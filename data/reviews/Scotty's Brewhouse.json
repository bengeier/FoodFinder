{"text":"They've only been open a few weeks so maybe they'll work out the kinks but it was probably the worst service I've experienced in C-U in a very long time. Were there on a Monday, for starters, so I'd definitely avoid later in the week/weekend. Started with staff fighting & complaining at the entrance & didn't get any better. Took 15 minutes to be acknowledged by wait staff, another 15 to get water, another 10 to get 1/2 our table's drinks, etc. Food was average bar food. The waitress took over a half hour to bring each person at our table our deprecate checks, one check at a time. Won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. I love the outdoor space and games for kids. I will go to a place that's kid friendly even if the food isn't great. We ordered nachos and they were pretty gross. Looked like a can of dog food and cheese wiz on some chips. Taste wasn't much better. And they weren't cheap.  
The fried pickles are good. We will probably be back to give it one more but I do hope this place puts more effort into the food!"}
{"text":"August 30, 2017 UPDATE:

Returned to Scotty's for a going away party tonight. Very pleased. Food service was fast, waitresses were prompt and attentive. Excellent atmosphere and clean. THIS was the Scotty's experience I originally hoped for. Would recommend! Credit to Scotty's for working out their early startup kinks. 



Tried Scotty's on Monday night at 6:30. Place was packed and we had a 30 min wait. No bigw deal. Found bar space and enjoyed some local beer on draft. Surprisingly, the bar staff couldn't make one of their mixed drinks because they ran out of Kaluah? We were seated at about 7:00 and our waitress took our order for food immediately. Appetizer came out in appropriate time. 

After about 50 minutes, the manager appeared and apologized that they were out of turkey for one of our wraps. A new order for food was then made. At about the 1 hour and 20 minute mark, our food arrived. Three of the plates were cold, and one of the dishes had obviously died under the hot lamp. Lettuce was wilted and the sauces were dried out and baked onto the food. Very disappointing. Our 4th party then waited another 10 minutes for her dish to come out, which was also cold. 

Management on scene was very apologetic, including our waitress. That's why this review gets more than 1 star. We were clearly not the only table upset by our experience, as the poor manager had no less than 5 other tables of complaints to field of varying degree. He ended up comping our drinks and we left without eating. 

Scotty's menu, atmosphere, and location have potential, but they need to figure out food service if they're going to have a regular following."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. Took nearly 30 minutes just to get drinks. Then another 20 minutes for our food (there were multiple empty tables). They brought out the wrong order twice before bringing us the correct order. Good sports bar atmosphere, huge menu, horrendous service.

To add to this:
They waived our entire bill and apologized several times. The food was decent. I would give it another chance."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, and great beer. The bartender Josh always provides excellent customer service. He is friendly, knowledgeable, on top of everything, and gives everyone a fantastic experience from the minute they sit down to the minute they leave."}
{"text":"After drinking 107 ounces of beer, this review was written. And no, the writer was not drunk.

Continue reading to learn how a Scotty's server broke her morals by serving more beer than she would \"morally\" ever serve. 

Why two stars, you ask? Two words: POOR SERVICE.

My friend and I enter at 3:00p. Hostess guides us to high top tables. We look at each other then at hostess and ask, \"Can we have a lower table, please?\" While looking at section with lower tables, hostess responds, \"All of those sections are closed.\" I look at my friend and say, \"You have a difficult time sitting at high top tables, right?\" Hostess reassures us that the low top tables aren't available. This is the first time the customers look at each other with an \"OKAY! SERIOUSLY?\" face. (10 minutes later, two new parties entered. Guess where they were seated? Correct...in the section that was \"closed\".

We are seated; looking through menus, school-girl gigging while reading the humorous names of entrees out loud. Employee #1 walks by within ear shot of us and says to Employee #2, \"Can you find them a server please?\" This is the second time we looked at each other with an \"OKAY! SERIOUSLY?\" face. There are \"sections\", right? So, there must be a server assigned to our section. Hmmmmm...interesting...and not a good interesting...

Server approaches table; asks for our beverage of choice. I stated my drink selection and server asks, \"What size? 8 oz.? 16? 25? 60 or 101 oz., but I won't serve the 101 oz. to you.\" I ask server why she won't serve 101 oz. \"Some servers will serve 101 oz. to a group and some will serve that amount to groups of 2, but morally I won't.\" This is the third time we looked at each other with an \"OKAY! SERIOUSLY?\" face. 

(By the end of the visit guess what we did? Between the two of us, we ordered and drank 107 oz. of beer just to prove a point. Hey server, just to let you know, you broke your morals. Yes, we did the math and you served more ounces of beer than you said you would \"morally\" serve to two people. #justsaying)

We were sitting for 5 minutes looking over our menus and server approached us 3 separate times asking if we were ready to order. After third time, server said, \"Well, why don't you just close your menus when you're ready to order so I don't keep bothering you by asking if you're ready to order?\" Hey server, guess what? You were serving two individuals that knew that \"trick of the trade\" because we've been part of your trade. Maybe you could have communicated that from the beginning. #communicationwillgetyouabettertip Fourth time we looked at each other with an \"OKAY! SERIOUSLY?\" face. 

Once food was delivered, we rated food, presentation of food, and timeliness of food delivered 3 1/2 stars.

Server provides us with our checks after we had almost finished 82 oz. of beer in total. Nope, we weren't done. Nope, she never asked us if we wanted more to drink. Fifth time we looked at each other with an \"OKAY! SERIOUSLY?\" face. 

After a few awkward, what she thought were sly, passes at our table, she finally stopped and said, \"Do you mind if I ring these up? I don't want to get in trouble from my boss for the tab not being correct in the morning.\" Hey server...just admit...your shift was ending and you needed to cash out; we all know you wanted your tip. #wearentstupid #communicationwillgetyouabettertip Sixth time we looked at each other with an \"OKAY! SERIOUSLY?\" face. 

Why two stars, you ask? Two words: POOR SERVICE."}
{"text":"Big fans of Scotty's in Lafayette, Indiana and looked forward to this new location. We were not disappointed. The food was terrific and the staff was well trained and super friendly. Welcome to Champaign Scotty's"}
{"text":"I recommend requesting ferita to be your server. She was great, even though our order got put behind for a while, im sure its because they are still new. they probably give her a lot tables because of her great personality and so awesome.i would want her to waitress all tables. So thank you. The anto resolution burger was pretty good , bacon brussel sprouts were a little dry though could have used some more dressing or something. Over all it was good. Tvs were a little to loud though."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. We checked out the menu prior to coming and it looked like it had everything a restaurant could possibly offer and the parking lot has looked packed since it opened. We came on Saturday night and the line was out the door with an hour wait, not surprising given the time we came and the sports games that were on, so we came back late Sunday afternoon. We were promptly seated by a very cheery and enthusiastic host. The decor was personalized for Champaign and they brought in beers from local breweries which was awesome. Unfortunately, after being seated, we didn't have a server for close to 20 minutes even though multiple servers looked at us and didn't greet us. Finally, a server informed us we were just added to her tables. We got the vibe that she just wanted us to leave the entire time, which made us feel uncomfortable the entire time. The food was pretty good - the dill pickles were amazing. We got our check mid meal. Unfortunately we planned on using the app to pay and that didn't work, so we spent another 20 minutes waiting to pay via our server before we were finally able to flag down a host and ask him to send her to us. Another server came and asked us what we needed and told us our server left. A couple minutes later a manager came by to help us. Somehow our tab was closed out because the app processed our payment without confirming it to us. The manager tried to remedy the situation by giving us a couple $5 off comp. coupons for another visit and apologizing for the entire payment situation, which we appreciated. The entire experience for trying to pay probably took about 30 minutes. Maybe it was just us, maybe it was a weird day, but given that it wasn't very busy we expected better....we probably won't return...at least not for a while."}
{"text":"Came in Saturday had a great experience. It was busy so there was a short wait for a table so we found a spot at the bar to have a drink. Awesome selection of beers on tap and many local breweries like Riggs and JT Walkers. All beer prices are in line with places like Hooters and BWW, but they have better selection and the bar is huge. Their menu is very large and diverse and every plate we saw leaving the kitchen looked awesome. We had the nachos and split the BBQ pork & mac'n'cheese sandwich and it was amazing. Staff was great and it was nice to meet the GM who made it to every table to personally introduce himself and check on how everything was. We will definitely be back. I'm glad we found a replacement for BWW. Scotty's service, food, selection, and staff are leaps and bounds ahead of BWW!"}
{"text":"ate dinner here on a weekday. the fish tacos i ordered was very good! customer service was excellent , and the place was clean. and since our appetizer came late, it was \"on the house\"! I would recommend to anyone to try this place out. I'll definitely comeback here again."}
{"text":"Scotty's is decent. Great atmosphere and set up. The food is hit or miss. It seems like they are still trying to get their act together. It took us two and a half hours to get out of here for dinner a few weeks ago. They messed up a few of our orders. They were kind enough to fix their mistakes, but it took another 30 min for the corrected food to come out. Once they get it together, this place will be great and a definite spot for outside eating and drinks in the summer"}
{"text":"Food here is great. But I was told there was a way to \"call ahead\" and be out on a wait list, but not exactly a \"reservation\" I tried to call to do it and I was told you could only make reservations for 12+ people, so I was deceived and came to find out when I arrived that they continued to add people through the \"call ahead\" in front of us. So whoever I spoke to on the phone was not exactly honest with me, not sure why. But still worth the 1 hour + wait because he food is awesome. The link to get added to the call list btw is Scottysbrewhouse.com/waitlist. They don't exactly advertise it apparently..."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Scotty's today for lunch. The place was packed but we grabbed two seats at the bar. We were immediately greeted by one of the bartenders, Jessica, and given menus and waters.

The menu is huge but organized well. We started with two craft brews --- Revolution's Jukebox Hero and Triptych's Because Christmas. There's a flight option which is a great way to try many local offerings.

I ordered one of the \"snacksty's\" to start. These are mini appetizers. The bacon ranch tots were tasty -- enjoyed the chopped bacon on top. Great portion size for $2.99!

I ordered the boneless wing lunch. $8.49 gets you wings, seasoned chips and a soft drink. This is a significant discount from the regular priced menu. The breading on the wings was great and reminded me a bit of the texture of Chik-Fil-A bites. The garlic teriyaki sauce was great.

My husband enjoyed the Lucy II burger. He upgraded to farm-raised meat for $1 more. You can also change any burger to bison or turkey. 

Love the food, service, and decor (Triptych growlers as centerpiece). We'll be back."}
{"text":"It was okay, I thought service was mediocre and had an attitude. Burgers were kind of dry, and I did not think they were that special. Would rather just go to Meatheads and make my own personalized burger. A good place to go if you just want to sit down, watch sports, and socialize with friends though."}
{"text":"I am REALLY trying to like this place, but they're making it very difficult. I like the location in Champaign, and gives a change of pace from BW3. Visit 1: My order was missing 1/2 of the items ordered, and my friend's order was completely wrong. It took us nearly 30 minutes to have our order corrected, and later had to speak with a manager to get it fixed. Visit 2: No issues. The pizza we ordered was pretty basic, but the service and food quality was acceptable. 
Visit 3: Order a couple burgers to go.  The girl at the front (Ana?) seemed new, but was extremely friendly.  She took down my order perfectly, and recapped the order accurately. It took them a little longer to get the order ready, and she gave me updates & offered water while I waited. (I really thought that things had turned around for SB). A gentleman brought out my order, and we were off.  Arrived home to find that neither order had any toppings, and every specific request listed on my receipt was ignored. (I pulled it from the bag to double check to see how this occurred).

I will likely return... eventually, but now I will have to be \"that guy\" when explaining and checking my order. Smh..."}
{"text":"I really like this place, good food and atmosphere.  The macho nachos are amazing!  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because every time I grubhub from them and order a sandwich/burger they always forget the freaking toppings!!!  It's like they just never finish it and is super disappointing!"}
{"text":"I loved this place when it opened. The menu was big and had interesting items. The last 2 times I've been there the menu has shrunk, and so noticeably has the crowds. The service is subpar. I don't know if I'll ever go back since the menu shrunk and gone are my favorites (Caesar wrap was best in town). There are plenty better places to go. They also got rid of some of their specials (snakstys) and I'm predicting the business will fail unless they right the ship. They need to up the anti with promos, better wing night, and an improved menu. It was so great, now it's not."}
{"text":"I have never been to the actual restaurant but I have ordered up from OrderUp a few times now and I have been very impressed each time. Their food isn't unreasonably priced which is nice for a broke college student. The have a classic wedge salad that I get every time because it is always so perfectly filling. I also get their slider so I can spoil myself a little but not feel bad about myself. Each time I order for delivery it always comes in a reasonable amount of time and the order is always correct. I will continue to order from them because I always end the meal satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing wings.. terrible service. Wasn't asked once for a drink refill or even treated like a priority. Will continue to patronize this establishment but only for carry out."}
{"text":"Food today was marginal. Came for a burger. Asked for medium rare; staff said we can only offer temps on the larger burgers. Me: What's the difference between small and large? Staff: 5 v. 7 ounces. Me: So you can temp a seven ounce patty but not a five ounce patty? Odd! Ordered Chicken Caesar--Just ok., (it gets feta--really odd). Tomato basil soup--served lukewarm. Chili--came almost cold. Oddly the crackers that accompanied the soups were warmer than the soup. Our table was drafty/really cold and OMG, the music was so loud we had to practically yell at each other. What's up with no hand towels in the men's room or waste can?"}
{"text":"Update 1/13- came in tonight at 6:15 busy football night, sat down at bar and was impressed on how fast we were greeted and served with beer! 

Food is pretty good! Games are always on, vibe is always on point however the bartenders. I've been there over a hand full of times and always the down fall are the bartenders. We've had to wait some time for a table and found seats at the bar. It took literally 12 minutes before we were noticed and that was after I'm assuming a waiter/manager pointed us out. We were literally sitting in the center of the bar. Next time was at lunch. Got a table right alway and ordered a beer. Our ticket just sat there! There was no one at the bar! Finally our waiter  who was waiting on our beers walked away and got our food. Then the poor waiter went back to wait on our beers some more! Than this happened again while we met some friends at the bar. 3 bartenders and still couldn't get noticed sitting at the bar. For a great time maybe you shouldn't order a drink at Scotty's."}
{"text":"Brutal.  Came here when they opened and they were all about service.  Came in tonight at 10:30 on a Sunday night and the bartender was a jag. There were three people at the bar and he spent the entire time ignoring all three of us and cleaning pitchers and clearly prepping to close. Finally I got up and walked to the other side and hollered \"hey can I get a beer\". When he brought me the beer, I asked him why, as a bartender, he doesn't glance over at the patrons at least every five minutes and he said, \"because we are closing soon.\"  So this place gets the award of \"JUST ANOTHER BAR\".  Bummer.  My first experience was so freaking good here, management has gotten comfortable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food, but DAMN it's expensive.  I've been here a couple of times and the food and beer selection never disappoints.  However, when you get your bill you have to do a double take to make sure you're not imagining things.  $9 for a 25oz beer??  You can get the same at Bdubs for about $5.  I think the food and the atmosphere is better at Scotty's, but it's really not worth the extra $$.  Don't get me wrong...you'll like it, but just be prepared to pay the extra."}
{"text":"Ok. Not worth the expense when we have so many other bar-grub places that are much better.  Super grease-ball."}
{"text":"Have been there five times food is great, service has just gotten worse. Even after the last attempt at talking to the manager without making a scene, or asking for anything free, they just can't seem to get it right. If service doesn't improve they aren't going to make it with the way things are currently being ran. Bartenders don't pay attention to patrons at the bar and seem more interested in putting away glasses than earning a tip. Won't be back. Five strikes too many and you're out!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food but sounds like the service at the bar is the way to go as the two of us had an overly long wait with half dozen empty tables. The tilapia was good and my wife had chicken nachos which were light on the toppings and heavy on the chips. VERY LOUD!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to be done with this place after many bad trips. The first visit was great, all thus after were horrible. Trip 1 ordered a Ragin Cajun bison burger that was fantastic (where else in CU can you get bison?!). That and the great beer selection made me want to come back. Trips 2-4 consistently had bad food: ribeye steak sandwich was tough and fatty, chicken wrap was mostly lettuce (I ordered no lettuce), Backyard BBQ bison burger was absolutely doused in barbecue sauce. 

The fourth and final trip was also paired with terrible service. Waited over 45 minutes for our burgers. The bartender would wait on us, then forget to fulfill what we needed until we reminded him again later. The only reparation he offered was at the end of the night for a free round of drinks. However, we were done and weren't ordering more. His excuse was \"the manager wouldn't allow him to remove the drinks we already had off our bill\". 

Bad food and bad service with no amends from the manager is no way to do business. The beer selection (usually has 2+ handles of local Riggs on) is the only redeeming quality of this place. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Made myself try the food twice to see if it was really that bad. Food is very sub par, I'd save myself the money and go down the street to Billy Barooz where they charge the same price for food and it actually tastes good. I've tried the tacos, burgers, nachos, salad, cookie skillet... none of it was good. My most recent purchase was the mini nachos (nachos are your basic boring nacho you can make at home) and montys Frisco melt. I'm convinced they dunked the bread in butter and rubbed the patty and fries in salt. It was hard to eat, I had to take the bread off. Steak 'n Shake doesn't even butter their food that much. Probably would have been fine with 1/100th of the butter and salt. Don't think I'll be eating their food again."}
{"text":"This place was a real let down. From the hostess to the waiter they were clueless. Obviously undertrained. The menu was large, too large to do a good job on all. Our food was cold and terrible. I complained and the manager came over to ask how they could make it better. Warm and some kind of sauce would have been a lot better. The nachos were unbelievable! The worst ever and nothing like nachos! We will never be back!'!!! Worst food and service ever!"}
{"text":"Ate there twice with family since the opening.  My daughters liked the burgers but they think that Steak and Shake is gourmet.  
First visit:  I had a burger--Ok taste but dry.  The side order of beans and rice was weak--no flavor.  My wife had the chicken sandwich which was pitiful--we should have photographed it because it looked like a sandwich you might buy at a Circle K.  her fries were cold;  she requested replacement fries, and these were cold.  Sidenote---why don't these \"pubs\" that are trying to serve tasty food actually use fresh cut fries--a huge difference in quality.
Second time we shared appetizer Manimal fries--good taste but very small (about half the size of the photo on their menu).   We shared the Macho Nachos--absolutely tasteless.  I truely believe my 8 y/o nephew could make better tasting nachos. 
Count me as underwhelmed.  There are better casual restaurants in Champaign. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"We ended up here because my fiance had eaten at the one in Indianapolis and loved it. He kept raving about their burgers that you can put peanut butter on. Peanut butter?? 

So...we get seated quickly. There are televisions everywhere with different channels on so people have a variety of things they can watch. There is an extensive menu. We order the Totachos as an appetizer. Think nachos, but with tater tots. It was good and perfect for sharing with just two people. It takes me a few minutes to decide. He decided on the Shewman's Special which has peanut butter, jalapeños, cheddar cheese, and bacon. He also orders the Thr3e Wise Men seasoned potato chips. I decide on the Shewman's Special, but took the jalapeños off and substituted the ghost chili pepper jack for the cheddar. I wanted to keep the heat in the sandwich, but wasn't feeling jalapeños on the burger. My side was the brussel sprouts with bacon. 

I was skeptical of the peanut butter that my fiance was so excited about, but I also like to try new foods or concepts. 

We get our food. He digs right in and is in heaven. I on the other hand, take a bite of my side dish of brussel sprouts and bacon and then season it with a little salt and pepper. I don't mind seasoning a dish just a little after taste testing it. Then, I finally decide to try this burger. I take a nice bite to get all the flavors in. It has peanut butter oozing from it and it actually works! The flavors meld together well and the peanut butter makes it a very rich burger. It's not my favorite burger ever, but I would definitely eat it again."}
{"text":"Ok, so tried top stop here last night for dinner (3/28), and there was a wait time of over an hour for a table, which isn't a problem, so my party and I figured we would grab a seat at the bar while we waited for our table....no go there either, bar was packed.  Now, this isn't a bad thing, we left and got a bite somewhere else.  But I began to think, if this place is that packed on a Tuesday night, it must be really good.

So we went back today (3/29) for lunch.  Place was again busy, but we were able to get a table within 10 minutes.  The design and atmosphere of this place is amazing.  The staff was friendly, including our server and the hostess.  The menu has a wide array of items, and a huge list of burgers.  So, I ordered a burger w/ cheese, bacon and a fried egg.  The burger was ordered medium rare but came out well done, and the egg was overdone.  I let the server know and she offered to replace it, but I kept it, just mentioning to say something to the kitchen, since it was no biggie.  

So overall, I would rate this place 5 stars on the staff, and 5 stars on the atmosphere (very cool design inside), however, on the food from my experience (burger and apps), I would give it two stars, so I'm going to rate it 3 across the board.

Next time I visit Champaign, I will definitely try here again, and hopefully bump my review to 4 or 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The place had very little business when we got there yet they seated us in a side room which I just don't get. My wife ordered a frisco melt which she said was okay my burger was incredibly dry. A burger place should have great burgers. Our waiter was fantastic and did and outstanding job the star are for him."}
{"text":"We had a gift card we wanted use and had not been here before. I was hesitant after reading many negative reviews here, but our visit was anything but negative. We went on Saturday about 8pm and it was about 80% full. We were seated right away and our waitress Janessa arrived after about 2 minutes, took drink orders after some recommendations and food order a few minutes later. We got our food in maybe 15 minutes tops. We both really liked the food, my burger was very good and the menu isn't huge but has plenty to choose from and the beer list was pretty extensive. My wife is pretty critical of restaurants having waited tables for many restaurants in the past but she really liked it also. Janessa wasn't hovering our table but was always there when needed. We will definitely go back for another visit."}
{"text":"Short wait (10min) for how busy they were. Lots of new people in here still learning. Some minor confusion on our seats. They text you when your table is ready. Food came out in about 15 minutes. Wings are big and juicy but the sauces mild, garlic teriyaki, pinapple Caribbean jerk, and Wang Chung (Asian ginger) were nothing to write home about. It felt like they were trying to reinvent the wheel with the sauces. Wife built her own burger. Avacados pretzel bun. She was happy. She is generally easy to please. Awesome beer selection but we weren't drinking tonight. Service was good, managers checked on us."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I really did.  But after two visits I have to give up and move on.  The estimated wait both times has been 25-30 minutes and the actual wait was closer to 45 minutes.  The service is VERY slow.  You maybe see your servers 4 times the whole time you are there.  So good luck getting extra ketchup if you need it!  Maybe I just got bad luck in both cases, but neither of my servers had any knowledge of their beer menu.  The first time the food was \"ok\" at best.  The second trip I ordered their  \"feature\" burger who the server said was Their best burger.  Something with brew bacon jam and an egg.  It sounded good.  It was not.  I ordered it medium rare.  The burger they brought me was well done and it was covered with completely burnt charcoal blackened hard pieces of what I assumed to be bacon.  As soon as she brought it to the table it made the whole table stink of fried grease.  It was awful.  It was like eating charcoal.  Because someone else brought it and I never saw the server and had been in the restaurant for over and hour at this point without food I went ahead and choked it down after scraping the charcoal pieces off the top of it.  When she finally came to ask about it I politely said it tasted like burnt grease and showed her the black crispy  pieces and told her to smell it and explained that awful smell is how it tasted.  A manager came to the table and asked about it and I explained the same thing to him.  He said he would go look into it.  Well my family was done eating and at this point we had been there for 2 hours.  I explained that I didn't complain for a discount but rather for a hopeful improvement.  The manager never returned, never offered any explanation for the awful food, and provided no discount on the bill.  Before leaving, we used the restroom; left our coats on the table, our leftovers on the table and a half of a beer that I paid $8 for that I hoped to finish.  When we returned my kids' leftover pizza box was gone, my beer was gone and the table was cleared.  So we had to be patient with their slow service the entire lunch, but then they rushed us out the door!  The same manager who was going to \"look into my burnt awful burger\" walked by so I asked him what happened.  He said we assumed you left.  I pointed at the table and said \"with my phone and car keys on the table, and our coats on the chairs?\".  The whole concept and theory is something I was really excited about.  Being a farmer and hearing about their Indiana farm raised beef I really wanted this place to work for me.  After two VERY slow visits, poor service, terrible food, I wont be going back and have to suggest you skip the pain and don't go.  This place will not last long."}
{"text":"I had eaten at Scotty's in Indianapolis and knew it to be really good. When I saw that one was now close to me I had to come back.

I've spent the last few weeks on my day off exploring the menu and various offerings. The food is amazing. 

This is the only place I will ever eat Brussels sprouts!

The staff is all friendly and it's very obvious that they love their jobs. This is quickly becoming a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Scotty's a couple weeks ago on a Friday night. It was packed, but that's not surprising for a new business on a busy night. We waited about 30 minutes which wasn't a big deal. 

Once seat we were given an enormous menu offering anything that you would care to eat. It took a while to look over everything, but I'm definitely complaining with everything they had to offer. They also had an extensive drink menu full of house cocktails and a lot of draft beers which featured a lot of local breweries. 

I went with a burger and the girlfriend went with a chicken sandwich. Despite how busy it was, we got our food quite quickly. Once we got our food we were both pleasantly surprised with how good it was.

Service was excellent through and through. Our server was more than happy to offer suggestions and answer any questions that we had about the menu. When it came time to pay we were able to use their app to pay which was pretty cool. 

Overall, we were happy with our experience. With the variety of food and drinks they offer it gives us no choice but to go back."}
{"text":"It was a good pub. Nothing that stands out as superb. Not in the league of a Miller's Ale House but definitely somewhere I'd go if I were in town and wanted to watch a game. Service was adequate and I thought the spicy steak sandwich was really good but chicken rice soup awful. Take it off the menu!. This is just a simple review...it did its job."}
{"text":"I've been here now 5 or 6 times, mostly because I keep hoping the food will get better. I'm a local and I was really excited about this place. The servers and staff are really nice. I've never hard to wait long. But the food, oh it's terrible. I think they may have hired someone who never worked as a chef before. The burgers are a disaster. The sandwiches taste awful. The soups are over salty and terribly put together (except the lobster bisque). I will keep going back every few months, hoping they hire a much better chef."}
{"text":"2 me time here. It was ok. Nothing really special. If you're a coffee drinker don't go here. It's not a bottomless cup!  They use a kurig and charge $2.50 a cup!  They don't tell you that till after you've had 3 cups and you see it on your bill. 
Nice bathrooms and plenty of TV's."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection, phenomenal wings, 61 TVs, unbelievably friendly and customer-friendly wait-staff (hat tip to Matt L). Possibly, the best spot in C-U."}
{"text":"There is a wide selection of delicious food, but due to how many people visit, and partially because of fairly poor management, it always takes a long time to eat there. I once spent around 2-3 hours there with my family on a regular lunch on a weekend because they were so busy and the staff could have been better prepared. The staff is nice though, just make sure you have a lot of time to spare if you eat here"}
{"text":"Good meal while on a road trip.  I'm not from here and found some interesting beer selections I was unfamiliar with. Food came out hot and fresh. If you like your burger with pink be sure to tell them that, otherwise it will come out medium to medium well."}
{"text":"A another great option for dining in CU. A very inventive rotate menu of specials. I loved the Christmas Season choices. I highly recommend the fried pickles. A long wait though, buys its new and to be expected. Friendly wait staff. I love that you could pay with the app. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stayed at Home2 Suites and Scotty's was super close on a stormy night.  Standard pub food.  Nachos were loaded and tasty, wife's taco salad was just okay.  The taco meat was served cold rather than hot which seemed a bit odd.  It's a sports bar but the televisions were on full blast despite just a handful of people being there.  Okay in a pinch, decent but nothing special.

{"text":"Love the decor. Hostess was very nice. Waitress was great. So many menu items to choose from. I went with the queso and chips and the chicken chopped salad. Both were very good. The queso dip had a really good flavor. My salad was yummy. 
Everything being served around us looked really good. Even found a beer that I liked. Definitely will go back and try some more goodies."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, but it just fell short of my expectations. The hostess and server were great, but the food was not. I ordered the hot ham and bacon jam sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. 

While the Mac and cheese looked creamy, it was actually completely dry and flavorless. The sandwich was all bread with three pieces of what looked like lunch-meat ham and the bacon jam- which tasted like burnt bacon smothered in a sauce. No, thank you. 

It does look like they have fun drinks listed for Valentine's Day, so I may be back to try those, but am definitely over the food."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on A Saturday and if that would have been the first time I tried it I wouldn't have gone back.
Every time I have been there there has been a short wait which is fine. The issue is that there are so many staff members at the hostess area, six last time, and not ONE of them can tear their eyes away from the computer screen to say, \"Hi\" or \"someone will be right with you\" when you walk in. This place was nice when it was brand new and clean and now it has joined the ranks of the majority of CU restaurants in the Sticky Table Club. The menu and salt and pepper shakers were filthy.
The food is pretty good but inconsistent. The service is inconsistent as well. I had a fabulous waitress twice and a really distracted waiter the last time. Not sure when I will go there again...maybe take out next time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for watching a sporting event.  Lots of TV's.  Very big food menu and lots of different beers on tap.  I had the Shewman Burger.  It had peanut butter and jalapenos on it.  Believe it or not, the peanut butter accented the sandwich quite well."}
{"text":"That Fire Burger really lit up my nostrils & mouth, and I'm a Delhiite (the part of India that doesn't hold back on spice & chili). READ: I loved it but still wish I could've tasted the flavors more. Their Mo' Fo' Chicken Gumbo was the best! You taste the cumin, and the cajun, and the pepper, and the chicken, and the okra, and the mushrooms... solid fries and lobster bisque too. But they gotta get their act together on serving big groups- wet cutlery, absent napkins, 20 minutes to get water."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Poor beer selection, awful wings, over priced flights,  I don't understand why is so popular.  I won't go back.  Not advised"}
{"text":"Still working out the kinks since it just opened, but the food was good! Loaded tater tots...AWESOME! Had the Piggy Mac grilled cheese. It was good. Different. But good! Going to be a nice place. Just hope they keep the quality of food up to par!"}
{"text":"Tip: press 2, then press 1 to place a carry-out order. They upgraded the size of the dressing cups for to-go orders, but if you have to be on hold for any length of time with their automated phone system, be prepared for deafening hard rock muzak. 

For dining in, it's too loud for my taste (loads of TVs, loud music) but it's a great atmosphere for a lively dining experience, if that's what you're into. Booking the private room is difficult, as more likely than not, you won't reach the person who deals with the schedule. 

Service has been inconsistent, which is why I haven't rated it higher. The menu has improved since opening, and they're not trying to specialize in literally everything."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this location. Tonight's selection was the Bar-b-q ranch chicken salad with a cup of chili .  The chili was spicy and flavorful but could have been served a little warmer. The salad was well prepare and exactly as expected. My only comments would be to cut down on the proportion of chopped red onion and the overall amount of dressing served on the salad.

The problem, of course was service. I would have appreciated having the chili served before the salad  instead of with it - a minor point. However there was a long wait to get the server's attention for the check and then again to provide payment.  This feel I might have deducted too severely from the tip but it seemed appropriate at the top me."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. The beer was delicious and cold. Decent variety of beers as well. I ordered a frisco burger with a waffle fries and a side salad of mixed greens. The salad was beyond great. Large portion and seemed to have really fresh greens. The burger was pretty tasty. The only downfall was the waffle fries. They just weren't crisp at all. Maybe they were baked as opposed to fried. Which isn't a bad thing. Just not what I was hoping for in a fry. Other than the fries, it was a really good experience."}
{"text":"We were frequent visitors to the Scotty's in West Lafayette and Indy and they never disappoint. We were pumped to see one coming to Champaign! We've been three times, and are yet to have a smooth experience. Long wait times for drinks (25 minutes was the longest), wrong drinks delivered to table, errors in the bill, and long wait times to pay. We went for lunch once and it literally took two hours. Someone's food still had the plastic wrap on it.....yikes. I really hope this location can get the kinks worked out!"}
{"text":"Currently here on opening night. So far so good! Great servers, amazing menu & awesome drinks. 

7 meals. 7 happy diners! 

It was all delicious. Loved the variety on the menu."}
{"text":"We used this venue for a networking social, and it worked great! Mike was our server and was super nice. They put us in a semi-private room with high tops, so it was great for moving around and chatting. They have great drink specials from 4-6, and their general prices aren't bad either. Our group had basically everything on the menu, and everyone was pleased with their dish. I'll use this venue again in the future!"}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening tonight. The loaded waffle fries were amazing. Local craft brew is also on their menu. Excellent service from Liz. Family friendly with great kid menu. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Day 2 of March Madness was a good time a Scotty's. We had a clear view of 4 TV's all playing different NCAA games, which is exactly what we were hoping for. Our waitress was attentive and friendly too. 

My buddy got wings and he was pleased with the outer crispiness and inner tenderness. He did order 3 sauces and instead got 2 because evidently they couldn't accommodate for 3, so they randomly picked his 2 sauces without clarifying - kinda weird. 

I got the nachos and they were plentiful, so expect more than you can eat. The salt was dispersed very disproportionately between the tortilla chips so that was a negative. The beer selections were decent and they do have a flight option, which is nice. Also got the chili and it was fine, nothing special. 

Great place if you want to watch several games at once, otherwise a decent sports bar without a major niche."}
{"text":"Decent alternative to places like BWW and Destihl, especially for us \"southsiders\" who don't always like to drive to Downtown. Went with our two kids and couldn't have felt more welcome despite the potential tantrum tornado we carried. Multiple staff members engaged our three year old, and they provided carrots with ranch before we even settled into our booth. Kids menu is a good size, healthy side dish options, and a toy at the end. There are high chairs and car seat slings available.

Food was better than I expected. Ended up getting the burger of the month which was some pun on Rudolph and consisted of an elk burger with applewood smoked bacon and a brussel sprout slaw, with a cherry tomato stuck in with a toothpick. I'm a sucker for a good reindeer joke. Fries were well seasoned too.

Rewards program is nice. Only complaint is that at some point one of the staff must have really liked the music because the volume shot up, came back down, but never quite settled to a comfortable dining volume. Lots (I mean lots) of tvs as well."}
{"text":"We all enjoyed this restaurant!  We are 60 -80 years (4 of us) ,so the atmosphere is a little young for us, but all our food was delicious,  and the service good.  Especially welcome was the lower calorie menu, which was also inventive and tasty!  Loved the chunky tomato basil soup!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's new and exciting with a lot of delicious food choices and a lot of good brews. I've been here a couple times already and I absolutely love it over BWW or Hooters. Food is amazing and staff is nice and knowledgeable. I really appreciate that they carry local brews like Riggs. Plus 75 cent wings on Sundays and Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Solid burger! We were traveling through Champagne IL with our dog and wanted out door seating. It had just rained but the staff was very helpful and let us sit outside despite the wet tables and chairs. Great beer selection also! I had the Red, White and Blue burger, messy but tasty. My husband had the burger of the month, which was a Cubano Burger, VERY GOOD!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time eating here, yummy food. Found my new favorite drink. Our waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"Not a very good place in my opinion. The place was nice and I love sitting at the picnic tables but the service is slow and the food isn't fresh or good. We ordered onion rings which were extremely over cooked, my fajita melt was soggy, my husband buffalo chicken wrap was mostly lettuce. The building however is very nice. I might give it another try but I'll order something different."}
{"text":"2nd time there and service and organization is still a major problem from waitresses to the management.  Some tables are open, but they don't have enough servers for them.  Cleaning off tables is slow.  Drink orders were taken for part of table, but no the other.  Delivering drinks to the right people was a problem, over and over.  Was given our checks and not even asked if we were done and would like anything else.  Food was just ok...."}
{"text":"Ambiance is cool (we especially liked the basketball court wall), servers were friendly, and food came out quickly. The food was good, but nothing hugely spectacular considering that lunch for 2 came out to $31 and change. That's outrageous. I can get a better turkey club at Guido's and spend less money while patronizing a local joint."}
{"text":"Food is quite good.  Service is bad.  Took 30 plus minutes to pay bill as waiter fell off planet earth.  Service was bad from the start.  Drinks from the bar came very slow, and refills and future orders were hard to place.  Atmosphere is ok, a little loud and visually noisy.  Won't be a destination spot for us.  Wouldn't recommend for a date night or a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Get the BOTM for June 2017. It's a Hawaiian burger. Not normally my thing but this is top 3 in terms of best all time burgers for me.  It had a sweeter BBQ sauce with a pineapple ring, 3 slices of avocado. This is not on the menu all the time. If I lived in Champaign county, I would live here for the month of June."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? It's amazing! We had an amazing experience here. The food and atmosphere are incredible. It's a little on the loud side, but that's the nature of the beast, so, be prepared and don't complain about it. 
I got the spicy luau wrap with the dirty rice and beans and the jerk waffle fries as a side. Hands down, the best wrap I've ever had in my life. It's a wrap that has grilled chicken, pineapple, rice, Jack cheese and grilled peppers and onions. It also has this amazing sweet and spicy sauce as well. Starts out sweet but the heat builds. It's not overly spicy, but it's packed with flavor. I absolutely loved it. The waffle fries are awesome. They're cooked perfectly and evenly. With the jerk seasoning, they went well with my meal. So good. Overall, everything was really good. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best new places to come to the C-U area. This is always our choice place to go when we're in this part of town. The food has been great every single time and service is great!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last night, our server was very busy, to the point you could hear her say, \"I am panicking\"  to another server as she is running around her section. She clearly had too many tables. The manager wandered around, seemingly unaware one of her servers was bogged down. We ordered the chicken tenders which were great until my daughter bit into bone. When I informed the waitress I asked if they were made in house, to which she said yes, I suggested she tell the cook so they can make sure they are being more careful, she advised a manager would come by. In my experience of being a restaurant manager, biting into bone is a serious problem. The manager, who was pregnant and constantly stroked her belly as she was talking to us, immediately started the conversation about how they do not make the tenders in house and that that should somehow suffice my questions, without asking if my daughters teeth are ok, didn't remove the item from the bill, offered no business card if my daughter had any issues and simply said sorry and walked away as if it is not their responsibility for bones being found in boneless items that their restaurant serves. The food took an hour and 40 minutes, we only ordered Chicken tenders as an appetizer, a wrap, tacos and a kids grilled cheese. We also ordered a Burger to go, the burger was completely rare, if I missed something in the menu saying they are all rare that is my fault, but I also think that is something they could mention upon ordering. For waiting 20 minutes from the order to have a rare burger is pretty ridiculous though. We will never go back, the management clearly did not have a handle on the restaurant that night and made a horrible first impression. The food was mediocre at best and not worth the money we spent. Wendy's probably would have done a much better job."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with my son for Mom's weekend. The wings are great, the ribs fell right off the bone, our waiter Clay was excellent with his recommendations and service. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and menu, adds a little hometown feel throughout the restaurant. We try and go at least a couple times a month!!"}
{"text":"All of our party's silverware was dirty, including the plates as well. We had high hopes for this restaurant, however, my whole party and I left dissatisfied and wishing we had gone somewhere else. Stars for the ambiance of the place and the well-trained employees, but the food itself was just plain disappointing. The food was overpriced for what it was and took quite a while to get out of the kitchen as well. Overall, I would probably not come here again for dinner, but maybe for drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant but I wouldn't stray too far from the burgers as most of the other items we've tried have been subpar. Kitchen is a little slow but it's a new restaurant so I don't blame them. Great place to watch a game!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in, we were going to sit at the bar like we usually do places but it was full. I'm actually glad it was because I received probably the best service I have had in this town for a very very long long time. I don't write these ever, but shout out to you Ferita! Thank you for being up beat, informative, wonderfully pleasant l, etc. Happy rest of the week, we will be back on Sunday for brunch/football... hope to see you!"}
{"text":"Our last visit wasn't impressive. The menu seemed smaller so struggled with what to order. We ended up with a small plate of nachos and pizza. The nachos were ok but the pizza crust was soggy. We were disappointed because we loved this place when it first opened. We will probably go back and give it another try so hoping it will be better."}
{"text":"Where to start....We were told it would be a 15 minute wait, only to be seated within 3 minutes, this is not the problem, just thought it was odd to be told 15 and seated in less than 3 and the dining room was not full.  On to what really matters.  We were visiting friends and they took us here.  We were excited to try the different burgers.  Very nice waitress but that's where it ends.  We watched as food to tables seated after us came out and our waitress telling us our food will be out soon.  When the food finally arrived, the sides were cold and you could tell the kitchen messed up.  We finally flagged our waitress down and let her know, she said she would let the manager know....so we continued to eat our burger, which was just okay, nothing really exciting.  We asked our waitress again about the sides...finally after 20 minutes here comes the manager with new sides??? What??? Uhhh were are finished eating our hamburger and ready to go.  It was just kind of weird to bring out sides 20 minutes later and never came to the table.  I would suggest they hire people who have maybe been in the food service industry and then maybe they will have a chance."}
{"text":"Service was very good here! Janessa took very good care of us! The problem we had was a bit confusing. My girlfriend got the chicken strips which say it comes with coleslaw and waffle fries. When we realized it came with neither it was too late. Not only the fact that the strips are extremely tiny for 9.99. When I went to ask about it the server told us there is a lunch menu, that she couldn't even find at first in the menu. The lunch menu is in the very very back of the menu. Last back page. It's Same price just doesn't come with fries or slaw. So for the same price you really just get ripped off at lunch time. She wanted a mac and cheese, so the server should have switched to the non lunch portion to save money, and upgraded the side option. The non lunch portion you can add a side for 1.49, instead of the additional 3.00 we got charged. Clearly something Scotty's needs to review and or train their servers how to ask the right questions on such orders."}
{"text":"The newest chain to open on South Neil St.  This beer and sports bar chain started in Indiana, mainly in Indianapolis, and in several other college towns like Bloomington and West Lafayette.  I believe this is one of the first outside the Hoosier state.

This is a large restaurant, with several dinning rooms, a large bar and TV's in every corner.  It has that generic, slightly sterile feel, while at the same time very bright , clean, and comfortable.  Right now it is crowded from the moment the doors open.  I was able to get a seat at the bar.

There is a ridiculously large menu.  Salads, burgers, tacos, pizzas, wraps, nachos, and on and on.  About a 15 page menu.  All in that over portioned man food/pub grub vein.  I ended up with the \"burnt ends\" burger.  Pork bunt ends on top of a 1/2 pound patty.  I could not get a really good answer to what the \"pork burnt ends\" were.  It ended up being over cooked pork belly.  Burger came out well done, when I order medium.  Fries are OK.  Food quality seems like a slight step above TGI Fridays, or BWW.

A really nice beer list.  About 30 taps, ranging from locals in the Champaign/Urbana area like Blind Pig, TJ Walkers (from Mahomet), the new Riggs from Urbana, and Tryptich just up the road, as well as several from Chicago.  A handful of macros as well as a full bar. So a little something for everybody.  I think they have the largest tap selection in the area.

I would definitely hit this spot up over the many other chains in the area when watching the Illini play.  Though that is not saying a lot.  Good beer selection, generic vibe, with a large safe and by the books food menu."}
{"text":"Tough call between a two and a three star, because I was think they're trying. Beer selection is nice with reasonable prices. The architect of the place deserves much  more than two stars because it looks nice, is comfortable, and acoustics/sound levels are good. Service wasn't good. No one really checks in or is on top of anything. Everyone is moving around but not attentive.  Similar grousing at the bar. I can't imagine if it was really busy. Server drops food off and doesn't say a word. Empty beer glass, no silverware etc. Seemed like everyone's first day. Not rude, just not personable. Going through the motions. (It's really clean, so they're doing something). 
The food really sucked. The graphic designer guy gets two thumbs up for making microwaved wraps, chicken breasts, macaroni and cheese (they try to put it on everything) look appealing, but it's bland and bad. I'm imagining the kitchen is a line of microwaves based on the four guys in chef coats laying on the ground outside the back door. 
In conclusion, if nothing on this menu cost more than $10, it would be fair, take your chances, enjoy the game and drink your beer.  If this place was in a dense urban area where having a real kitchen wasn't possible, they might pass. However, that's not the case.  
I'd definitely come back before a game, before a concert, after work to try an Illinois brewed beer, but I'm not eating anything."}
{"text":"My family and I tried Scotty's Brewhouse in Champaign.

It was fine.

The servers are all young and enthusiastic. There is a large beer selection, though some of the servers are under 21 and have little knowledge on what they's offering.

We liked the atmosphere. Sodas and water came in mason jars. Food was served on trays. 

It's fun and trendy, but Scotty's is serving pub fare at steak house prices. While some of the menu is rather inventive (peanut butter on a burger?) it's mostly just variations on food from the grill or the fryer.

We all generally agreed that while we enjoyed ourselves, we weren't particularly impressed enough to choose Scotty's over other similarly priced restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Food is okay. They have improved their menu. The atmosphere is pretty good.

My wife and I went there for a lunch for a wedding anniversary (because life is crazy when you have a 10 month old).  We ordered an appetizer and a couple of entrees.  At the end of the meal we went to pay with a gift card.  We were told that it had expired.  It was a gift card that was good for two months.  Our waitress thinks it's an error and goes and gets her manager.  Manager comes out to explain.  We felt kind of scammed. Then were told that there was \"nothing they could do\".

Our waitress was awesome. But the manager was less than helpful. Clearly, there was something that they could have done which was honor the two-month valid gift card we had been given.

*Apparently it wasn't a \"gift card\" but a \"bonus cash card\" (or something similarly silly) given to someone for buying gift cards in bulk. I don't care what you call it. It looked like a gift card. Was given to us as a gift card. We probably won't go there again as a couple and I probably won't do any business lunches there anymore."}
{"text":"This rustic, (rather hip), casual bar and restaurant has great food and excellent service. We were there during a very busy time, the place was packed, we had a party of 8 with no wait, and the waiter was super attentive and friendly; he made us feel like we were the only customers in the place. The large bar (with TVs above) is surrounded by tables and high tops where customers shared appetizers and beer flights. The extensive menu includes everything and anything for breakfast, brunch, happy hour, dinner, cocktails and dessert. (See photos of menu.) We had the Dill Dipps for one appetizer (breaded, fried pickle slices with ranch or horseradish). They were fine. I loved the Spin & Art Dip (homemade spinach and artichoke dip, broiled mozzarella & tortilla chips). The Sangria (with orange and lemon wedges on the rim instead of in) was fantastic. Also, we had ordered a Moscow Mule. The first one came in a regular glass, therefore we asked about the copper mugs. The waiter apologized saying that there were none clean at the time, but did serve the second one in the proper mug at no charge. When they say, on the menu, that something is \"spicy,\" they mean it! The Spicy Steak Sandwich is extremely hot, however pretty tender. The Avocado Turkey club was fantastic!
Great service; we all enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Made my second visit to Scotty's and not any difference than the first , got the same waitress and she remembered me and what I drank and also welcomed me back, always nice to be remembered. Handicap parking was still a issue but this time I parked in the several vacant carry out spaces , ordered a medium size hand tossed pizza that came out served in a sheet pat and all the toppings had slid to the center leaving 2\" of plain crust hanging over , what's wrong with a flat pizza pan ? 
The pizza was good but won't order it again that is if I bother to go back, it was $25.00 for just my pizza and I can go to Papa Dels and order the same thing and get twice the amount of toppings for only $18.00 and it will be on a flat pan.
So far I'm not real impressed."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and always disappointed. Slow service. Menu items we come in for are no longer available. Ayce wings on mondays are no longer available.
That was my first bad experience came in for ayce wings took 45 minutes for 1st order then 35 minutes for reorder was with a date and she was livid called. Complained, got gift card to try ayce wings again I come in they don't have them anymore. Food is good but pricey and service is slow and always messing up the checks when separate...
So triptych then hooters it is for ayce wings."}
{"text":"Could be good.  Tries to pass itself off as a microbrewery, sports bar and gastropub.  The food is not as described in the menu.  Stuff is not had breaded.  It comes from an assembly line.  Asked for hand cit fries. They were not hand cut.  Pork tenderloin was thick, more like a pork burger and was not hand breaded, same with fish and chips.  Good atmosphere for a sports bar and some interesting beers.  Servers not overly friendly, personable or passionate.  With a little work on the menu and staff could be great.  Think it is a franchise that launched before it was ready."}
{"text":"Trash. Wings looked like they had been microwaved. The celery and carrots all looked old. Buffalo chicken could be confused with some type of soup. Couldn't taste any chicken. Cookie desert skillet was the best thing, but how can you get a cookie desert skillet to taste bad."}
{"text":"South Neil street, my how you've grown. It seems like just yesterday this entire area was a car dealership. Then, that was gone. Then it was construction equipment. Then one day buildings started popping up. BIG BUILDINGS! Big buildings that a lot of people are going to. There may be more cars in the area now parking to go eat and shop, than there were on the dealership lots. 
This place is one of them. 
I went here on a Saturday before going to work at Triptych. Oddly enough, there were three Triptych beers on tap. Also things from Blind Pig, Riggs, and Destihl. So, you will have the opportunity to drink local beer. Soon when they have 3WiseMen on tap, you'll be able to have that as well. It has the most tap handles in town, but it does carry a lot of BMC, so, not the most craft handles in town. 
I had a salad, I believe it was the black and blue salad. It was quite a good salad. Generous portions of meat, and one of my favorite things, avocado. 
I sat at the bar, taking in the view. Many large TV's with pretty much every game playing that was live at that moment. 
It seems like it needs more parking. But then, I don't think you would be able to fit more people in there if the lot was any bigger. From Neil, the parking doesn't look adequate, but it is surprisingly large. If you can't find a parking spot, then you probably will have a wait for a table, once you do get a spot.
There are several different seating areas, if you are lucky, you might get one of the booth suites that face the bar and the TV's. They have an app for your phone with which you can pay your bill (it doesn't seem this location is available on the app yet, so you can't preorder... yet).
Triptych growlers adorn the tables as flower holders. 
As it's new, there are still hiccups with the POS (like orders being rang in multiple times), but that benefits you!!! the person sitting at the bar!!! for when the server comes back and says \"oh, I only needed one of those beers\" and the bartender has the choice of dumping it down the drain or giving it to a patron. Or... they accidentally rang in 2 orders of chicken wings... and suddenly... FREE WINGS!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place. It is always packed when I've driven by and I've heard other people have had good experiences there. We shared the manimal fries and fried pickles for an appetizer, it was good fried food. The main courses were disappointing, tater tots were from a bag and had been reheated.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful. Happy I went and tried it, won't be going back."}
{"text":"The choices of food was excellent as was my selection, Piggy Mac & Cheese sandwich. The service was 'meh', but our orders were delivered quickly. The reason that brought me to write a review was to warn any coffee drinkers that are out there, they charge $2.50 PER CUP, because they use a Keurig. I hate Keurigs and I'm not too keen on any restaurant that does not serve endless cups of coffee, especially a bar. That is all, thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Finally got in for dinner - went about 5:30 and no table wait on Halloween - filled up a bit more by 6:00.  Service was great and pretty fast.  Mark was knowledgeable about menu from drafts thru dessert and gave great descriptions.  There were many local brews available which is nice to see - we had some Riggs, Triptych and JT Walker.   Several had bison burgers - it was good but should have asked for med rare because being lean it was pretty dry.  The beef burger that I got a bite of had excellent flavor and was still juicy at their recommend med well.  Natural cut fries were well seasoned and not overly salty.  Good first visit and will certainly come back again."}
{"text":"Park tenderloin sandwich was tasty. Waffle fries were great! Not happy with their drink serving ordered a cosmopolitan martini and bartender did not complete the drink in glass upsetting when your paying good money and bartender can't provide a decent serving. I told server, but only notified bartender nothing else's was done to rectify drink serving. Won't be ordering martini's from here again!"}
{"text":"I like many things about this establishment.  The number one is their practice of hiring of disabled. It's isn't all perfect after that.

I have visited three times. First time service at the bar was good. Bartender did everything one would expect. Food was just ok (breaded tenderloin flavorless).  Second visit was a business lunch.  Took forever for someone to wait on us. After that service was better.   But appetizer came out with meal. And that burger with the peanut butter on it is juvenile, not something that would qualify as a signature item.  Third visit was a happy hour visit at the bar. Service is getting worse!  I actually felt neglected.  The simple steps of service were ignored  (I actually had to yell across the bar to get silverware to eat!).

I'll probably go back for one more chance.

The space is cool. The menu has lots to try.  Good selection of beer.  Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with a group. Food was good, but we waited probably an hour for our checks. The manager didn't even care. Sure, we all wanted separate checks, but there is no excuse for this lack of concern."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! They have a fantastic staff! Food is super yummy, and if something isn't right they do their best to fix it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"As far as drinks go, you might as well go to Applebees. Was pretty unimpressed with those offerings.

The wings were great though, one of the best wing places in Champaign that I've been to."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Luis, was such a nice guy. Very enthusiastic about his job. 

Food just ok. 

3 stars for Luis, the fact we could bring the pupper, enjoy the pretty patio and were able to walk back to the hotel after a few brews. 

Didn't use the bathrooms (I brought hand sanitizer), so no comment. 

Skip the nachos. Wings close to BWW's, but not quite."}
{"text":"Following my first review, the owner contacted me to follow up.  I have to say that does not happen too often, but I'm going to give them a second chance since they obviously care about what their customers think.  Hopefully, after the holidays, things will smooth out and improve since many others have talked about their great experience."}
