{"text":"Great place! I started going there because it was convenient to grab a bottle on my way home, but ended up really enjoying the owners and other patrons. Now I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"We came with a wine tasting groupon and stayed for some craft beers after!  The decor of the shop is great - they offer bottle service, so you can buy and enjoy right there!  Their selection is outstanding and a great place for gifts.  Their staff is knowledgeable and they have fun events every night of the week!  Their patio is nice as well.  Come once and you'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"Amazing setting with knowledgeable wine associates. If you are looking for a before dinner bottle with great cheeses and meats or an after dinner desert wine or anything in between, you must try this place. Amazing selection and the prices are great. They offer great deals when you buy a case of wine too, you can't beat it! Friday nights they have free tastings which is a great way to try all of the amazing wine that they offer! If the wife likes wine and the hubby likes a cold one, perfect! They carry a wide variety of beers too. My wife and I love the place! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The wine tasting was 4 pours. All four wines I thought were not good. Its like they picked the cheapest wines for their tastings. What was strange was that they had a good selection of wine for sale. If you are going to do tastings, they should be the best offers so that people crave more and buy more wine. If you offer crappy wine, it makes me think the whole selection is crappy, and just encourages me to leave quicker. The service was pretty bad....slow and extremely unfriendly nor personable. I will not be back, and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Who knew this place offered wine tasting in such a pretty atmosphere right on busy Scottsdale road?  Just went last night, and it was really nice.  Outdoor fire pit, beautiful flowers, and the inside bar is great too.  My only suggestions:   1.) In follow-up to a comment already on here about the wine glasses...We had 4 different wine tastings (2 white, 2 red) and the server poured them all into the same glass.  Not ideal to taste the new wine, when there is still some remnants of the prior wine, especially with the switch from whites to reds.  2.) Very limited seating.  Most of the store is a retail setting, but more places to be sit would be great inside and outside.  I know they can squeeze in a few more.  My friend and I left the first time, because there were no tables but so much extra space to walk around.  Overall, a good experience and I will come back."}
{"text":"We have many enjoyable evenings at this establishment. I am sad to say that wine warehouse has closed! We went to this place yesterday evening to enjoy a wine tasting with friends the place was dark. Sign said they were closed...looks like they went out of business."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! The owner was extremely rude asked us to leave when we brought food in.  We were told that we could bring food in as we called ahead of time and asked. He wouldn't explain why just asked us to leave. In addition to this. We had reserved a table for a birthday party. Table was not available when we arrived. Will never come back. My girlfriend was charged for her wine they she didn't get as we were asked to leave. Unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"I was recently staying at the Residence Inn and decided to check this place out. They have a great selection of wine,  no corkage fee and reasonable prices. The bartender was really nice and suggested a wine that fit my tastes perfectly.   I returned a few nights later because I was craving an organic beer and their website advertised that they had an assortment of organic beers. When I arrived and asked for some suggestion, the lady looked at me like I had 3 heads. She proceeded to tell me that they only carry craft beer made in small batches and she wouldn't worry about the the quality of ingredients. Well, I can drink gluten free or organic...anything else hurts my stomach. So, off I went!   I really want to love this place but I wish the whole staff was more informed on their selection."}
{"text":"This place hasn't been open long, but I drive by it almost every day. Then I heard they had a good craft beer selection, so one day I stopped in. I was impressed with their selection, and even more with their prices. It is tough to compete, in Scottsdale, with places like Total Wine & More and Whole Foods. But they offers a nice selection of single bottles and are competitive across the board in regards to their prices. Oh, and they have a wide selection of cold beer, too. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My dear friend Marisa S. introduced me to the Wine Warehouse for an Oregon wine tasting event!  This is an adorable boutique wine house with a tasting table and lots of wine to choose from.  The staff I met was extremely nice; I had the pleasure of meeting Sharon and Patrick.  We chatted about wine, pets, children, silly Canadians sitting on the adorable patio and everything in-between.  We tasted some good complimentary wines from a distributor representing their Oregon wines and I also had a flight of white wines from the tasting bar.  Happy hour has $2 off per glass and $5 off a flight.  Also they have complimentary tasting events every Tuesday and Friday with light bites to nibble at (cheeses, crackers, nuts, veggies etc).  I had a great time here and will be back if I am feeling thirsty for some vino...which is quite often ;)"}
{"text":"This is really a great place. Was here for an event last week and there was decent live music on the patio and the owner was passing out free strawberries with chocolate pre-Valentine's day. The spread also include a large cheese tray, mini-meatballs and some greasy wings and a bunch of fruit. Wine samples were flowing and you also could simply buy a beer in the store and crack it open and go to town inside or outside. Huge discounts on everything during 3-7pm happy Hour and a good vibe. Better get there fast though before all the Scottsdale snobs discover the joint and ruin the place."}
{"text":"Staff is amazing. Every time I come in, they are helpful to find the right bottle. I get my nails done next door and they will deliver a glass of wine over there. Happy hour is the best! Great place to bring a bunch of co-workers for a drink as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent the WWH and we love it! The staff is amazing (especially Brooke & James) and are extremely knowledgable. The perfect place to meet good people and drink delicious wine at a great price. Easily the first stop for any night out!"}
{"text":"Nice place, nice folks.  Came for happy hour wine tasting and really enjoyed ourselves.  Nice wines, especially liked the Cambria.  Some nice microbrews too."}
{"text":"I have brought many people here already that have written reviews for this place and I haven't, shame on me!  I love this place.  I am so happy we have this concept in North Scottsdale.  I have been coming to this place almost from opening date, I remember still smelling the varnish on the wood, lol.  They have a great patio, and twice a week they offer free wine tastings.  If you sign up for their e-mails you can get the details.  I love knowing what they will be offering.  You can also do flights of the wines they are offering, or if you don't like what they have open at the time, what I have done is buy a bottle and enjoy it there, whatever you don't drink they will re-cork.  Brook, Barry and James are very helpful and can steer you to the right wines for you."}
{"text":"Tasty wines and good snacks... I'd go again, although they don't know what the yelp offer (free sample) is and never bother looking into it for you... Though we did go in with a wine tasting and cheese platter groupon so that may be why. Nonetheless, cute shop with a lot of choices. AND did I mention the beers available are crazy cheap!!"}
{"text":"Under normal circumstances this used to be a great place. Unfortunately this is no longer the case. Me with a group of friends used to frequent wine warehouse but were recently asked to leave. The reason was dueto smoking outside, which they normally allow. We arrived and we sat outside at the farthest table from the door and were given ashtrays. After about 45 mins we were asked to stop smoking due to smoke getting inside, which was impossible. We started to colony and decided to leave. While paying our tab and packing up, the owner came out and attested he was going to call the cops of we didn't leave immediately. This was asinine as we spent a very good amount while there, we were quiet and courteous and were told we were ok to smoke. They have lost frequent customers and we recommend no one provide monetary benefits to this establishment."}
{"text":"Purchased a wine and cheese sampler Groupon and went last night. Very friendly and knowledgable staff. I loved the high barrel tables and the whole decor exceeded my expectations. Part wine store, part lounge. Patio seating with heaters were available. Great selection of wines with a variety of prices for your budget, open until 10pm. Very pleased with this place and will go back again."}
{"text":"I am always looking for places to taste wine and also grab a bottle to go, if need be. After purchasing a Groupon deal, I decided to head to Wine Warehouse for a pre-date night wine and cheese tasting. I liked the concept. Lots of wines 'flagged' by country and many to choose from by the bottle. The bar is area is decent and there is outside seating. We sat at the bar because it was still hot outside and there did not seem to be any misters. We had 4 tastings and a pretty sparce cheese plate with two half slices of two different salamis. That could be better. I actually thought it was initially so chincey because this was a Groupon deal. Well, no. We asked for a more 'in depth' cheese plate and the server told us there is no kitchen and this was it! The cheeses were very good, but they were cut into small cubed squares.  The wines we tasted were very good. Wine is very much a matter of taste. I gave my Chardonnay to my boyfriend, because there is one Chardonnay I like and its in Carmel, Ca. Again, not the wine bars issue, it's a matter of preference! The one thing I did not like about the tastings: all were poured into the original glass. That is weird. Anyone who knows a thing about tasting would no this ruins the next tasting from the last. Overall, we liked the Wine Warehouse. With a few changes this place could be fab. Champagne tastings? A more expansive flight of wines choice? Lastly, more cheese! We will be back."}
{"text":"Overly priced wines for one.  The wait staff is very friendly.  The owner however, what can I say, needs serious customer service skills, in my opinion.  Been there before and enjoyed the center table of small bites.  A wine tasting happened to be going on when we were there, we helped ourselves to them.  The owner said it was for a private party, but there were no signs that stated that (happened to be in the middle of the place).  We even saw the customers of the bar enjoying them too.  I asked the server if the small bites are for everyone, he stated yes, it was part of the wine tasting that they were having.   The waiter said it's for everyone.  Helping ourselves to them, the owner kicked us out, but not before his outburst of yelling and spilling my husbands beer all over me.  Needless to say, and even reading another post of this owner kicking people out, we will not be back, nor will the couple we were with. Good luck Wine Warehouse!!"}
{"text":"Mas Vino! I've been looking for another fun wine hang-out; this may be it. They have a huge selection of wine; priced from $10 and up for a bottle (store prices, not restaurant prices). They also have a vast selection of craft beers too. Looking to have a glass while you are there - no problem. They have 4-5 coolers of chilled beverages; they have some non-alcoholic beverages too for the designated drivers.  Wondering about bringing a group? The bar seats about 10, the various tables inside seat about 15-20 and then there is the big outside patio...with heaters mind you - that seats I'd say 15-20 plus lots of standing space so you can take turns with the seating if needed.  Food? Selection is very limited for purchases; you can get a little cheese plate for $10. It's a wine bar afterall... but they seem to be cool with bringing in your own food so that's cool. I was told on special event nights they do have a selection of appetizers though.  They have a TV behind the bar; I'm sure you could talk the bartender into putting on a game etc. when I was there a movie was playing.  Staff is nice; our first visit we had Patrick helping us out behind the bar. He also helped us to find a bottle of wine based on our needs and description so don't hesitate to ask... there are so many bottles to choose from and they know their wine. I'll be back. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've never been here to stay because of the experience my mother and I had. My mom had a groupon for a wine tasting and small food platter which is going to expire soon. She is going out of town soon and I just got back in town so we decided to go today. Apparently they were having an event, and after talking to an employee, he said maybe they can honor it on the patio but probably not due to the event. After speaking with a manager, he informed us they couldn't accept the groupon at this time. My mom asked if she could talk to a manager to see if maybe she can get a voucher for another time. So Brooke, the \"manager\" apparently, approached us with a nasty vibe to begin with and asked what was up. My mom explained how she didn't understand why she couldn't accept the groupon since in the fine print it didn't say anything about not being accepted on \"event days\". Brooke sarcastically and rudely said that its \"illegal\" for her to do accept it in these circumstances. My mom repeated what she said and asked why it was illegal and Brooke said that is not what she said. Overall I couldn't believe how rude she was. I work in the service industry as well and I get how groupons can be kind of annoying but honestly they get you clients and your company was the one that set it up so you deal with it and honor and most of all be NICE to clients. We probably would of bought bottles of wine beyond the coupon but I don't even want to come back there after that experience. I myself don't get sassy but my mom does, so I had to walk out of the store while she was writing our \"voucher\" to come back on her card for the same value because I was about to flat out ask her \"why are you being so damn rude???\" Probably even worse language than that. I honestly have never experienced that from a manager to a client. I know my own manager would NEVER talk to someone like that. Needless to say, I love wine, but I will never go back to that place because of that woman. Hope you guys train your managers to show  a little bit more simple kindness towards clients."}
{"text":"If you're a wine fan in the mood to try something new but don't know where to start, head to Wine Warehouse of Scottsdale in north Scottsdale.  The store/bar opened this month and features dozens of wines and craft beers for any price range and taste.  What's coolest about the spot: lounging at the bar is an awesome place where you can sample wine before you throw down to purchase, and the vibe is friendly and relaxing, unlike what you might find if you just go to Trader Joe's.  I went there this week with some friends to try some of their selections, a variety of red and white wine, including a carbonated red called Bellina that tasted so awesome, just like cherry Coke, I took a bottle home with me. At $8.99, it was a steal and a must-try!  Monday's through Friday's, the Warehouse hosts a happy hour, with $9 wine flights, $2 off wines by the glass, and $3 of create-your-own six-packs of beer.  The coolest deal, though, is that you're always able to create your own 12-pack of wine bottles for only $60 from what's available at that price point. Like our hosts pointed out, the case would make a great set of holiday presents, with quality selections at only $5 a pop -- what a steal!  The bar is also offering up periodic wine tastings, including one Saturday, September 28, from 5-7 p.m., which will include free cheese plates and wine samples. I had some of the Warehouse's cheese and fruit when I went, and it was delicious.  Besides my favorite wine, the Bellafina from Italy, we also tried the Lo Nuevo, a refreshing Spanish white wine; the Viognier, a clean and acidic wine from Northern California; the Drops of Jupiter, a red wine from San Francisco that is actually made by Train guitarist Jimmy Stafford; the robust Mercer Cabernet Sauvignon from Washington; and the smooth Southern Hills Cabernet Sauvignon from Wente Vineyards.  I thought they were all great choices to sample, and I liked all of them. I'm usually not a white wine drinker, but I enjoyed the ones I sampled, especially Lo Nuevo from my dad's home country.  Wine Warehouse has plans to open a patio with TVs, and I think it'd be a fun yet practical place to visit if you want to have a glass of wine and save money by drinking a bottle at home. It's not as formal as some wine bars, which can be great for happy hour, and the store's atmosphere, with fun ceiling hangings such as a cupcake, give it a welcoming feel. Check them out on Facebook at www.facebook.com/WineWarehouseofScottsdale."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly spot to enjoy some great wine and beer. My husband and I had \"date\" night here. Great prices and selection. I did the wine flight and all the selections were amazing. They had appetizers out for customers to enjoy, but I opted to order their cheese plate (the one food item they have) and it was lovely! Great quality cheese and the presentation of the plate was beautiful. They have a large patio area outside which I look forward to enjoying in the spring."}
{"text":"Visited this place as I was a lucky recipient of a Groupon.  We enjoyed ourselves;  had a 4-wine with cheese plate tasting.  The retail \"store\" surprisingly offered a wide selection of reasonably priced wines."}
{"text":"This place is really cute.  I took the missus on a wine date with a Groupon and they gave us 4 tastings paired with meats and cheeses for $20.  It wasn't the four greatest wines we had ever tried but it was definitely a great deal.  The decor is that of an elegant home and they had a great selection of wines and BEERS that they paired with flags of their country or state of origin.  Overall, I agree that the place needs more seating but it's really a wine store that's housing some foodies to get them to try and buy more.  I'm OK with that.  The staff was friendly, but there was only one person serving like 15 people which means the service was a bit slow.  It's definitely a great idea that needs more support.  So go support them and get yourself some delicious wine in the process.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great wine and beer selections... Just a nice place to go and have a glass! The staff are very personable and they know their wines!"}
{"text":"So glad this place has closed...the owner was terrible...a bunch of  friends went there for a birthday celebration and the owner was soooo rude...very embarrassing situation for all my friends....I went to every social media outlet to warn people about the establishment"}
{"text":"When Marisa S. asked me if I wanted to join her for a wine tasting here at first I thought it would be a place like Bevmo or Total Wine based on their name Wine WAREHOUSE.  Much to my surprise and pleasure, it's a boutique wine shop with friendly staff. For more details on what's offered read some of the other reviews already posted.  I will write the ambience is great- perfect place to bring a date or come with a group of friends. Great location with a beautiful patio out front with seating.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff- sure to become a neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a FREE Wine Tasting every Tuesday & Friday with some small snacks to go along. The inside bar is nice to sit at and chat with the employees there who are extremely nice and very helpful and knowledgeable about the wine. They also offer specialty beers, like the Stone Enjoy By, which I went in to go buy for my bf. They had 1 left in a separate fridge and ended up giving it to me to purchase."}
{"text":"Need better wine sampler glasses. Way too small to see, smell and taste the wine.  Need to,knock it up a notch if you expect clients to purchase your wine."}
{"text":"This is a great place! It is super cute and well decorated, very hip. The people working the wines were incredible at describing them to us and discussing what we liked in wines. We had 4 tastings and their appetizer plate and left with a couple bottles of wine. I will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Went to the Wine Warehouse on a Groupon, received a wine tasting and meat and cheese platter. The wine was awesome! For the meat and cheese platter you got 1 piece of pepperoni and 1 piece of salami, so that was a little lame. However, the server was really knowledgable and fun. The store offers a huge variety of wines and has a nice atmosphere, would go back and recommend for a relaxing night!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Love the relaxed atmosphere, place to interact with people enjoy a glass of wine, etc."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to start with recapping my appalling experience at Wine Warehouse. Went with a large party for a birthday celebration and the party coordinator was told in advance by the staff we could bring external food from off the premises. Was greeted with sub par service to start (a large table was not reserved and we resorted to having eight or so women huddle around a high top) despite the fact the joint was nearly empty.. About twenty minutes in the owner came outside and proceeded to rant at our party for having food we brought ourselves (if you've ever seen the movie, Up, you can get a nice visual for this mans demeanor). The owner proceeded to have a verbal argument with several of the ladies and in doing so made a complete and utter mockery of himself. Man did this guy miss some customer service basics. (his emotions ran high; he became incredibly defensive and raised his voice several times; refused to take ownership for his staffs' action and sited it was \"illegal\" to have external food and that he'd recently been fined a significant amount for doing so (this in and of itself is embarrassing); allegated that the party coordinator lied about the fact that his staff informed her external food could be brought in (only he and his daughter worked the prior Friday he claimed..).; only about ten minutes into the argument did he finally mutter a shallow, disengenuine sorry). To top it all off after we seated ourselves at the friendly outdoor cafe next door he interrupted our meal to tell us we had a \"check due\" at his establishment. (We bought two bottles of wine; had a few sips of one and didn't open the other). Our classy party coordinator paid the bill after the old man threatened to call the cops. (I can't say I would have done the same.) Later on the lovely staff at the cafe next door informed us that people brought her food over to wine warehouse all the time and she had even personally delivered to guests. She did mention that the owner who ranted at us was rarely ever at the warehouse and this begs the question: were we harassed for having outside food, or for having outside food on a plate versus styrofoam......or what? I guess we will never know because the owner was so self consumed in his irrational rant and accusing our party coordinator of lying, and less interested in understanding our circumstances. I cringe to even think about how poorly we were treated at this place and can't imagine this guy being in business for long. This is by far the very WORST customer experience I've ever encountered and I am still flabbergasted. It was like a scene from a movie people. DO NOT GO TO WINE WAREHOUSE."}
{"text":"Cute place! I was surprised when I walked in at the size, variety and over decor of this store. Part wine store and part bar. Father and Daughter owned and operated, both with great knowledge AND personalities. The wines we tasted and purchased were all great...we will be back!"}
{"text":"First visit to Wine Warehouse.  Friday night was wine tasting ... good presentation, tasty whites and reds from France and Italy, good conversation.  Enjoyed wine and cheese on the patio - beautiful night. Nice ambiance inside and out, lively background music, friendly guests, and Brooke and Barry were fantastic hosts!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"LOVE coming to the wine warehouse! Great little locals place and I always have a wonderful time here. All the other patrons are friendly and the staff makes you feel very welcome. Every time I visit I have memorable conversations with the people sitting next to me. People come here for great wine and a nice time! Thank you Brooke for always remembering what I like too!"}
{"text":"Andy was great! Knows his wines and was very gracious. First time here. Nice outdoor area.  Perfect for a wine flight and some cheese and fruit."}
{"text":"Had a nice experience 1 month ago. Told they ha no problem if you bring food from any nearby restaurant.  Had a party there this evening, brought food. Owner proceeded to come out and very rudely told us to leave. His rant continued as we offered to out our food away. We went next store to pita cafe and had great service. The owner came over there to say we hadn't paid our tab. Brought the bill for two bottles of wine we didn't drink. We paid. Had to go get our own bottles. All he had to was say sorry no food. We would have put away and probably $ a whole lot of wine. For now, he's lost 12 customers. Learn some customer service!!"}
{"text":"Loved my experience shopping here.  Upon entering I was pleasantly greeted and offered a glass of wine while I shop.  Staff was very knowledgeable about the wines and did a great job listening to my preferences and then providing some recommendations.  So far we've enjoyed all of the bottles we took home that day."}
{"text":"Let me join the Marisa S. and Joe S. bandwagon and say this place is fantastice and yhanks yo Joe and Marisa, I now know about it!  I/we went here on a Wednesday night after the ISC UYE with a few yelpers for their wine tasting quiz.  For $10, you get a blind 4 wine tasting in which you compare your tasting notes to the list  the Wine Warehouse provides and then you make an \"educated\" guess for each of the wines you are tasting.  I loved it.  What a great idea.  And the best part, if you get all 4 correct, your flight is free.  Ahhhhh, bliss.  I got none correct.  Zero.  Bummer, but I drank wine!   This is a very cute and well stocked wine store and from what I can tell, the staff is very knowledgeable and well trained.  From the serious jazz tunes playing to the short sale wall to the wonderful assortment of tapas and cheese plates, this wine store has all the makings of a fun evening out!  Can you imagine telling your date or friends, lets go to a wine store tonight.  They would be surprised!  My return factor is 100%"}
