{"text":"This place is not good. We tried the elote which was obviously made from a frozen corn as it had that distinct thawed corn softness and taste. Gross. We also tried the bruschetta which was basically pico de gallo on a slice of sour dough. The bread was not grilled or anything so the salsa like topping and bread quickly became a soggy mess. Gross again. Then there was the chicken tamale, which tasted alright but the masa didn't seem fully cooked so it was a bit mushy. Next was the wings, which were ok but nothing special. We ended up getting our check before ordering anything else because everything we had was just not good at all. I don't expect this place lasting through the summer. Sorry."}
{"text":"The vibe was nice, the decor upscale.  Great place for friends gathering and food/drinks. The waitresses are attentive and fun. Grest music"}
{"text":"Negative star rating. Literally just walking out of the restaurant. A FLY was in my drink!!! A FLY! Showed the drink to the manager (the fly was at the bottom of my drink). Completely grossed out. All she can do is reverse the transaction to accommodate. This nasty experience. Never again!"}
{"text":"Hannah....what a hire. Well done, super sweet from the moment we sat down. The food came out super quick, the drinks she made were spot on. Good things will happen here..a gem in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Very cool spot and friendly service. The food is pretty good too, however, MAKE sure you ASK for itemized receipt!"}
{"text":"Went into Three Wise men there  were maybe ten people at the bar my girlfriend literally waving my wallet in the air. They ignored her I came out of the restroom expecting  to have my lady and our drinks nope! I tried getting two bartenders attention they ignored me as well@and continued their conversation. I will never go back horrendous service"}
{"text":"Our favorite bar we've found while visiting Scottsdale so far. Went on a Monday, so there were only a handful of people, but everything was great. Service was quick and checked on us often. Drinks were cheap compared to surrounding competitors. Tried a tamale, which was unique but tasty. The atmosphere was ideal. Would definitely visit again. :)"}
{"text":"I have lived in Old Town Scottsdale for the past 5 years, and over that time I have visited nearly all of the clubs/bars in the area. This past Saturday night, my wife's best friend was celebrating her birthday and had spoken to a promoter that offered her a deal for bottle service at Three Wisemen (buy one get one free). The bottle was reasonably priced, and we have never been to this club/bar so we decided to go. There were less people at this bar than I am typically used to in the area, but I figured due to it being relatively new, that was normal. We had a good time dancing, and the service was acceptable (not five star service, but what I would expect from a club/bar in Old Town). 

Everything was going well until it became time to pay. We were brought the check, and my group of friends started getting cash together. I offered to take the cash and put the entire bill on my card. After giving the bill back to the server, I received a text verification from my bank asking me to verify the transaction (I had set this process up previously). When I received this notification, I realized that the amount that they charged was over $100 more than had been listed on the receipt that I was given in the bill. I notified my bank to deny the transaction (via text). 

I then was approached by the server and she informed me that my card  was declined. I explained to her the I declined it because they charged me more than was listed on the receipt. She then asked me to follow her over to speak to a guy who I assume was a manager. I told him what happened. He proceeded to tell me that this is \"normal\" procedure in Old Town, and that the extra amount was for gratuity. I told him that I expect to pay gratuity, and I had even planned to pay it on the bottle that they gave us for free, but if it is automatically included, that they MUST show it on my receipt that is included in the bill. I told him that it is unacceptable to show me one amount, and charge me a completely different amount without my  authorization. The guy (who I assume was a manager) then walked up to one of the bouncers and told them that I \"put my hands on him\" (which was completely untrue, which he later admitted to my wife). Several bouncers then surrounded me and proceeded to  try and intimidate me into paying the bill. They even sent other bouncers over to our table, and one told my brother \"your friend refuses to pay $60\". 

After several minutes of arguing with them, and repeatedly telling them that this is not an acceptable way to run a business, I told them that I would pay (which I proceeded to do). I also told that that I would tell everyone that I know how Three Wisemen does business. I still have copies of both receipts (the original one for the lesser amount, and then one that I was actually charged). 

AVOID THIS CLUB/BAR UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE QUOTED ONE PRICE AND CHARGED A DIFFERENT AMOUNT WITHOUT YOUR AUTHORIZATION. They will gladly tell you that this is \"normal\" for Old Town. I will never be returning to this bar/club, and I will be sharing this story with everyone that is willing to listen."}
{"text":"My first experience was absolute sublime. The GM Mike and our server Janae were some of the best service workers I've had the pleasure of meeting.. will asolutely come back and i recommend you give it a try aswell."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink before heading to Canal Convergence a couple of weeks ago.  This location used to be an upscale restaurant, so I was curious what they did with the space.  The bartenders were nice, the atmosphere was laid back and I enjoyed my tasty peach bellini martini."}
{"text":"Bar and grill by day,  dance club at night.  Three wise men always bear gifts, so dress to impress and they may offer you a special you can't refuse.

Tamale Tuesday had my heart right now. Amazingly authentic.  Try getting smarter tonight, swing by the Three Wisemen."}
{"text":"Very good comfort food, uniformly cool staff so far, and entertainment at various times of the week.  If I had the money I'd probably be coming here twice or three times a week."}

{"text":"Awesome people! Great food and music! Bartenders were quite friendly. We had a table booked on a Saturday for party of 15. Staff kept coming and checking us to make sure we were doing good. Hard to expect this kind of service at a bar (night club) on a Saturday night in Scottsdale! Just saying!!!! 
Overall great experience and fun night"}
{"text":"Love it, just make sure security keeps Carol out, what a B. Who comes to a soft opening with an attitude like that?"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Cleaned up look. The food is amazing and the drinks are affordable. It has a great vibe different then the rest of old town the perfect place to be social."}
{"text":"Stopped by Three Wisemen for a lunch meeting and was pleasantly surprised! It's been a while since a Bar and Grill \"wowed\" me. Loved the menu selection, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was REALLY good. Four of us split several appetizers and entrees and every bite was better than the last. I ended up in Three Wisemen by happenstance, but we will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This is an amazing first stop before heading out, a perfect atmosphere for grabbing food post club chaos, and is somehow fun no matter the day or time you drop by! Def recommend for all the crazy specials they run too."}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service!!!! Rude! Food was Awful! Did not have a good wine selection... terrible menu! Was there to see The Batchelor Arie and Lauren... 
Do Not Waste Your Time!!! Bevy is Better! I work around the corner... terrible customer service... Very Disappointed!! They are begging  for Customers... NOT!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat their prices for a night out. Try the tamales! Friendly bartenders and DJ. Had a blast."}
{"text":"Just left there and the drinks was on point very very good we'll drinks, but the food was nasty as hell. Fish was burn wings had no type of seasonings to it but the Fry's was good. Very nice people but I'll never eat they cheap Frozen process food ever ever again smh ughhh it made me want to turn vegan .... Im never coming back here ever in life ever"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a couple of girlfriends and really enjoyed myself. The servers and hostess are so very smart and attentive! I never felt like I had to find someone to take my drink order and the food came quick. The onion rings are super delicious and I think our server said it was a house made special batter yummo. Great music to boogie to and a nice outdoor patio if you need to take a breather. Be aware that the gorgeous girls here are smoking hot in their work uniform consisting of their bras and panties but don't be fooled these girls are 100% ladies and very well informed of the drinks and menu items. Love this place, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a zero star, I would. First off: their only open for a soft opening so they have virtually no food, and the food they do have is disappointed sports bar food. Second off: I went for the initial grand opening and the bartender refused to make my drink unless I tipped. I'm all about tipping, but who asks for a tip...ESPECIALLY asking for a tip before I even taste the quality of their work? Excuse me but you aren't entitled to my hard earned money.
Lastly: I decided to give this place a try with my girlfriend, still during their soft opening, with MAYBE 8 people in the bar total. We sat their for over 10 minutes, with a pathetic attempt of a greet, and absolutely zero effort to get us any drinks or the minuscule menu they offered. Safe to say: this place will definitely not last as it does not care about actual guests and the service is some of the worst I've encountered. Do yourself a favor and don't even bother with this place. Not worth it."}
{"text":"When it comes to what the rest of old town Scottsdale is this place is a gift from god. Good music. Cheap drinks. Good food. No dress code. I stumbled in here late one night cause their kitchen is open until 3am and I've been hooked ever since. 

This is owned by the same person as Maya and has become my favorite destination. Mostly because the drinks are 30-50% cheaper then anywhere else. 

Only downside is the bathrooms are kinda small in comparison to everywhere else but I feel like that's a small price to pay for what we get. 

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Even if it's just a pre-game spot it's still way cheaper then any other place in old town."}
