{"text":"It was a great experience going to this place. Very good and healthy food. The taste of the chicken was magnificent and also without that dryness that other chickens have.
Very good customer service. Definitely I will be back. The decoration is great. 
It is a new place but I think nothing to envy to the big restaurant chain. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"We had the 1/4 chicken with baked potato and salad plus the chicken salad sandwich with the meatball soup. Everything was soooo good we almost went back the next day. We didn't but this place is definitely going to be one of our go-to places for good food."}
{"text":"Chicken wrap was BOMB.... I haven't written a yelp review in awhile but I was moved to do so thanks to the very nice guys working here but more importantly the AMAZING wrap and salad they made me.

$8 bucks for a huge healthy wrap, I recommend the Green house made little spicy sauce, and a Spinach salad, AND a bottle of water or soda.  

Can you beat that nowadays?  Forget Greens and Proteins next door, their salads are BLEH!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"\"Hot and new\"? Give me a break. Went in an hour before closing and was told they were \"out of chicken.\" Wtf. Seriously, why are your doors even open? The only souls in the place looked like the employees/owners talking amongst themselves at a table. No apologies. With Greens and Proteins right next door, I won't be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Good and healthy food! Literally the very best roasted chicken I have ever eaten.The Wuacamole home made is very delicious ,Perfect location for a lunch and a quick dinner with some friends. Thanks Armando"}
{"text":"The place its beautiful to start with very cozy colorful. We ordered the 1/4 chicken we eat all without talking just to make the point a good that was. Juicy crispy delicious. Portion are large and well priced. I had the mixed salad with tomato olives with Caesar dressing and we just love it. We will be back soon and tell all our friend. Thank you Rotisserie Chicken"}
{"text":"Very awesome food great service this is the place for a real chicken I highly recomend prices good food portions thanks really like it"}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers went here for lunch, everyone agreed was delicious. Our pointers: 1 - chicken seasoning is awesome, put more of it. 2 - Mac and cheese should be a side option. Loved how you had options for the salad and that a salad is automatically included. Thanks for lunch we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! They were so accommodating when I asked to come early to pick up food. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"It's okay, but... a half chicken plate with a drink and tax sets you back about $20.  No bang for the buck.  And there's lots of places for a full meal well under $20.  I don't mind paying for a nice meal but if you're gonna charge me big bucks, don't give me styrofoam plates and plastic ware and make me stand in line and bus my own table.

On the plus side, good service, clean, comfortable, and fresh salads.

On the neutral side, the sides are on a steam table and covered. You never know what you're getting until it's scooped.  The mac and cheese was left open and looked dry.  The server stirred it up to look better just before he took my order.  They seem a little stingy on the salad fixings with 3 options.  I'm sure having an open salad bar has it's drawbacks, but the current system seems to gouge you for more $$$ to add extra toppings...and as I mentioned, it's expensive enough as is.


On the negative side, the chicken was seasoned well and the skin had great flavor.  That flavor doesn't make it to the inside of the chicken.  Therefore the chicken is rather bland and maybe a tad dry.  The dipping sauce certainly added flavor but I think the chicken should have some kind of cooked in seasoning.
Again, $20 for a full meal seems a little steep.  Nevada Chicken Cafe and others do a much better job at a much better price.

Two stars because, Meh, I've experienced better.  It's has potential.  in reality it's just fast food at gourmet prices.  I have nothing against the place other than seasoning and price.  Perhaps if they had daily specials where you really got bang for the buck, I'd return.  Perhaps they could do something to promote the salads as a deal and use good chicken chunks instead of that god awful shredded stuff they use."}
{"text":"Great customer service. It's rare to have great service these days and would come back just because of it. Oh and the chicken is awesome!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is delicious! I ordered the 1/4 chicken with the corn and a spinach salad -- everything tasted great! The chicken was nicely seasoned and was perfectly moist and wasn't super greasy. They have a great selection of sides and I was told that they are all made fresh in house. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"First time going in,  place is clean and they have cucumber flavored water!

I had the chef's special since I wasn't familiar with the menu, I was not disappointed.

If you want a healthy homemade meal and you happen to be lazy or tired have a salad from here, this place is perfect.

Will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions! And some of the friendliest service i've come across in las vegas. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Very simple menu, absolutely delicious for a healthy meal! Props to bringing more flavor to healthy options"}
{"text":"Tasty and healthy Food ,  Great Customer Services and nice and clean place .  Chicken Taste Good highly recommend , Prices are reasonable ."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken fresh and super healthy best guacamole they make it in front of you ...and not only that they have yam my favorite ,salad is really good , mash potato, I will definitely going back and service was great ! The owner and employees are very polite and they give you the best service .... if you are looking for a clean and healthy place!"}
{"text":"Chicken excellent. Generous portion. Baked potato tasty. Place nice and clean. Staff friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time visit, came here for lunch. Pleasant experience. I selected the 1/4 rotisserie chicken (breast and wing), with a cup of soup and steamed sweet potato. Make sure to get their homemade hot sauce (spicy cilantro cream consistency!) it was a great compliment to the meal. They have fresh cucumber and lemon water to wash down your lunch. This place is good for a healthy and hearty meal. Will return."}
{"text":"This may be a great place, but they ran out of chicken making it a little difficult to rate. Running out of chicken in today's word of data-based decision making seems odd. At very least, creating a horrible customer experience.

We arrived an hour before closing, did not think this should be an issue."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy meal!

I got a takeaway from here and couldn't believe how juicy and fresh the chicken was. It came with 2 sides - I tried the salad and steamed veggies."}
{"text":"It is rare that I am moved to write a review on the spot, but I am doing so while finishing my  meal.   I am so happy to see another healthy dining option in town. The customer service was outstanding and it was no issue to have our strict dietary needs accomodated.  The restaurant and restrooms were spotless.  I also thought the ability to separate recyclables was a unique and welcome change at a restaurant. I was terribly impressed that the owner had implemented suggestions made by another reviewer less than a month ago.  I had the homemade meatball soup and my husband had the spinach chicken wrap.  We were delighted to see various flavors of zero calorie Vitamin Water available.  My soup was tasty and my husband said his wrap was amazing. Definitely will make it a point to return."}
{"text":"I was pleased to visit a friend near his office and see that A new rotisserie chicken place  popped up where Soulfish used to be. I ordered the half chicken and yams and love the Peruvian seasoning. The yams were perfect like my aunt used to make in Tennessee :-) I thought the prices were fair and middle of the road compared to other chicken places and I would definitely return. The chef/owner armando intro'd himself and made us feel welcome which matters to me when i visit new places."}
{"text":"There is a sign on the door that says this place is permanently closed. It's a shame because this place had good food and great service."}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered 2 single chicken plates for 2 of us. They informed me they were out of chicken. It would be a 40-45 minute wait. 

Ouch. No chicken and it's in the name of your business. 

So I can't really review the food, as they had none to offer during my lunch break."}
{"text":"My new lunch spot. Great service and food. It says fast food... the service is fast but the quality is way better than any fast food. I will be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great concept but needs work. The chicken was little dry but decent & the mashed potatoes were good. The negatives are:
1. No kids menu which I would expect from a place like this. My son had the adult portion chicken fingers which he said was good but to big a portion & you pay an adult price for your kids. 
2. Drinks need work. Literally they have a few different brands of canned soda & bottled water. No ice tea, fountain drinks etc. such an easy fix especially with those multi flavored machines that take up very little space. 
3. This one is nitpicking but no music playing which makes the atmosphere kind of weird when you eat there. You're listening to the air-conditioning running the whole time. 
That being said it's worth trying. They've only been open for a few days so I will try it again after a month or so when they work the kinks out."}
{"text":"In the search for delicious and healthy food, I encountered this lovely place. First of all, the decor is unique, vibrant and refreshing. Second, the customer service was excellent. The lady taking care of my order was kind and patient. Most importantly, the food/salad bar area was perfectly clean, smelled great and the food itself was delicious! 
If I lived closer, I'd visit this place after the gym every single day. 

Please try the freshly made guacamole!!! You'll love it! 

Also, the infused complimentary water was off the hook delicious!! 

I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"good food, healthy choices, great ambiance, simple just focused on a good flavor, 
place is new and  i am a regular now. 
loved it!!

ps. the day rick mention, the food sold out!! good sign, sold everything. that is a good sign."}
{"text":"Guess what Rotisserie chicken sell?  Rotisserie Chicken!

They're located in a strip mall near Rainbow and Sunset, which has plenty of parking.  I saw that they finally put a few chairs outside, which told me that it was time to try a new restaurant!

The restaurant is set up chipotle style, where you walk down a queue, order along the line, and pay at the end.  They have a huge sign showing the combo plate options - (1) choice of chicken size (2) choice of side (3) salad options.  The chicken comes in quarter, half, and whole sizes.  I got the quarter, which is essentially a large sized leg and thigh.  I suppose that you get two legs/thighs for the half size and four for the whole (but a Chicken only have 2 legs?? idk). 

Being a new restaurant, the staff struggled a bit to get me through my choice of sides and salad, but I'm sure they'll get that down in no time.  Drinks are not included in the meal and they only had bottled options, so I couldn't even ask for a free water.

Since this place specialized in Rotisserie Chicken, I certainly had really high expectations for the Chicken.  I'd give it a 7/10 in juiciness and 8/10 in flavor.  It was good, but not el pollo loco good. 

The sides were OK as well too - nothing really good or bad about them.  However, I was super disappointed with the piece bread.  The cashier took it out from a huge plastic bag.  It was stale and boring.

I do like how the restaurant encourages the cudtomers to sort our trash into paper/plastic, glass, and waste.  Its a good thought, except the cycle goes \"reduce, reuse, and recycle\".  100% of the stuff I got was disposal, which kind of defeats the cycle of \"reduce and reuse\". Oh well.

Overall, the food was ok, atmosphere was great, and staff were friendly.  I think the food will get better as they refine over time."}
{"text":"NOT BAD AT ALL. 
This place recently opened up so I had to try for lunch.
It's a small place that is still airy with nice big wooden tables to sit on and a simple line to order that leads across the front of the food area. The lady serving food is always very pleasant and helpful. I found their chicken to be quite juicy and delicious - in a way an honest chicken should taste like - with no gimmicks. I like their slaw and corn to accompany the chicken. (you get 2 sides with 1 being either salad or slaw) You also get a biscuit and can treat yourself to free lime/lemon drinking water in the back. 

I found the 1/4 chicken meals to be filling without being overpowering and now it's my go-to lunch spot while on assignment out here as this place can stand toe-to-toe to good rotisserie chicken lunch spots in my home, NYC. 

Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for lunch since they had a 10% off Yelp check-in offer.  Chicken had a nice seasoning & was perfectly juicy. You get 2 sides with an individual 1/4 meal and they have a good amount to choose from including a mini salad bar. While I liked the food & the service was great, it's just too overpriced."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Las Vegas. You have to eat the chicken wrap, healthy and delicious. Great customer service.  100% recommended."}
