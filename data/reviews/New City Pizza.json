{"text":"We used to be loyal customers. The last 4 times we have sent our order has been wrong. The very last straw was we asked for a pizza with green peppers on it and instead of green peppers they gave us jalapeno. I called and took the pizza back where they argued with me they were green peppers, and told me green peppers are supposed to make things spicy. Rather then just saying we're sorry we messed up your order, here is a new pizza. 

Bottom line: mediocre food with horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Descent pizza for a cheap price. Nothing special but does the job when you're hungry."}
{"text":"This is based on walking in and ordering, rather than picking up a slice. 

There is a special posted on the window: Mon - Wed, two large pizzas, six toppings combined, with garlic bread or a 2 liter coke. Which is what I ordered, got the coke instead. $20, tax included.
They also have a walk-in medium cheese for $5 I believe; one topping XL is $10.

Fresh out the oven, the pie is very good (pepperonis, the spicy sausage, etc); far better than the card board, inconsistent pizza you get at pizza pizza. Also better than the very dry hot & ready pizzas you get at Little Caesars - I cannot comment on their fresh ones though.

Unfortunately, the place is a little dated. Dirty floors and plastic chairs. Small standing area if you prefer to eat inside."}
