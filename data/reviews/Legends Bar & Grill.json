{"text":"I recently had an extremely disappointing visit to the un-legandary \"Legends\". My girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot on a late night, and the service was absolutely astonishing. Astonishing in the sense that I didn't realize service could be so dreadful. The host took about 3 minutes to greet us, since he was out having a chat with his buddy on the patio while having some cigarettes. 

From that point on it got worse, the waiter legitimately didn't even speak to us throughout the night, he apparently has mastered the art of communication through animal groans and head movements. Not to worry, the meal was $4.77 less since he got a $0.33 tip from me. Figured it would at least help him buy some more smokes. 

All in all, decent food (for anthem..), uncomfortable atmosphere, and cringeworthy service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cold beer and an excellent twist on your normal bar foods. Had the beer battered mushrooms, jalapeño poppers (wrapped in bacon) and the caprese salad (with pickled onions). Excellent!  Also had the BBQ pork sandwich and sirloin steak which was better than any local steakhouse. Our daughter and her friend actually saved room for dessert and had the deep fried cookie dough which was incredibly decadent and frankly amazing. Service was great! Fun and friendly laid back atmosphere. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner Sunday afternoon. The bar had quite a few people sitting watching a game. The restaurant was empty which verified my concerns about the food. The half chicken quesadilla on the happy hour menu was ok but the jalapeños were very bitter so I had to pick them off. If I went back I would order it again without onion and jalapeños-just chicken and cheese. I had a pear salad and added chicken. It was very small like a half portion but the price reflected a huge full size salad. Husband had the bbq pork with fries and said it was just ok. The place is ok for drinks and an appetizer but I won't be going back for dinner. Way too expensive for the quality and portion. The server was very nice and efficient."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying if it weren't for our amazing bartender, Jesse, I wouldn't have given any stars. The bar was extremely busy and she had absolutely no support. I've never seen a bartender have to leave the bar on a crazy night to grab 3 cases of beer because she ran out. Once again, where is the manager or a bar-back to support the bartender?? They were running out of glasses and alcohol at the bar and it was easy to see how overwhelming this was getting with no help. This made it a very uncomfortable experience sitting at the bar.

Oh but that was nothing. When Rick (supposedly the manager) finally came to give some help he was an absolute disrespectful ass. He was throwing towels, slamming doors shut and slamming glasses down. His employee was obviously stressed and working her ass off and Rick did nothing but make the situation worse and more uncomfortable. Every chance he had he would make a snide comment about her to customers. I've never seen anybody more disrespected and treated like absolute trash like Rick treated his employee tonight. My understanding is, as a person in a managerial position, that you can handle stress well and you can walk in to a stressful situation and lift up your employee. Rick was an absolute child and cannot handle a busy stressful night. He made it incredibly uncomfortable tonight for the customers and more importantly treated a great employee with absolute disrespect. If you can't handle the pressure of managing a bar without treating your people like crap then bus tables. 

I've never seen any kind of disrespect and unprofessionalism like this at any type of establishment towards a staff member. I hope Jesse finds a place to work where she is appreciated and not treated like absolute garbage for her hard work."}
{"text":"Went twice now, hoping for a different experience but unfortunately food was still just okay and service was also just okay.  While is good they are open late the menu has changed, they don't have a lot to choose from and the food isn't that great.  Also both times we have gone my order was messed up (one was wings and one was dessert, not hard orders).  Not worth it to me to give a 3rd change."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  Horrible service (they should just hire turtles, it would be faster).  I don't understand how this place stays in business!  Ordered a chicken sandwich with a dollop of spinach/artichoke dip on top (this was a menu item, not a special order item).  Sandwich came out with a huge lump of cold cream cheese on top of the chicken.  Disgusting.  Companion ordered a burger and it was overcooked and lukewarm at best."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible experience and owner never followed through after an in person meeting regarding our horrible experience! Zero stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely AWFUL! Granted, we never actually got to eat anything because BOTH TIMES we went (months apart) we were seated and then ignored forever and ended up leaving."}
{"text":"I have been here five times now.. Never again..
Here is what made up my mind..
Walked in and stood there looking around and the host gave me eye contact then looked away. The host station was 10' away and he was helping nobody, then when I walked over there he left.. I watched him just walk away and talk to another employee and joke around.. I should of left.. Plus it wasn't busy, plenty of open booths.. We end up getting seated and wait almost ten minutes to put in our drink order.. Our server brought back my beer and one water, they were out of the rum my date ordered.. They made here another drink, it was horrible.. We told the server who told us its because the pineapple and orange juice they use isn't real the Oj is like sunny d.. They don't have the small cans of juice to make drinks! Whatever.. I ordered another beer and this time it was as flat as flat gets, no head, no bubbles.. Keg is about dead. I told my server and she asked how I knew.. Really? Then she asked me if I even tasted it! Lol, I'm 40 and drink beer all the time.. I ordered a bottled beer.. As far as the food goes its OK, just over priced..
So I get my bill for 3 beers and 2 mixed drinks and it was almost fifty bucks! My date grabbed the bill and they added 3 or 4 extra drinks to my bill.. It got corrected..
Never again..."}
{"text":"Was very excited to hear Legends was under new management as I live less than a mile away.  Decided to have dinner on Sunday for the grand re opening weekend.  On the positive, restaurant seems cleaner. Beyond that, restaurant remains subpar. Food seems to be re heated highly processed...not fresh. I asked for water to go with my warm craft beer and it arrived long after my meal.  My order upfront was wrong on three separate occasions. And after a long wait, my final bill  had to be adjusted twice before it was correct.  Never asked but  w aitress said manager wanted to speak with me...instead he walked down the aisle and ignored me. I won't be frequenting this place in the future. Unfortunate,  because I was excited for the change."}
{"text":"I love Legand's bar! It is my favorite place to eat.  We always get great food and service. Even though it is a bar, the TV's aren't over barring, so you can still have a conversation with out yelling while enjoying a meal.  We take our little ones, and they love the cheese balls!"}
{"text":"I went to Legends Bar & Grill with my family, which included my 4 yr. old grandson. Everyone really liked their meal but the food took a long time to come out. That really is my only complaint. Otherwise we all thought the flavor, quantity and presentation of our lunch was really good and we especially appreciated our waitress. She was attentive and so sweet - she brought my grandson 5 candied cherries from the bar instead of the 1 that we asked for (no, we didn't let him eat them all - just 2). We all felt full and happy when we left!"}
{"text":"Decided to give the new owners a chance despite the awful experience we had in April. We were pleasantly surprised. The place is completely redone and looks nice and clean. Lots of tvs for sports fans. The menu isn't bad. Kids options were nice with several side options. Mac and cheese was standard Kraft like but not bad. Wait staff was great. Took our drinks and kids meal right away. Took less than 15 mins to get our food once we ordered. And this time the waiter came by and asked us how our dinner was. I got the pear salad which was lightly dressed and my hubby got a burger. Food was 100x better. With the awful selections in anthem (besides two brother which is awesome but doesn't service dinner since they don't have a liquor license) I have to say this is a decent place to eat and would go back.  I would recommend trying them again if it's been awhile- it's much better!!"}
{"text":"The new staff and ownership is great! Much brighter inside, better food, cleaner, but most importantly it's packed! All the little things are addressed by the staff before you can even ask! Without a doubt would highly recommend it to anyone. Will be back as soon as I can :)"}
{"text":"Girl's Night Out!!  Thursday night Trivia and Music Bingo Night!!  So much fun!  We all had great drinks, Happy Hour and after.  The food was fun, fresh and yummy!  The game hostess AMAZING!  We had to leave early, had movie tickets already!  But, already planning another Thursday Night Visit.  I hear they have Live Music on Friday Nights, when it is NOT summer!!  So excited to head on back, try another menu item and hear some music, play some trivia AND still be able to visit with the group i am with.  Kid Friendly, which is a HUGE bonus!"}
{"text":"Under new management. Stopped here to meet up with some friends for the Cardinals' game. Staff is really friendly and the food came out super fast. I had one of the burgers and we shared an ice cold pitcher of beer. Burger was cooked perfectly. 

Cool mix of families, couples, and single fans. HUGE number of TVs so everyone could easily see the game. Clean place and the patrons were all nice people. 

First time here, but I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Sets new standards of mediocrity.  Food, service, atmosphere, etc middle of the road or slightly below.  Interchangeable with any number of other establishments around the valley."}
{"text":"Only the second time trying it since we moved here 5 years ago. Tried again with new owners and the menu is boring. The kid walking around with the ASU hat is a douche. Probably a good place for a drink, but not for food."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned restaurant.  They make everyone feel like a member of the family.  Love their burgers!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give new ownership a try. Food is pretty meh bar food. Pre-packaged and re-heated. They refused to put on an Ohio State game for my honey... tried to tell us it was over when it was in the second quarter, then 'forgot' then couldn't find the channel..... It's s freakin' sports bar!  Plus you have to walk thru cigarette smoke to get in. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch and for dinner. I've tried many items on the menu.

Veggie burger with roasted peppers and eggplant- delicious

Beef burger with cheese and caramelized onions - delicious

Street Tacos - delicious 

Salads - delicious

Pint of Guinness - best since Ireland and I lived there

Service - friendly and not superficial 

This is not the old Legends, and really deserves its on separate page here on Yelp. This is a quality pub with great service, tasty food and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Legends last night since they have new owners and what a difference.  Place is clean, inviting and the food was good. If you have not been there for a while give it another try."}
{"text":"As a longtime Anthem resident I've actually been here many times, usually a 3 star experience but I must say they've improved. Went there last weekend because my wife & I agreed that the previous visit 6mos earlier \"food was better\" so let's find out if that was a fluke or not.

I ordered wings - hands down best Arizona wings I've had in years. Big, meaty, not over or under cooked, plenty of sauce, bluecheese & veggies good and didn't annoyingly charge me extra for extra bluecheese. I asked \"are these the normal wings\" and server (who ranked a solid A- for my 6-person family) replied yes. Wasn't too busy so they gave us a large out of the way table that was perfect for my semi-obnoxious 1 yr old and little 6-year old girls. They got crayons, good kids meals, good portions including drink, they liked the atmosphere so all was good w/kids. Bar atmosphere is kind of lively with TV's everywhere so it was fun.

My wife's grilled chicken sandwich was nothing to write home about - but then again when is a chicken sandwich anything spectacular? Fries were crispy. She wanted a craft beer but before spending 4 bucks on that asked for a shot or small taster and server had no problem with that. She didn't like it and ordered something else, but that shows good service and willingness to please customer with no boloney.

Bottom line is that after 8pm it's a bar but we weren't rushed out, it wasnt too rowdy and we were made to feel welcome. It's been two trips now where food was really quite good and we were all nodding in agreement that we shall return soon."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but members of my party we complaining that the drinks were watered down.. the service was average but then again it was really slow.."}
{"text":"Not good.  Service sucked and food was mediocre at best.  Has a local bar atmosphere so if you are a regular they might pay attention to you otherwise good luck."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, went there a few weeks ago and had wonderful service and food, today was unacceptable......"}
{"text":"Just finished an absolutely delicious bleu bacon burger with a really different cole slaw made with kale.  To die for dinner and half the price of Tru Burger with ten times the flavor...$2.00 happy hour beer!"}
{"text":"Will NEVER come back!

The service was so horrible we didn't even stay for our meal.

We had a party of 12 (With 4 kids) and we made reservations earlier that day and they GAVE AWAY OUR RESERVATION!!! They said the group \"jokingly\" said they were us when the hostess asked. But we found out that they were conveniently related to the bartender. I hope that family gave a good tip because they certainly missed out. (We also never got our drink order or menus when they did finally \"fit\" us in... 

Outside of the awful service... This restaurant was very hot, dirty and smelly inside. 

Can't say anything about the food, but if it's anything like the service or appearance I'm sure it would have been horrible!"}
{"text":"Frustrated. Went here for dinner at 545 and was told half the place is \"reserved for a fight tonight\" and \"there won't be any seats for 2 within a decent amount of time\". I look over and see two young kids sitting at a table drinking water and ask, what about that table, and hostess says oh that's the owners kids and they want to sit there....really are they paying customers?? This is the Second really bad experience I've had trying to go eat there. Last time 5 of us  went and the girl told us we had to wait and we had been waiting about 10 minutes and then two of her friends came in and she hugged them and she seated them at a table for 6. Then when I mentioned it she said \"oops sorry\". Guess I will not be eating here any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is still terrible with new ownership. Food cold and tasteless. Unfriendly atmosphere. Save your money and time. Terrible snob attitudes!! Never will go there again or recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the server was good, but I left with stomach upset akin to food poisoning. Will try again and update if it improves."}
{"text":"Sports atmosphere: 3
Service: 3
Food: 2
An adequate sports bar if you need one. Food is typical frozen & nothing special. Nice place but i Won't bother going back."}
{"text":"We walked in not knowing what to expect, from the time we opened the door we were  made to feel like family. The entire staff was very pleasant and quick with friendly banter. The waiter answered all our crazy food questions and brought everything to the table quickly and with a smile. 

The beer was described so well, I ordered it, though I normally don't like beer. The French dip I ordered was delicious, hot, fresh, and fell apart in my mouth.  My friends raved about their burgers and sliders 'excellent' was muttered more than once. 

I would come back here in a heart beat."}
{"text":"We just had lunch at Legends - now under new management.  My husband had a 
great Philly Steak Sandwich and fries and I had a delicious Cobb Salad.  The service
was efficient and friendly and the place looks bright and cheerful with the new decor.
The new manager is upbeat and welcomes new ideas and feedback.  We will certainly be back and hope others in Anthem will give the NEW LEGENDS a fair chance!!!"}
{"text":"I like the food, and have for years.  Really good burger, and I'm a big critic when it comes to burgers.

I will agree with the other post, that service leaves somehting to be desired."}
{"text":"Legends has the best calamari I've tried in the Phoenix area. Paired with a soy-free ranch and pesto dip, it's to die for. Sliders are flavorful, salads are tossed and dressed just right, and the artichoke spinach dip is hot, creamy, and delicious. Service is cheery and quick, drinks are readily refilled, and the ambience is low lit and low key, except when the bartender has his playlist cranked up really loud. Across the street is Anthem Park, where you can walk off your meal or steal a kiss."}
{"text":"Legends is my preferred bar in Anthem. It is great during football season as they probably have the best TV setup in the area. The food is pretty good with the exception of a couple things being overpriced. They have some great people that work there though. I recommend this bar if you're in the Anthem area."}
{"text":"Not a good night for the food here at the local bar and grill and I'm pretty sure that's the way it always goes at this local's only joint. If you don't know the waitress name, you don't get your game turned on any television's. The waitress was always polite and the bar manager, Jesse, was very nice as she comped all our food, but that is what someone is expected to do after a bad meal.

No Hostess at stand
The special of Pecan Crusted chicken was served with cold, flavorless pecan sauce on top.
The mashed potatoes were ice cold
The Beer (bud light Bottle) was luke warm.
The busboy left a shot of whiskey right above our heads and then picked it up and chugged it 20 minutes later. It was left over from another table of people. 
This is like the 4th crappy sports bar in Anthem.
Being crowded is not an excuse for bad food.
Burger was clearly a frozen patty.

Unless you live in Anthem and even then, skip this place, but then again if you know the cook, maybe your food will be the right temperature?"}
{"text":"Good: Service 
Better:  Sports Bar Atmosphere
Best:  Owners & Southwest Chicken Soup
Better than Best:  Ranch Dressing

This place is BY FAR the best place to take my autistic son to eat anywhere.  He is treated warmly by all the owners and staff.  All the bartenders past and present are great.

Food is always hot when it comes out and I get refills usually before I need them."}
{"text":"The only game in town. An Anthem original. Family owned. Cold Beer, etc. Lots of tvs. Good place to watch the game or hit up after softball."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. They remodeled a couple years ago and it looks great in here. The food is good too, with a good selection on the menu. My wife likes their salads and their burgers are fantastic. They could use some more options on tap, but that is the only downside. I will certainly come back. Only negative is the bathrooms. They have been pretty dirty the few times we have been in."}
{"text":"Good food although it took a while. Loved the special pasta!  Kids got a little anxious.  Place wasn't busy, but we were a table of 8 and people who arrived after us got their food first. I don't care that the guests after us didn't have a lot for kitchen to prepare, but it should be first come first serve"}
{"text":"If you're in Anthem, this is your sports bar. The food is great - I have had the spinach and artichoke dip and the only problem I had was there wasn't enough dip to keep up with the chips!

The French onion soup is really nice, and I believe made in house. Also, the buffalo chicken sandwich is outrageous!...as long as you ask for an extra side of buffalo sauce, if you need it.

Nice atmosphere, the service leaves some to be desired. Make your food and bev decisions quickly, because when the servers come by, you may not be able to flag them down for a while. For a sports bar, the food really does it here."}
{"text":"Went to Legends to watch a particular game on Big 10 Network because we had been there before. Had our choice of seats because the place was almost empty on a Saturday afternoon. After a few minutes I knew why. Absolutely terrible service. Waitress forgot our order, beer and diet coke. Really tough. Never saw her again. Left money on the table after finishing my beer and left. Been there twice now, first and last."}
{"text":"Love this place. Highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich. My wife always gets a salad and it's always loaded and amazing. The pretzel appetizer rocks!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service waited 15 minutes and they seem to only had one person working and the were just attending the bar. We ended up walking out and will probably never go back."}
{"text":"FYI: As of tonight this restaurant is under new managemtn so disregard all the reviews as everything about this menu has changed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff are amazing, food is great if you like bar food. Fried pickles and fried cheese---yum! The only thing I'm not a fan of is the Mac n cheese burger. You can't use penne and call it macaroni- get some Mac and fry it then put it on the burger =delish. All around my favorite spot in Anthem"}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner last week at Legends Bar & Grill in Anthem after hearing great word-of-mouth recommendations after its re-opening with new owners.  I have to say those recommendations were spot on.  There were plenty of TVs for my husband and son to keep track of all of the important games.  The staff was very accommodating in making sure we were able to see the games we wanted.  And, the food was delicious.  I had a mushroom burger (added bleu cheese crumbles) that was fantastic!  It was juicy, flavorful, and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient.  My family and I look forward to another visit in the near future."}
{"text":"Food was okay for bar food, and my french dip was good.  The service, however, was horrible.  I had lunch on a weekend with a buddy and I only noticed one server for the entire place (not counting the bartender).  It took us about 45 minutes from when we ordered to when we got our food and the place wasn't busy.  It also took a long time to order another beer and our check.  I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Better, but not great...

My wife and I went there about a year ago and it was absolutely terrible. Service was a joke, restaurant was dirty and the food! Mine was OK, but my wife ordered one of the Burgers. The cook forgot to remove the plastic wrap before cooking it and it was served to us that way, melted plastic and all.

We heard that they were \"under new management\" so we thought we would give it another go for lunch. The new owners didn't do anything to renovate before opening so it looks exactly the same. We stood in the doorway for about five minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were there. When we did finally get sat down we had to wait another ten minutes for drinks and to have our order taken. There were only three other tables sat when we went in mind you. Our waitress was not very attentive and was more interested in watching TV.

I ordered the Blackened Chicken Sandwich. It was decent, had good flavor and was cooked well but the lettuce was soggy and the tomato's were not fresh. My wife ordered the BBQ Bacon Burger and the bread was soggy. We ordered Mac 'n Cheese for my daughter, it was cheap Kraft stuff (not even the deluxe), not home made.

Bottom line, the \"new\" owners had the opportunity to really turn this place around and missed the mark, terribly. It's doubtful we will return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and great service, I've never ate anything here that I didn't like!  One of our favorite date night restaurants. The chocolate chip cookie dough chimi is to die for!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Legends bar and grill .. 
I had my dog with me and could not find anyone to serve me at the Mexican resturant next door ..
So I decided to leave and go to this fine establishment. I believe they make the best margarita in all of Anthem .. 
  Thank you bartender \" chris\" for exceptional service and very tasty food"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a whim after I searched Yelp for a restaurant in the area. It was a little tricky to find since it's tucked away in a large parking lot but I am glad we found it!!

I, of course, started with a Bloody Mary which I was pleasantly surprised with. They actually had quite a bit of garnishes which seems to be hard to find in Arizona. It was decent, nothing out of the ordinary but it was a good solid Bloody Mary.

I also ordered the French dip and onion rings. This is where everything took a turn...it was the best french dip I have had in a long time. The meat was so nice and tender and the flavor was perfection. The au jus was excellent, not too salty! The onion rings were also pretty good however I am not the biggest fan of the large onion rings but that is more preference than anything.

The atmosphere was great, they have great little booths that are kind of secluded which I love. They had enough TVs to watch the games and the service was really great.

I will definitely be back because that French dip...I dream about it"}
{"text":"Our family has been eating here for about 10 years.  Why?  Mainly because it's somewhat of the only gig in town.  Rookies was not exciting at all.  So, when we want a burger or sandwich it's close by.  This being the drawing virtue. Both establishments  have the notion that because they are in Anthem, that there is magic fairy dust that makes them special.  For Legends, inconsistency has been the constant.  None of the good servers that use to be there are there any longer.  People mainly go in to hit the bar, it's kind of the local hook up place to some extent.  Most of the time their music sucks also.  

So most of the comments are correct.  Sometimes it's good, other times not.  Service isn't that exciting if you haven't just come in off the golf course or are there to buy drinks. We will be glad when we get a few more places up in the North Valley.  I think half the people that show up do so like us.  Out of habit."}
{"text":"Warm beer, cold hamburger and old stale buns. Save your money. A real big disappointment"}
{"text":"Food was eatable, service was terrible. Music on really loud.  Won't return."}
{"text":"My family and I love this neighborhood bar and grill. Monday is cheap burger night.. and they have Guinness on tap!"}
{"text":"An accident on the highway brought us here to wait it out. Food was great, blackened chicken salad was a nice healthy option and my friends nachos and pulled pork sandwich were bomb...plus out waitress gabby was friendly and attentive. The pooch was able to sit with us on the patio and they even brought him water in a cute bowl."}
{"text":"Had lunch there a few times... Good food but the service was very slow!! Will go back because of the good food, hopefully the service will improve!!"}
{"text":"Everything that comes out of their kitchen is wonderful.  We have never been disappointed.  Their food is better than their drinks.  If you have never eaten there, you need to give them a try.  Mmmmm chicken pesto.ese"}
{"text":"We have been there a couple of times, and yesterday just didn't do me any favors to entice me to return.  The main problem (which my Mom has also comment on) is the overuse of Salt.  I ordered a Caprese salad and usually it is difficult to mess that up.  The presentation was really nice, but when I bit into it I had an overwhelming taste in my mouth of just salt.  I couldn't even taste the rest of my meal as that took my taste buds off the chart.  I didn't say anything, but if salt is necessary to that extreme then the chef is obviously not tasting their food.  My Mom is salt sensitive and there are health risks in going to the extreme with the salt.  I may try it again someday but not in the near future."}
{"text":"Went back after new ownership.  I was disappointed. Hamburger and fries were cold. Service was not any different than before which was average. I had hopes it would have improved but no."}
{"text":"Service has been good. Food is good. Unbelievable that they allow smoking on rhe patio. It's terrible when you're with a large group and the people at the table next to you are smoking. And tge establishment has provided them an ash tray. GROSS!!"}
{"text":"Was staying at the Hampton In off Anthem Way and the 1-17 for a wedding and needed a bar and grill situation to entertain relatives, catch college football games, and get a bite to eat. The area offers very little in the way of restaurants, so Legends it was.

Ambiance:
-sports bar, with table, booth and bar seating. 
-lots of big screen TVs with multiple games. Had college games on Saturday.
-seem to be fans of ISU (Iowa State), owners likely from midwest
-place was nearly empty on a Saturday afternoon, I think there was one patron at the bar.

Service:
-our waitress was polite and friendly
-bartender does not seem familiar with standards for alcoholic beverages (see below)

Food:
-my fiance and I split a full chicken quesadilla ($8.99). One of the best quesadillas I've had. The waitress suggested we use the Nobody Beats Mitch (you know, the furniture/mattress superstore) hot sauce. It was SUPER HOT! and tasty. Just beware of the repercussions the next day. 
-my aunt also ordered a quesadilla ($8.99) and my uncle ordered the loaded fries ($7.99). Overall, they seemed happy with their food, and with the large portion sizes, we had enough to take back to the hotel.

Drinks:
-our waitress was unaware of what liquors they had, originally a Black Velvet and Diet Coke was ordered, she came back and let us know they didn't carry BV.
-the bartender (and possibly the server) had no idea how drinks were to be served/garnished. My uncle ordered a long island iced tea, was not served in appropriate glassware and also was missing the standard lemon. I ordered a margarita, was also served in the wrong glassware and was missing the lime.

The food was great, the prices were on point, but the lack of patronage and the apparent inexperience of the bartender/server really killed the expected sports bar and grill vibe."}
{"text":"Leah is amazing!! The food is extremely good and so fresh totally great experience! This is our new staple.."}
{"text":"Amazing! The onion rings were hand made and the reuben sandwich was so good... says the hubby. I ordered street tacos and I'm coming back for taco Tuesday. And the caprese salad is so yummy. U have to try it. We will be back. We didnt expect it to be so good at a bar lol"}
{"text":"This is the best sports bar in Anthem with a close second being the cross-town Rosatis Pizzaria.  The wait staff is usually very good and the TVs abound!"}
{"text":"Solid little sports bar tucked into a strip mall that serves cold beverages with warm and friendly service. From appetizers to their mains, you really can't go wrong with their bar food. Good selection of drafts and can make whatever mixer you choose.

There are plenty of games on multiple TV's so you can catch it all. Multi tiered seating decks help to break up the floor space, which seems to help with the noise level. 

Servers are always perfectly timed to offer you another round, or to remove your plate.

All sports bars should be this good, but sadly, they aren't."}
{"text":"What a huge turn around with the new ownership.  The restaurant was bright, CLEAN, and inviting.  Food was great.  Had the Cobb Salad which was very appealing to the eye, and more importantly very tasty.  The salad was perfectly dressed and all of the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The staff was very friendly and competent as well.  This was a place we stayed away from for more than 12 years because of previous issues.  However, I so glad we gave the new owners a chance.  I invite all fellow Anthem residents to give Legends a chance."}
{"text":"New ownership! Great happy hour drink and daily food specials.  Kids eat free Monday nights!  Street tacos in Tuesday.  $.49 wings on Wednesday!   Boneless wings are great!  Service has been great!"}
{"text":"OK, I'm not ordinarily a fan of sports bars; they're loud, I'm not interested in watching football nonstop, and usually the food is mediocre. But we're renovating the kitchen and needed to eat - husband was simply hungry, and I was looking for basic low carb food that wouldn't totally blow my diet. We both found what we were looking for. 

For a sports bar, it's amazingly cozy; all the booths enclose you in privacy, with adequate, but not overpowering lighting. 

I was hoping for adequate - and found really good food; good enough that I'll be back regularly from here on in. We have tried several burgers, with the mushroom burger being our favorite so far. I went for the grilled salmon entree, which comes with grilled asparagus and broccoli (a perfect  low-carb meal, perfect for anyone watching what they eat, frankly) and it was so good that I've eaten it three times in a row. I just can't get enough of it!


The wine list is pretty good for a sports bar; I'm not a beer drinker so can't comment on that, but the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and will bend over backwards to accommodate your wishes. 


I only moved to the area from the San Francisco area in July, apparently while Legends was undergoing new management and renovations, so I can't compare it to the old Legends, but so far this is one of only three restaurants in Anthem that I am willing to recommend to my out-of-town friends. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"2 of us went there for a light dinner.  We used a discount coupon that covered $20 in food and drinks.  Our bill came to slightly less than $20 so our waitress told us that we had to order something else to bring the bill over  $20.  She suggested desserts.  We got a small slice of cheese cake, which was not very special and brought it the bill up to near $ 26.  In general, the food was ok, but this last trick to increase the bill made it certain that we would not return."}
{"text":"Ever since legends' new owners changed the menu for the better, I love the food. They kept the stuff they should have (best  ranch in town) and fixed the items that needed improvement! The burgers are absolutely the best around and the boneless wings are great too!! Their staff is awesome too, a personal favorite server of mine is Kayla. She's friendly and great at her job. Hands down the greatest place in anthem for a bite and a beer."}
{"text":"This place has improved much after the renovation. Some of the best happy hour in anthem. The lunch staff is a bit slow. We came in to order wings with friends this week on a Wednesday it took us over an hour from start to finish. Seemed like only one waitress for the whole patio area. Also don't sit outside unless you like inhaling cigarette smoke. There is no smoking within certain feet of Phoenix area restaurants yet people continue to smoke on the edge of the patio and management doesn't seem too concerned."}
{"text":"First and last time here. 

First, it was dirty and dingy inside.  I felt dirty just sitting down.
Next, we had a vulgar couple of people sitting at a table a few feet away.  They were talking so loudly and about such inappropriate things while I was sitting with my 2 young daughters clearly hearing everything they were saying.

The food was so bad that my daughters ate one bite of cheeseburger and one bite of grilled cheese, and said they were done and would eat again when they got home.

I wish the waitress would have noticed and asked, but oh well. 

We won't ever be back."}
{"text":"First of all, I must compliment Chris, the bartender and waiter.  He is one of the best ...... cordial, attentive and very caring.  Service was outstanding and he is really a nice guy.  The food was very tasty and served in a timely manner.  Yes, it is a sports bar but the atmosphere is energetic and fun.  Give it a try!

I was hoping that maybe you can make your onion rings thinner .. too hard to eat.  Also, the Philly is bland .... delete the provolone and add sharp cheddar .... don't be skimpy!!  Thanks."}
{"text":"This place used to be really great. When the owners were working... The food was great and the Bloody Mary's were the best on the planet! ... But on Saturday... sadly sadly sadly disappointed in the service, food and drinks. Questioning on whether to ever come back."}
{"text":"Typical prepared, previously frozen bar food. There's absolutely NOTHING about this place that's even close to above average. I think the lack of options in Anthem is the sole reason this place is open. Keep up the Mediocre work guys. Mediocre food. Mediocre service. Mediocre decor and atmosphere. If the new owners are striving for 2 out of 5 stars.... They're  nailing it!!"}
{"text":"New to the city and our first visit at you establishment was positive. Food was tasty, family friendly, and not to loud. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Chris takes great care of us every time. Their sandwiches, wings and desserts are phenomenal, their nachos are yummy, and they've always got fantastic drink deals. Also, poker each Wednesday night is always a good time."}
