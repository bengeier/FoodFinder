{"text":"Sushi Rock is back. But will it be like an extra season of Futurama, or a reboot of Roseanne?  This time, they're partnered with an Italian restaurant, which I have not tried the Italian menu, so I won't comment on it.  The sushi is good, but a bit expensive at $10/roll. If you go when it's half off, not a bad deal.  The times I've been there, they were dead and I worry they won't be able to stay in business if that's typical. Try them while you can."}
{"text":"The sushi here is really good. The crab salad roll is my favorite. Shrimp, avocado and cucumber inside with crab salad on top. On the Italian side, I love the chicken picatta. If you like lemon, you'll love this!"}
{"text":"Best Italian on Westside.  Rick the chef is fantastic.  Had eggplant parm, chicken wings and sausage and peppers.  Everything was fantastic from ambiance to the server Veronica to the entree, fabulous!"}
{"text":"We ate there while in town. My 7 year old son loves sushi. Sushi was tasty (I've definitely had better). The waitress was nice too. They had green rice for St. Patrick's day which my son thought was fun. However music was blaring and we could hardly hear to haves conversation."}
{"text":"Went with my hubby, both excited to try their sushi.  Was so disappointed.  Mostly rice. So much rice! And not nearly enough sauce to help give it some taste. We will not be going back. Our waiter was great, though. So that's why I am giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Lakewood. Come here at happy hour for best prices: $5 apps, sushi rolls and glasses of wine. We always have amazing service here as well."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is an absolute joke run by a family that condones speaking to their customers like garbage. We were first greeted by a very nice hostess that immediately began to get our table together. We were sat at a nice high top in the back near the bar with a great view of the whole restaurant including the musician. A few minutes after we sat down and had ordered a bottle of wine + an appetizer we were abruptly approached by a woman who did not introduce herself and insisted we must move as a different reservation needed our table. After I asked if it was possible to find a different table for the 6 top I was given the answer, \"Um no, it's easier to find a table for two so get up.\" At this time the owner, Joe, finally stepped in to let her know we were okay to stay where we had been seated. Already appalled by the way that was handled, we decided to stay and stick the rest of the evening out. We then found out that the woman speaking to us like scum was a MANAGER named Veronica. Never in my life have I come across a more unprofessional human, let alone someone allowed to be management in a customer service driven industry. The incorrect bottle of wine was brought to our table and our very nice server went back to exchange for the correct one. At this time we heard Veronica say, \"Oh so now they want white wine? Of course they think they can just change their bottle now\", at which time I stated that we had actually ordered white in the first place and it was simply an error. After a snarky response back we were still not brought the correct bottle. I decided it was time to bring the owner over to discuss the issues I was having. Veronica saw me speaking to the owner and proceeded to make a snarky comment under her breath about how I can continue to cry about it. The owner asked what he could do and I stated simply receiving our correct bottle of wine sooner than 30 minutes after ordered would make me happy at this point. When he returned to our table he brought Veronica with him (?) and they proceeded to \"apologize\" by saying I misheard everything and she did not act the way that I was claiming. I replied by noting how unprofessional this was and got the response \"No, YOU are being unprofessional.\" This is laughable as a customer- I am not at work, YOU are at work and it is YOUR job to be professional and cater to a paying customer. The best is yet to come- Veronica is the owner's stepdaughter. As they continued to not only put their hands on me as an attempt to comfort me they continued to tell me how wrong I was for not simply accepting an apology. Yes, you read that correctly, putting their hands physically on myself and my boyfriend. At this time we walked out and I now am writing this in absolute disgust. Clearly the owner condones his employees to speak to his customers this way solely because they are family. That is a sick way to run a business and I cannot wait to see this place go under as I know I am not the first, nor will I be the last, to encounter what is possibly the worst staff in all of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sushi did not smell fresh and they forgot one on my rolls. The seaweed salad was good. I ordered a Woodford reserve manhattan and they served it with low quality ingredients and charged $12! Italian food was passable but nothing that can't be cooked at home. Miso soup was hearty and good. The theme of the dinner was low quality ingredients--even the oil for the bread was low quality oil with basic dry herbs. The problem is that in order to succeed in an area like Lakewood you really have to set yourself apart with Quality and execution and someway of being different. This place tries to be different by having Japanese and Italian food but they don't do either very well, And they don't do anything innovative that would make this concept interesting. Also the waitstaff really doesn't have a good grasp on either the food or the wine."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating that I've been in the restaurant industry for longer than I'd like to admit. From hosting to serving to cooking to management. I have never had a worse experience at a restaurant. The owner, I believe his name is Joe, was drunk and physically pushed me. The bar manager, Veronica, was foul mouthed and behind the bar to make drinks every twenty minutes or so. This increased drink times and guests, including myself and girlfriend, suffered for it.   The wait staff is personable and friendly. Unfortunately they have not been trained well. This resulted in a very slow service. Speaking with my server I learned the turn over is high due to management so everyone is constantly new and no one has been trained longer than a day.   Tickets times, bar and food, were extremely high. We are talking thirty five minutes for an appetizer.   The worst part of the experience was the owner and bar manager. After complaining about the drinks we ordered not coming until we were finished with our entree, we were offered free drinks. I said we were leaving and that it is fine, I just won't be returning. I was then yelled at by Joe and physically pushed while he told me to get out. It's worth mentioning we watched him walk around the restaurant with a glass of wine in his hand for a few hours. The bar manager made sure he had his glass full. He threatened to call the police, to which I said please do. You laid your hands on me I'd love to see where that goes. He calmed down, I paid my bill, I'll never return.  The food was actually good, the sushi and Italian. Just be aware you're going into a volatile environment that's run by questionable people. Be prepared."}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi at best. Staff seemed confused about pricing, selection, and even the time they closed.   There was a large very disruptive group which the staff seemed to find amusing rather than trying to have them be more respectful of other guests.   For the price of the sushi it is definitely not worth going. I'd recommend they either focus on the Italian food or the Sushi, but not try to do both."}
{"text":"We went last night with friends for my love's birthday. The owner came over and chatted..it was awesome. Warm and inviting, great bartender and server. We order the calamari and meatballs for appetizers. Both SUPERB! The sauce was rich and delightful. Then we shared sushi. The pink lady was my favorite, but all was phenomenal. I'm a huge sushi person and this is the first worthwhile sushi I've had after living here 2.5 years. Can not wait to go back! Very thrilled to have the dual concept in our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Best place I've been to ever on this side of town I wish there was something like this on the east side. Great service great food the Ambiance is stellar. Met the owner and enjoyed a glass of bubbly with my date.. so impressed with everything that's all I can say it's a must-have stop."}
{"text":"Great house salad with perfectly cooked salmon.  Sushi shots were excellent. I prefer versus sushi with rice.  Service was attentive.  My wife loved her eggplant parm."}
{"text":"Update: much better experience this time dining in. Our server, Jenny, was full of personality, and she really made the experience fun. We had California roll, fried Brussel sprouts, a glass of wine, and chicken piccata. It was all very good.  This was my first time here since it changed over from Roxu, which really seemed to struggle in this space, though their concept was not that great, and the food followed. I've eaten at Sushi Rock at other CLE locations, so I was a bit surprised that the place is \"two concepts under one roof. The good news was this place is more busy as Sushi Rocks than it ever was at Roxu (but still only one third full). I asked to do a take out order at the reception area and the hostess told me I'd have to do that at the bar. One bartender and a full bar was frustrating, while the hostess didn't seem all that busy. I waited five minutes to place my take out order. After waiting a few minutes another gentleman came up and offered me something to drink and asked if I'd placed an order, which was a nice recovery. Turns out he was the manager. After another 25 minutes, I finally had my take out order and took it home. Upon opening the box, the roll looked small, and I realized they didn't put any crab in (see photo)! Back in the car, back to the restaurant, and another wait. Luckily, the manager made it right by remaking the order and giving me a $30 gift card to get me back. I will chalk this experience up to the transition and figuring it all out and give them another shot and hopefully the stars will align."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!! I've haven't had a dining experience this great in awhile. We went on a Wednesday because they have half off all classic rolls and also run a happy hour special. We also had a Groupon to use as well so we were pretty pumped to try a bunch of food. On the Italian side we ordered the sausage and peppers, calamari, and the meatball. All were excellent but the meatball was by far the best. Perfectly seasoned with three types of meat in it. We then ordered two classic rolls and the Lakewood roll. All made very well and the presentation was awesome. The Lakewood roll is a great choice of you are looking for a new sushi roll to try. Our waitress was Bethany and she was amazing. Super friendly, outgoing, and attentive. She answered all our questions and never left us waiting for anything. We had such a great time here and will be headed back soon."}
{"text":"If I was just reviewing on the hostess and the Italian food we had, I would give this review a 1 Star. The hostess didn't tell anyone in the wait staff we were there table. The chicken Marsala was bland and once we brought it home and added salt and cheese, it was much better. We waited for 10 minutes before the hostess finally told the waitress we were her table, but once Jenny came over we were immediately happy that she was our waitress. She was extremely helpful, friendly and attentive. The sushi was excellent and we will definitely be back for that. We had two larger rolls and want to try others."}
