{"text":"We gave gone here numerous times. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. The pint and a pound are a great value. The prices are reasonable and portions more than adequate. The beer is cold. They have a jam session on wed nights with numerous entertainers playing guitars and singing. The evening is a lot of fun. Highly recommend this restaurant as it is a sleeper.

{"text":"Been twice hoping the service would be better, no such luck. Had to wait then ask the waitress for drinks. 
Food quality is like most other pubs, processed food in a bag that gets nuked. Small patio overlooking the Wal Mart parking lot. Not much of a crowd and not worth any more visits."}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for years as it is right next to the Walmart in Aurora.  I will admit right away, that upon walking in, this place looks like nothing special.  But after having been numerous times, there is always an assortment of different kinds of folks inside.  
I personally found the waitresses to be nice and friendly and the beer is cold.  
After having sampled a couple menu items, the food is not bad at all.  Their burgers are particularly good, and when asked, I was told that they are never frozen and the patties are made by hand.  
I've witnessed numerous patrons coming in for the wings, that actually look massive.  And guess what.. this bar serves breakfast!  Ain't nothing wrong with breakfast and beer.  Oh.. and there are poker tournaments held here.. FREE to enter.  Some serious poker players here. 
I will be honest.. it won't blow your socks off, but won't disappoint either.  Good location if you are coming off the 404.  
I'll be heading back."}
