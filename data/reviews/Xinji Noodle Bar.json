{"text":"The restaurant looked absolutely amazing.  It has an industrial/modern vibe to it.  We waited a little to get seated which we expected considering it is a new place and there are tons of people trying it out as well.  Once we were seated we waited a little bit to get a menu but once we did we were able to order right away.  It took some time to finally get our food which by then we were starving and couldn't wait to eat.  We ordered the vegetarian ramen, the miso ramen, and the spicy korean fried chicken.  The food was not anything amazing.  The ramen tasted like salt and a hint of something else I can't really put a finger on it but it was not appetizing.  It did, however, taste better if you add the siracha into it.  They also offer a chili oil but when it came to the table it looked like it was just gochujang and a random oil (which was not mixed together).  By the end of the night we felt completely duped.  Hopefully these are just new restaurant kinks and will be soon sorted out.  I might try it again once it has a couple months under its wings."}
{"text":"The pork buns were tasty! Miso ramen was delish! Server told us the menu will change up and always have new things to try. Service was super slow because they were busy, but food rocked so will go back sometime."}
{"text":"Xinji is one of the best noodle place in Cleveland, OH area. I love the rice and pork chop dishes, but I could not remember the name. However, the Spicy Miso Ramen is a little bit too salty for my taste. The customer services is okay, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't excellent."}
{"text":"My guy and I went here on a Friday night around 7:30pmish. We were sat right away, and the restaurant was mostly busy. Pretty cool industrial interior. The server took our drink and food order in an appropriate amount of time and before we knew it, our appetizers were out (and they were delicious! ).   Fast forward to 9:10pm, and we had yet to get our ramen. We were told that were was a mishap in the kitchen, and I think our server did a decent job at keeping us posted. Kind of inexcusable, no one should have that long for their entrees. There are clearly operational/kitchen kinks that need to be worked out, because judging on other reviews, this is a reoccurring problem.   Food tasted great, would likely come back here again in the future with the hopes that this issue is worked out...or we'll do take out; because let's face it, Cleveland lacks in the ramen department!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty cool.  We went before the dinner rush and got our food quickly.  The pig head bao was good but the pork bao was pulled pork and just meh.   The ramen was okay, wasn't amazing but wasn't bad either.  Wouldn't mind going back.  Although they were seriously understaffed when we were there on saturday night and we waited for our bill for a long time.  Probably would avoid rush hour."}
{"text":"Stopped at Xinji Noodle around 9 on a very cold Saturday night.  Parked at the medical office across the street.  The place was busy despite the bad weather.  It was a young, trendy crowd typical for Ohio City.    The decor is very clean and minimal.  The exposed brick, spiral ducts and baked enamel metal chairs gives the space a chic industrial feel.  The large bar and open cooking area provide some visual stimulation.  One problem is the front door which upon opening allowed a huge blast of cold air to engulf the dining room.  For starters we had the taro steamed bun and the Korean fried chicken.  The taro bun wasn't very inspiring.  The fried chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, doused in a mildly spicy sauce.  For entrees we had a vege stir  fry noodle bowl and a pork tonkatsu ramen soup.  The vege noodle bowl used ramen noodles and was OK but rather small.  Usually pork tonkatsu is a breaded and fried cutlet but here  it was a slice of lean and tender pork belly.  The broth was tasty and the assortment of bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, corn and nori was well balanced.  The only drawback of the ramen soup bowl was the small almost child sized portion.  In addition to an extensive selection of sake, no hot though, and Asian beers, they offer a variety of Asian flavored mixed drinks."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I've ever had. The pork belly fell apart when I picked it up, that's how tender it was. The spice in the spicy miso ramen was just enough to have a solid kick but not so much that I had to slow down. Affordable sake as well, and suprisingly some craft beer along with Japanese brands. Do yourself a favor and add a soy egg to your bowl - the extra dollar is worth it when you break it open and the soft yolk blends into your broth.  My friends and I also tried some of the happy hour specials; the kimchi balls were crispy, fresh and balanced, and the bao was so good that I probably could've ordered 4 of those for dinner and been pleased.  The only negative I have to say is that the industrial style metal chairs are super uncomfortable and it took a bit of time to get our ramen (but the appetizers were fast). Still, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland and just eating those noodles will make you happy.  Also the service was frequent, friendly, and pleasant."}
{"text":"Amazing place to have noodles. Need to have more places like this in the Land. Great atmosphere, small easy sit down place. Good food, good times"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to go here since they opened and was so excited! When my party walked in the host did not acknowledge us and was just staring at his phone, we had to greet him and it was not busy. The atmosphere was ok but the music choice, we all thought, was off. Like they had on a cheesy 80's standards mix that didn't fit the vibe at all. The outside storefront looks appealing and love their neon sign though.   The miso ramen was just downright awful. I've had ramen all around the country and this was one of the worst. The broth was thick and didn't even taste like miso. Like, there was basically no broth. The noodles in all of our dishes were hard and there was no good spice to the food. The veggies were bland and seemed like they came out of a can? The little slab of pork was mostly fat.  Service was average and food was overpriced for what it was. My party and myself unanimously decided we would definitely never come back. Btw, we all had stomach problems that night.  I have never left a Yelp review for a restaurant but was so disappointed I had to share."}
{"text":"Yay a Ramen place on the west side. I came here after it had only been open for 7 days so I want to give it another go and try more items.   My boyfriend and I were lucky to find a seat at the bar on a Saturday night (it was still busy around 8:30pm). We tried to order a Mexican Coke but they were out (bummer). The beer list wasn't up to date however, being open 7 days at the time they were still getting their bearings. We ordered the Pork Bao and those were delicious. We also ordered the Shoyu Ramen and the Miso Ramen. The Shoyu broth was fantastic but wish you could get something other than chicken. I really enjoyed my Miso Ramen. Next time I'll try the Spicy Ramen.  I chatted with the bartender and she said there are a lot of great ideas on the horizon once they get up and running for awhile. So stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Honestly this place was a huge let down for my friends and me. We came as a big group (party of 9) and all of us were extremely hungry.   Pros: -Taste was decent -Service was friendly and accommodating   Cons: -Long wait time (given we did have a big group) -Restaurant seemed understaffed, was difficult to get waiter's attention at times -Lack of consistency in meals (those of us who ordered the same dish but got different: types of noodles, amounts of meats and broth) -Size and food proportions were NOT good (2-3 pieces of Korean chicken and the smallest bits radish for $9...)"}
{"text":"Stopped there on my way back from a disappointing meal as the new noodlecat in west lake (never going back). I ordered a Vegan Ramen and Pickle Bao Bins.  It was stellar and the best Vegan broth I have ever had.  I live in Florida and eat at two local ramen spots, both of which don't even come close to the quality of this spot.    I'll be back every time I visit Cleveland and plan on making another stop tomorrow."}
{"text":"I did not expect to find the best hot chicken in Cleveland at a noodle bar, but here we are. It was amazing, and if you like spicy food you should definitely seek it out. The other thing of note is the good sake selection, it's great for people who already like sake or to introduce new people to sake."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Happy Hour here is a must with great deals on a variety of menu items along with beer, wine, and unique cocktails. The servers along with the rest of the staff do an amazing job at setting the mood for this upbeat and fun place!"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of this place. Great energy and fun vibe from the moment our party came in.  They were pretty packed so we had to wait a few minutes for a table.  Not a problem though because we just got one of the delicious custom drinks from the bar. I loved the lychee one!  Once seated we received great friendly service and the food was amazing!  I loved my spicy miso ramen and the Kim chi balls were the bomb.  Everyone at our table got a different ramen bowl and all of them equally delicious. The chef even stopped by to say hello and ensure we loved our food. Definitely would go back and suggest to anyone!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Just what Ohio City needed, a good local noodle restaurant. I've been a couple of times, service is great and they're very informative if you have any questions on the menu. And don't judge you for not knowing what certain menu options are  Staff is very friendly. Miso ramen is my go to, make sure to add the poached egg!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to try this place out and was very disappointed. Ordered a Thai tea and it was mediocre and I had to add my own syrup as it came unsweetened. Then I ordered a spicy Miso. Never thought you could go wrong with miso but I was wrong. The broth was too thick and very salty. The spice level was good but the salt overpowered it. The noodle was still hard. Asked the server if it's usually this salty and she said it's made the same way everyday. I usually don't like to waste food but it was too salty for me to take another bite. Server asked if I wanted some regular broth to add in my bowl but I felt like that would've ruined the whole point of ordering it spicy. Needless to say, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"New noodle restaurant that opened up in July of this year. Ambience was great, very spacious building with plenty of seating and high ceilings. I can see lots of possibilities for expansion of the restaurant in the future. I was here to try out the ramen specifically. I ordered the Spicy Miso ramen. Overall the ramen noodles were very tasty, however the serving was small, the soup was salty for my preference, and there was only one piece of pork in my bowl. For the price being paid, I think it merits a larger dish and much larger meat portion. Other than that, I think this restaurant has great potential."}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland for a few days, we saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Definitely worth it! Ramen was super flavorful and the Kimchi Balls were delicious. Prices were super (especially during their happy hour)."}
{"text":"Excellent noodle and tonkatsu. Dumplings and bao were great as well. A welcome addition to the Cleveland restaurant scene as Cleveland has needed a good noodle house for a long time. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner tonight with my husband. Food was amaZing!!!! Sticky buns are great. Spicy dumplings are great.   If the manager is reading this, please please please let your wait staff know to NOT spray the table cleaner all over the place when someone is eating next to the table they are cleaning. This happened twice to us. The smell was SO bad we couldn't finish our food. We noticed the same girl spraying off another table and a guest held their nose. Hopefully you address this issue. I probably won't be returning for a while."}
{"text":"Everything here feels authentic and tastes great. The portions for the rice bowls are nice!"}
{"text":"No clue what people are talking about as far as $16-$17 bowls of soup. All main soup & rice bowl entrees were $8 & $9 during dinner hours on a Tuesday night. These were the regular prices.   I tried steam buns, fried chicken, a corn side & a spicy ramen bowl for dinner, everything my guest & I ordered was excellent. The service was quick, attentive & courteous.   Both us will definitely be back with more friends."}
{"text":"So I've been looking forward to coming to eat at this restaurant for about 3 months.  There is a dearth of decent ramen places in Cleveland and especially in the middle Cleveland area.  I had heard that the person who started this place used to work at Momofuku which is saying a lot.  I missed the a grand opening even though I've been following their Facebook page earnestly.  Probably could be doing a better job advertising this place, though the place was moderately full when The Wife, The Kid and I came tonight.    The place has a modern industrial look to it.  We were seated immediately so I didn't get the chance to look around much.  Our waitress was nice but was still getting a feel for the menu.  I looked for tonkatsu ramen which is the dish that I compare ramen places with.  It is not one of the items on the menu here.    Disappointment.  I was going to order the eel bowl, but then I figured I should order a ramen, since this was a noodle house.  I settled on the Shoyu with chicken.   The Wife got Spicy Miso.  We also ordered the Tenaki chicken appetizer.  And eventually got a pork bao as well.   So the good: the noodles are excellent.  Better than Otani.  I wonder if they are home made.  They taste and look home made.  Nice chew.  My wife liked her spicy Miso- had a nice full flavor and did not lack spice.  Pork belly was excellent.  We loved the fried/smoked? Soy sauce based chicken appetizer.  Really tasty.  Wish there was more of it- three smaller pieces for $7 is a little stingy.  Buuuut it was good enough that next time I'll order two.  The Kid enjoyed the crispy chicken skin.   The bad: Shoyu was underwhelming.  Didn't love the bamboo- it made the whole thing smell of bamboo.  Chicken was plain- pork belly was much better.  The bowls were not particularly large for $12.  There was a tonkatsu upon on the special menu- but it said that it was in a Shoyu soup, so I don't think it was the rich pork broth.  BRING ON THE TONKATSU!!!!  This is a ramen places people!!!  Also they don't have an option to get a second helping of ramen noodles, which is a little strange.  This is a pretty typical option in most ramen places.  I would have paid extra for more of those yummy noodles.  The pork bao was OK.  Should have used pork belly instead of pulled pork.  Meat was a little tough.  I think that they should be a little more descriptive on the menu so you know more specifically what you are getting.    We'll be back buuuut I'd like it might more if they brought in some tonkatsu ramen and allowed noodle refills.  As it is, I'd prefer the prawn mee at PacEast."}
{"text":"Cost does not seem to match expectations. Maybe I was too excited.  The miso ramen itself was average - broth was not spectacular, noodles were okay but not stand out compared to other bowls of ramen I've had all over in other cities. Without outstanding broth and the specific noodle there wasn't anything else to hold it together. Also Not a lot of standard add-ins like pieces of seaweed, fresh herbs, corn etc.   Pretty disappointed to be honest because I really wanted to like their bowls.  Atmosphere, staff behavior, and physical presentation was very nice (brand new place so it is totally up to date) but the food was a little disappointing, especially at the price point."}
{"text":"Food is good, if you get it. Earthworm Jim is the worst bartender/human ever. You'll know him when you see him. Service is lamer than a dead goose. Hopefully you can find one of their 4 noodles if they ever bring them out to you. 10/10 for entitled attitudes but a solid 20/10 for waiting time........  Alright, the food is amazing I feel bad about that review. Eat there, it has what humans crave."}
{"text":"The owners aka husband and wife team have placed their life and soul into their restaurant and really strive to make it the best. We will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Didn't love it at first. Probably because I ordered the wrong dish (eel over rice - great if you LOVE eel... I just like it in small portions). My last few visits have been fantastic though. I always get the steam buns to start, then ramen with soy eggs. Also, they have an awesome happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I was so, so excited for this place to open. I'd been craving both good ramen and Korean fried chicken and was thrilled about having a great new place to get both.  We came here in a larger group (8) about a week after opening, and made sure to call ahead and had a lengthy conversation with the manager to make sure we would have a table ready since we knew they would be busy. When we arrived, they had lost our reservation, and we waited about 30 minutes for a table. Not a big deal, we weren't in any rush.  We were eventually seated and our orders were taken quickly. However it took another hour after we ordered for any of the food to come out. Okay, I get it. New restaurants always have kinks to work out, and it seemed like (bizarrely) there was only one person working the kitchen on this particular Friday evening. If the food was fantastic and well-priced I would still give them a solid four stars.  The food was a little pricey (for Cleveland anyhow). My Korean fried chicken appetizer had -two- pieces of chicken for $9. It was pretty tasty, but come on. I was less bothered by the price of the steam buns ($7 for two), and ramen ($12 plus an extra dollar for an egg) which were still a little more than I would have wanted to pay but I didn't feel like it was completely unreasonable.  The food tasted good overall, no major complaints (though if you have a poached egg on the menu it should be poached, not hard-boiled). Not super remarkable either though, I feel like Otani noodle on the east side has better ramen overall and Dante in Tremont is nearly as good and less expensive to boot (plus egg is always included). However it wasn't until the next morning that my one star review was assured.  SO WHY THE ONE STAR RATING? I mean, even if I liked nothing about the experience, as long as the restaurant doesn't get me sick I'll usually give it at least two. Well, that was NOT the case with Xinji. The next morning, I woke up with severe gastrointestinal distress. After asking around, it turns out that -every one- of the other seven people that ate there with me also got sick! It hurts me to have to rate this new local restaurant with a single star, but not as much as my stomach hurt that morning.  Footnote: The music playing here was the most bizarre, stressful thing I have ever heard. It consisted of a woman screaming over various crashing sound effects (and possibly some saxophone?) and each ... performance was over 30 minutes long. If you went shopping for music designed to make people hurry up and eat so they would leave as quickly as possible, and you found this album of what one friend could describe only as \"post-Björk screamwave\", you would have hit the jackpot."}
{"text":"So, I was invited here for Supper Club and I have to say, the food and service was really great. I'm not a good judge of Ramen, but the food here was really well done. The appetizers, from Kimchi balls to dumplings, were really delightful. The place is very clean, and has a very upscale aesthetic, but it still comes across as a nice place to take a date or just have a lunch or stop over with friends.   One of the difficult things is the parking, which is mostly street, which is okay, as the meters don't stay valid after six pm. The prices are fair, the bar is really decent and I believe that they do \"flights\" of things like sake, but don't quote me there. The staff was very quick and looked after us very well. Over all, a pleasant evening with fine folks!   Over all, a worthwhile place to stop and get your noodle on:)"}
{"text":"Have been very eagerly awaiting the opening. Gave it a few weeks, every new restaurant needs some time to settle in and get the kinks out, right?   Got take out noodles for brunch last Sunday August 27.   Order food at the desk.  No one can explain to me the diff between a poached egg and a shoyu egg. K, whatever. No wifi?  They have wifi but won't give me the password. Btw there's two other tables in the restaurant. But whatever. Food finally arrives (15min) did I mention that there are are only two other two tops in the restaurant?  I get the for home, and the mushroom pancakes is so salty it's completely inedible really sad, that was what I was looking forward to most. Two ramen dishes were ok. I did enjoy the texture of the noodles. Definitely high point. Broth was bland, even the spicy broth. Depth of flavor was lacking.   Ramen at masons creamery is far superior. Looking forward to the next time they."}
{"text":"The kimchi ball I had was tasty--it was a vegetarian version with mozzarella cheese and was fried, with some piquant marinade surrounding the ball. It also comes in chicken and pork varieties.   The ramen noodles in vegetable broth with mushrooms was fair. I thought the broth needed a little kick to it, and added some hot sauce. The noodles were substantial, and firm.   The people here are wonderful. They graciously answered questions I had about the cuisine and origins of the restaurant. I will return."}
{"text":"Okay, I have to update my review one more time! I recently downgraded my review of them from 4 to 3 stars but I'm taking it back and even bumping it up! I had ordered from them on door dash and the order was canceled. I tried calling them several times to order over the phone and never got an answer. HOWEVER, I later received information from them that they are not affiliated with any third party apps which completely explains the doordash incident, and the number I had for them from yelp was incorrect! I since requested yelp to update the number so it should be corrected soon.  So today, I ordered over the phone for pick up (using the correct number). The server picked up the phone right away and was very friendly. My order was correct and even with pick up, it was still amazing. They separated the broth and mix-ins so nothing would get soggy which was much appreciated. The flavor was fantastic as always and the mix-ins were fresh. It's official, I love this place.   Another thing I learned, they use local ingredients and they use the entire animal that they purchase rather than wasting it like most places do. You can see my other reviews but our most recent experiences with this restaurant have been stellar. Please support them!"}
{"text":"Cleveland was in dire need of a ramen spot . Xinji has done an excellent job of filling it .  The best spicy ramen I have tried in cleveland by far . The spicy miso broth was loaded with flavor - fresh ginger , heat , and a good balance with the  salt.  I added an egg to my ramen ... (its not real ramen without it !) . The second item ordered was the Thai iced tea , honestly meh - would not recommend (strong smokey flavor) .    Will be back to try the other ramen ."}
{"text":"So.... this place is AMAZING!!! The ramen is very authentic and the broth is to die for. I've had a few appetizers that were all wonderful, especially the wings. The ONLY downfall is that it is a bit pricy :( Give me that bowl of sweet delicious ramen for $9.00 and I'll eat there twice a day! Sad truth is I can get a larger bowl of the most amazing pho from Superior Pho for right around $9.00. You guys have the BEST ramen... let us get more of it for a price that is easier to digest... PLEASE!  Or add a rewards program?!? Or add noodles to the happy hour menu?!? Overall--so great, I eat there almost weekly!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad this place exists in Cleveland. I just wish I enjoyed the food more. There are tons of vegetarian and vegan options here but the ones we had were just OK. The fried dumplings were more like savory cream filled cannoli. The steamed buns were dry and could've used tofu instead of the starchy vegetable it came with. The vegan Ramen was a great option, and the noodles were delicious, but the broth lacked a real depth of flavor, and the bowl was small. An extra star for the cool interior design."}
{"text":"Love the pho - all of them are great. Have tried several- get that and you won't be disappointed. Fills you up. The wings are also great. Service is top notch- atmosphere is great as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been here twice and the food is great, along with friendly attentive service. It's not your typical more American than Asian cheap eats spot with the giant flaming woks of mystery. This place is very nice. You can bring a date here. They have a bar. Both times I had the spicy broth ramen with a soy egg, and though not extreme, you may sweat a bit. The broth has a deep intense flavor."}
{"text":"The place has potential! Interior is simple and chic. They also have daily specials, which gives customers more options since their menu is short (maybe they'll add more dishes). However, they are a noodle bar so it would make sense that they would specialize with just those dishes in particular. The set price for the dishes are a bit too much in my opinion. So unless you're willing to go out every now and then for a great meal, this wouldn't be your everyday lunch spot. The service was great, but I wish they were a bit more attentive."}
{"text":"Get the bonless korean bbq.. amazing... phenomenal! Spicey sweet  This place is realy fuckin good"}
{"text":"Everything is made from scratch. Kitchen and restrooms are spotless. Loved the soy egg and pickled mushroom in my ramen. Had lunch on a Saturday after glass blowing at Ohio City Glass."}
{"text":"First time at Xinji Noodle Bar! We were really excited that a new ramen place was coming to town and came during opening week. The place was clean with a minimalistic industrial vibe with awesome lamps hanging overhead. It's cool that you can see part of the kitchen depending on which area you get seated at too. The staff was fast. They have paper menus with drinks on one side and various Asian fusion bites like Korean fried chicken, Chinese pork and chicken Baos (mini Chinese bun sandwiches) and Japanese ramen noodle and rice bowls.   For appetizers - we had the chicken bao, pork baos, and Korean fried chicken. We were surprised that 3 appetizer pieces of chicken cost $9. But if it tastes great that's fine...but it just tasted okay. Pork bao was okay. Our friend's wife liked the chicken bao though! So maybe that bao is worth trying for anyone who wants an appetizer.   For ramen we all ordered a different version from the menu. I had the miso ramen and added a soy egg. You can add toppings like roasted pork for $3 extra dollars or a soy egg or poached egg for $1 each on top of the ramen bowl that already costs $12. We agreed across the table that the broth lacks flavor and the meat could be better. We all hate wasting food and I was starving so I finished my bowl. If I could do it over, I'd just skip all the appetizers and the ramen and just order the soy egg on it's own. The waitress came over and asked how my bowl was and I told her it was okay. My bf said he saw she brought it to the attention of the manager and he laughed after discussing the bowl. Not sure what that meant...  If the broth is made more rich, I think we would have liked it more and instead of using pulled pork, using the traditional pork cut might add to the flavor of the ramen too! I thought our bowls would come with naruto, but they didn't. There were paper menus when we were there so maybe there is a changing menu as the owner plays around with flavor more.   Would recommend? In the words of our friend who brought us here \"Meh\". It's a new business so there is room for improvement. No where to go but up !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Xinji on a Tuesday night around 7 pm for dinner.  It wasn't busy, but it wasn't empty either; there was a steady flow of customers.  The service was prompt and friendly.  We each ordered sake (I got the Lychee, on the sweeter end of the spectrum), which was delicious.  Since this was our first visit, we decided to just order a spread and split everything.   We started off with the Korean Fried Chicken (came with a thigh & a leg), which had amazing flavor and spice, and the Crispy Veggie Dumplings, also amazing.  We ordered one of the Kimchi Balls, the one with corn and pork .. it reminded me a lot of Arancini.  This was my least favorite of everything we ordered (just a little dry for my taste).  Then we got the Spicy Miso Ramen, which blew our minds.  The broth was so rich and flavorful, and had a spice that built up the more you ate. The noodles were done just right.  The presentation of everything we ordered was very well done.  We will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Being a ramen addict, I have had ramen in multiple cities like Chicago, NYC and LA, so you can guess that I was excited to try one of Cleveland's top rated ramen spots on Yelp. I ordered the spicy miso and was expecting a reasonable portion for the $12 price tag, but surprisingly, it was a dinky bowl with minimal, mediocre broth. The noodles were subpar, artificial and chewy. As a comparison, for $2 more in Chicago, you can get a well-crafted, authentic ~20 oz bowl of ramen after waiting 3+ hours at a top-tier ramen spot. The bowls here are probably 12-16 oz which isn't enough for someone hungry to be satisfied, and definitely isn't worth the price tag. I was very disappointed in the portion size.   Furthermore, the service was slow and it seemed like the staff were focusing more on the guests at the bar than the guests on the periphery. I had to request my water to be filled two times and waited on my check for almost 10 minutes.   To further taint my experience here, after heading back to my hotel, I noticed that my urine was a highlighter yellow. It appears that another guest experienced this as well. As she correctly noted, this is usually due to a type of vitamin B added to color the noodles yellow. This explains the subpar noodles I noted.  However, I will give it to Xinji that the presentation of the dish was spot on and the ambience was pleasant. Overall, I was quite disappointed in my experience and would not recommend the ramen. You can get better portion sizes and a better experience for $12 elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loved my first visit at this charming restaurant.   Server was warm and friendly.  Decor was cool and inviting. . Super clean.. I'm so glad they're open for lunch a few days a week.  I had the spicy miso and loved it.. The korean pork ball was good, not great.. I like my food hot and it was served lukewarm. . I will be back next weekend!"}
{"text":"Got takeout on a Friday night. Korean fried chicken was the highlight. Rice bowl and noodle bowls that we got were both pretty bland and the portions seemed small. The atmosphere at the restaurant seemed nice, the brief time I was there picking up our order. The reality is though that the food wasn't tasty enough to get me to go back for a dine in experience."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this noodle bar since the day it opened! Cleveland has a lack of these kinds of restaurants and they are always a fan-favorite for me. As an all around Asian cuisine lover, I find it difficult to really mess up the food in such a way that I do not like it lol So this four star review is a hopeful one that next time the service will be better, and our orders will be correct.   For a busy Friday evening, there was no wait time for our party of three, which was really nice considering we expected there to at least be no parking or no open tables. We were surprised when we parked in front of the front door and got seated right away!  I ordered the Shoyu, which honestly, had some pretty amazing ramen noodles. Some of the best I've ever had out. The broth isn't as flavorful as it could have been, since the soy didn't really hit you with a BANG, but I could appreciate the subtlety anyway.   Sadly, even with food that I can find a home-like fondness in, a waitress that forgot to place our orders, brought the wrong things out (although she did fix the problem in a timely manner!), and kind of hesitated to bring us refills, it cannot be a five star kind of meal for me.   As far as food goes, it is a must-try if you enjoy ramen or Shio, the GF rice noodle option, and it is definitely something unique in Cleveland that the rest of the city is lacking in! Here is to a better experience next time!"}
{"text":"Very good food, and enjoyed the atmosphere. I went when they were fairly new, so I think they can only improve."}
{"text":"The noodle dishes are great, but their signature 'kimchi balls' are just fried cheese-filled rice bites, the kind of snack you'd expect from TGIFridays -- there's literally no kimchi, and it doesn't have the faintest flavor of kimchi either. Asked the waiter what was up with that; he proclaimed, 'Uh, i think it's baked in there somewhere,' and walked away, which was funny. Decent food, just don't go for the kimchi balls, as they do not truly exist."}
{"text":"The concept of places like this rock my socks. I am not a huge soup fan in general, but I love a good solid broth with veggies in it. My good pal-ette (she is not made of wood....or at least I do not think?) suggested this for a late dinner tonight. Being GF I was hopeful they would have a few items I could eat and low and behold they did! I wanted to fall in love with this place so badly. It is like that hopeful POF date that doesn't quite hit the mark, but gave it their all and is worthy of a second chance.  First, this place has a really nice feel to it. Simple, clean, industrial and very modern with organic touches. As you can see from my photos it has some very beautiful colors, lots of wood, exposed ceilings? and HVAC with a nice open concept. The bar here has a decent amount of seating and the flow of the restaurant is open and not crowded.   Simple items that can all fit on one page of a menu can either be a good thing or a disaster. I think for this place, it is somewhere in the center....   The hostess seated us at this cute little 4 top in the center of the place. Samantha (our waitress) was very sweet, but I don't think she has been serving very long. Well intentioned and kind,but lacked attentiveness and accuracy.   The adorable mason jar mugs of cucumber water made me smile. I LOVE THIS TOUCH! I started off with the Fried Chicken Bao - GF style. If I am being honest, this dish was just too simple for me. Let me start off with the fact I got roughly 2 ounces of meat between the two. That isn't very much meat for the $7 price tag. It would be more tolerable if they loaded it with veggies, but that was lacking as well. Pretty simply put it was boiled chicken, cabbage, pickles and some sriracha sauce all on a corn tortilla. This dish didn't have enough chutzpa for me, but it did taste good.   For the main spotlight, I ordered the Shio Noodle Bowl - GF Style with a side of pork belly and bean sprouts. The bowl came out LOADED with rice noodles. Sweet mother of monkey milk were there a ton of them! The broth in this had a fantastic flavor. I could have drank an entire bowl of just broth. In fact, there just wasn't enough of it comparitively. I loved the mushrooms, choy and naruto inside of this bowl as well. Sadly, when my bowl first came to me, it didn't include the sides of pork belly and bean sprouts I ordered. Samantha forgot to place the order, but once I brought it up she quickly fixed it and out they came. The pork belly was super tender and flavorful. The bean sprouts were a little odd. I was expecting fresh and crisp sprouts but it appears these were slightly cooked? Overall, this dish was a solid 4 stars. Next time I will ask for 1/4 of the noodles and a bowl of broth!  I will be back and try things a little differently. Not a bad first experience and I hope the next one will be even better!"}
{"text":"We had drinks, appetizers, main dish, and dessert.  All very good.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward for this place to open for a while now and it was more than expected! It is an great mix of different Asian signature dishes. We got a few different dishes to share Korean Chicken, dumplings, bao, and ramen. Everything was on point and make sure to get the hot sauces!  Let's just say I have already gone back for seconds and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Finally, very good ramen in Cleveland. I had Shoyu with poached egg. Great service and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Cute spot. Spacious and bright decor. It was my first time here and the waitress was happy to provide recommendations on her favorites in most popular items on the menu to try. I tried one of the flavored sake's hesitantly, as I haven't really enjoyed sake in the past. It was like a really sweet wine and it complemented the food items very well. We tried each of the 3 varieties of the delicious deep fried balls. (I forget what their authentic name was.). I also got one of the noodle bowls with pork and added a poached egg which was recommended by the waitress. It was so delicious and I had enough left over for lunch the next day. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some other menu items. We also got these amazing little ice cream balls with a cherry sauce and sprinkling of oatmeal. Was the perfect end to the meal!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice and inviting so I thought I give it a try. Got the spicy ramen. It was really small bowl with only one thin piece of BBQ pork. The broth was not as flavorful. The noodle was  good, soft and chewy. The noodle is on an expensive size considering the size is really small."}
{"text":"Went here last night for supper club and I enjoyed it! There were five of us and we easily split a bunch of appetizers then each got our own bowl of ramen.   *On special Vietnamese sausage dumplings in a creamy corn sauce $8 - you get five in an order and I thought they were really good.  *Crispy veggie dumpling $7 - nice if you're looking for something fried, but other than that not memorable. Again, five in an order.  *On special spicy mango pork bao $7 - tasty and lots of meat! Two in an order so perfect for sharing.  *On special kimchi balls $10 -  three in an order and you can pick a couple different varieties. Good, but they all seemed to taste the same. Reminded me of a large risotto ball.  *Spicy miso ramen $12 (plus $1 for soy egg add on) - large bowl of soup with dense eggy noodles, fatty slice of pork, corn, bean sprouts instead of mushrooms, a soy soft boiled egg, and this spicy chili pepper broth that had my mouth on fire. It was good, I just struggled a bit with it. Everyone at the table actually got the same thing and it seemed like everyone enjoyed it. Has potential to make you sweat and make your nose run though!   Some more details: street parking available. I think it is nice to see these once dilapidated buildings get a refreshing makeover. Along the same street you have Platform Brewery and Herb & Twine. Atmosphere inside is simple industrial but nice, however the lighting gets pretty dim in the evening so perfect spot if you want to look better to your date. Low lighting + alcohol = instant boost in attractiveness.   Service. So our server technically did well - she did not neglect us, kept the water flowing, continuously cleared the table, separated the checks appropriately, but I would not describe her as a pleasant person. I'd say her personality towards our group was more that of a well seasoned server who had died inside over the years. No smile, no friendliness, not mean, but you could almost imagine she was hoping for your death when you asked her to switch out your water because there was something floating in the bottom of it.   Overall our group had a really good time eating tasty food and chatting about all things. I can definitely see myself picking up a to-go order of soup this winter (just maybe not the spicy one again, I am weak). I suggest you give them a visit and experience Xinji for yourself!"}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff! A little sad that the pork steam buns were pulled pork instead of pork belly, and I was given the wrong ramen (which the bartender was willing to give me chili sauce to fix), and they charge for eggs like others have mentioned... but they don't mention it's a cold hard boiled egg.    All in all it tasted good and we hope they'll work out some of these kinks. Leaving review hoping they get visibility."}
{"text":"I'm glad Xinji is in town. I'm of the opinion that you  can't have enough ramen competition. That being said, I have equal praise and criticism for this place.  First, the soup bases are delicious and flavorful.  I've had the Shoyu, Miso, and tried my friend's Vegetarian soup. They have tremendous flavor. The noodles are hand pulled, tasty, and have perfect texture. The broth and noodles form a solid base. Their meat options, the roast pork in particular are perfectly cooked and properly seasoned.  Now, I think the serving size is small and at $12 (for meat options), I'd like a little more substance or bring down the price. I do not like how many of their add-ons cost extra and are pricy. $3 (on top of a $12 bowl) for extra protein seems excessive and bean sprouts shouldn't cost $1.  Their Bao (buns) are also tasty, but the ones we had were a bit dry (the fried chicken). Again, the flavor was nice, but it was under dressed. I asked the kitchen for a sauce to use and was given a kimchi aioli (or sorts) and it was incredible on our Bao. Again, $7 seems pricy for what you get, which are two petite buns.  Lastly, the staff here is really nice. They know the menu very well, are attentive to customers, and very warm. I like the modern look of the place. It's sleek, but still warm and comfortable. The co-owners are on the floor checking in on customers and asking for feedback, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Xinji and finally made it there at about 8pm on a weeknight.  Found parking on the street nearby and got in no problem.  Xinji is two storefronts joined together with a bar on one side and an open kitchen in the back.  The restaurant is cool looking with plenty of exposed brick walls, industrial accents and just enough style to make it all work.  The tables are simple and the chairs are a bit too simple, they could be more comfortable.  The menu is simple, with limited options so I ended up getting the vegetarian ramen with a soy egg added to it.  The bowl came out in about 10 minutes; I was a bit surprised that the soup wasn't hotter coming to the table, it was a best lukewarm.  The noodles were good, with a rough texture and decent flavor.  The broth was ok, although a bit lighter then I would have liked; if it had more flavor, spices or body it would have made the ramen much better.   The vegetables were good, with only the mushrooms having any intense flavor.  I did add some of the hot sauce that helped spice up the dish, but at this price I was expecting more.  Service was ok, my server did have an issue understanding that while I do not eat meat or foul, that didn't mean that I only wanted items that were vegan.    Xinji is a cool spot and a welcome addition to the Cleveland dining scene.   The menu could be improved with a fish or seafood option since I found the vegetarian ramen to be nothing special.  I would guess that the meat and chicken based broths add some needed umami to the ramen that I was missing."}
{"text":"Solid five stars. Excellent beer and sake selection. My wife and I split the pork dumplings and they were sensational, great spicy sauce very moist and very flavorful. I went off menu and created my own noodle bowl and they were happy to oblige and just charged me for the closest menu item, very fair. My wife had an excellent bowl off the menu. Flavors are all great and freshness is definitely apparent.  The space is new and clean but in an old building. Worth the trip from the 'burbs."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING about this spot is done right!! The food is fantastic... The service is outstanding... The vibe in this place is so laid back and welcoming! I'm truly in love with this spot right now and it's a weekly stop for me!    BEST NOODLES IN CLEVELAND!!!! Hands down!!"}
{"text":"I've been craving spicy miso udon ever since my first/last visit! I loved going to Noodle Cat, so if you loved that place too, Xinji is not a trade off at all! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is on-point. Prices are good, food is awesome and their M-F 5:00-6:30pm Happy Hour offers killer app and drink prices. The kimchi balls are SO GOOD and the fried chicken bao are even better. Love this place."}
{"text":"Tried the spicy miso with tofu and it was awesome. Tofu was well cooked and flavorful as well. I will definitely drop by again"}
{"text":"What a unique noodle spot. Since winter here in Cleveland just seems to linger we were wanting to try a new noodle spot. I'd heard some rave reviews from friends and decided it was my time to give it a shot.  When walking in the atmosphere was very inviting, super chill, and loved the interior decor etc.  We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server, sorry forget the name, was over quickly to explain the menu, drinks, and answer any questions we had. My husband ordered a beer, myself a glass of wine, and apple juice for my daughter. After reading others reviews of the kimchi ball I forced my husband to order it for himself. The drinks were out timely, as was the kimchi ball, and my daughters dinner (chicken nuggets and a side of white rice ) came out first. Which I always appreciate. My husband ordered the miso ramen, as is on the menu. I ordered the Shio ramen with an addition of a poached egg. Within the first few bites I was in heaven. I asked our server if they had Siracha and he recommend something similar that they make in house, it was seriously BOMB! My husband was pleased with his meal also, he typically can be difficult to please/rave about new things.  I would highly recommend giving xinji a try, we intend to come back and keep trying new things off the menu!!"}
{"text":"This is not a rendition of a quick concert but a fully realized eloquent symphony of flavors and exquisite preparation when it comes to the miso ramen bowls. The best noodles in Cleveland. The broth is otherworldly, with it's subtle complexity and smooth velvet finish, this place is a must for everyone."}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about finding a hidden gem!!! It has only been a week since Xinji has opened but somehow they don't have any reviews! The style and layout of this place are on point for Ohio City. Everything in the restaurant is modern/industrial and all the furniture is brand new and fits perfectly. They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of the place. On to the food! I ordered the Spicy Miso + a soy egg. Flavor explosion!!!!!! It was SO good. It came out in a large bowl and the smell of spices radiated. The spice level was perfect for me but I love hot food. I'd say be careful if you aren't THAT into hot stuff. I was shocked at how much pork they actually included in the bowl. Two very large pieces.  Everything was super fresh. It was slightly different from what I'd typically think of noodle dish, but in a good way if that makes sense?  The service was great and the noodles came out in less than 6 minutes!  I wish they opened a little earlier for some lunch options but that's just me being stubborn. This might be my new local go to!"}
{"text":"I was craving ramen and so we got ramen.   We were coming from out of town and I was debating between this place or another place. This place won because I love soy eggs!   The dumplings in chili oil was really good. I like how the oil was really flavorful, maybe they combined it with a little touch of stock.   The boneless Korean fried chicken was really tasty and delicious fresh, not the best I have ever had but really yummy. I love the cucumber salad they serve it with, nice acidity.   Their ramen was good. Not great. The noodles were cooked perfectly for me, nice chew to it but not super chewy. Their pork belly was oh my gosh tender but still had a slight, very slightly chew to it. It still melted in your mouth. The portion was perfect. The soy egg was too marinated for my liking, a little too salty.   Ask for a side of hot oil and stuff! They have this habanero ghost pepper one that is not really spicy but adds a beautiful smokiness to the ramen. Best with pork!  Staff and restaurant were beautiful. Street parking is a pain. There is a bunch of free parking in the neighborhoods if you don't mind a four minute walk or so!"}
{"text":"Gave Xinji a try this evening. Be warned if you have a restaurant.com coupon they DO NOT accept them. The manager gives this excuse of having \"no knowledge\" of ever submitting or having anything to do with restaurant.com. I just find it baffling how a business can just be put randomly on a website like that without any of the management knowing? Don't you have to approve this before it being submitted and have a legal agreement of some sort?   So I would assume that the manager could have at least given us the $15 discount as the bill was $51 as a good faith to surprised customers. It was frustrating. Instead he legitimately didn't seem to even remotely care.   As a newer business I think that as a manager  you should be in some way accomodating or even apologize and offer some sort of discount in a way to show that you mean well and also would enjoy a returned visit and satisfied customers.  The food itself was decent. The spicy pork dumplings were the highlight. The actual ramen bowls were good but it wasn't the best I've had. I think there are better places in Cleveland that offer similar menus with better quality.   All in all I'm giving this place 2 stars because like I said the food wasn't awful. I enjoyed my sake and dumplings but I couldn't get the taste out of my mouth of the experience I had with service.  So I won't be going back either.  Good luck Xinji."}
{"text":"Food excellent, bai appetizers were good. Go with the noodle bowls for an entree. My friend had the vegetarian one and it was excellent. I had the chicken rice bowl and it was fair. Chairs are metal and small, I wanted a more comfortable chair to linger."}
{"text":"Xinji Noodle Bar was a surprising delight! I came here as part of Yelp's supper club excited to find a ramen shop in Cleveland close to where I lived. I've scoured ramen shops around the world (including Japan) and most extensively in Chicago. What I found in Xinji noodle bar is a ramen restaurant that stacks up in the top quartile of ramen shops. While I will not count it as the best ramen shop, it definitely is a solid contender on the world stage of ramen shops.   I'll start with the sides. Between attendees at the supper club, we got several versions of dumplings, special kimchi balls, and an order of the mango pork bao. Overall, these were pretty good and I can somewhat agree that the prices may be slightly high for what you get, but as they were still fairly good, I'll give them good marks here.  + Dumplings - delicious and well presented + Kimchi balls - a little kitschy, something I probably wouldn't order again, but fairly good + Pork bao - probably the most overpriced item, but still quite good  Then to the main event... the Ramen, I got the spicy miso. I'll start with the noodles. Their noodles are actually quite good. With a slight wave in shape and a bit irregular in width (not uniform throughout), these were some of the more unique noodles I've seen, but still a good chew and bite. It also held onto the soup flavor well, which is something I always look for in a ramen noodle.  + The broth was flavorful and actually reasonably spicy (unlike many other places that just have a hint of spice). While it wasn't a mind blowing broth, it was clearly quite good.   + The chasu pork that came with it was actually very good as well, although it was a bit large and could have been cut into slightly more manageable pieces.   + The soy egg was the typical golden egg, while it was supposedly soaked in soy sauce, it didn't add too much outside of the typical golden egg.  Service was fair. We got our food in a reasonable amount of time, but service wasn't overly friendly or engaging, especially as we came with a group that included people who didn't eat ramen very often.   Bottom line, this is a solid ramen shop, especially for a city without a huge Japanese restaurant scene. Mainly come for the ramen as it's what they should be known for and order an appetizer if you're in the mood, but they aren't \"must haves\" on the menu. You'll be happy you stopped in."}
{"text":"8:00pm Saturday night - 86 rice and mushrooms.... 8:30pm - 86 veggie?!?!?!  let's start with \"everybody has a bad night\".  When it comes to kitchen preparedness I just don't think you should run out of rice and veggies at 8 but whatever....  Food expediting gets a bit slow when they get busy and there is no warmer so food isn't at the ideal temp. Doesn't help that the expediter moves like molasses in winter .   Spiced pork mango bao - lick your lips good. 2 in an order. My fat ass could eat 5  Spicy pork miso soup, add egg and sprout and hot oil - hot damn! So good...coming back for seconds asap. MUST add egg. Vegetable soup , add sprout - also very good. Wife was busy eating mine though.   Four and a half stars on food Two stars for operations  Some small tweaks in the kitchen and management and these folks will be a staple for Cleveland...definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"Anyone in the greater Cleveland area knows that the struggle is real to find good ramen. Noodles are life... so why is it so hard to find them in our beloved city? Enter Xinji. We ordered the spicy ramen and a few pork buns. The noodles actually had texture and taste to them, and the broth was really filling. I needed a giant doggy bag. Don't forget to add an egg on top. It's worth it! I was pleasantly surprised.  As for the vibe, as other's have pointed out-- its industrial minimal. The chairs aren't ergonomic (this is something I wish restaurants in CLE would get on board with :/), so it did kind of hurt my back after a while. You also may end up at a community table, so be ready for that (I don't care about that, but I know some people do). Overall, the vibe is cool and it feels like an authentic addition to this neighborhood. There's plenty of free street parking, so don't rule Xinji out!  We came on a weekday early night and didn't see our server much at all. We tended to ask for everything at once because we didn't know when he'd be back. However, I totally recognize that they might still have kinks to work out with their service. When I come back in the future, hopefully that will be worked out!"}
{"text":"What a great experience, all around!  My dude and I stopped in on a Friday night on our way home. We pass it all the time and kept saying we were going to stop for dinner one night. It took us a couple of months to stop but I'm so so glad we did!  We grab a seat at the bar and the bartender instantly helped us.We ordered beers, a couple kimchi balls, a spicy miso and the \"KFC\" to share.   So let me just start out by saying the spicy miso was great. Full of flavor, the meat was juicy and tender and the garnish was perfect. All around a great dish, and large enough to be a shareable portion, definitely if you get something else. The kimchi balls were also packed with flavor and totally worth the $.   Now, the Korean Fried Chicken...also known as the \"KFC\" is where the money is. WOW, so messy, spicy, full of flavor, and the chicken is so juicy and tender. We have already decided to go back soon JUST to get the \"KFC.\"   The help was great, the ambiance is chill, the food was spectacular and it was easily accessible. This place easily gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"An Asian fusion restaurant offering the best ramen in Cleveland you'll find, with decent, but slightly overpriced, sides.  Xinji is a new restaurant that fills Cleveland's lack of decent ramen. The establishment has unique offerings of different Asian dishes inspired by a variety of different countries, garnished with a modern American style.  Walking inside, the restaurant gives off a modern vibe, with its brick wall, an environment with hustle and bustle, and selection of unique furniture and furnishing. Our waitress was to the point and quick.  We had spicy pork dumplings, which were boiled dumplings in hot sauce, similar to traditional Sichuan Spicy wontons, but without the normal heat or flavor that Sichuan roasted chili oil entails. The wrap was a bit too chewy for my preference, and the meat tasted slightly overcooked. The spicy sauce didn't leave much of an impression, but was overall decent. Adding to the dish, was the unique addition of cabbage, mushroom, and pickled cucumber.  Their ramen broth are all derived from chicken, steering away from the more commonly seen pork broth offered at other locations. The broth offers a cleaner, less fatty finish that other ramen lovers may be used to. I ordered the shio (salt) ramen, which is a lighter taste compared to the shoyu and miso broths, that tend to be darker in flavor.  Chicken is hard to get right- the shio ramen was served with cuts of chicken which were surprisingly tender, given the difficulty in cooking the meat. The broth was the best ramen broth offered in Cleveland, and was very flavorful, with hint of creaminess. Overall, I was happy to taste a broth that actually tasted like ramen broth, compared to what other \"ramen\" locations offer. The noodles also had a good chew. I ordered a soy egg with my dish (egg with soy sauce), and it complemented the overall dish well in flavor and texture.  I do admittedly miss the usually creamy, rich broth that tonkotsu ramen offers. Ultimately, for my personal taste, Xinji's ramen is good, but did not leave me with a future craving or lust, and I found myself somewhat bored of the dish halfway.  Overall, I am happy to see a new restaurant offering ramen. Xinji Noodle Bar definitely stands as the best ramen restaurant so far in the Cleveland area, and provides unique options for Asian fusion and ramen with chicken broth. This is the place to be if you are seeking to fulfill some of that ramen craving, as long as you aren't looking for the more creamy, fatty broths (Notably, they do offer pork belly with their miso ramen). The restaurant's sides are slightly pricey, given that it didn't blow our minds, so we likely will skip them at our next go around, but they are certainly worth trying for those curious. As the restaurant is new, I do look forward to see what more they have to offer in quality for their sides to match their current price."}
{"text":"Great for a fun dinner! Service was great and food!! All I could say maybe some music should be played just for background. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for an exemplary ramen spot for years, finally Cleveland has one. I've been to Xinji probably ~9 times and I've only had exceptional experiences every time. The staff have a great knowledge of the dishes and the amount of work that goes into them. They are extremely active on Instagram and are always posting new ideas for customers to see ahead of time. Always accommodating, always exceptional - this is a must go to location for everyone.  Spicy miso and Korean hot wings are mainstays, but I have yet to have anything less than exceptional.  Honestly - the people who have left negative reviews don't know anything about ramen."}
{"text":"The Kimchi balls and the Spicy Miso ramen were amazing!!! Definitely will come here again. I have been searching for good Ramen for awhile. Kitchen was fast. Also got the Korean fried chicken....was okay. Awkward piece of chicken but nice and crispy. The bar was a bit slow. Our appetizers came out before out drinks and the drinks came in waves. Two drinks then another two drinks. Overall great time. Loved the food.  Definitely add the eggs to the ramen!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent time here last night. Good service, great persimmon cocktail and excellent food. Korean fried chicken rocked it out of the house. The kimchi balls where very good and the spicy Miso was my favorite ramen bowl!  Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Good bao buns. Mediocre ramen at best. Portions are small for price. Broth is rather bland and not very exciting. Instead of slicing the pork belly meticulously into thin slices, it comes out as one large fat slice which at first makes you think you are getting more bang for your buck but in honesty is just lazy on the kitchens behalf as it does not make eating the ramen easier nor is it aesthetically pleasing. Poor judgement on that part.   I might possibly come back in the future but will not be trying the ramen again. I appreciate a place like this opening in the neighborhood and it helps pave way for more cool places to open up but I've had ramen elsewhere that has tasted better. Still, xinji is a solid and viable option for your ramen fix if you're in Cleveland and around the area. They don't make it bad here but it isn't good either if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Finally Cleveland has a good ramen restaurant!!! We ordered the crispy veggie dumplings , Korean fried chicken and shoyu ramen. I am taking off 1 star because while good, I have had better Korean fried chicken. But the ramen was spot on! Yummy homemade noodles, a perfectly cooked soy egg , juicy thin slices of chicken and sweet and crispy bamboo shoots. I am excited to go back and try some of the different ramen. Service was a tad slow, but the dishes were so obviously each made individually, that it is forgiven!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We've been there countless times by now - to the point where we they know us.  Spent many nearly 20 years in Chicago and happy to finally have a good ramen place in Cleveland.  Love the location - close to Platform and Forest City  Shufflboard - and the food is great.  Definitely try the kimchi balls, miso ramen (spicy or regular) and the fried chicken buns.  If I had ONE complaint...i wish they were open for lunch on Saturday and longer/full menu on Sunday.  Highly recommend.  Likely the best ramen in Cleveland."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Asian food, scratch that, if you enjoy consuming out of this world food, you need to come here now. Prices are reasonable for the quality. Service was good and the atmosphere was comfortable. My wife and I ordered two bao (pork & chicken), miso ramen and shio ramen. The ingredients were super fresh and the flavors worked perfectly together. This is definitely going to become a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"One of the better noodle bars I have been to. Probably the nicest one in the area as well. The food was great, and the portion sizes were perfect. They have a decent size menu with a fair variety of options. The serving staff below par, but they might have been because she was fairly busy. Oh ya.....good luck parking!"}
{"text":"xinji is such a great addition the area!! it also seems to be not too well known, which is great for people who don't want to wait forever for a table, which is everyone.   my fiancé and I have been dying to try this place out but moved from downtown to gates mills so it's quite a (well worth it) hike. we got all of the kimichi balls, pork and chicken bao and the spicy pork dumplings to start. all absolutely divine. I cannot believe the reviews saying that the bao are undersized. that is absolutely NOT the case. i think the bao is comparable to one of the yummiest bao restaurants we've been to, Baoburg, when we lived in NYC. to drink, my fiancé got Miss O and I got the raspberry sake. omg, delicious! for our entrees, I got the shoyu ramen and my fiancé got the fried chicken. again, what's with the reviews saying it's small? this is japanese fusion food, not an asian buffet. while I loved the ramen, I will say there was not enough chicken and the broth was rather tasteless unless doused with chili oil, but still IONS better than garbage noodlecat and otani noodle.   we also took my parents here last sunday after the flea for brunch and they LOVED it. we got the vegan & pork jeon (korean pancakes) and they were scrumptious. my dad is not exactly an \"out of the box\" type of eater and he adored this place. him and my fiancé got the pork chop as their entree and I got the spicy miso ramen and my mom got he shoyu ramen. the spicy miso ramen was absolutely delicious and super super flavorful. it's spicy without being sweat inducing and I even added their hot sauce and chili oil for an extra kick. the ramen noodles themselves have the perfect amount of chew also. it's worth mentioning that our service both times was fantastic.   the bathrooms are extremely clean which is always a plus. I love the open concept kitchen as well. the only complaints and reason for 4 stars is that they can't legally serve alcohol during sunday brunch (huge bummer), they should absolutely add some bao to the brunch menu and the disposable napkin dispensers on the table do not cut it when you're eating noodles. cloth napkins would be much more suitable. all in all, this is obviously the best and most authentic ramen in cleveland (which I know is not saying much) but it's really really delicious and filling a much needed ramen void here!"}
{"text":"Delish! Cle needed a ramen bar and this place delivers. Tasty with nice chewy noodles and great pork belly. Hope they go back to the late night hours."}
{"text":"I live about 5 minutes walking from platform so I was pumped when this place finally opened. My boyfriend and I wandered in late on a Wednesday night and had amazing spicy pork dumplings, miso noodle bowls and a 30 minute conversation with the head chef and possibly Cleveland's most interesting man. Food was amazing, especially the farm to table aspect, which is definitely something Cleveland needs to start embracing because that, my friends, was some good stuff"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Xinji and won't be my last. The atmosphere is modern but warm, and parking is primarily street parking which isn't a problem located down the road from W. 25th. The kimchi balls are excellent and a great deal for happy hour ($2 each or 3 for $5). The beverage I ordered was nice for a $5 special, but would have gotten a hot sake if there wasn't happy hour. The ramen was excellent. I ordered the chef's special, shrimp/pork wonton ramen (which I'll try an order of wontons next time because I enjoyed so well). Broth was hearty but light, noodles were prepared perfectly, but would have enjoyed more protein. Service was a bit inattentive for a mild happy hour crowd. I look forward to trying Xinji again."}
{"text":"The ramen changes every times I come there. First time was rich, spicy and flavorful. Second time was alright the spiciness lower down. Then the third time it was completely watered down and all I tasted was saltiness and super plaint. I had ramen all over the states but this is just disappointing."}
{"text":"I love ramen and couldn't wait for this place to open.  Since opening I've been here twice in a few weeks, once on opening day and once a few weeks later.  First let me say the food is great, I had pork ramen on the first visit and thought the broth was actually too rich.  But I do have gripes with other areas.  First, the service.  On opening day our server was great but the general service was slow, I'm fine with this, it was opening day.  On the most recent visit the server was bad and the service was also bad.  The order was taken wrong, not omitting something requested and the server took our bowls to another table first who was in the process of paying their bill.  I also wanted some hot sauce seeing the table next to me had hot sauce.  Upon asking the server I watched him look for other bottles in the back and not finding any brought me some chili paste instead.  I ended up asking the table next door for their hot sauce.  The servers also don't come around enough or check on the table.    Secondly, and maybe I'm to observant but the bowls and Asian spoons don't work for ramen or together at all.  The bowls are too small for ramen and you can't easily access the noodles on the bottom or move stuff around in your bowl.  I like to move my bowl contents around and choose what bite to take next.  Also the spoons are too big for the bowls, they are very nice, but  as being big spoons they have a built in part of the handle to catch on the bowl so your spoon doesn't fall into the bowl, but the bowls are so small there is no way this big spoon can fall in.  It just doesn't work together.  So the food is very good, I encourage you try it out.  I will be back but only for take out at this point."}
{"text":"To be honest, didn't want to come back here after my first time eating here due to small portions (compared to other ramen places) and also not getting my water refilled. Broth wasn't that flavorful - I got the spicy miso. Didn't opt for appetizers since the general consensus online was small appetizers portions.   Went home, and saw a change in urine color. Thought it was me but my boyfriend's did too. Did some googling and apparently there is riboflavin in the bowl to help give the noodles a yellow color?! In all the ramen bowls I've eaten, never had I seen this. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Best place to get ramen in Cleveland. Chef came from Momocho, and he definitely knows what he's doing! Great drink list. We tried the trio of kimchi balls, all very delicious and crispy on the outside. Flavorful but not overdone. We also had a spicy miso and a shoyu ramen, both with a poached egg. Noodles are quality, they taste home made and the broth is delish. Usually I don't like pork in ramen because it's boiled to the point of being tough and chewy, but the chicken and pork were fall-apart-tender and flavorful. The service was fantastic and our server even packaged up our leftover ramen for us to take home. We will definitely be back... often! I only wish that takeout was available too."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise! Thank you Yelp for the recommendation. The decor, staff and atmosphere were pleasant, comfortable and very inviting. The food was terrific. The raman noodles were fresh and delicious ."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 early on a Sunday afternoon. We all got the spicy miso ramen (not that many ramen/broth options), had a few appetizers to share. The Korean fried chicken was very tasty, spicy and not too sweet, crispy/crunchy coating. Dumplings were yummy too, very flavorful and in a spicy sauce. The pork bao was not very impressive though. I thought the appetizers had quite small serving sizes, considering the price. The spicy miso ramen was very good. The broth was very flavorful. Noodles seemed to be fresh/handmade and were great. The pork was very tender. Came with corn/veggies. Unfortunately no egg. I would come again for just the spicy miso ramen and nothing else."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon, our favorite sandwich shop was closed, and we were in Ohio City. Hmmm....let's try that new ramen place, he said- so we walked in.  It's a small, contemporary restaurant, with a nice decor. We were seated right away and they brought us a brunch menu. I was a tad disappointed that the Korean fried chicken was not on the brunch menu (which I had a craving for and wanted to try), but instead, along with their ramen, they offered HK style french toast and another type of french toast (a little random, but hey it works).  I ordered the pork belly ramen and he ordered the fried pork chop (hoping it was more like a tonkatsu). The dishes came out quick, which was much appreciated.   My overall review of the ramen: - Broth was a tad too salty for my taste. I tend to like more richer pork based broths, so I didn't care for the broth. - The noodles were good though- nice and chewy.  - The pork belly... was seasoned with more like steak seasoning? I think it would have been much better if it was just the normal cha siu that normally comes with ramen.  - The rest of the add-ins were alright. Could have done a bit more with the veggies, rather than just corn... maybe some nice mushrooms in it would have been nice too.  His pork chop came out- and it was not the tonkatsu we were hoping for. It was more like an americanized Chinese sweet and sour dish with fried slices of pork. Not really what we were expecting, but it was okay.  I think overall, the food is okay here, just not what we were expecting. Perhaps it could be advertised more as an Asian fusion restaurant, rather than a noodle bar?"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We tried several appetizers and got the spicy soup with a poached egg. The noodles were a soft chewy texture that was a very appealing texture. The heat in the soup was perfect for me. It hit you but didn't linger.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the service. I felt almost as if I were putting them out by being there. The atmosphere was very nice and inviting. It is modern and clean.    Parking can be tricky. Note: don't try to walk from the west side market.  I would definitely return for another bowl of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Ramen is good, I suggest getting extra broth. 1 star lost because the last time the broth itself was VERY under seasoned. It simply didn't have the same flavor it did the previous 2 times.  If you are debating between the normal pork ramen and the spicy option, just get normal and ask for chili paste on the side. Its clear to anyone who has ever been a cook that they simply add the chili paste themselves to the spicy version. I will definitely be back, the noodles are on point, apps are good to."}
{"text":"Finally a worthwhile bowl of ramen in cleveland--we certainly waited long enough. I had the spicy miso and enjoyed it thoroughly. Nice tender pork, good bite on noodles, rich broth, great spice level. Tried some other apps that were good in a middle of the road way, the spicy dumplings probably being the best of them. Had a nice sake as well. Really clean and well kept. My server (i think the manager actually) was excellent, although the others were a little spacey.  Definitely be back, I'm looking at you bao."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The steam buns we had were great. However the ramen was not the best. I thought the broth needed much more flavor and the veggies that should have been in there were lacking."}
{"text":"Don't be lame and go to Noodle Cat- Xinji is where it's at! The menu is mainly ramen, and the kimchi balls are a great choice during happy hour. The Shoyu ramen is my fave, with vegetables, a few slices of chicken, and springy noodles in a dark and salty broth. The kimchi balls remind me more of arancini (rice balls) than anything else, and all of them are deliciously crunchy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Korean Fried Chicken, DOPE; Spicy Dumplings, SUPER DOPE; Shoyu Noodles, DOPE; Rice Dishes, SUPER DOPE; Bao Dishes, LOOK DOPE.  Great job on this place, from the interior build-out to the menu execution (portions are spot-on).    Will be a new go-to.  (ALSO, went opening night, service was poor.  Went two weeks later, service has been fixed and is great)."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen spot we've found in Cleveland. Hangs with our favorites in San Francisco and NYC. What really separates Xinji is how fresh and local the ingredients are, as well as how pleasantly light, yet flavorful the ramen broth is. The chicken appetizer, taro bao, and eel rice bowl were also terrific."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. Really good hot wings and Kim chi balls. Probably the best ramen in Cleveland... definitely can't compare to Columbus which has a lot better options. Its a little over priced if not for happy hour."}
{"text":"Not bad. That's probably the most honest thing I can say about Xinji. Other than the selection of sake which was great, everything else was just average. The ramen bowl I had was decent, but based on other reviews I was expecting to be blown out of the water. Being the best ramen in Cleveland doesn't necessarily mean it's really good, it's just the best of what's in the area. The bao was better than the ramen, I will say that. Service was, meh. The waitress had the personality of a wet noodle - no pun intended. She was efficient enough, but good luck getting more than a one word answer or anything other than an indifferent attitude out of her.   Xinji is good enough, but I probably won't be back unless dragged by a friend."}
{"text":"I had very high expectation for this place and I truly hoped it would be a success as Cleveland has been lacking such a noodle bar. Given the fact that the place was just opened last week it has some room for improvement. My bf and I had the pork baos and they were really good and both of us liked them! The unagi rice I had was good as well (but obviously it's the same unagi/eel you can get from anywhere such as Pacific East). The Shio Ramen was kind of mediocre - the chicken broth soup was very light, tasted like the chicken broth soup can (which could be bought from Park to Shop downtown) with 10 times the water and maybe a few drops of sesame oil (as we all know the Ramen noodle soup is supposed to be very rich, boiled with a real piece of chicken fresh or a real piece of pig bone for a few hours for every spice to be blended with each other, typical Asian cooking). So I guess maybe we need to try something else on the menu? Something that could only be cooked in the restaurant, something that we couldn't easily duplicate at a home kitchen. But again as it's a new place and the owner might be experimenting the current menu, I believe it would be better in the future with a wider variety of choices. Will definitely give this place a second chance to see if things change. Hope for the best!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate here was in the summer when they first opened up. I remember having a decent experience, albeit slightly disappointed in the ramen. I decided to give it another chance in hopes of seeing improvement.  Just wanna say that Xinji has an industrial look that I'm obsessed with. The brick walls, geometric light fixtures and colorful blue chairs are all aesthetically pleasing and I appreciate the effort that they put into the look and feel of the restaurant. Water is even served with cucumber slices in cute mason jars.  Now on to the food. The fried asparagus appetizer was average at best. The Korean fried chicken however was delicious and had the perfect amount of spice and crispiness. It was also beautifully plated.   For my entree I decided on one of their specials, the wonton ramen. What I liked was the thick curly noodles, the bamboo shoots, and the taste of the wontons. What I didn't like was the bland broth and how small the ramen portion was. The broth needed something extra in it, maybe adding chili oil would've made it better. For $12, I expected a bigger bowl and more than 3 wontons, but I understand that this is a higher-end ramen shop which equals higher prices.   So would I come back? Yes, because they have different specials every month that consist of interesting dishes and unique takes on ramen. However, I don't think I will ever have Xinji ramen cravings so Otani is still the winner for me."}
{"text":"Mmm...great new ramen place in Ohio City! My girlfriend and I went here with a small group for supper club and we all enjoyed it!  We ordered a variety of apps to share with the group, but unfortunately we JUST missed Happy Hour!  The kimchi ball appetizers were pretty good, but they didn't pack the flavor punch I was expecting when I think of kimchi. They were more like arancini balls (fried risotto) than kimchi balls since it was mostly rice inside.  The dumplings, although small and bit-sized, were pretty tasty! The pork baos were the best I've had in Cleveland!  They definitely load 'em up with plenty of meat.  For entrees, each of us ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was delicious! The noodles had a nice, chewy texture, the pork belly was super tender, and the broth was a good medium spicy...Very flavorful and just the right portion size!   Service was pretty good, but the waitress could've been more personable. A smile here and there makes a difference.    The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated and clean.  The dim lighting sets the mood for a great date night spot. There's plenty of seats at the bar and they have a full liquor license to boot. On a side note, the bathrooms were really nice too!  I'm look forward to coming back for another bowl of ramen as the weather gets colder. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food was very flavorful and fresh. The wings were sooooooo spicy but yummy. The dumplings were not your typical dumplings- very crispy. The noodled were so yummy too. Can't wait to come here again."}
