{"text":"Graffiti's is a great little bar in Kensington.  I enjoy their Saturday afternoon shows, with the windows open it is a great people watching spot and passer-byers stop by the window to check out what is going on.  I have also seen a few nighttime shows here and it is tons of fun.  The crowd and bar staff is friendly and I have only ever had good times there.  I have eaten there once, a Saturday afternoon with out of town guests.  Two of use ordered the portobello mushroom burger and the waiter then proceeded to go across the street to buy the mushrooms, now that is fresh food!!"}
{"text":"The perfect cozy bar in Kensington Market with great live music almost all of the time. One of Toronto's hidden gems."}
{"text":"This is such a cool spot in the Kensington mkt area. There was live music playing and it was so cool that we went and hung out at the bar just for the awesome vibe. It's a tight space but its a lot of fun!!"}
{"text":"There are several faces to Grafitti's. Performaces by artists like Julian Fauth who went on to win a Juno to Death Metal to Country and back again  Then there is the people watching and of course this is some of the local flavour of Kensington. Just  a great place to stop and have a break.

Most importantly the Black Metal Brunch moved here from a bar down the street called Planet Kensington. Black Metal Brunch has a facebook page where you can get the Sunday menu. This brunch has seen many favourable reviews over the past several years. It remains consistently good. Simply put the \"Eggs Benny\" is the real deal. Many restaurants in Toronto charge much much more and deliver ho hum stuff but Linda taught me how to make a good hollandaise sauce. The other menu items are always worth trying. For the less adventurous you can also get bacon and eggs. Oh and did I mention that the price is the best I have seen?"}
{"text":"Great place to listen to live, indie bands and get a REALLY GOOD mixed drink. While most bars serve blah rye and gingerale, at Graffitis it just tastes so much better - maybe because he uses real alcohol. My brother gave this place a lower score but he's an idiot. Go and see for yourself. The owner especially loves out of towners from Burlington."}
{"text":"A wonderful venue for musical adventures over beer.  You can always peek from the street, as the back of the stage is at the window.  The intimate setting is good for softer acoustic shows on quieter evenings.  On a loud day outside, there better be heavy metal inside or you won't hear much.

Unless you're a local literati-hyped artsy type who doesn't mind the John Cage / Marcel Duchamp sound fusion of inner and outer worlds.

Mostly contemporary western culture sounds.  The place next door hosts Rastafarian gatherings and they all live in harmony."}
{"text":"Graffiti's is the anti-brunch place. No egg white omlettes, no mimosa's, no poached eggs, no folks dressed in their sunday best for a leisurely meal. 

Graffiti's has what they call their 'black metal brunch' every sunday from 11-3 or 5ish. Music is heavy metal to the T which is good for us downtrodden and sleepyeyed folks on sundays. But the food is good here, fresh cut fries interesting brunch dishes like latkes, philly cheesesteaks or whatever the cook feels like putting out that day. And the quality of the ingredients is excellent must come from being directly in Kensignton market I suppose. They also make pretty good ceasar's here."}
{"text":"My friends and I were so humiliated... Four of us last night were looking for a place for a bite to eat and some drinks, and after reading all the great reviews of Graffiti's, we decided that would be our destination. It was around 12 a.m., there was live music drawing us in from outside.. seemed great!

Very small place but seemed lovely and intimate. Two guys playing live music, sounded great. My friends and I stayed in the corner by the door while one of scouted around to see if there was any room for us to sit or if their kitchen was still open (no on both counts, which was fine). Since it's winter, my one friend thought she could quickly check on her phone what was nearby while we were warm. The musician deemed us unwelcome there and, while, singing and performing, proceeded to walk over to us and open the door to show us out. We were so embarrassed, and laughter from inside, as we were the butt of a joke, followed us out. I've never felt so unwelcome. Was the complete opposite spirit of Kensington which has always been friendly and warm."}
{"text":"Went back this weekend for the fabulous brunch. 

How I love this place! I have increased my overall rating because I have so much love for the brunch specials menu, which changes every week. 

I had the quiche and salad and all I can say is wow, melt in the mouth goodness! 

Staff are super friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"This place caught my eye when I was looking for things to do during my trip to Toronto. From the pictures I knew I was going to enjoy the atmosphere of the place and the music. I was expecting it to be entertaining simply because I was expecting to be having brunch while in a dive bar playing metal. 

What I wasn't expecting was how good the food was and how creative it was. I had the savory french toast which was smothered with mushrooms in a white sauce. It was veryyy yummy. The bf had a egg, cheese, sausage combination that was nicely seasoned and baked inside a roll of bread. Both dishes tasted like they used fresh picked herbs. I honestly was expecting more bland and conventional. I'm glad that wasn't the case. The bloody mary we ordered did not come (but we were also not charged for it), they may not of heard us over the music and chatter. 

Expect a bit of a wait, there is one cook and one guy serving. So bring a newspaper to read or something juicy to gossip about and sip on a drink, it's brunch after all."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to have a gourmet breakfast (or lunch) while listening to the best black metal, look no further then Graffti's on a Sunday  morning/afternoon.

For the past two sundays I have had no difficulty licking my plate clean of the chef's amazing and made to order creations. Last week we ordered the savoury french toast with cheese sauce and the salmon quiche. I don't even like salmon but I found myself stealing bites.

This week I went for the waffle croque-monsieur and he went for the lasagna. Again, we both licked our delicious plates clean.

The menu changes from week to week so you know you are going to get something seasonal, fresh and absolutely spot on perfect. Highly recommend to all my little rockers and foodies alike."}
{"text":"As Gord and I were walking around Baldwin Street in Kensington Market, we heard music coming from Graffiti's so we headed on in.

It was jammed but we were able to find a couple seats.

The High Tides were playing.  Their sound was loud surfing instrumentals and they were good.  The guitarists kept going outside to entertain the crowd on the street.

Then Burnin' Ethyl came on.  They played loud rock 'n roll and were good.

It's always a fun time at Graffiti's!"}
{"text":"What a diamond in the rough!  Great people, great atmosphere, great music, and best of all, cold beer!  Had a great time at this place when we stumbled upon Anna and her piano playing friend.  The music drew us in, the friendliness kept us there."}
{"text":"The grafitti mural, Elvis memorabilia, darkly intimate atmosphere, lively crowd of regulars, awesome rotating live bands, everything that everyone loves about Graffiti's, it's all true! 

The impromptu sidewalk dance party that you've probably witnessed as a passerby just on the other side of the glass garage doors is an integral part of the nightly experience and spectacle you don't want to miss.

I can't say that I was impressed with the seemingly non-existent selection of drafts. In fact, one or more of the taps were broken, but there were liquor bottles galore if I had so wished for a cocktail. Alas, I settled for my default bottle of Keith's and settled down to happily tap my feet to the beats that I had come for in the first place. Oh what fun!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had brunch in a dive bar before, but I will again. Graffiti's is a hodge-podge of paint, bric-a-brac, grit and Kensingtonian squalor. You could make a drinking game tallying Elvis sightings in this place. I decided to hit up the Black Metal Brunch on Sunday morning and I was not disappointed. There is something exquisite about enjoying eggs benny and sipping coffee while listening to hardcore and death metal. 

But I didn't do the benny.

Possibly spurred on by screams on the soundtrack, I ordered the highly badass White Trash Chicken Bake. Breaded fried chicken tenders ensconced in mashed potatoes, corn, and rich gravy. Sweet sassy molassy, it's wicked good. I ate the whole thing.  THE WHOLE THING. I'm going back. And it looks like a pretty chill place for a drink too. Wish it was a little bit more spacious, but that's part of it's charm I suppose.

Obligatory Title Pun: TAG, this place is it!

Menu Readability: Two words: skull typeface.

Need to mention: Any other time I walk by this place, there seems to be a band playing.

What this place teaches me about myself: Metal: it's what's for breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here for my bfs bday brunch with his friends. I actually picked the place based on a Blog TO article I came across titled 'best themed restaurants in Toronto' and listed was the black metal brunch at Graffitis. My man is a huge metal freak and he loves brunch so I figured this was the perfect combo.

We tried giving the place a call weeks before the date and they said to just call close to, or even the day of and let them know we were coming (there was like 10 of us). We tried the day before and the day of and nobody picked up so we just went. We made sure to get there right at opening to ensure we got somewhere to sit big enough for all of us. 

There were only 2 people working, a man server and a woman cook. When we walked in and said we needed to all sit together the first thing they said was 'a warning would have been nice'.....pretty unprofessional if you ask me. 1) we tried calling numerous times in advance and 2) you're a restaurant in downtown Toronto.....and you just opened for brunch...are you kidding? Wouldn't you be happy to be getting business? I wanted to say something but let it go because I didn't want to make a stink on his birthday. 

The seating arrangements were kind of annoying for a big group but can't blame the place for that. There were only a few meal options so I settled on the eggs benny. It was mediocre at best. I've definitely had better. 

But at the end of the day they played lots of black metal music and the bf and his friends were happy so I was happy. Would I return? No...unless I was forced."}
