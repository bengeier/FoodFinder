{"text":"This little restaurant is not what I expected when I first happened upon it.  It is run by a really nice little group of people and the patrons there are like family. It's a nice little vibe, worth checking out if you are in the market for some lighter fare.   The meals are good and the prices are reasonable.  As I mentioned in my quick tip, if you are dieting you really need to try the grilled Orange Roughy and salad.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I live in the area and this is my go-to fish and chips place. I've been here a few times now, and the service has always been exceptionally friendly. The past time that I was here for dinner we had a great conversation with the waitress, she is the daughter of the owner who runs the place along with other members of the family.  This place has several awards on the wall and deservedly so. It makes me happy that the fish is battered lightly and NOT greasy at all. I seriously hate over battered and greasy fish. The people who I dined with had the grilled fish which I usually would not order at a fish n chips place but it looked excellent and they loved it so I'm going to try it next time. The calamari was also delicious and I really enjoyed how the coleslaw was not drenched in mayo like you usually find at fish n chip places, but was much lighter and marinated in what seems like vinegar. I really enjoyed it.  They have several different options for sides like rice and salad so you can really get a lighter meal here! Our waitress suggested us the baklava that is made in house by her husband for dessert, which was a non traditional take- instead of being made with a phyllo pastry it was almost like thin layers of sponge cake instead! We loved it! Will definitely be coming back in the future to support this locally owned, family run business."}
{"text":"As a Gluten free and health conscious eater this was not my ideal choice. I was delighted with the grilled fish option, the rice was well seasoned and the service is exceptional. You can expect to seat yourself and be tended to in fair time, as the waiting staff sometimes helps in the kitchen. The food come up quickly and the atmosphere is warm & inviting. This is a gem in Islington Village."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout Halibut fish and chips from here. Fries were soggy and had to add lots of salt and pepper to make them taste like anything. Fish was okay, but the tartar sauce was the crappy prepackaged stuff. Staff were friendly - probably the only redeeming feature.   2/5, wouldn't go again though."}
{"text":"Not good, small fish portion and large fries that still tasted like frozen freezer. The previous reviews are dated and I should have known before going in. Also for lunch time, it was very empty (which is another sign that the restaurant was not good anymore)."}
{"text":"I read reviews all the time to help decide if I should try out the food  Reviews about johns are pretty consistent I had take out and the food was good    not a lot of fries tho I noticed a comment from a customer that was unfair and probably an honest error  if at all on the server  it was about the credit machine on 18 percent tip I know how these machines operate  customers have full access and can set the tip amount at any time as they please. A transaction for the tip cannot be processed by the server  This was mot a nice comment to make at all and should be removed    it was speculation!"}
{"text":"I think this is suppose to be like an English style Fish and Chips Restaurant, but I wasn't impressed with the food Decor, plain and Old Fashioned I wouldn't recommend it I shouldn't be so crass, as it again is a Community Environment. I think Seniors and possibly Families would like it."}
{"text":"I eat here about once or twice a month.  I'm a halibut lover and I find the batter here to be the best.  Portion size has always been good and I find it to be a bit better than other fish places in the area.  Price is about the same as all the other fish joints in Etobicoke and there are a lot."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase - the service is average for a Fish n' Chips joint.  Ordered the Halibut and Chips. Great tender fish and a very good batter. Not too think and oily. It's definitely not on the cheap side, but then again, Fish n' Chip restaurants prices have jumped in the past few years due to inflation."}
{"text":"Nice family owned business. Excellent halibut and chips. Waitress was excellent. Quick service. Waitress suggested the baklava and I was not disappointed.  Nice place with a clean washroom which is a bonus."}
{"text":"Good service, good size plate, halibut was nice and light, chips are average, coleslaw was very good, will come again"}
{"text":"A quaint little local spot, I just moved to this area a couple of months ago and had my first try of this place recently. The service was super friendly and it was quick, no complaints there. I got the battered haddock and fries. They were good, I can say I've had much worse, but I have also had much better, so middle of the road stars. Also, a sit down fish & chips place should really have tartar sauce in a dish/bottle, not in the tiny packets."}
{"text":"Had a hankering for fish and chips. Been past this place many times and decided to check it out. Worst experience ever. I walked in there were no customers in the restaurant except for a couple waiting for their food for take out. I stood for 3 minutes before seating myself. The waitress (as it turns out is the daughter of the chef) was too busy complaining about someone in her life to her father. I had to listen to this, when I came in. UGH! Sat for another 3 minutes and no service, got up and grabbed the menu myself. 3 minutes later waitress decides to come over.  I was quite appalled by the hefty prices for battered fish and fries. Really? $15 for two pieces of fish and fries?   Decided I might get better value for chicken fingers and fries at $13. NOT A Friggin Chance! A plate with 4 small pieces of chicken fingers (clearly previously frozen) and a wack load of fries - also frozen. The fries crispy at first, then became soggy and limp after a few minutes. Clearly had been in a freezer too long, no substance to them and soaked with grease. I mean what happened to the potato? it was just a shell.  I don't use ketchup or vinegar on my fries... I do mayo and hot sauce. Can you believe they had the gall to charge me .75c for two tablespoons of mayo!! UGH  I don't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great service and delectable halibut fish and chips.  I have been here several times and I am consistently impressed with how fresh and flaky the fish is inside a crispy batter.  But above all the service is warm and truly above par.  The server is super friendly and accomodating.  If you are hankering for fish and chips just go straight here and don't stop any other place. where service is foul as if their fish was sent from heaven."}
{"text":"Pretty good, good fries, great haddock. Don't order the gravy, it'll ruin the experience. Cause it's horrible. The food and friendly wait-staff makes up for that minor flaw, though."}
{"text":"This place was packed when I went in, I will admit it did take a fair bit of time to even be agknoweldged but once I was I was pleasantly suprised, the waitress was extremely hospitable and pleasant.  The food was delicious, the portions were good and I found there wasn't too much batter on the fish. The prices were very competitive as well, for 3 meals I paid less then 2 and an extra fish. Small venue may make dining in a bit difficult and the parking is not the greatest but the food and service more then makes up for it  I highly recommend this cozy little place to anyone looking for delicious and affordable fish n chips"}
{"text":"I love John's! Serving size is always huge and you get good value for your money. I usually get the haddock with chips and coleslaw. Service is always fast and excellent. Sometimes the chips may be soggy or overcooked but forgivable. Another one point less is that their tartar sauce is not homemade. Overall though, John's is pretty good for a fish and chips fix."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Johns, needles to say I was excited as this place has been in the neighbourhood for years!  Customer services was exceptional!   Food was just OK, big portions but the friends were old and store bought. Frozen and fried.  We had halibut - again lot fresh you can taste that it was frozen/friend.  Grilled shrimp - Was ok, again not fresh.  Excellent ambiance, friendly service! Should bring the food up to standard"}
{"text":"Great Fish and Chips! Don't forget to try the Greek salad - exceptional! Home made desserts are stunning! Excellent service.  A hidden Gem."}
