{"text":"I come here all the time. Delicious calzone and flatbreads with a twist. With a salad selection that is a great bonus. Convenient place to drop in for a good coffee and pastry as well. 

Have met Sal and Joy the owners and they are an excitable bunch which makes the experience a bit better."}
{"text":"Basically this is way overpriced for inferior quality food.

A small (and I mean small, under 100g or 2 bites) was bland, the avacado tasted old and it cost almost $4. The 2 macaroons I ordered - which were as stale as stale could be - were almost $6.

There are a variety of other businesses within a few blocks of Sal's that offer the same food but taste better and at a much more reasonable price.

This is the second time I've gone here and will certainly not be back."}
{"text":"Sal's flatbread calgary for lunch....alright, let's start with what went right.  The sandwiches ordered were bbq chicken, steak and onion, and chicken ceasar.  They were good, but no veggies.  Would have been nice with lettuce and tomato.  The kids ordered hot chocolate and white hot chocolate latte.   Was alright.  The avocado, banana, yogurt, and honey smoothie....not that great, was over blended and warm.  Also ordered macrons.  Overall, it was convenient, but lacked in pizzazz.  Like it is, the experience was flat."}
