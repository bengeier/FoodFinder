{"text":"I've been walking past this place for two months now and finally got the chance to go last week. It's a little french restaurant and very much has that kind of atmosphere. 

The hostess/server was very sweet and nice. She spoke mostly French which I enjoyed. The food was pretty good, I had a fillet of sole and my friend had the grilled chicken. Both were quite tasty but I felt that it left me wanting a bit more. 

I had the peach martini which was good but really sweet. All in all, I thought it was a good meal but not the best French meal I've ever had. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is also good. Made a reservation, and called when we were running late. The table was still reserved for us even though the restaurant was full. The decor is a little outdated, and the restaurant a little dim, but the food is authentic. Good place to have a nice dinner with family. Would return."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant through Yelp and was pleasantly surprised. It has a cozy French styled atmosphere with a few tables (which were full so make sure to reserve before coming) and tons of hidden gems on the menu. If you don't like seafood or French delicacies this might not be your restaurant.But if you do or you feel like trying new things then you'll love it here. I had the snails in white wine, herbs, garlic and whatever other goodness they mixed in there to make my taste-buds sing Hallelujah. That was just the appetizer.  For an entree I had the frog legs flambeed in Pernod and more Frenchness. Anyway bottom line if you're looking to get away from the chain restaurants or the flood of Japanese cuisine this will be the perfect place. 

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."}
{"text":"The owner is a lovely Parisian woman who stayed open in Sunday for a friend's bday. The food was also amazing.  We had the lamb, escargot, (pate was okay, not great) and dessert."}
{"text":"This restaurant is best known for its onion soup.  It is one of the best in town not only is it not salty, the bread and cheese is so good that mix well with the soup.  The cheese is not sticky at all.  The Le paté du chef I am not a fan but others enjoy it very much.

The Poached filet of sole looks very well cooked.  Last time I have it is very salty.  The Frog's legs sauteed with tomatoes concasse, garlic and herbs I see people are eating them yummy.  The Deboned roast duckling flambeed with grand marnier in orange sauce very different from the Chinese Peking duck. For the Roast rack of lamb rubbed with dijon mustard and seasoned with herbs provencale, the taste and the marinated lamb is good but the texture of the meat can be better.  If the raw material is not supreme, not matter how well it is cooked, it won't earn the 5 stars.

The dessert Crème burlee is very disappointed.  Except the torched sugar top layer, the custard is not fresh.  It used to be very good"}
{"text":"Owner treated us like criminals because we brought a birthday cake for a surprise party.  They will charge you $2 per person to serve a cake that you brought and cost them nothing.

The entire time he walked around the restaurant in a very surly manner.

Food was mediocre, no duck confit.  Orange sauce on duck was too sickly sweet and duck had no taste and was dry and rubbery."}
{"text":"This restaurant was excellent. Let me start by saying that the downside is parking and location. It is very easily missed. Although not far from the city, it's definitely small, it's operated essentially as a house so it's easy to just drive right past it. When we found it and looked for parking, we went to the back and there were no spots left - there are not that many to begin with. We asked the staff and they told us to pull up to the front where the other stores were and to park in front of there so we did! 

We got inside, and it's very quaint, nicely spaced out, definitely older but so warm and cozy. Perfect atmosphere for a date, or for bringing family and friends for a reunion or just for a beautiful French meal. The food is pricey - but in fairness, French food usually is pricey - at least if you want a good quality French meal. 

Three of us came together, for appetizers, we ordered 1 Les moules sauce bonne femme (mussels with creamy white wine sauce) - I would say that it was okay. Although I do appreciate mussels, I didn't love it, they weren't overly tasty nor spectacular. We ordered 2 Le salade panachee, avec Portobello et vinaigrette de balsam which was delicious! I would say that if you're looking for an appetizer, don't get the typical ceasar salad or mixed greens, get this portobello salad, it was delicious. It's a perfect balance of salad with the portobello playing in perfectly to replace any meat on the salad with light balsamic to bring it together. 

For the main, we ordered their special of the night: lamb shank, le canard braise a l'orange (orange duck) and le carre d'agneau aux herbes de Provence (roaster rack of lamb). From least best to best, orange duck was okay. Although obviously the orange is meant to be a star flavour, it really overpowered the dish. The duck was not by any means standing out because the flavour of the orange was overly played into the dish - wouldn't recommend and wouldn't order again. The lamb shank was great, braised well and served beautifully, it was delicate and delicious. But the STAR of the night was the rack of lamb. I've had MANY rack of lambs over time but this is by far, one of the most tender, succulent well seasoned and balanced rack of lambs I've ever had. We had it cooked to a medium rare and when we bit into it, it was as though it melted off the bone. A++++ would order again and would recommend. Although it's pricey, it's well worth the money you're paying for it. You're getting 5-6 pieces of beautiful rack of lamb that is done perfectly. 

We also got two bottles of wine and profiterole for dessert. A well rounded meal, beautifully done."}
{"text":"I ran into this restaurant while I was looking for a French restaurant nearby. After having checked that on Dine.To and Yelp, I decided to give a try. 

It's a neat and cozy place. It's romantic and it does not overwhelm you with unnecessary decoration. The candles and flowers are real. 

Food was great but a little bit expensive and prices were different from those posted on the restaurant's web site. 

A nice lady greeted us warmly when we arrived and when we left. She  was smiling at all times; pretty sincere; hard to get that feeling in Tdot nowadays.

I'd definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here with friends and wasn't too hungry, so I just ordered an appetizer and wine.  I ordered the artichoke salad thinking it would be fresh and delicious. It tasted like the artichokes you get out of a can, so I was not impressed. I'm not sure if this is true but it tasted just like the ones I had previously bought at home. I honestly thought my salad would be made fresh since this is a cute higher end restaurant but I was definitely wrong. 

I found the service to be on the slower side and I could barely get our waitresses attention to ask for more water.

I think I would possibly try the restaurant again when hungrier to see how I enjoy the entrées. It definitely would not be my first choice as they have limited options for people who are both lactose and gluten intolerant."}
{"text":"Think Auberge de Pommier without the crazy price tag.  Over the years i still can't understand why this place hasn't received the kudos it deserves.  My wife and i frequent this place often and every experience reminds us of a brief getaway to Europe with great food and wonderful service. Make sure you try the French onion soup, mussels and tenderloin for a wonderful experience - although you really can't go wrong with anything else.  Very reasonably priced, tucked away in an obscure part of town and never really received the credit it deserves.  Price for two with wine, tax and tip came in at ~$160."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday, the food was superb, service was excellent and the ambience was authentic French and romantic. Creme brulee was to die for. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me there for my birthday. Since our reservation was at 8pm on a Monday, we had the entire restaurant for ourselves unexpectedly.  The service was welcoming and nice - never pushed us to finish fast. Food was amazingly made."}
{"text":"french onion soup so I've heard is among the best....
magnifique!
What used to look like a old house was transformed into a beautiful, yet classic, and classy Montmarte.  Cozy, dim, with its decor, it really makes you feel at home.
I've been hearing about their infamous french onion soup, let's just say its THE BEST French onion soup I've had, full of flavors, accompanied by the swiss cheese melted over heightens the flavor. 5/5!!
Their Liver Pate 5/5 served with crostini over greens and baby tomatos was yummy!
Deboned roast duckling flambeed with grand marnier in orange sauce was lovely!! the sauce had the perfect balance of flavors to compliment the juicy duck 4/5

The overall dining experience is lovely, very tres romantic, the service was delightful, and helpful.
Would I come back, oui! :)"}
{"text":"We dropped by at 5pm, but it was closed.. we checked the door.. opens at 5:30, as we were walking back to our car to leave.. a women opened the door and waved at us to come back.. she has  a thick french accent.. the location is well decorated in the theme.  the food was delicious but expensive.. total was about $80 for two. without desert. the service was slow.. I would go back.. very romantic little cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is an island of culture in a sea of fast food franchises....
You would not expect to find this kind of place at the corner of Wilson Heights and Sheppard but once you step in you feel as if you've been transported to a small village in the French countryside... The decor is warm and cozy and they play authentic French music. It was very relaxing and pleasant. There is a small and neat patio out front with 3 tables but it faces the parking lot and the gas station across the street so we opted to sit inside. There is free parking in the front and around the back as well. We were served by the owner who was possibly the most hospitable person I have had the pleasure of meeting; the restaurant closes at 10pm but we were there until 10:30pm - not realising - and she didn't say a word. The owner clearly takes pride in her business and was very friendly and kind. We had lobster bisque, French onion soup which was outstanding, mussels, frog legs, escargots, filet mignon and roast duckling. Everything was very great but the steamed veggies could have used a bit of seasoning. They have a nice selection of dishes and even have an organic Pinot Noir on the wine list. The desserts are not on the menu so I was a bit taken aback when the bill came and the small crème brûlée was $8, but it was very tasty. Overall we had a very enjoyable evening. 
With wine and dessert our dinner came to about $80/person. We will be back to support this local business."}
{"text":"With a new baby in the family,  finding the perfect space to host a holiday dinner without disturbing other patrons was somewhat difficult especially for all 19 of us! Le Montmartre was able to accommodate my fiancé's family in its semi private dining room (2 long tables) with a 5:30pm reservation. 

Most of us hadn't seen each other over 6 months so we got caught up on catching up and delayed on deciding what we wanted for dinner. Our servers weren't exactly thrilled with the delay and made a special announcement to our group to hurry up. A bit pushy no? 

Each of us went with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I personally got their French onion soup and scallop. The soup was easily one of the best French onion soup I've had - not overly salted or greasy. The Swiss cheese was perfectly baked and melted over! It stayed gooey til the very last drop. 

My scallop dish was also very tasty  but not as memorable. 4 giant scallop baked with mushroom in creme sauce and came with side veggies. One of my fiancé's cousins loved the creme sauce so much she literally slurped every drop and wiped the plate clean with the complimentary warm bread. 

I also had a bite of the escargot appetizer, duckling, veal - all delicious but again nothing stood out. Our party ended our gathering on basically the whole dessert menu - tiramisu, puff pastry with vanilla custard ice cream, 4 layer chocolate cake, creme brûlée. Desserts just like the appetizers and main courses were all French food done well but for the steep price - I expected amazing food, service or at least perhaps a more filling portion. By the time I got home, I was starving again. 

Service was just ok - forgot a few of our orders for each course and  one of us had to find our way into the kitchen each time to ask about the missing order. 

Overall - Good but not worth the price to return once more. An one time dining experience."}
{"text":"This is probably our worst restaurant experience ever. We are so tired of traditional Canadian food, so chose this French restaurant to have some European style dinner. We considered prices and rating, plus this restaurant was the best one in Sheppard Avenue area. 

So we came there and were surprised to come across very nice and cozy restaurant in this quite area. We were greeted (it looked indeed French, as staff was bilingual, that's nice) and seated upon arrival and all pretty things ended up here. I've made a list of things which may explain my given rating:

1. Long waiting time. - After making an order we have been waiting almost for an hour just to get regular pasta! We kindly asked a couple of times if the dish is ready, and all we got was that it's cooking. I know that a high quality food does take some time to be cooked, but not an hour and with no notice! Plus, people, who came later, got their meals earlier than we did, and it wasn't salad by the way! 

2. Careless staff. - They asked about drinks to start, we went with water without ice. They double checked this detail, and brought within 15 minutes both glasses full of ice. Why asking then? (Have I mentioned long waiting time already? Or the water was extracted from a deep well?) 
Plus they kept opening and closing the front door, what made it freezing to stay in restaurant.

3. Aren't you greedy? - After having our long-awaited dinner, when it came to paying for bill, we kindly asked if they could split amount between two of us. Yes, they did but they rounded up the initial sum (adding another $.90) to the bill. We don't mind the money, BUT at least you could ask about it, right? This is irresponsible and unfair. 
As a result of such a \"diligent\" work, we decided not to leave tips. Once the waiter saw this, he said that tips could be very appreciated. We kindly told him what was wrong. And you know what! The waiter stated the following: \"If you don't leave tips, then don't ever come here again!\" 

To be honest, we were more than shocked! If you work in French restaurant, then do your job as you would work in France, not Montreal (later we found out that some staff was actually from Montreal, that's why they spoke French). Tips are expected for providing exceptional customer service, which they didn't prove. Extortion is not a resolution!"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's bachelorette's party. We tried the French onion soup, it was good, but 8.95 for a small cup of soup is a little steep. I ordered roasted duckling, it was OK, but It was not $23 dollar worth of special. However, a friend of mine ordered a rack of lamb, the meat was tender, juicy and you get alot for your $29 dollar of the dish. I would recommend their rack of lamb if u are coming here for the first time.

I would come here for special occasion, but not all the time, it is quite expensive to my liking."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday. He's from France and wanted French food. Ill be the first to admit the food is pricey but the meal was delicious and worth the treat. I had the mussels and shrimp pasta. My boyfriend had the shrimp dinner and creme brûlée. He loved it. My only complaint is. I asked if they do anything for birthdays and they said they will bring out a profiterole with ice cream and sing (I assumed it was complimentary) after they brought it out (it was mostly ice cream) my boyfriend said he wanted creme brûlée for dessert. When I saw my bill I was charged for both. Had I'd known it wasn't complimentary I would of told them to bring out the creme brûlée with candles because neither if us really wanted the ice cream. They did not inform me that I had that option of choosing. Who wants to pay 8 dollars for basically ice cream? But I didn't let that spoil my evening."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Le Monmarte for his birthday, it had romantic and authentic ambience, the French waitress was very courteous and food was excellent. We both really liked everything about the restaurant. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Location:

It's located in a narrow building next to a tiny plaza. If you've never been there use a GPS you might miss it!

There is very little parking at the front but you can drive between the buildings and there is more parking in the back.

When you walk up:

It's a cute little building. We came as a large group for book club and were sat in a room off the door. It was nice. Note: was rooms are downstairs

Took a peak at the other side, its really nice, tasteful, and classy.

Seating:

Table seating, comfortable seats and we'll lit.
 

Food:
I ordered a peach Martini to start. It was really good. Would get it again.

I got the pâté app. Mixed reviews on that one. The pâté was tasty, thick sliced with a peppercorn topping. It was on a bed of chopped romaine lettuce with halved cherry tomatoes. That was a bit odd. The only thing wring, is that for the size of the pâté we could have used a few more crispy bread medallions. It comes with 4, 6 would have been better. But it is something I'd get again.

For the main I had frog legs. They were delicious. Tender, and soft. They had a delicate flavour. They were tossed in was a butter and herb sauce. Perfect, I just wanted to lick my plate, that's how good it was

Everyone enjoyed their meals. The salmon and trout were big hits.

Staff:

It's a nice restaurant, the people that work there are great. We had a bit of an oops with the bill, the staff couldn't have been nicer with the resolution. It says a lot when they they go out of their way to make things easier for you!


Conclusion:
We like it so much we are going back, already made a reservation!"}
