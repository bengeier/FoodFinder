{"text":"I heard Goze talk about this place on MMAjunkie Radio so I went to check it out. The food was great, I had the lomo saltado and it was very juicy. I would definitely recommend this place to any other junkies."}
{"text":"We've been to several Peruvian restaurants here in town and this is by far the best we have had.  Everyone was friendly and service was pretty fast.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"1st time trying Peruvian food and boy I have to say this was the right place to be, came in on a Monday for lunch, looks like a new places but gotta tell you, the food was absolutely delicious, they also have an awesome alternate to regular soda called Inca Cola, hats off to the service too, they were prompt and Brigitte my server was very polite and made sure I was taken care well, 
Recommended me to come check out their hometown band which plays on Saturday, will do !  Good place, check it out  5/5."}
{"text":"I haven't had Peruvian food over 2 plus years. I'm excited to try this!! LOMO SALTADO!! Nice service"}
{"text":"I heard the guys tell a funny waitress story about this place on MMAjunkie Radio so I thought I'd give it a try. It was a great recommendation. The ceviche was bomb! I'm gonna try something else next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"When it comes to Peruvian food in Las Vegas, this place is king of the hill. The staff is very nice and helpful and the food is on point and authentic. The last Peruvian place I went to had Kanye playing in the background, this place has great Peruvian decor and music. If you love Peruvian food, look no further."}
{"text":"Good food. 4 dishes so far.. the mussels, beef with rice and fries, cilantro rice and chicken, desert so good"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Bad quality food. They even microwaved some of the food that we were turned that was cold. Unbelievable. Go to Lima Limon instead."}
{"text":"Came in late in the evening to try this new place out. We were greeted immediately and sat in a booth. Our waiter was friendly and professional. Business was slow but this place has potential especially with Borinka salsa group playing on Saturdays which is something not offered at other Peruvian restaurants. Being an American-born Peruvian, I've always had high expectations of Peruvian food comparing it to my mother's. We started off with Choros a la Chalaca (mussels on shell w lime juice) that were rich in flavor. Food came out with a great appearance and in a timely manner. Boyfriend had Parihuela (seafood chowder w shrimp, clams, fish, mussels and squid) and I ordered Lomo Saltado (tender beef strips w onions and tomotoes rice and french fries). Both choices were really filling and enough to share with each other. Server didn't drop the check off after he bussed our table. We had to go up to the register to pay which is no problem but we weren't informed. We would definitely return. Giving it 4 stars because of it's priceyness. Some items I believe are over priced and bigger parties will have a problem with that."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, awesome service definitely will make another trip in the near Future zero complaints here!! This is the spot in Las Vegas if you want Peruvian food."}
{"text":"Los anticuchos estuvieron deliciosos pero, el aji de gallina y la pollada no me gusto."}
{"text":"Great little place off the strip. This was my first time eating Peruvian food and the waitress gave us some good recommendations. Very friendly staff, good service, and great music. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place good food portions are gigantic and service is ok would definitely come back not 5 starts cause they forgot a drink call chicha that was included with my plate over all good place with authentic peruvian food"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time yesterday , and it was amazing!!! A little pricy but their portions are HUGE and the food is to die for definitely coming back and it looks like they have live music probably on the weekends , I had a tallarin Saltado finger licking good lol ."}
{"text":"I'm Peruvian and vegetarian and this place was able to accommodate seco de champinones con frejoles! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is probable my favorite Peruvian food in Vegas! If you are in town make sure to check this place out! Excellent food and excellent service"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here, the food and the service were above expectations 
The owner went out of her way to make a special dish for us
Strongly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I am Peruvian and this is some of the best I've ever had! With the owners wife as the chef, the food is incredible, fresh and savory. You can't go wrong with any of the seafood, especially the taldarines saltado de mariscos. For appetizers try the papa a la huancaina."}
{"text":"As I plan a trip to Peru, I'm craving the foods I hope to eat when I get there later this year. We don't have too many Peruvian options in town but I decided to take a pescatarian foodie friend for a dinner date here to check it out. We shared a trio of dishes and left full and happy. 

CAUSA DEL SABOR: A layered appetizer of mashed potato and tuna (or chicken), in the shape of a heart. Flavors and textures we typically wouldn't mix in the US but they harmonized well in this dish. 
CEVICHE MIXTO: Served on a decorative, fish-shaped platter, this dish is well portioned for the $20 price. The mix of fish, octopus, shrimp, and crab was fresh and accented with sides of sweet potato, corn, and cancha (corn nuts). Get at least one of their ceviches when you come!
CAUCHA DEL MARISCOS: In the fusion section of the menu as a \"seafood fried rice\", similar to arroz con mariscos but with slightly different seasonings and preparation. This was good and paired well with our other dishes. Again, large portion for the ~$20 price.

Due to the pricing and portion sizes, I'd recommend this more for a group than for a date night. They do also have breakfast specials and weekend-only specialties. I'm in the area for work occasionally and look forward to coming back for the lomo saltado. 

NOTE: They have live music and salsa dancing on Saturdays, and our server said they book up in advance. I like to be able to have conversation when I dine, so this is a deterrent for me but YMMV."}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!!! Our waitress was very professional and helped us out a lot. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is wanting to taste how Peru food really tastes, especially because I lived there for a few years and it tasted exactly the same. Great food, great music, very fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food gets a 5, service was off, food came out quick.

Get the ceviche, amazing. Every bite was an experience."}
{"text":"The food here is GREAT !!! The portions are HUGE !!! If you want to try a \"classy\" style Peruvian Restaurant this is the place to be !!! This is my wife's new favorite restaurant. They have only been open a month but, they seem to be doing everything perfect.  We will definitely be back !!!"}
{"text":"We went in a weekday evening. The bathroom was clean, the restaurant was clean . Service was friendly. I ordered a salchipollo and sabor criollo. We paid around 55. Food was OK but pricey for the dish and flavor, kinda expensive for what good it was. Papa a la huancaina was very salty. So sincerely I don't think I will go back. Rather to drive to other Peruvian restaurant in las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious Peruvian restaurant. We come here a lot and have never being disappointed. The alfajores are the best. They also have salsa dancing during the weekends."}
{"text":"This please is the best Peruvian food in town .
Costumer service is excellent. And the food is delicious. The place is very clean . 100% recommended ."}
{"text":"Honestly I was disappointed. Food was just ok and bland. My wife and I ordered lomo saltado and I could tell right away the meat was not very fresh. Also had an appetizer that was called tri color. It was 3 separate potato dishes in 3 different sauces. Huacaty, huancaina, and rocoto. Sauces were ok and potatos were dry. They were definitely not cooked that morning. They also had the taste of the refrigerator. My wife is Peruvian and we have eaten at all the Peruvian restaurants in Las Vegas. We were  very disappointed with this one. The entire menu was overpriced and we will not return. On a positive note the waitress was very friendly and offered good speedy service."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out a Peruvian restaurant with my family while I was in town and we wanted it to be close to the airport since my sister was getting in around dinner time and this was one of the two options we looked at. We decided on this option compared to the one down the street because this looked a lot more spacious. I noticed this place was brand new (it had only been open for a few weeks when we went) so I expected them to still be getting into the swing of things (and they were).

We were seated at a table that was clearly too small for the size of our party, as there was no way it could fit all of our food at once. We were eventually moved to a bigger table. It was pretty slow the night we went so there wasn't really any reason to have seated us as such, but I'm assuming it was a lack of experience is all.

For appetizers, we ordered Papa a la Huancaina, Causa de Pollo, and Salchipapas for appetizers. I was against ordering the Salchipapas (hot dogs and fries), but my dad insisted. The Huancaina sauce was great and the Causa was good too.

We ordered a few pitchers of chicha morada (purple corn drink) because you have to be drinking this if you're eating peruvian food. It just seems natural. The drink was tasty, but it hadn't been chilled and we weren't given ice with it. Back in Peru I was used to not having chilled drinks all the time, but it's a different story when I'm back in 'Murica.

For entrees we collectively ordered Lomo Saltado x3, Aji de Gallina x2, and Carapulcra x1. Most of my family had tried lomo before so I think the big hit this time was the Aji de Gallina because the creamy sauce was just delicious. The other dishes were also very good. When I asked for some aji to go with my rice I was pleasantly surprised when they brought out quite the large dipping dish of it. So good!

I give this restaurant a 4/5 because I know a new restaurant will have to work out the kinks and it wasn't much of a hassle for those things that were \"wrong\" anyway. The food was great!"}
{"text":"Great customer service they treat you like royalty the the food is very delicious the place is very clean and nice to me besides  the good food what is very important is the customer service because if they treat you nice you want to go  back and that is what I'm planning to do I'm defenetly going back. I highly recommend this restaurant. I can't wait to go back and try a new dish"}
{"text":"Big fan of Peruvian food and had been searching for a great place to eat some Peruvian food at and this place did not disappoint once. The staff was very quick and friendly. Food came out right away. Every plate was so delicious there was no left overs from anyone! Definitely will return again!"}
{"text":"The food was so good and the portions were on the bigger side. I really loved the food and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came here to try the ceviche de pescado. It was very good. The portion is big enough for 2 people to share at a cost of $15.99. They have lunch specials from 11 am to 2 pm for $8.99 including a glass of chica morada drink which is a great deal. The only thing I didn't like was that the sweet potato was hot and the corn was warm. The side items are supposed to be cold in my opinion. The service was excellent and fast. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Me encanta la comida Peruana, he visitado Peru en varias oportunidades y debo confesar que este restaurante tiene una comida espectacular, tal cual como la de su Peru.. Me encanto."}
{"text":"I went to this Restaurant 3 times during the holidays and the food is just like you are back home. I will recommend this restaurant .
The Ceviche de Pescado is delicious"}
{"text":"After our favorite Peruvian restaurant suddenly closed in our town we were distraught and tried searching for other Peruvian restaurants to try, none of them matched up until we found this place in Vegas!! Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating, the food didn't take long to receive and the flavors were spot on. I had the Tallarin Saltado de Carne and my wife had the bistek a lo pobre. We plan stop here every time we visit Vegas!! P.S make sure you get the soup and ask for a side of the lime marinated onion to accompany your meal."}
{"text":"Another good meal!!! Ceviche mixto awesome!!! Service inpecable!!! Very kind people at this restaurant!! Bisteck a lo pobre TO GO!! And lucuma ice cream for my sweet tooth!! LOL."}
{"text":"Not the best Peruvian food I've had in Vegas. But wasn't terrible by any means. The portions were pretty small for the cost. The waitress was great but clearly overwhelmed since it was her and one other girl and the house was packed! Got one of our orders wrong and never cleared any of our plates away (which was awkward for a huge party like ours) so the dishes kept stacking. Felt bad for her but it wasn't her fault in the least bit. The atmosphere was nice and reminded me of my Peruvian family but the food could have been better and bigger for sure."}
{"text":"We had my niece's graduation dinner party here.  There were 26 people in our party.  Arlene our server was very attentive to our needs.  She was so focused and worked fast and was able to cover the needs of our guests. The food we had for dinner was delicious. We ordered Jallea, mussels, papa rellena, papa huacaina, chaufa de carne, Lomo Salado etc. We were very satisfied with the food and service and Arlene went above and beyond for our party. When you are in the Vegas area come to this place and look for Arlene."}
{"text":"I purposely went to this place twice to make sure I wouldn't be giving three stars as a mistake, here's why...

ATMOSPHERE:
Small Peruvian restaurant located in a shopping center, there's nothing special about the decor, what makes this restaurant fun is the live music. Don't go here if you want a quiet dinner. The music works both in and against the restaurants favor, you'd think that they'd have the setup down to perfection 5by now, it can get quite annoying. But if the music system is working its a very festive atmosphere. 

 FOOD:
Pretty damn delicious. I've had the arroz con marisco (rice with seafood), ceviche, and lomo saltado (beef with fries). Each time I've gone with family and I've also sampled their dishes, all of which taste great. The best thing about El Toque is that there is so much variety in the menu itself and everything I've tried thus far has had great flavor and was cooked just right. Definitely recommend the ceviche if your in the mood for something zesty. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Very friendly and approachable staff, I've always been seated promptly and never have an issue with a request or dish. The reason I'm giving this establishment 3 stars because I do feel some of the dishes are over priced and at times the atmosphere can really be a buzz kill. 

I'd definitely go back to have a bite once awhile just not a staple."}
{"text":"You, (Jr.)
You are playing with toys on stage. Not drums, but toys.

Your phone is a toy, it has games on it. Its a toy. You can pick it up and play with it whenever you want, then you can put it down. That's a toy.

The Drums are a Musical Instrument. Not a toy.

You are playing with toy drums on stage, where you can pick them up and put them down when ever you feel like.

That's what you do with toys 

Not Musical Instruments!

I have never played soccer (futball) with my trombone; 
But I have played soccer with drum sticks in my hand, and a shaker.

Those are toys, meant for fun
NOT Musical Instruments 

In conclusion.

Put the Fucking Phone down and play the Drums.

Start small,

Do 1 full song without touching your phone.

Then 2 songs, ( in a row) without touching your phone

If you get cocky you can try a whole set without touching your phone.

But let's be honest, we need to take baby steps because you are still playing with toy drums on stage 

Not Musical Instruments YET!"}
{"text":"I am in town for work and visited this lovely restaurant after hearing so much from a coworker from Peru that said this restaurant \"Makes me feel like I am back home.\" I must say, this gem of a restaurant did not fail to impress.  Yes, service and presentation was fantastic, but the food was just incredible, the frijoles con seco de cabrito and arroz con mariscos were divine!  You could tell this was the kind of place the community treasures and it showed by the crowd.  This is the kind of place I will visit every time I am in town, simply for the wonderful experience we had.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Random tid bit that made me feel like I was at an authentic place, they asked if we wanted water with or without ice. Excellent service, but be a little patient as these aren't the flare pinned sycophants that forced to hover over you at chains. 

Tried the chinese/Peruvian fried rice -  chaufa (they had a president Alberto Fujimori, makes sense), it came with a giant whole fried shrimp. good, enough for three people, a lot of it went home. 

Dining companion had the El trio del sabor, A giant deep fried frutti did mare. Also good. 

I'll be back later to try the more nuanced dishes and I definitely want to try some of the new to me desserts.
 So far it looks like a solid choice for Peruvian food."}
{"text":"My Peruvian broski (Raul Tafur) recommended this spot and I have to thank him profusely with Cusqueño beer the next round! The food is excellent, delicious and generously portioned (we had the concha with aji verde, the fresh ceviche mixto, lomo saltado and aji de gallina). Our server made sure that we enjoyed every bit of our dining experience and steered us into ordering the right dishes to give us our first taste of Peruvian cuisine right down to the simple but delectable Alfajores for dessert. We're definitely a fan and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I love it!! Wish it was closer to my house. The ceviche is great. My husband is picky and he*s loved everything we have had from here. Plus they have one of my favorite Peruvian beers!!"}
{"text":"Finally found a Peruvian spot in Las Vegas. Food was spectacular and very tasty. Music also kept the ambiance going!"}
{"text":"My place for Peruvian food craving these days.  I basically go there every single week for lunch and some special days for dinner.  Lunch time specials are like eating back home and the rest of the food in the menu covers a wide range of dishes of authentic Peruvian flavor from ceviche to lomo saltado and chupe de camaron to aji de gallina.  Add drinks like chicha morada, maracuya or Inka Kola and helado de lucuma or alfajores for dessert and you get a full experience like you will if you're in Peru.  The restaurant is relatively new and they work hard to provide a good service but I never had any issues with it.  The decoration is nice and warm for a strip mall restaurant and they have weekends with live music (a salsa band that play my favorite songs from Niche) on Friday nights, karaoke on Saturday nights and Peruvian music on Sunday afternoons."}
{"text":"This service was horrible. We told the server we were on lunch and pressed for time. Our food took forever to come out. The food was bland and not too much flavor. Tee asked for split checks and the sever messed up our receipts and charges the wrong amounts on our card! If I could give it a 0 stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went there for Mother's Day dinner. The food was delicious!!! Real authentic Peruvian food. My son and I ordered the arroz con mariscos, my and daughter husband ordered lomo saltado, my other son ordered bisté a lo pobre, my other daughter ordered pollo a la brasa con papas fritas and her boyfriend ordered pollo saltado! For dessert we ordered Lucuma ice cream and alfajores. We all loved our food!! Everything was so delish, that the next day I ordered arroz con pollo to go. Then, two days later. I ordered more food to go seco de carne, ají de gallina and ají verde. I highly recommend this restaurant to Peruvians and non Peruvians because the food is superb!!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular! Best Peruvian food in Las Vegas by far. We had Pescado a lo macho, Choritos, Ceviche de Pescado and Escabeche de Pollo. Everything was delicious. If anything, a little pricey, but I pay gladly when I receive this quality of food..."}
{"text":"Did not taste original, but was okay although pricey for a Thursday. Slow service and although it was okay, it was not close to original like aji de gallina should have been shredded not chopped chicken letting me know it wasn't cooked in the sauce but added to a sauce. The sauce also did not have that distinct flavor but only reminded me of Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The \"El Trio del Sabor\" was simply fantastic!  I've been to a lot of Peruvian Restaurants across the country, as well as Peru, and this is my favorite.  Such wonderful flavors.  I'd love it if they opened a location in Salt Lake City."}
{"text":"Delicious Peruvian food (arroz con mariscos & pollada were amazing), great service, decent prices (maybe a tad bit overpriced), excellent music. They have a live band: Orchestra Borinka which makes the atmosphere amazing.  They even had an instructor come in and offer a  free salsa dance class!"}
{"text":"Great tasting seafood dishes.  There a lot of interesting choices so you'll want to visit more than once.  Excellent service by a really cute and friendly waitress.  Restrooms were very clean as was the restaurant throughout. Try this little gem for something different and tasty. My only complaint was that my Arroz de Marisco dish could have used more squid and was mostly rice.  Other than that; you must try their ceviches-they are really good!"}
{"text":"Its good but the service hours posted are never correct. Coming from out of town and driving from my hotel to come here 2 times on a matter of 3day and always late to open or for example today Tuesday at 3:25pm they are close!?
Hours say mon-thurs. 11am-9pm wtf!"}
{"text":"Exquisita comida!! Me gusto mucho la atención, las porciones son grandes y la comida deliciosa.
Volveremos"}
{"text":"wow. so many good reviews for such a bad tasting peruvian restaurant. i'm from LA, came to visit. was in the mood for peruvian and found THIS \"gem\" and i mean that sarcastically. 
everything was salty.
YUCK!"}
{"text":"LLAMEN ANTES DE LLEGAR!!! Puse una estrella porque no hay estrella negativa. Me parece una falta de profesionalismo que anuncien horas de operación y llegue uno y encuentre cerrado, es la segunda ves que me pasa... venimos de otro estado a pasear pero no a perder el tiempo. El restaurante podrá tener buena comida pero parece que no se les han olvidado la mala costumbre latina de llegar o ABRIR tarde."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you are Peruvian, you will remember Peru when you are eating in that place. They have a good taste. Everything is good. They even have especial peruvian beers, the tv programs are even from Peru, and music like callao style salsa. I recommend you this place."}
