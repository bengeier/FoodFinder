{"text":"Good food.  Freshly made in a very timely manner.  Friendly service.  What more could you ask for?  Stoughton loses many restaurants but this
One remains strong due to good food and service."}
{"text":"I was hungry for some Chinese food today for lunch, and I found this place. It's only about a mile from where I live, and it was perfect. The food was not only good, but inexpensive. The service was fast and all I had to do was go pick it up as fast as 10 minutes after I ordered. (Which was conveniently over the phone) To anyone planning on ordering from here, I recommend the crab rangoon. Some of the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I have ordered food from here on numerous occasions. It's always been good and reasonably priced. I wish they delivered. That is the only drawback."}
{"text":"Great meal,  huge portions, and a good price!  
Super sweet delivery girl and the young man on the phone was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"I would give this place \"0\" stars if allowed.  My husband purchased dinner for 2, plus 2 egg rolls and 2 orders of pot stickers.  Not only did they not give us the red sauce which is a major part of our meals,  but it was so BAD, my husband took 2 bites and threw it away.  He called the restaurant to complain and the best they would do is credit his name with a $1 credit.  What a waste of $35!!!  Steer clear of this place, go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. The prices are great. They don't deliver but, the take out is fast - about 10 minutes. Sometimes it is hard to communicate with the employees but if you don't need a million things changed in your order you should be fine. I have always been happy with my food"}
{"text":"My family has only ordered bulk orders of the bao zi (pork buns) here, which we do maybe once a month or once every two months. We love the buns and serve it to other people too, and they've loved it as well. We haven't ordered other food from here, though."}
{"text":"It's more like 2.5 stars.  I have had way better.  My expectations weren't high due to the fact it's all run of the mill take out Chinese food suited for most American palettes.  It did come fast and hot, but I wish the items that are labeled spicy were consistently spicy."}
{"text":"For a quick easy food take out or delivrry this place is excellent. Easy on the wallet and comparable to most Chinese restaurants.  I enjoy many variety of choices on their menu. 

This establishment is geared more for take out or delivery. It does have some tables and chairs, but more of a after thought. I rated 5 based on food, price and service only.

If your looking for a dine in experience with waiters, ceramic plates and silverware, then this place would not be for you. Everything is disposable ie plastic or paper plates."}
{"text":"Consistent, fair price for the food, always tastes fresh and staff is friendly.  It's just what you want in a take-out.  Do wish they delivered for lunch though."}
{"text":"Got lunch take-out. The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour (didn't really have a flavor). The Mongolian pork lunch special was also extremely bland. I wish I had looked around for some condiment packs, as I was looking forward to some spicy food today.
They forgot to include my drink."}
{"text":"Great place overall, quality service quality food quailty people. That's all that needs to be said. 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"So amazing. Love this place. Been going here since I moved to Stoughton when i was 16 years old. It was the first meal my mom ordered us when we moved in. I am 29 years old now and there food is still the same. (Bomb.com)There Crab Rangoon's and red dip are to die for. Also, the egg rolls are great esp. with soy sauce . I get shrimp fried rice,it goes perfect with the 'happy family'meal.My Hubby  loves the sweet and sour chicken!"}
{"text":"Praise the Lord!  Been looking for good Chinese here since I moved from DC 7 years ago. Everything you would want from a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. We usually get the General Tso Chicken and Singapore noodles."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for Chinese take out. Ordered the Mongolian Beef and crab rangoons. The Mongolian Beef actually had a little (not much, but it was there) heat which was nice since so many take-out Chinese places have no heat whatesoever. Food was tasty and had a nice selection of vegetables. Crab rangoons are just OK, but not bad."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for ~3years now.  They have an excellent wonton soup. It can be hit or miss but a recent change has lowered my view of them from a 4 star to a 3.  They make an EXCELLENT home made egg roll but unfortunately I discovered today that for lunch they have switched to a nasty, mushy, commercial-made frozen egg roll.  I was quite disappointed. When I asked they said they still do the home made for dinner but these pathetic excuses for egg rolls for lunch. 

Additionally they have changed their sweet and sour sauce.  This new stuff has no taste.  It's thick and red but very little taste. 

My word to them; stop cheapening your ingredients or you'll lose customers.  

I haven't tried the other Chinese restaurants in stoughton, but now I will."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese takeout place since forever. The food is delicious and my family and I always enjoy it. Love the orange chicken and Singapore noodle."}
{"text":"We ordered for the first time a couple weeks ago. We got orange chicken, sesame chicken, egg rolls, and crab rangoon. We ordered carryout and it only took 10 minutes to prepare. Everything was delicious, the whole family enjoyed it and we had more than enough for left overs. The prices were average for a chinese take out restaurant. We'll be eating there again next time we decide chinese food is what's for dinner."}
{"text":"I will never order from there again. I called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken. The person who answered informed me that it was both hot and spicy but it was serves with broccoli, snow peas and onions. Once I got my entree it was neither hot nor spicy. On top of that, there was no broccoli. Too many onions, barely any snow peas AND a very small amount of chicken. Did I mention that I don't think the chicken was actually chicken? It was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor. The white rice that accompanied my dish was mushy and clumped together. I've made better rice boiling it. My mom had the Kung pao chicken and she was also dissatisfied with her meal. The crab Rangoon was ok... Fairly basic. 

I won't return there. I would prefer to give it a ZERO"}
{"text":"Our favorite for quick good food! Good value for the money- lots of food and drinks included."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese but definitely not the worst. Went here for Chinese takeout. I got chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and a few other things. Nothing was terrible but I really only loved the fried rice. Good place to have in a small town like Stoughton but it wouldn't stack up against Chinese places in larger towns."}
{"text":"I have been ordering take-out from this place for the past five years, and I was shocked to see that they had a negative review.  Every single time I have ordered from them the food is hot, fresh, and exactly what you would expect from a nice take-out Chinese restaurant.  Owner and staff are friendly, everything is ready in \"Ten Minute\", and the food and flavor are excellent. 

They do have a few tables for dine-in, however the atmosphere isn't great... the place is really your traditional take-out or delivery venue.  The kitchen is right there in the open and you can watch them making the food--all is clean and well kept.  All I can say is check it out for yourself as I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We go here pretty regularly. The food is good, but by no means great. It is pretty divey looking (photos of food, etc) and they mess up our order abt 20% of the time, but still a good value for the price. General Tso's chicken is great. I asked for brown rice once and they gave us fried rice... to their credit, it was brown :)"}
{"text":"Good food Chinese fresh cheap. Mom and pop owned place the best  Chinese in Middleton :)"}
{"text":"Called to ask questions for a carry out order. I was told they couldn't help since they are in a rush hour. I said I am calling like everyone else to order dinner. Was told to come in and get a menu then go home and call order in. Great service NOT. Ordered from Moonstar in Oregon instead. They wanted a carry out order."}
{"text":"My husband love the food here. It's a take out only place. We call our order in and pick it up 15-20 minutes later. The food is always hot and tastes fresh. It is a good place for carry out."}
{"text":"It's a decent place for takeout, with very friendly staff and a very fast turnaround time for your order being ready. 

General Tso's was good, but not as spicy as I'd like, but the boneless ribs, fried dumplings and egg rolls were pretty solid, as was the house special lo mein. 

I'd definitely go here again, especially with Ming's being closed."}
{"text":"Hubby has been eating here for years but since I only occasionally visit WI, he never convinced me to give this little dive a try. Now I'm sad about what i've been missing! Cannot understand how they do it for SO cheap - amazingly fresh, tasty, generous Chinese. Clean, open kitchen, very fast and large variety. Liked it so much that I got a lunch special to go for the bus ride over to O'Hare. They packed it up tight but remember to take napkins, condiments and utensils. I loved the shrimp with broccoli (also had carrots) and the shrimp were large and plentiful. Wonton soup (4 big dumplings) on a cold day was delish and included in the lunch special. Also got chicken egg foo yung which included large, well filled egg roll - also tasty, mustardy sauce OK (not as good as the brown sauce I'm used to). All lunch specials include roast pork fried rice which was good enough to buy on its own. Seems like a mom/pop place so support your local Chinese joint - down with PF/PW/PE."}
{"text":"Really good chicken teriyaki. Very good egg fu young. Their general taos red sauce is weird it has a twang to it I avoid it now. Your typical chinese delivery, delivery has always been good on time. This is our go to chinese night out delivery."}
{"text":"We've been a residents of Stoughton, WI. for 20 yrs. we've been ordering food from them ever since and they have not change. Very good food and cheap price, their food is not to salty and way better quality food compare to others Chinese take out place. We're else can you buy a very good meal for $5-6.00 for lunch, any other food on the menu is also cheap. Owner and staff are always friendly and quick. Our fav. Schezuan shrimp with broccoli, hot  sour soup, mo shoo pork. Other food on the menu are also good, and service with a smile.!"}
{"text":"This place is not fancy like Imperial Garden nor is it very home style Chinese like Fugu.  But it fits the neighborhood well.  The owners are super nice people and when I lived in the neighborhood, we had a nice little friendship.  The food is on par with other take away Chinese restaurants around the Madison area.

I stopped in to carry out dinner and not much has changed.  The outside has been redone but the inside is still clean and simple.  The menu is pretty much the same.  I ordered the mei fun and the dinner special chicken and cashews.  I get the crab Rangoon,  too.  They have the best deal on the Rangoon: ten pieces for under four dollars.  It is a lot of food for twenty bucks, plus if  you use the coupon on the counter, you get free soda.  The owner threw in a free egg roll too.

There is a TV in the corner showing Chinese films to keep you entertained during your brief wait for your food.  But you don't wait long.  From when I ordered to when I left, it was maybe at most 15 minutes.  I am always satisfied when I come here."}
{"text":"This is another poor excuse for a Chinese restaurant in Stoughton behind Ming's Garden.  The quality was bad.  The fried rice didn't taste fresh and the sauces were bland."}
{"text":"On par with other American Chinese take out. Staff very nice.  Usually get the chicken fried rice or moo shu pork (with steamed rice instead of pancakes) or beef with broccoli.  And I have enough left to take for lunch the next day.  Which also makes this a good value."}
{"text":"This place has great take out. There are just a few tables to eat at, but seems most of the business is take out. The people that run it are very nice and seemed to know everyone picking up food when we were waiting for ours. The restaurant is very clean, and the kitchen is open so you can see them making your food as you wait. They have all the typical dishes, but seems more flavorful than some we have tried. We will definitely take out from them again, just wished we lived closer."}
