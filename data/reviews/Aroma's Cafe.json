{"text":"This is the best $6 meal on South Blvd! You simply can't beat the amount of food for the money, and the care that Chef Charles puts into his work is beyond reproach! $6 gets you your entree, side and a drink and everything is ALWAYS fantastic! It's located in the service drive at Cadillac of South Charlotte, and don't expect anything fancy. There are a few small dine-in tables and everything is served in styrofoam to-go boxes. It's a small, simple operation that produces unique and amazing meals! Definitely try the chicken bacon ranch! It'll change your world!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible as it's located in the service lane at a dealership. The savory smell hits your nostrils as soon as you enter and the food you get relative to what you spend is a win win win for the customer."}
{"text":"Always good food. Charles actually cares about the food he cooks and the people that visit him. He'll go out of his way to cook something not on the menu for breakfast. His burgers are amazing but his blackened chicken pasta is the best!"}
