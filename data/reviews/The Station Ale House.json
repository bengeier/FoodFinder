{"text":"A group of four of us met up here for dinner on Saturday night. We're in our early 30's and it's more of a early 20's kind of place.   CONS: Service: Bad and slow.  Server took our order without writing it down then came back and had to take it again. Asked for no cheese on beet salad, came with cheese. The new salad was the old one with the cheese picked off because I found some traces in it. It took forever to get the bill.   The menu was a bit lack lustre too.  PROS: Location  Server gave us separate bills without asking"}
{"text":"Our team was looking for a spot for after game beers and given that we were up near Jane and Eglington (where there is nothing going on) we opted for the short drive south to Bloor West Village where the options for beers are plentiful!  I'm usually a Brydens fan (located next door) but when I looked on Yelp for options and saw how well reviewed The Station Ale House was already having only been open a short time (plus their pictures looked fantastic) I figured we'd give them a shot. Good thing too when we arrived, Brydens had no room on their patio but The Station was fully able to accommodate our team of 12.  It was a simple visit, many of us were there strictly for beers but most of us ended up getting something small to eat. The beer specials on Thursday were awesome, $5 pints of Mill St Organic or pitchers for something like $15? I think our group must have ordered 9-10 pitchers easily. A few folks in our group got full meals but Nachos seemed to be the order of the night to share with a friend.  I read the other review(s) about the nachos being amazing so I was confident with my choice. I would not say they were the best nachos ever, they were ok. But no better or no worse than most restaurants. The kitchen may have been overwhelmed by our orders because even nachos took a super long time to turn around.  This is to say, I cannot be too hard on The Station as I think they're doing great things overall and I would be interested to come back and try their well photographed and delicios sounding breakfast/brunch options some day soon. For now I'm more than happy with super cheap booze options/specials!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Meh is right. If you stick to the daily special this spot is okay but if you go to the menu, it can be overpriced. An example is the Mac and Cheese with bacon at sixteen dollars, which doesn't even come with a salad.  We had the cheese steak special at ten bucks and found it tasty but greasy. The fries with chopped rosemary were really good.  An okay selection of draft beer. The room is small but cozy.  The service is efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Wonderful bar - great food, great drinks, live and recorded music - just a great find for us"}
{"text":"OMFG!!!!!!!!!!! The Station opened in June. I wanted to go check it out, but I waited for this special day to go for the first time. That is because today is the 20th anniversary of Student Bodies and in the show there is a café named The Station!!!!! I was not sure what I was going to order at The Station. Maybe an alcoholic beverage (preferable), maybe dessert, or maybe some light food. I looked at the whole menu. There were a few drink options that relate to Student Bodies. I ended up choosing The Station Sangria. How could I not?!?!?!?!?! It has \"The Station\" in its name. So does The Station Caesar, but I hate caesars. As for the other drinks I considered, I drank or ate things with their flavours today. I was not expecting a green drink!!! This made me so happy!!! The bar is small and nice. The bartender is a cool dude who has genuine conversations with people. He also plays great music! Now get this: they had a sign on the door saying that at 8pm they would be closing for their staff party. They are having a party on the 20th anniversary of Student Bodies!!!!!!!!!!! I repeat: The Station is  having a party on the 20th anniversary of Student Bodies!!!!!!!!!!! OMFG!!!!! OMFG!!!!! OMFG!!!!! Nothing is a coincidence!!!!!!!!!!! This place was made for me!!!!!!!!!! I will be a regular!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on an icy Dec evening ~ for an impromptu girls night in the west end.  I love the low key vibe and that it's not very pub-y.  (Not that there is anything wrong with pubs).  We ordered some dips to share and I had the beet salad.  The beet salad was great, I think other menu items are worth trying.  The staff were pretty attentive.  The bar started to fill up as we were ready to call it a night, perhaps people were getting out of a movie across the street?  I don't know.  Either way, it's a nice place to go.  There's a variety of drinks to be had (ciders, beer, wine, cocktails), and I think everything was very reasonably priced.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical and almost walked out after having sat down and been ignored for 10 minutes, but things quickly turned around. Once the server came over, she was friendly and attentive. Glad we stayed!   I like that they have a nightly special - Wednesday is $5 glass of wine night, so of course I had 2. :)   I had the nachos - I know not very adventurous right? - but there was smoked bacon and they came with a decent sized side of guac, sour cream and pico! I have to say these were the best nachos I've ever had. The jalapeños were so fresh and there was ample cheese. Try them and you'll see!   My kid had the chicken fingers and fries from the kids menu with a side of gravy. He gobbled everything up in minutes - which is a good sign.   The menu looked great with lots of fun choices. The fried chicken with mash and gravy caught my eye so I'll likely get that next time.   Did I mention the $5 wine?"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the super bull, the food was awesome, have something for everyone and drink specials everyday of the week. Really friendly staff and enjoyed the great atmosphere. Give this place a visit if you in the area! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great place for some good drinks, food and friendly people!  Everything is unpretentious and relax here. The food is fresh, service is timely and atmosphere is chill.  They have daily drink and food specials. My favourites are their wings and nachos topped with brisket. All their ingredients are fresh and made in house too!   The staff and patrons are easy going and down-to-earth. Some nights, there's live music.  There's also a nostalgic looking movie cinema across the street to catch a movie before or after going to the Station."}
