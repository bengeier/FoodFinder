{"text":"Been here twice, have been treated with exceptional service both times. Jule offers samples a lot of the time, as well as complimentary snacks if you're a sit down customer. Would recommend their specialty drinks, they're great.   Only slight downside for me is that it's a little pricey ($4.20 for a regular drink) but that's pretty standard in a teashop, so it's pretty worth."}
{"text":"Their services was so slow. We ordered tea and cheese cake. Tea came almost 30 min after cheese cake. Two guys are serving and not many costumers in the cafe though... Tea is fine and cheese cake is really ordinary. I won't go again."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Never coming back. Ordered one of their milk teas and wasn't aware that it comes with something else bc it was not listed on the menu, I took only one sip because the taste was disgusting. Lady server did not even ask what was wrong with the drink, she just ignored it. Ordered takoyaki and waited 20 mins, then finally it arrived and guess what, the ones on the middle of the plate were hot and others were not, not even cooked well. Did not even gotten any discount. Nice atmosphere and interior design but the food that they are serving are not worth the price, doesn't even taste good and a bit pricey. Cake tasted old and it seemed like it was sitting on the fridge for days. Never coming back to this place  (Honest opinion)"}
{"text":"Very delicious and unique western style desert! Can't stop of having one after another. Definitely worth a try~"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome service, good drinks and pastry with fair price. can't ask for more for an incredible spot to chill with friends."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times on different occasions. The older guys whom I assume to be the owners seem pretty nice.   Bubble tea - not a lot of flavours to choose from especially compared to their competitors like Chatime and 168, but I like that they have a decent variety of add-ins to choose from. I have to admit that I don't always go for the other options though, since their tapioca pearls are so perfectly chewy.   Ambient - simple, modern, and warm. Most of the friends that I brought made spontaneous positive comments about the interior.   Dessert - overpriced IMO. I understand that it is an expensive area and they do offer something different - like creme brûlée cheesecake and mini cakes that look like dice. Don't get me wrong, their creme brûlée cheesecake was great, but I'd rather A. Get something better at a legit dessert place or B. Get something cheaper from Loblaws.   Decent place on the overall. The owners seem to be running the place wholeheartedly. I'd come back from time to time for the tea as well as to try the new food menu."}
{"text":"First time at jule. The waitstaff was really nice. I got the milk tea for take out. Service was super quick. I really like the decor, especially the plant wall they have in the back. The drink was good but not sure if it's worth the price ($4+tax for reg size). Apparently their signature drinks are really good and I might just have to go back to try them. Their milk tea was basic."}
{"text":"Grateful to the fellow yelpers on finding this gem! With construction scaffolding finally gone, I hope they Jule gets the attention they deserve! Decor is bright and modern. Also, every single server was smiling and so polite!  I am a Chatime fan but I have to say that the black diamond milk tea here is better! The pearls were cooked perfectly. Agar jelly is also a great choice; it had an almost roasted flavour that made it super yummy!  We also shared a house special rice noodle soup, medium spicy. It was a bit salty but the flavour was good. The meat was tender; it would have been nice to have a few more veggies. But the price and portion were fair and I would come back for a quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The menu is overpriced. Some of them don't speak proper enlgish. It creates difficulties when trying to communicate with them."}
{"text":"This review is ONLY for their pastries, as I have not tried anything else. Every time I come here, I feel obligated to have their cakes just because of the amazing ones I've had in the past. And everytime I leave a happy girl. Their desserts are definitely on the expensive side, compared to other places in downtown Toronto. But the quality is top notch and worth every penny -  this is coming from a dessert monster that I am, having tried pretty much every decent dessert place in downtown Toronto.   I especially recommend the creme brulee cheesecake - it is very creamy and has a softer, melt-in-your-mouth texture than the average cheesecake."}
{"text":"What a unique place! We came during the night of Nuit Blanche and fortunately for us there were a couple of tables available. You can either choose to sit in or get take out. (Btw, you can only get vicinity points with take out!)  I got the regular sized Jule Black Diamond with tapioca and half sugar which eventually came out to a bit more than $6. It was delicious and the tapioca was nice and chewy, but the only thing I didn't like was that 1/3 of the drink was just blended ice and didn't taste like anything. I kind of felt like I was getting ripped off for the price I paid. Maybe next time, I'll ask for less ice, or if possible, not in slushy form.  It really does have a very nice interior, however. It looks clean (the washrooms are pretty clean too), and feels very cozy. The couches seem a little too low for the tables since I had to bring my glass down from the table in order to be tall enough to reach the straw, LOL, but it's still very comfy nonetheless. There are even pillows on the couches in the half booths.  Not to mention the service here is very welcoming. Our server was super sweet and helped us out a lot with the menu as well as the wifi password.  I would definitely come here again for studying. The prices are a little expensive, but if you choose to study here, it's worth it to pay a little more to use the study space."}
{"text":"Jules has become my go to spot for bbt in the city. My girlfriend and I come here all the time to study, or just relax. The prices are the same as a typical bubble tea place ($4.75 approx) but the cup sizes are huge. They have a large variety of milk teas, slushes, hot stepped tea (unlimited refills), and food. Definitely a must try !"}
{"text":"I come here often because it is literally right across the street from me. The milk tea is okay, I like the Jule Black Diamond though. The great thing about this place is its ambiance, really elegant and calming, with a more private seating area, which is why I often come here with friends to chat.   The owner is really nice, always greeting people with a smile. I once had a really bad bbt with extremely under-cooked tapioca, and he switched it for me right away and gave me a 10% discount. That's the kind of service needed to keep a returning customer.   Overall not bad for a hangout place, I'd recommend it if you want ambiance over the drink itself."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Price: ~$25 for 2 people  Ordered the matcha crepe cake, regular crepe cake, and hot milk tea with tapioca. The crepe cakes here are softer than one's you'll find at other places, but delicious nevertheless. Only downside to the service was that it took the server 15 minutes to take our order after seating us."}
{"text":"This place has great atmosphere! And free wifi too! We ventured into Jule's because we wanted some bubble tea. We ordered the Jule's taro for $4.70 and added aloe vera for another 50cents. They were so generous with the aloe vera! The bailey cheesecake was nice but there was a bit too much whipped cream. But for the price of $4.99 it's pretty worth it. They offered us free samples of tea as well. Excellent service! :)"}
{"text":"Always passed the shop when I'm the area so I decided to try it out with my sis after shopping.   There are very few tables but the layout is very lovely.   We ordered keylime cake and the chocolate lava cake. I suggest eating the cake at the cafe!! The lava cake was scrumptious and warm as we ate into it!!!   The milk bubble tea was alright. I ordered 50% sugar but it tasted like 25%. They didn't have tapioca at the time when I ordered so they made a new batch. We weren't in any rush and didn't mind waiting for the drinks. The owner apologied and was very kind. He gave us a macaroon for the wait. Awesome service recovery!! I would definitely come here again! :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last Saturday to chit chat. I would say this is a hidden gem. The service was a little slow but the ambiance and food was great. My only complaint is that they said there would only be three water refills for the hot tea."}
{"text":"I was attracted by its fancy decoration, but it truly disappointed me.  The couch is not comfortable if you want to sit there for a long time. the chair is a better choice. I ordered the lava cake, cheesecake and a chocolate drink. The drink is watery, so watery that it makes me think of the hot chocolate powder I got at home. The lava cake is dry, super dry and bitter. The cheesecake is ok though. Compared to its wonderful deco, they should really improve their food quality."}
{"text":"It's very pricey, and the customer service is really mediocre. I'm quite disappointed because I like coming to a place like this to work. But it doesn't compare to Green grotto at all. The drinks are really sugary, and their tea only taste okay given their price range. I had the Longan Tea, which consisted of water, sugar, longan and dates came up to 10.00 post-tax and tips."}
{"text":"Didn't allow for a two-person party to sit in a booth, even though there were two empty booths up front that no one sat in. Said they had to add $2 to my bill if I wanted to sit in the booth."}
{"text":"Original review: Jule is run by immature owners who respond to customer feedback with hostility and legal threats. They reward racist keyboard warriors who have far too much time on their hands with free meals. Does this really sound like a good place to give your business to when there are so many better options nearby?  Revised: I should add, I actually came here during the late winter months after a movie at Carlton Cinemas. Ordered a bubbletea that was far too sweet and a fried noodle that was soaked in oil and soy sauce with very little meat/veggies. My co-worker ordered takoyaki which came out cold other than for one or two pieces. The food was way overpriced for what was received. Food at Jule is cafeteria-quality at best. I stand by my original review above 100%."}
{"text":"Place was meh. I don't know if I came on one of their 'off-days' (every place just has a day where their food/drinks are just not on par) but the drink I had was very watery and the blueberry cheesecake lacked any kind of flavour. The people there were quite nice, but I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out because I love bubble tea and was going to see a movie at the Carlton Cinemas next door. Upon arrival my boyfriend and I wanted to sit in the inner area where the couches are but were told we had to spend at least $20 to sit there. We were kind of debating it because we were actually going to only get drinks but the waitress basically said \"nevermind it's okay\" and allowed us the couch seating. Then, we decided to order some food to share. The bubble tea took 15 mins to come and my boyfriend's water that he asked for never came with it. 10 mins later the waitress informs us \"the manager is giving me a hard time because you guys aren't spending the minimum $20 so can you move to the other tables?\", so we did. Then, my boyfriend had to ask for his water twice for her to bring them, food took ridiculously long, and the bill had to be asked for TWICE and took 20 mins to come. Also, she informed us the food order we got comes with ice cream and she would bring it after we were done with the meal. Of course, she never checked up on us so we had to ask her for the ice cream (we got a little bit excited, since maybe the ice cream would make this experience just a little bit better) - but of course, she hands us a tiny little sample size scoop/cup of baskin robins ice cream. Really? A SAMPLE SIZE? For your PAYING customers? We got the bill and it came to $19 plus tax. We spent $19, a dollar shy of the minimum to sit on the couches and STILL were asked to move. Absolutely disgusting way of treating paying customers. Tipped her 50 cents because of the awful service and treatment and she was so triggered she never even said \"thank you\" both when I handed her back the debit machine and when we got up to leave.   The place has so much potential as they have a wide variety of drinks and decent food with a great atmosphere and free wifi. But they're pretentious and undeserving of any customers, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, because the sweets looked great in their shop refrigerator. However, once I set foot inside the shop , the experience was horrid.  I was there with a friend of mine on an average Wednesday afternoon. First, the waitress reminded us in an unfriendly tone that there was a minimum consumption of 4.50. OK, fine, no problem.  I proceeded to order a milk tea (4.70), and my friend two macarons (6.00).  At this point, the waitress asked if we'd like to have three macarons instead, in a combo, for only a dollar more. Since we wanted to have a conversation, we were not thrilled by the math exercise, but no problem, bring on the third macaron.  OK, then shortly thereafter, we were told that a combo is only possible if one person consumes everything in the combo. Since it was very clear from the beginning that I ordered the tea and my friend the macarons, I don't understand why we were offered the combo. In any case, I ended up paying for the tea and the (now) three macarons separately.  I don't go to dessert cafes to solve high-school math puzzles after work, so I was quite exasperated by this experience.   But that's not even the worst of it! My friend ordered the passion fruit macaron. There were three of them in the refrigerator. Waitress comes back and says that \"we should order a different one because they are unsure (sic!) about the quality of that macaron\". So then, why was it in the refrigerator? And why did they not bother to take it out? It was still in there when we left!   When I mentioned the issue with the billing to the waitress, she offered nothing in the way of an apology. She said that \"I should read the rules more carefully next time\".  As you have probably guessed, there will not be a next time."}
{"text":"Very overpriced with minimum quality, and the staff is not friendly nor welcoming at all. Last time I go there. Won't recommend it ever."}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks!  Got the brown sugar bubble tea - was great!  Taiwanese braised pork on rice - nicely cooked, not too salty either  The cheesecake was nothing special   Will definitely visit again to try other items"}
{"text":"I love this bubble tea shop and am slowly becoming a regular! The drinks are made with real ingredients, like taro, as opposed to flavour powder. The drinks are easily customizable for ice and sugar quantities, plus toppings like their delicious tapioca and various jellies. Their desserts are also great; the macarons are light, crispy and flavourful and the creme brulee cheesecake is TO DIE FOR! You can see the vanilla bean throughout the cake!!   The atmosphere of the shop is great for lounging or studying; it is beautifully decorated with super comfy seating, huge tables, and bright lighting!  Other great things about this place are that it takes vicinity reward points for takeout beverages and it is wheelchair accessible, so I love taking my business here (Tip: you need to take the ramp just west of the Carlton cinema). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Its a very adorable and relaxing atmosphere The place is very new (apparently opened for a month) and is filled with friendly, fluent staff. I say this because when entering some drink spots (mostly when Asian influenced) I come across a language barrier, it is a bit hard to describe my dairy allergies in such situations. Anyway, the place is filled with nice furnishings, soft piano music and VERY pleasant workers.  I can't say that its a 5 star place just quite yet because my drink (approx. 500 mL of Mango Green Tea) was not very that special for 4.20 (it totaled to 4.75 with the tax for a fairly simple drink) however I have to add I love that they have a lot of options for your drink (such as the amount of sugar added, cold or hot, toppings)  A pro is that they have WiFi, a con is that none of my devices connected well to it.  Overall, very relaxing place to be. They opened the 2 doors at the front while I was there, had some cool breezes coming in as well"}
{"text":"First time going here and it's really close to yonge/college on carlton st. Also currently hidden behind a massive blue tarp wall undergoing construction.... but it's open!!  The place looked very modern, cozy yet casual. I thought the location looked smaller in person but the seating was very spaced out with about 12 tables in total. I think that helped in creating a more intimate hang out spot for students, families, friends, etc.   Prices were comparable to chatime and had basic milk teas with tapioca, grass jelly and adjustable sugar and ice levels. They also had their signature drinks which I ordered called the jule matcha ($5.20), regular size with 80% sugar. The sweetness was spot on and the drink, a matcha and red bean slush was blended well with no residual ice chunks. Towards the end of the menu they had a combo: $1 off cake slice with the purchase of any regular sized beverage. I ordered a passionfruit mango cheesecake slice ($5.99). So delicious and normally $6.99. It wasn't too sweet, dense or rich, had a creamy texture and a tangy filling - paired really well with my drink!   Overall, the atmosphere and ambience of this place was very chill, laid back and spacious enough for privacy. We didn't feel rushed at all. The drinks were well made and the cakes - primarily cheesecakes were moderately sweet and very smooth."}
{"text":"Food is good and inexpensive. Drinks are standard coffee shop prices I.e. Average of $5 per specialty drink"}
{"text":"Very cute tea shop. I ordered the honey milk tea, and it was delicious! I would definitely recommend coming here. The only thing that was lacking was the service, but I think the tea makes up for it!"}
{"text":"I came here on Wednesday and immediately was greeted. The place is cute and cozy, suitable for a date night. I got Jule Black Diamond (delicious, my favorite) 80% sugar but still found it a bit too sweet, the sweetness is comparable to Chatime's- roasted grass jelly milk tea. My friend got the Caramel milk tea- it was overly sweet (she asked for 50% sugar) and there was no ice in there for some reason. I am returning today for a couple Jule Black Diamonds 50% sugar, quite excited :)"}
{"text":"I find this cafe very over priced for what they offer. They have decent tasting drinks, but you get very little for what you pay. Glasses are often interestingly shaped, resulting in even less drink despite being priced as a premium bubble tea shop. Their customer service is slow, and it's often hard to flag down a waitress.   Despite saying that WiFi moochers are welcome, they really don't encourage people to stay by having limited wall plugs and uncomfortable chairs. Tables are small, so only one or two laptops can fit, making it an uncomfortable study session. All wall plugs are located near the tables with couches near the front, but good luck getting those as larger groups are prioritized (and these groups likely don't need the plugs). I have been turned away from these tables near wall plugs, despite them being open.I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for something sweet after a movie. We bought three macaroons -- which we were surprised to find out cost $10. (The prices were not listed.) Well, they must be very good, we thought! Sadly they tasted like a mouthful of sugar with little to no flavor. Very disappointing for such a display of grandiosity."}
{"text":"Neat new gourmet tea cafe. A bit hidden and easily missed, but they've got some fantastic brews. This is likely going to be my new go-to place for when I need to just get work done.  Went in because I needed a place to sit down and Starbucks next door was closed. This place is relaxing, comfortable, brightly lit, open late, and they give you a bowl of FREE POPCORN! Plus the servers check on you but don't really bother you, total bonus.  The teas were amazing! The waitress gave me a free sample of their cold special tea. I don't know what was in it, but it was like drinking a field of flowers and berries at the same time.   For my order, I opted for the hot ginger tea which at first glance on the menu gave me some sticker shock ($4.50 for tea is looks a bit steep ;)) but when it came out, it was a massive mug probably 1.5 times the size of a cappuccino mug (or as I like to say \"bowl cup\"). The tea was zippy and flavorful, way better than a bag of tea from the nearby big-box cafes.  They also have cake by the slice, but I didn't have any. They looked really good though and a few people came in and out just for dessert.   All in all, for spending less than $5 on arguably one of the top 5 cups of tea I've had, free popcorn, free wifi, and 2.5 hours of productivity, I'm really hoping this new spot stays for a while."}
{"text":"In front of Jule is under construction and it is hard to go to the entrance. It is a beautiful nice place. Inside is very Taiwan atmosphere. I ordered Ginger tea and Tapiocas were great. However, the tea was too sweet. I am not sure if they put sugar too much in my tea or it was the way it was. When I was there, tapioca was not ready. The waiter asked me if I want chili instead of ginger tea. I think alternative should be similar to ginger tea I ordered. Chili and ginger tea sounded very different. I waited until Tapioca was ready. Their cakes are expensive. Mill crepe was $8.95. Is it real?"}
{"text":"Visited Jule last night. I'm a fan of basic bubble tea: simple and not on the sweet side. I picked the Strawberry green tea and added Tapioca.. no other sweetness. For those who like to customize, most of their drinks offer you the option of how sweet you want them. They have  roughly 8 different kinds of topppings/bubbles - slushis - more \"desserty\" (almost like sunday) or simple teapot. Nice place to hangout and sip on your drink, perhaps eat a piece of delicious cake or have a macaron! Will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Oh man. Jule. I fell in love with this place.  I like the overall vibe of the place, very calming and relaxing. The crepe cake was so soft and delicate. The bubble teas were tasty. I recommend trying the Black Diamond bubble tea because wow, that's something totally different from all the other places. The tapioca was probably the highlight though because it was chewy and had its own unique taste. The price was pretty much the same as any other teahouse so not really a big deal.  The servers were very understanding and willing to explain how it all worked. They were really nice! Made you feel more comfortable for sure.   Overall a great experience here!"}
{"text":"the signature drink was good and the pearls were well-made. they also have a decent selection of cheesecakes. i chose to go with the blueberry and was satisfied."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place when I was in the area.  It looked they have great interior from outside:)  I tried green tea which is matcha shake with redbean as a topping.  The tea was very good and I was satisfied.   Especially redbean quality was so good.  Will probably visit again if I'm in the area and get a milk tea craving.  It takes longer than any other tea shop place.  But staffs were kind and friendly.  Conclusion: Interior was nice and compy and they are doing good job what they do!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff and the best bbt I ever tasted. 5 stars all around. For dog-lovers only."}
{"text":"Found my favourite bubble tea place in downtown Toronto, this place is amazing. A very comfortable and neat environment, what's better is that there's this SUPER CUTE bartender. I love their Jule hazelnut chocolate drink, it's simply amazing. So if you go ask for Angela, she makes awesome drinks and is super cute."}
{"text":"Best milk teas in town and the place is cozy and comfortable. Place is good for solo rides or group chit chats. They have various kinds of hot and cold drinks and different sweet treats, cakes, and macaroons. I could definitely see myself coming back here again! Just a tip, opt for half sugar for the cold drinks. I had the brown sugar special drink and it was sweet enough for me. My friend had the caramel drink with 50% sugar as well but it was still a lil bit too sweet."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better bubble tea places in the core of Toronto. My friend and I are absolutely in love with the service we get every time we go. The employees are friendly and accommodating.   Their hot teas are delicious, special fruit tea is great and so is the ginger milk hot tea. The glasses are huge so you are getting your moneys worth.   The desserts are average. The earlier you go, the fresher they taste (as expected). The interior is decorated very nicely and provides a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was slow and rude, the food is overpriced (and not very good), and menu items are not as advertised. There are far better options in this area. Avoid at all costs!!   I came here before and it was very meh. The food sucked and it was pricey but I was there for work so I didn't care to leave a review. Seeing the way the owners handle feedback and treated other customers, as shown in the more recent reviews, I wish I had never given them my business. They are extremely hostile towards fair criticism and reward malicious attacks as long as they are in support of their restaurant. Very unprofessional.  Off topic - does anyone remember Amy's Baking Company from Restaurant Nightmares?"}
{"text":"The exact cakes at Jule can all be found at Loblaws for $2.99 a piece, and they charge $8.99 a piece. The markup is simply ridiculous. Their drinks are more expensive than any other bubble tea shop and poorly made. Their food is simply disgusting. Everything here is just awful and overpriced."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Jule and ordered a bento box each, the bento box was EXTREMELY small in portion - to the point that sections of the bento box were left empty. So we ordered \"pan-fried noodles\" but before ordering we asked for clarification because we wanted to know what type of noodles they used. The fully english speaking server told egg noodles but then returned with overdone soggy and greasy spaghetti. We left needing to buy another dinner. We left reviews on their various social media platforms but when they did respond they all they said were that our truthful reviews were harassment to them. They told us \"if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it.\" like huh???   Then, a racist privileged white women who's never even been to the restaurant told my friend to get a \"F$@#@$% life, you asian princess\" making a VERY unnecessary racial remark and Jule rewarded her with a free meal! The woman continually threw racist slams at different ethnicities ON their social media towards other customers. Not only did they not stop her nor take down her posts, but they said they don't have the time and do not think it is necessary to apologize to every negative review."}
{"text":"A decent place to hangout after a long day at work. Their sweet drinks are the best. I would advise against getting anything non sweet from this place, not that filling nor it is tasty."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Jule. Drinks were too sweet even after getting the reduced sugar option. Cake slices are small for what you pay for.  Staff doesn't know too much about their own drinks when I asked them about the different types."}
{"text":"It's just a bubble tea store pretending to be a real restaurant. The food is overpriced and average bordering on frozen TV dinner quality. The desserts aren't even made in house and look store bought. The only thing worth spending your money on maybe are the drinks. Why come here when there are so many other better REAL restaurants to choose from when you're downtown.  If you take away all the so called \"food & desserts\" it's just another bubble tea place like any other.    Also what irks me the most are restaurants that charge higher prices but do not deliver exceptional service and product. It is a blatant \"slap in the face & bend over & take it without lube\" offense to me! Isn't anyone else outraged?"}
{"text":"Jule is a nice cafe which has tea, hot food and desserts (which are very nicely displayed at their counter). The ambiance is very nice, clean and relaxed, and it would be a great place to have a sit-down chat with friends.  If you come sit in, they serve the drinks in nice mugs and cups which makes it fancy oh la la.  They also have a take-away daily special for bubbletea (see photo). I got the Thursday large black milk tea tapioca special which came out to $5.15, which is around the price of just a regular black milk tea without pearls. The major con was that the wait was ridiculous. Maybe the tea was freshly brewed...but 15 minutes into waiting, with no one in front of us, the guy making drinks says he ran out of milk tea so we need to wait some more. Alas, our drinks were ready and I'd say it was kind of worth it (this would not be the case if I was in a hurry!). I care a lot about the tea flavour and it was definitely there, very rich. 50% sugar was just the right amount of sweetness. Chatime still has the best pearls--the pearls at Jule were good but just a tad undercooked so the core was harder than it should be.   UPDATE: The manager of Jule contacted me and it was nice knowing that such a standard of customer service is being upheld at Jule!  Came two more times and pearls seem to be slightly undercooked each time and the tea flavour depends on who is making it. It was very strong and good the first time, but was more watery the other times. Service was good and didn't have any more issues with long wait times."}
{"text":"We ordered food(bento box). The middle section was supposedly seaweed as a side dish and I could count how many strands of seaweed were there. My friend also ordered the same and she got the same thing. Might as well not put it on there. Cheap taste, cheap portion, extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Maybe I have lost my taste for this style of desserts/drinks. This place just didn't do it for me. I tried the caramel drink and a slice of the key lime cheese cake both were overly sweet and not what I have experienced for this type of items. The setup is designed for certain clientele i.e. people who want to linger around and drink/eat for long periods of time. There are some combos that provide some added value.  I don't think I will revisit."}
{"text":"The crepe cake is like an ice cube! the triple yogurt is not fresh either! I won't recommend anyone to go there anymore!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for fresh desserts. There is a good selection of cakes at affordable prices and great quality. The chocolate hazelnut cake is my favourite because I like chocolate in general. Their cakes are not too sweet, which is perfect for those who want a light dessert. They also offer macarons and other delicious drinks at great quality and taste. This is a great alternative to Butter Avenue and Nadege."}
{"text":"Not a fan of bubble tea, but Jule offers much more! Was treated to dessert by my son in this very interestingly-decorated place. I found their chocolate-hazelnut cake delicious, and the hazelnut smoothie was a more-tasty alternative to Tim Horton's Nutella Ice Capp - more creamy. Decadent, yes! But oh, so goood!"}
{"text":"I love their drink! Very high end boba drink. I didn't like their thousand layer Crepe cake that much. It was ok but not worth the price. However, please boba lovers, y'all need to check this place out!!! I love boba tea and I tried many famous place from OC, California to Houston, TX and nothing taste this good!"}
{"text":"Second time been here:) Had some sweets and drinks with friends after shopping. I like Mille Crepe Cake the most and then the Lave Chocolate cake. ;) I ordered Jule Black Diamond, not as tasty as the first time I tried it but still good enough. ^^ Will visit the place again for sure!"}
{"text":"This business is not professional; they treat customers as disposable. At best, they ignore bad reviews and at worst, they tell people to go elsewhere, that they can't please everyone, and that if they don't have anything nice to say they just shouldn't say anything at all.  This is not a good way to run a business. One woman named Angela wrote a negative review, only to get a slew of negative comments from another woman (calling her an \"Asian princess\", other profanities, and telling her to die). This woman continued to assume that another commenter eats cat as he was Chinese, and then call another commenter a \"terrorist\" because of his ethnicity. This woman was rewarded by Jule, who offered her and two others a free meal and thanked them for their \"support\".  While Jule claims they are not racist, their obvious support of someone who said such profanities shows otherwise.  Very disappointed with this establishment."}
{"text":"Oh-My-Gosh!  Never ever again. I wonder how this place is rated so high.  We came here to celebrate a bday. There were 6 of us.  Maybe it wasn't the right night but.... Out of 6 people, 4 got their order screwed up and not because the waitress wasn't fluent in English but because I think she just didn't care. 1 wrong order and yes, it could have been an oversight, a misunderstanding, but 4???  The quality of the food was in my opinion not very good. The service, like I said, we better be sweeping the problem under the carpet, and price wise, well it was o-k.   Overall a very disappointing experience and to be totally honest, I won't definitely return here again.   Oh yeah, there is another thing they screwed up: the bill. Some items haven't been charged while other were added to it.  RIDONCULOUS!"}
{"text":"Awsome dinner deal, unagi don with rice, salad and ice cream. Had caramel pudding drink. Sugar level was just right. Their cakes are delicious too."}
{"text":"I was here recently with a friend for some bubble tea. Overall, it was pretty good and the decor was really cool.  I had the caramel pudding bubble tea (30% sweet) $5.49 and my friend had the hazelnut chocolate bubble tea (100% sweet) $5.49 + $0.49 for tapioca pearls. The server told me they ran out of caramel pudding, so I could choose another topping to substitute the missing pudding and I choose lychee jelly.  The server was really nice, but we waited a long time for our drinks. She came and told us that they had forgotten about us and she apologized and said that she would discount our bill.  When the drinks finally came, they looked great. I loved how my drink was slushy and not overly sweet (I'm glad I went with 30% sweetness). The jelly was chewy and plentiful. The slush tasted like milky caramel.  When the bills came she said she discounted us 10% and I thought that was really nice. After I paid my bill and left, I realized she had actually discounted me 20% because the discount was $1.10, so with tax my drink was only $4.96.   The decor is modern and cool. They have lots of desserts there too. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Still the same drink order, but slightly higher rating. Their tapioca is a little too chewy for my preferences, but their matcha flavour has really grown on me. It's subtle, but present. There are no artificial flavors that linger in my mouth and it's overall a very refreshing drink.  I did, however, try the food here today for the first time. They serve a selection of Taiwanese-based dishes so I ordered the noodles with ground beef. It had a rather.. unusual savoury taste to it, which I was reluctant to at first, but it was redeemed by the fact that it was steaming hot when served to me. Whatever sauce they used in this dish was nothing like the ones I've had before, which were all more pungent and vinegary, not to mention a lot redder in color. The portion size was fair and the price was just at the upper range of what I would consider reasonable for what it's worth at this location. Would I order this again though? Nah.   Though the food didn't impress me, I'll still frequent Jule because of its comforting atmosphere and wonderful accommodations.. and probably just stick with the drinks next time! (Not that I have a choice anyway since there's a minimum sitting fee)"}
{"text":"Overpriced, and poor service. Unusual for a cafe, this has table service. Now they are trying to price themselves as some kind of premium, high end place. However, this is incompatible with their poor level of service. Chinese owned, the menus are bilingual English / Chinese, but its clear no native English speaker has proofread the menu. In addition, there is key information missing on their menu and specials. I'd have no issue with this, except their high prices mean they should provide a high level of service. For 5$ cups of tea or 12$ pots of tea, I expect a high level of service.   The positive is that its a nice space. The negatives include poor customer service, I was made to feel unwelcome, and would not return again. The staff lacked basic graces - you cant  charge ridiculously high prices and have worse customer service than Starbucks or McDonalds. The music was way too loud and intrusive, I could not read.   I doubt this cafe will survive, I expect it will be gone within a couple years."}
{"text":"Lots of drinks to choose from, mocktails, hot teas, shakes and a few cakes. Nice decor, chill atmosphere, and excellent customer service. Prices are average, around $4.5, but the sizes are huge (I couldn't finish the milk tea both times I went). You can also get a cake and drink combo for a better value. Too bad it's a bit hidden next to Carlton cinema, however I'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"It's alright, cozy atmosphere, and is one of a very few tea/coffee places in the area that's open past 10pm (with barely any crazy people inside). However looks like they jacked up the prices for the drinks recently - a cup of normally brewed coffee for $8-9?! (easily $10+ after taxes and tips; no refills for teas, not sure about coffee)  C'mon!"}
{"text":"I am almost convinced the staff from this place go to loblaws to purchase their cakes and then sell them by piece. They have the exact same assortment as Loblaws but they sell each piece over 3 times as much than Loblaws. That's right! THREE TIMES!  The other day I went to this place because it was open late and simply was astonished my the price tag!  Their drinks are also much more expensive than all other higher quality bubble tea places in the area. I even tried the food once upon a time and never went back - it tasted like dog food. Seriously, avoid this  place at all cost!"}
{"text":"Drinks were good, not as flavourful. Decor was nice and comfy but the prices were way too high. Friendly servers though."}
{"text":"Very bad policy, you should spend more than five dollars for each person.  Very normal tea and dessert. Over priced."}
{"text":"I had he passion fruit green tea, wasn't the best in my opinion definitely had better. But you definitely need to try out the taro milk tea if you're going here it is DELICIOUS! The staff here are really kind and great too. Just a little disappointed about the passion fruit green tea."}
{"text":"Excellent tea, free WiFi, friendly service. Conveniently located near my campus in the downtown core. I wish the place was bigger because my friend and I had to wait until a table cleared until we could sit down (there's only maybe 6 tables for small groups inside the cafe). But space and wait time aside (and you can sit while waiting), everything else was fine. The staff was friendly and efficient. I particularly enjoyed the decor and modern vibe of the Asian bubble tea shop - it reminds me of Destiny's...except here, the bubble tea is considerably and comparably better (yes, I'm throwing shade #sorrynotsorry) in quality. There is a minimum $3.99 charge per person which I think is reasonable for permitted sitting time (2-3 hours). :)"}
{"text":"I have actually been to this place several times before, but I think they have changed the owner. The menu is different, and the price is way too high. For $13.5, I expected something delicious, but was disappointed when the server brought food to the table. It was just a bowl of rice plus slices of sausage and some vegies, which should only cost about 7 dollars in other places. Just disappointed, I used to like this place."}
{"text":"Drinks and crepe cakes are very good but a bit overpriced... I usually get the Jule Black Diamond whenever I come. The matcha crepe cake also good. I like this place because the atmosphere is perfect for chilling with friends and doing work. However, I personally don't come here to do work because of their 3 hour time limit."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on my way to get some Bubble Tea around the corner at Royal Tea. Hostess was really nice but after a 20 minute wait (there were no other customers) I asked for my money back and left. Machine to cover the bubble tea cup stopped working - I left with three staff members still fumbling with it."}
{"text":"I believe this place has just opened in the last month. I pass by it all the time on my way to the Loblaws down the street and decided to check it out with my friend today.   The place itself is gorgeous and super comfortable. Service is quick and attentive, no problems there. I ordered the taro milk tea and my friend ordered the Jule Black Diamond. Both tasted great, but the Black Diamond had a more unique flavour and appearance. We also had a sample of the classic milk tea. I gotta say, I've honestly never had milk tea that great before.   Also, you get free popcorn to munch on ^^"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Love the modern design and service was very good.   We were going to stay for a drink each and ended up getting 3.   The location is a bit hard to find, but well worth the search."}
{"text":"I visited Jule on a Saturday night at around 11pm with some friends. It is a cute venue and the staff are super friendly. I had a Jule Taro Milk Tea (hot), my friend had the Jule Milk Tea (also hot), my other friend had a cold Taro Milk Tea, and we decided to share the Creme Brulee Cheesecake. The drinks were all really good and the cheesecake was good, we had only wished that the top of the cheesecake was actually crispy/hard like a creme brulee. We look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"Mid week dessert on a Monday night.  Had the taro bubble tea and blueberry cheesecake.  Both were decent.  The cheesecake was surprisingly tasty and not overly heavy, and the bubble tea was decent as well - not as good as some of the bbt places up in Markham but above average for downtown standards.  Location is decent, easily accessible by transit, but unfortunately there are a lot of homeless people outside which is a bit unsettling as a female travelling alone to meet a friend here.  Service was great, our server was polite and very friendly.  Took a slice of layered Millie crepe cake to go, which was only mediocre - the middle was still frozen by the time I got home, indicating that the cake wasn't made fresh sadly. If it weren't for this, I'd have rated 4 stars instead."}
{"text":"Something already didn't settle well with me when we had to wait a solid 12-15 minutes for a waiter to come over to take our order, given there were 3 servers and only 2 other parties of 2-3 people each. Also, it was my friend's birthday, so I secretly asked them to put a Happy Birthday sign on the crepe cake that we ordered. When the cake arrived, the waiter just put the plate down on the table - in front of me! It was clearly not my birthday since I asked for the surprise sign for my friend. It was super anti-climactic, and I was a bit unimpressed how the waiter didn't seem to care at all. At the end of our meal, we once again had to wait a long time to get our bill. Service was not good at all.  In terms of the food, you really can't judge food by the way it looks. The matcha crepe cake LOOKED delicious, but upon poking my fork through all the layers of the cake, I already sensed that it felt a little crispy. And I was right - the cake tasted so icy, like they just took it out of the freezer not too long ago, and it was still in the process of defrosting. Totally not the soft and melt-in-your-mouth type of experience I anticipated. The matcha crepe cake definitely can't compare to the ones I've had at Millie Creperie in Kensington and Lady M in NYC!  The only good thing I can say about this place is the interior design. It looks really modern and trendy, and is a calm and relaxing place to sit down and hang out with friends.  I really wanted to try their molten chocolate lava cake, but after this horrible experience, I'm doubtful that I will come back for it."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for some bubble tea or simple Chinese noodle dishes such as their beef noodle soup varieties. The atmosphere is not as hectic as other bubble tea shop chains and they have a good balance of quality between their bubble tea and kitchen dishes."}
{"text":"Came here once and the service was terrible. The food was NOT as advertised on the menu. The noodles were soggy and definitely not worth the price.  Also a racist corporation supporting racism and hate, theyre unable to handle critical reviews. Will never dine here again, espcially not after the incident on their facebook."}
{"text":"Ran by very unprofessional people, if you have not seen but there was a whole controversy regarding Jule's and a customer where Jule's ended up providing free meals to those who sided with them and stood by racists.   Had you sort out the customer problem and maybe offered them a free meal for the inconvenience then you wouldn't be getting bad reviews on Yelp and Facebook.   But seeing how they handled an issue has turned me away from wanting to try this place out. I wish you the best of luck with your store."}
{"text":"So I actually got invited back to the place by their manager and brought 4 of my friends with me. We had A couple of their signature drinks and NY cheesecake. This time, the boy with glasses served us. He might not be the most experienced waiter but was very attentive and courteous ( one of my friends thought he was adorable, lmao!) We were seated at the banquet table. The decor, as what I felt in the very first time, was very pleasant and the sofa were soooo comfy (the reason why I wanna it last time I brought my friend there).  Most of our milk teas came as combination of frap and traditional Taiwanese milk tea. Wasn't the authentic one but I think is quite innovative ( since it tasted good). Really liked the red bean that came with the tea (they marinated it, so it's sweet and soft). The prices are pretty much same as chatime with slightly bigger portion. I think chatime tastes a little better and has more options. But this is a sit-down place with very nice atmosphere (geez, chatime doesn't have air condition, and their chair sucks....  It's painful to line up there in summer)  Overall it was a much better experience! Compare to similar Chinese-style tea shop, they are doing great! (Personally, I think they can do even better by changing a few procedures, but I guess it depends on the owner's ambition lol)  Yes, i will definitely recommend them to my friends/colleagues!"}
{"text":"Cute, delicious, and nice date spot. I am from Washington DC and i yelped this place because I am a huge fan of bubble tea. They have so many different choices from slush to tea to milk tea. I love how they ask you how much sugar you want without you telling them. They have so many toppings! My boyfriend got the jule taro with soy milk (which is good they have because hes lactose) with lychee jelly and i got passionfruit green tea with lychee jelly. EVERYTHING WAS SO AMAZING IM IN LOVE. Only if i lived closer i would come all the time. They also offer some food and dessert. Overall great experience the elderly man was so kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"The signature Jule Black Diamond or whatever was tasted like stale milk...1 sip and it went straight to trash can.  The picture was definitely misleading."}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment with recent menu and price change.  This is my third time here and something changed drastically.  They changed the menu and with that a hefty price increase. A regular and large drinks were $4.20 and $4.70.  Now it's $4.70 for a regular and $5.70 for a large. Furthermore, the authenticity of the drinks is no where to be found now.  I got their taro (with real taro) and mocktails which were amazing but this time, their fake grapefruit green tea was nothing to rave about.  Truly disappointing  since I thought this was a good place for dessert.  I hope they realize their mistakes."}
{"text":"A good place to hang out and chill after class/work. Comfortable couch-like seats, free WiFi, good atmosphere & lightings. They offer desserts, Chinese food and hot & cold drinks (including mocktails!) . I've tried only (twice) the Jule black diamond and liked it. Bf got the mango juice with QQ jelly, and he liked it too. It's a kind of milky slush, with brown sugar, and agar jelly.   Today we ordered their pork siu mai, and we loved it too! So we ordered another set. It comes with two black sauces, one of them a tiny bit spicy. We think that the siu mai is overpriced, with 4 pieces for over $5.  Note that their daily special and vicinity card only work on take-outs"}
{"text":"I went to Jule for the first time a few Saturdays ago. It was very empty, probably due to the construction happening in front of the store. The place is spacious with nice decor, good for a sit-down drink and dessert with friends. I tried some of their taro bubble tea. I could taste the milk powder, and there wasn't much taro taste to it. I'm not a bubble tea snob by any means, but I was very disappointed with this drink. Also, the waiter who made the drinks for us got the order wrong, so he gave us the wrong drink for free."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is a great place to hang with friends on a late late night and have good dessert and drinks. Though I would say the curry isn't what I expected, little sweet but me all still filling."}
{"text":"Great, and super friendly waitstaff! The shakes are tasty and use good ingredients.  There was a table next to us with two guys, an alpha and a beta. The alpha was being a huge a-hole to both his friend the beta, and the waitress. The waitress was super sweet through all of this, which was impressive!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Had the grass jelly milk tea. They were nice enough to make it with sugar on the side since I don't like my drinks too sweet. Tried some of my friend's creme brulee cheesecake which was really tasty! The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake was also really good.   Service was good. The server came by quickly to take our orders and refilled our water a few times.   Decor here is cute and comfortable."}
{"text":"this place is very sweet and relaxing, very very good service too. the server(s) are kind and helpful (you can sample some of their special drinks!)  the seating areas are comfy and the interior design and atmosphere is lovely if you like dessert and special milk tea options, you should check this place out"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a café w/ more space besides the usual chains, and ended up at Jule. The interior was decorated well and had great ambiance for catching up w/ friends. The menu was also quite extensive and had various drinks, desserts, and food.  We ended up having the Jule black diamond, bbq pork buns, and 3 cups chicken w/ rice.   Jule black diamond (4/5)- I heard that their drinks are on the sweeter side so I ordered mine w/ less sugar than usual; 30% was just right for me. Flavor-wise, it had a rich caramelized brown sugar base w/ agar jelly for texture. I quite enjoyed it. Price is a bit steep though so it's better to go for the Monday deal.  Bbq pork buns & 3 cups chicken (2/5)- I think they should omit the food & just stick w/ the drinks. The bbq pork bun tasted like it was store-bought, and the 3 cups chicken was subpar; rice was also mushy and the salad was just bland. Might as well go over to loblaws and get something better."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today and it was... okay. I really want to be generous and give it at least four stars but am underwhelmed. I expected a lot to be honest.  I had a honey milk tea which was creamy and nice... I just wish it had ice because I assumed it would always come with it. Its cold MILK TEA after all.. it had to come with a bit of ice at least (and no, I don't care if its cold outside, I need the ice if its a cold drink am ordering..it's mandatory in all the places I've ordered , lol).  Along with my order I had the Crepe Cake which took awhile to come but it was actually really yummy...yet small.. shoved in a large plate and it honestly looked awkward.   On the upside, the staff is really nice and accommodating. And the place was aesthetically modern and clean and for sure its a nice place to hang out.. the sitting area if fairly larger than other places who serve desserts so thats always good.  I'll come back here and try them out again next time. I might give them an extra point to see if it gets better."}
{"text":"Really nice tea place - great ambiance for just chilling with your friends, or bringing your lap top to do some casual work (or studying if you need some background noise). With that being said, food and drink prices are pretty expensive like nearly $10 for a slice of cake and $7 for a drink. It's only worth it if you plan on staying here for some hours to relax/do work (there's wifi, but I couldn't login to it for some reason). I had a red bean matcha drink and was kind of disappointed with it. It was bland and literally only had a tiny spoonful of redbean on the top of the drink... Although barely sweet, they couldve made it more matcha-y. That was not worth it at all.   It was a nice experience and great looking tea shop, but I probably won't drop by too often."}
{"text":"The tea was ok.  Their matcha crepe dessert was more noteworthy and I would come back for this . I'd come back to try their other offerings. The decor of the place is very nice though,  nice place to hang out"}
{"text":"Husband and I were around the corner shopping for groceries and wanted to stop in for a cool drink. Upon looking at their menu options, we both decided we didn't want to share and ordered separate drinks!   Husband ordered a passionfruit green tea with lychee jelly and I ordered a mango slush. Both were very tasty and yes, sweet. The waitress did mention that they would be sweet but we didn't mind.  We also ordered some macrons and they were delicious!   Service was superb; kind, efficient and friendly. The waitress even noticed our table a little wobbly so she can and fixed it! I like the attention to detail :)"}
{"text":"Amazing servicing of milk tea, had the salmon rice dinner cake with salad, soup and dessert  Great place, service is a little slow since one waitress was taking care of almost all the customers.   Other than that, I look forward to going again:"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, great desserts and teas. Servers are quick and attentive. First time here, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out since it's very close to a busy area with tons of restaurants. The decor is cute , reminds me a lot of the bubble tea cafe in Markham and Richmond hill.   I ordered the black diamond drink, this was #1 on their menu so I thought it was a good choice. I loved the tapioca texture, it was chewy for my liking. I asked for 30% sweetness but it was still very sweet. My friend ordered a green tea and she enjoyed it as well.   We ordered the crispy chicken to share. This is a staple item I get whenever I am at a Taiwanese cafe but I was disappointed in the dish here. It was alright. I wouldn't recommend coming for food, but the drinks are great from the ones we tried."}
{"text":"Rewarded customers who targeted racist and hateful remarks to a girl who posted an honest review with complimentary dinners. Check it out on their Facebook page honestly it's appalling. Never."}
{"text":"I came here to finish up some work with a friend on a Thursday night. They close at midnight and have wifi so that's all I really needed before I was set!   I ordered a bubble tea and it was pretty good. The service was FANTASTIC, probably the best service I've ever received. The waited was cheerful and kind and came by many times to offer my friend and I water. We were very pleased by the service.   We ended up also ordered a slice of cake which was ok. Very sweet and creamy, maybe I'm just not used to the textures.   My only concern is that there were no outlets nearby. Other than that, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"H-ule, Jew-ule, Ju-lie...? Whatever you decide to call it won't matter because behind this funny name is really an outstanding establishment. From the city that is so littered with bubble tea shops it's difficult to rise above the crowd. It's a tall order but I think the authenticity in their approach really elevates them above most.  Their drink creation are true to their Taiwanese heritage. Each drink has great balance in flavours and sweetness (customization) is on point. With quality daily specials for under $5/large a drink this place is surely addictive. I had the burnt sugar slushy thing drink (I really don't recall the name and am too lazy to read through their menu online). A nice creamy smooth drink with a distinctive caramel-y finish. Hints of toasted nuts, burnt toffee and freshly roasted coffee beans. Very, very good. Probably the best interpretation of this drink I've had so far from anywhere. The other common milk teas are each distinctive in their flavours with almost a perfect ratio of creaminess to tartness from the tea. Aromatic in their finishes with tea flavours that lingers in your mouth long after your last sip.  They also serve up some mean and flavourful Taiwanese dishes. Staples like the mince pork rice, pork ribs and even a pretty darn good curry dish are all surprisingly delicious. I don't know how these guys do it but every single dish was under-cooked yet still so flavourful. And with that is my only complaint. There's a theme here from drinks to food and it's call everything al-dente. Meats are tough, rice is grainy, veggies are au naturel/ virgin. Even down to the tapioca and jellies in the drinks they are a bit more chewy than usual. Somehow, someway though it was still a great meal and fantastic drinks. Perhaps this blemish is a blessing. Otherwise, I may just be here more than I should be.  Get it or you will regret it."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a \"Coffee Shop\" that was close to my hotel.  Jule came up as one of the closer places.  Even though I love my Starbucks Latte, I really don't like hanging out in one.  I find the locally owned shops to have much more character.  So I sought out one, and Jule was it.    Walking in, it was much more a restaurant feel as I just couldn't sit anywhere.  I was directed to a table.  I had only wanted a drink and a dessert, so I asked about anything not caffeinated, and I was given two options.  Ginger tea or Longan tea.  I thought I'd give the Longan a try.  My dessert and tea were delivered quite quickly and the cake was definitely good.  The tea on the other hand... I'm not sure what longan tea is supposed to taste like... But this is something I am definitely not ordering again.    There seemed to be plenty of servers, and the place had a few people in it but not overly busy.  So there didn't appear to be any reason why someone couldn't have come by to check on the order (since this was actually a restaurant and not a coffee shop), but no.    Overall, Jule was good but nothing spectacular.  My tea wasn't to my liking, but since a server never came back to check, I didn't order anything to replace it.  So service was just meh. The place is cute, but I think that they could have so much more of a cool atmosphere if they tried.  ie: dim the lights a little, and play some better music.  The menu indicated that if you order a drink with your dessert you get $1.00 of the dessert... my bill wasn't reflective of this, and I'm not sure the serving knew enough English for me to explain that.   I'll keep looking for better coffee shops."}
{"text":"This place is calm, clean and warm. The drinks and desserts are great too!"}
{"text":"The matcha crepe cake is delicious, drinks are too sweet, we ordered 80% sugar, still too sweet. Gonna try 50% next time."}
{"text":"OKAY place to hang out when you want to try a new place... instead of starbucks or second cup :p  - Maximum 3 hours to stay. I had to wait before seated. Not much seating area, I recommend maximum 4 to 5 group of people   - quite and nice place.  - drink was a bit watered. Not as watered as many downtown places (I ordered jule's taro and carrot cake)   - service was good. Lovely people :)   - They ran out of dessert selections. Macaroons sounds good (especially earl grey one), I did not get to taste it.   - Nice location. I like clean washroom :p   - They were open during the holiday (thanksgiving until midnight!)  - brought books to read. I was able to read. I saw some students working on their homework. :)"}
{"text":"It's a really nice tea place. The drinks are good. Had their signature caramel drink and a new york cheesecake. Nice decor."}
{"text":"Cute decor. Convenient location beside Carlton Cinemas.   Mediocre food. Ordered the Curry Chicken Rice which comes with miso soup, a dessert (sticky rice), half a boiled egg and salad. The white sauce is slightly sweet, doesn't taste like curry but it works. Good that it has pieces of potato and carrot, but the chicken tastes really dry, like frozen fillets. And at $12.99, I think it is overpriced."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and co-workers. I went after work on Friday around 6pm and there weren't a lot of people! However, around 7/8pm, the place got pretty busy and many of the tables were filled so be prepared to wait for a table around that time.  The decor is simple and modern. A nice mix of couches and tables - the couches are on the softer side and you may feel like you are sinking into them. I found it slightly uncomfortable sitting on the couches. The washrooms are really clean.  I got the Jule Taro with tapioca, 50% sugar and it was fantastic. It is a taro smoothie and it tasted fresh, not like your regular \"artificial, purple\" taro drink you get at other BBT stores. You do not get a strong taro flavour but the texture is there. The tapioca was spot on, it was not mushy and had a nice chew to it.  The staff were really friendly and did not rush us even though it was getting busy. A lot of the people were there studying or having meetings since they have wi-fi.  I can't wait to go to try out the desserts again - great selection of cakes :)!  One thing to note - they only take the vicinity card if you are purchasing take out."}
{"text":"Short of expectations. Although Jule had great ambience, seating and wifi access, they had a strange \"minimum charge of $5 per person\" rule.   Menu was mostly overpriced drinks and cakes. Very little to no savoury/appetizers. On the bright side, they did place one of their menus outside so passerbys could take a look before entering  Music was pretty dated. They played Fuck You by Lily Allen .   I ordered the deep fried squid tentacles which was pretty good although the portion was a bit small for its price. Crispy but overly oily.   My companion ordered their coffee--\"I'd rather get coffee from Tim's\". Not worth its price.   Overall, I would not come back. Everything is pricey and I would not pay the extra dollar for \"nice ambience\"."}
{"text":"After seeing the yelp reviews, we came here for after dinner dessert. As soon as we came in there was only one table that could sit us based on the size of the group but the host continued to force us to join two table. We let it be since it was more spacious although the seats were less comfortable. I ordered jule Oreo. The drink was not good. It was described as a milkshake but it definitely missed the richness of a milkshake. It tasted like they just took a couple of cookies and blended them with water. You can actually see the separation from the drink. My friends had some complaints as well. The matcha cake was still frozen. My wife didn't finish her jule matcha. When we came to pay, it took us 15 minutes. The guy had no clue what he wrote on the paper. It was definitely frustrating and will never come back here. There are other places around the area that is much much better."}
{"text":"Brought my friend here for her first bubble tea experience, but INSTANT REGRET. Both times I've visited, their milk tea has tasted weird. I'd rather stick to Chatime."}
{"text":"Friendly hard working staff, Very unique and tasty bubble teas, Comfortable sofas and tables Thats why i like this place.   My favorite bubble tea that i recommend , Jule Taro with tapioca.  This taste is very natural and not too sweet.  One thing i also love this place is  I m a busy mom so sometimes when my baby doesnt want to wait inside so i just call them 5-10 mins before i pick up and they made my order Yay!!!   Their cakes and macaroons are awesome too. Just little pricy so i can only go there once a week :-)"}
{"text":"@JULETORONTO #JULE #BUBBLETEA #YELPTO   I enjoyed my experience at Jule... except for the really long wait times. A few of my friends were craving Bubble tea, and I am usually not a fan (but then I haven't given it a real shot either). I went along anyway.  When you live in Downtown core, there are a handful of choices for bubble tea around the area - all that are either cramped in terms of space, crowded because it's everyone's go-to place OR in an area where parking is expensive.   So Jule was an unexpected, happy find - it's neither crowded, nor cramped around the Jarvis-Carlton area. And street parking is free after 8pm. I am yet to find another that fits the bill. The place is cute, and I am a fan of the iron and elastic backing for the booths. Makes the whole area within the store look like an art project.   Jule offers a little bit of everything - tea, some dining room items and desserts - all at extremely reasonable prices. I ordered one of the signature drinks - Jule Hazelnut Chocolate with tapioca. It was basically milky chocolatey Nutella-ee heaven. I also ordered the pork with steamed rice. It came with a egg boiled in tea. First time trying it. Absolutely delicious. The only issue - both my drink and my dish took around 45 minutes to come out. And it's not like the restaurant was FULL. It was just 5 of us, and another lady at a table.   A last pointer - this cafe is super clever. You may just be lured in for tea and dessert, but the menu sits right in front of you, and you'll most likely end up ordering some food anyway. We'd all had dinner and by no means are we gluttony fools. But we... had to eat. #unplanneddinner  Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Tasty deserts! Loved the space. Very comfortable to study, and service is exceptional. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. Got the special rice noodle soup. The noodles were done perfectly. Really nice bounce when you bite into them. The soup was a bit on the spicy side and the pork ribs were not the great as they were a bit tough and not much meat on them.   Also got a brown sugar milk tea slushie. We got both the pearls and brown sugar jelly. Everything went well together and it was a really nice cool drink to put out some of the fire from the spicy noodles."}
{"text":"5 stars for this place. Service was excellent! My friend had the signature black diamond hot tea & i got hot taro with tapioca. Both teas are so good! Take 50% sugar. Crepe was great too so this is my new favourite!"}
{"text":"I love their bubble tea, their tapioca is the best.  But their foods are just okay. I think the foods are over pricing"}
{"text":"Cute, spacious, delicious.   It's not usually busy, and the drinks are made quite quickly. I haven't tried their food (nor do I intend to), and another thing to stay away from would be their \"specialty drinks\", like the Black Diamond. It tastes pretty much like ice- very expensive ice, that is.  I do like their normal menu items- e.g. matcha slush, milk tea. The decor is really pretty and the waiters don't hover over you in hopes that you'll make a quick exit from their café. Of course, there's a time limit of 3 hours, but that's enough time for everything! I like coming by here to do some work. It also seems like a good place to hang out with friends or to just relax from the upsetting weather."}
{"text":"Such a cute environment and the drinks were delicious. Only thing they don't have are fruit slushes. Great service, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best place to be in when you are stress out or you need some time to study. The wifi is extremely fast. The service is very nice too. But the bubble tea isn't best i tried."}
{"text":"Jule is fantastic bubble tea shop where you can hang out with friends and enjoy the relaxing vibe. I love the decor and design elements of this place. Tables are spacious and spread out with cozy, round booths. The bubble tea is well done, allowing you to customize the amount of ice and sweetness (similar to Cha Time). They have good tapioca plus all kinds of jellies, although I'm not a jelly fan myself so can't vouch for those. They also have recently added more dessert options. It used to just be some pretty standard cakes, but now they have added petit fours and even macarons (although at $3 a pop, I can't bring myself to try them).   Although I am a Cha Time fan, Jule is appealing because there is never a lineup and you have the option to sit down (at Cha Time, I always have to get take out because it's so busy). The only other similar bubble tea spot downtown I would say is One Hour in Chinatown. Jule is open til 1am. It's nice to have the option to hang over after dinner or after a movie at the Carlton Cinemas next door somewhere other than a bar. Finally, the staff I have encountered have all been exceedingly nice. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Oder the black diamond hot and 30 % sugar .  It come to me luck warm ! Turned out it's not bubble tea just flavored milk . I could easily make this with black sugar from Taipei and if add tea would taste a bit better . It's so plain and so pricy for 5.50 you only get flavored milk rather disappointing . The pearl is small one it taste like they didn't soak it enough before boil them ."}
{"text":"This restaurant rewarded three people who lashed out at a woman very aggressively with asian slurs when she wrote a negative review of her experience a the restaurant. Food aside, this owners of this establishment are clearly accepting of this kind of despicable and reprehensible behaviour. I wouldn't give them a penny."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, starting from when they first opened and I can really say their quality of service has significantly diminished. When they first opened, serving sizes of the bubble tea were great and the workers and establishment seemed to care. They chatted with you, checked up on you, and their drinks would be served in real glasses. the lasst time I went our table of four were all served in plastic take away cups and our server was aloof and unattentive, she even walked away mid order without explanation only to come back moments later, again with no apology or explanation. The first regular milk tea came in a plastic bubble take away cup and we were confused and then  signature agar drink we always ordered, that was always served in the large tall glass was served in the same regular take out cup as some of our other friends.   Even though I felt the establishment was not what it used to be I never felt compelled to write a poor review because I honestly did not care about it that much. But in light of recent events I can firmly say I can no longer support this cafe any longer. I refuse to be a customer to a restaurant who will shame a customer for an honest review and then reward racists and whenever who slander the reviewer in their defense with free meals. If your store wants to be known for rewarding racist customers because good job your facebook page is showing how well you're doing. I am extremely disappointed with the way they can treat their customers this way now then I really don't want to be a apart of it.  I will be encouraging my friends who have been past customers to do the same as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Jules two times and overall I like the decor and atmosphere of the place. I have not tried their food or dessert items but their drinks are quite good. The Jule Black Diamond and the original milk tea are favourites according to the waitress on our first visit. We weren't disappointed by her recommendations. On our second visit, we tried the Black Forest Milk tea (Oreo lovers unite!) and the Jule Matcha Red bean. I thoroughly enjoyed the Black Forest Milk tea as they did a good job of retaining the milk tea flavour and complimenting it with light mix of ice cream and oreos. On the other hand, I felt that the matcha red bean was not well done at all given it ended up tasting like slush with a faint hint of matcha. It was not sweetened enough and seemed like they did not put in enough matcha at all. Overall, 3.5/5!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes. Seating is comfortable, stylish place, good Asian music, decent food and drinks. They even have tea in a pot with a candle base. The price is a bit more pricey though. Wifi available and is perfect for studying or doing work."}
{"text":"A nice little Taiwanese eatery located downtown.  Pros: Entrees, milk tea, and dessert all well done Friendly service  Cons: Portions small for price  Taiwanese restaurants are few and far between in the city so having one downtown is definitely a plus.  I was told that they started out as just a tea and dessert place but have added the entrees out of demand.  Walking in, you notice the cozy atmosphere almost immediately.  A lot of students come in to do their work in the this relaxed setting and I don't blame them.  If I was still in school I could definitely see myself here as well.  I came for lunch with my GF so we ordered two of the noodle entrees and milk teas.  The desserts were all presented with a very nice display.  They were very tempting.  I will come back to try them next time I'm downtown.  We had the beef noodle and the house special which had braised pork in it.  It didn't take long for them to come out.  From a taste standpoint, I really liked the noodles.  The meats were braised well and tender and the broth was pretty good. I just thought the portions were a little small for what you're paying.  The milk tea was more of the same, a little pricier that what I'm used to but well done too.    The staff here were all very friendly and patient with us and every other customer there.  I'll definitely be back for dessert though when I'm really hungry I might find a more filling option."}
{"text":"Extremely cute place kind of hidden away unless you're looking for it. The drinks were decently priced, tasted really good, and the waiters/ waitresses are helpful and kind as well."}
{"text":"I really love Jule, it's my favorite bubble tea place in Toronto, and one of my faves overall.  From the moment you walk in, when the staff greets you with a warm \"Welcome to Jule\" you feel very comfortable.  Have a seat at the round tables and admire the trendy décor and funky lights.  Jule is a great place for a nice variety of teas, bubble and otherwise, and they also offer a menu with several meal options.  I've only ever had the bubble teas and desserts, but I can attest that they're delicious.  If you look through my photos, you'll see that my favourite is the Jule Caramel Pudding, a slush drink with milk, caramel pudding, and caramel syrup, to which I invariably add tapioca pearls :).  I first started visiting Jule in 2015 when I was in Toronto on business and staying at a hotel around the corner.  One of the few bubble tea rooms I know that was open past 10 PM on weeknights, I ended up coming back many times.  Now I live here, and while it's not quite around the corner anymore, I try to visit whenever I'm in the area to get some of that caramel goodness.  I get a feeling of glee whenever I pass by.  Julie is popular with the student crowd from Ryerson University nearby and you'll often find groups of people enjoying the ambiance here.  Jule is also a member of the Vicinity Points network, you earn one point for every drink purchased and get a free drink for 10 points."}
{"text":"Found this because I'm not a bubble tea fan and my friends told me Jule was different and I had to try it. Boy were they right. I am a regular here.. it's almost embarrassing. Same order every time - the Jule Black Diamond. It's on sale Mondays for takeout -- go! It's like a burnt sugar flavour and I honestly don't think it even contains any tea, which might be why I love it. Still, my friends who like other bubble tea all think Jule is the best -- I had a friend in Michigan ask me to transport a bubble tea from Jule to Grand Rapids for her. I have once carted 6 Jule Black Diamonds on the subway from downtown to North York for friends who were visiting and just had to have one. Without the Monday deal, it's quite pricy for bubble tea, so be forewarned. I have a friend who likes the Caramel Pudding here as well, but I've tried the hazelnut chocolate and found it to be watery and underwhelming so now I stick to my regular. I have never tried the food here -- they started offering food a few months ago -- but I haven't had any complaints from friends who have.  This place also has a great ambience and seating for meeting friends or even studying."}
{"text":"My favourite bubble tea place in the core of Toronto :) The interior is decorated beautifully.  I've been here twice with my boyfriend! It's one of the best spots for a date or if you'd like to get some work done.  The service was spectacular the first time we went, but mediocre the 2nd time.  Def recommending Jule Black Diamond and Caramel Pudding!"}
{"text":"Fun little place for desserts, drinks, snacks and general hangout. Don't expect exceptional quality here, but do expect a decent time and a good after dinner spot, or during the day catch up spot."}
{"text":"Service is great. Everyone is super accommodating. The music isn't too loud. Very chill place with new soft pillows. Will come back! Wish they had some salty snacks too!"}
{"text":"Just your average run of the mill tea/bubble tea and dessert shop.  I find the prices here a bit expensive for what it is ($2.99 for a macaron; $7.99 for cakes, etc...seriously??)  It's a cute place but I won't come back anytime soon when there are better offerings elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here by myself to read a book and do some work after reading some of the reviews. This place is pretty great for studying and working, although the only spot with a electrical plug is the table on the left of the entrance. The waitress that greeted me was really nice and helpful, she let me sit wherever i wanted. She also directed me to the table with a plug.   There were no problems with the drinks that i ordered (i got the taro and the jule black diamond) and personally i didn't have a problem with the sugar levels (i like sweet things, so if you do too- this place is great for you!) one thing that didn't really suit my tastes was the taro bubble tea. It's not sweet and a little plain, in comparison the jule black diamond was way better and sweeter. However, i would reccomend the taro for people that want a more natural and less sweet tasting drink.   I also ordered the small octopi, the sauce was pretty good and the overall taste was delicious. Overall pretty good place for studying, coming here as a group, and delicious drinks."}
{"text":"I got the Jule Black Diamond with tapioca and 30% sugar.   The drink itself was just ok but the tapioca pearls were fantastic.   The atmosphere is nice and cute but probably not the place you're looking for if you want to sit down and study for a couple hours. Their menu has a note saying customers are not allowed to \"loiter\" and sit for longer than 3 hours.   I'd come back for a date or catch up with some friends but not for sitting down and doing work."}
{"text":"Came here when I was feeling under the weather and asked for a ginger tea--but they did not have any--and it is on their menu. Huh?! Then I asked for their recommendation on something hot, but not too sweet, and the waitress recommended that Jule Black Diamond. What I got was a warm, not hot, milk with sugar drink. For $5+ I could have just ordered a glass of milk, put some sugar in it, and heated in the microwave for 1 minute! 2 minutes if I wanted it hot--which mine was not! Don't get the hype."}
{"text":"Excellent tea, great service, and a very pleasant environment!  I came here for the first time a little after it opened and had a ginger milk tea to go. The shop itself is quite big, spacious, and very pretty. There are big booths with padded seats and smaller tables and chairs to sit and talk with friends, do some studying, or relax by yourself. I've never stayed, but it seems like it'd be a really lovely place to relax.  All of the times I've been here, I've had my order to-go and the girl at the till was very speedy about taking my order and I had my drink in no time. I haven't tried too many different types (I usually go for regular milk tea with grass jelly or ginger milk tea with grass jelly), but the tea is really excellent. There was one time I tried something called \"Jule Matcha\" or something and I was a little disappointed. It was a hot matcha tea with red bean as a \"topping\". The matcha was not blended very well and I got clumps of green tea powder in there. The red bean was also not super pleasant to me, but that's just my taste. Otherwise, the way it tasted was great, the texture just was not.  I'll definitely come back if I'm in the neighbourhood! Always impressed by the quick and courteous service and I'll probably stick to my trusted favourites from now on ;)"}
{"text":"This newly opened café was on my list to try out. They have a large selection of cakes and a variety of bubble tea. I've had a few cakes and coffee here and they have all been pretty good so far. My favorite parts are all the electrical outlets, they are open late, and they have superfast wifi, it's great for doing work! To my experience so far, they have had the fastest wifi here. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the cutest place! Ordered the strawberry green tea and it was delicious and refreshing. Will be back again soon :)"}
{"text":"I'm Taiwanese AND I worked at a bubble tea room for 8 months = I am a bubble tea snob. The drinks here at Jule are the better ones in Toronto. The Black Forest one is delicious and their tapioca pearls are cooked well too!"}
{"text":"Went there for dessert and was amazed at the atmosphere. I ordered the matcha crepe cake and it tasted wonderful.   There's a sitting limit of three hours but I was only there for 40 mins or so.   The service was great and I would gladly come back!"}
{"text":"I Yelp!-ed \"best desserts\".... I'm so disappointed.   The \"milkshake\", was overly icy and flavorless. The dessert (cheesecake???) was bad... no better than a super market cheesecake, with a specific flavor. Mine was creme brûlée.  Both items were supposedly the most popular. If that is the case I'm happy I didn't opt for anything else on the menu.   It may be a \"neat\" stop if you are in the area... But I would never recommend going even a bit out of your way for it.   Two stars because the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Delicious cheesecake, milkshakes and mocktails! Such a cute find. Loving the space & vibe of this tea shop and we received wonderful service. Will definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"Perfect place to study, the atmosphere is very calm. I went there with my friend, she got the blueberry cheesecake, she enjoyed it while I ordered the Jule Black Diamond, I liked it as the texture of the drink was different than it just being watery."}
{"text":"Finally discovered a cafe close by that is similar to those in Markham/Scarborough (like Go For Tea/Destiny)! LOVE the environment here. It's bright and spacious. A perfect study spot for students or just a place to kick it with friends.  Their menu is clean and simple with a variety of items ranging from hot drinks to cold drinks and sweet to savoury foods. I ordered the Jule Matcha (Red Bean) and I was definitely not disappointed. Matcha flavour was there topped with a pile of sweet red bed. I enjoyed the drink. It was not too sweet or milky but just right! The food looked AMAZING and I will definitely be back to try out the foods.   Service was prompt. Decor is cute and btw... love the little booths here."}
{"text":"Jule (opened since 2014) is a \"gourmet tea cafe\" that serves different desserts and drinks. My partner and I came here after seeing the long line up at Chatime on Yonge.   I ordered their milk tea with tapioca, hot, for take out. So basically it came in a coffee cup to go - I think they should create a system where they know what the drinks are so they can provide a bubble tea straw with ones with tapioca.   The milk tea was delicious. I ordered it with no sugar which was perfect because the tapioca naturally added sweetness to the drink.   My partner ordered their taro drink. It's great as it was made with real taro - so the drink came out more white - not the usual purple you see at Chatime because it's from taro purple powder. I think he still likes Chatime better for its flavour though.   The interior looks really nice. We might come back again to try their desserts."}
{"text":"Very cute Cafe. I especially like their organic coffee that comes with free refills :) and the fact that they are open late makes it even more attractive for night owl like me.   On some nights it is quite enough to come and study, on other nights you can spot group of friends who bring their board games (so might get a bit intense)."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this cute little place is just down the street from where I live! I came here this afternoon with a friend and we both loved it! I had the black pearl milk tea with tapioca and it tasted so good - I love the fact that they let you choose the level of sweetness. I also had a crepe cake, I've never had one before - it tasted amazing although the price is on the expensive side. There's free wifi, the place is very clean and it has a relaxing atmosphere. I think a lot of the people are Ryerson students. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer server, nice atmosphere, and the only sort of café open on a holiday past 6pm. My friend had the black pearl milk tea and said it was above average for downtown. Their desserts look tasty. So with that in mind, my review is more of a reflection of my own personal taste rather than of Jule. I may be back in future for late night cake, though.  Our server was really nice and helpful, I haven't been to many bubble tea/milk tea places so she was happy to explain the menu and give suggestions. We had two of their signature drinks, the chocolate hazelnut and caramel pudding. We really didn't like either of them. The hazelnut one just tasted like soy milk with powdered flavor. The caramel one was like icy-milk without much caramel flavour other than the little tapioca pearls. They were also out of agar on this particular night, which seems to be the popular choice. I'm guessing these drinks are supposed to taste like this? Powder and soy milk? You guys pay $5 for this? To each their own. I guess I'll stick to tea next time."}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service and terrible handling of customer complaints on facebook.. never support this and the bubble tea isn't even that good compared to the ones around the area (chatime, real fruit, etc etc)"}
{"text":"The bubble tea was pretty good. It is a bit pricier than the competition so It should be good! The drink menu is pretty limited in terms of flavours. Atmosphere is cozy and it's more spacious than most bubble tea spots. Its coffee shop-esque in that sense. However, the Wi-Fi didn't work at all with my laptop so that was a big letdown. They also offer food and dessert but they said it would take at least 10 minutes to get ready so that also wasn't going to work for me. If they could get their Wi-Fi working and the food coming out faster I'd give them a 4/5."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, great service, delicious drinks. A hidden gem - great spot for studying and hanging out with friends on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing find in the city! Very well decorated and clean, a great place to study or just hang out.  The coolest part is how they have options to allow you to CHOOSE what percentage of sugar to put into a drink, just amazing.  The quality of their ingredients are top notch too, and the cakes are actually from France. Worth a shot."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the appetizers were great but the main dishes were way too traditional so myself my girlfriend couldn't eat any of that. Dee's coffee and sweets we're also brilliant and amazing only thing I suggest is to add sandwiches or something  similar"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Noodles were tasty but the serving was small.  Good variety of cheesecakes and drinks.  Didn't have a chance to try them but maybe on my next visit.  The $9 a piece cakes is a bit of a deterrent when I can buy an entire cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu for $10."}
{"text":"Came here with friends one night. Service was slow and staff were not very friendly.   Nice looking place but very average bubble tea for above average prices.  Save yourself the trouble if you have a bubble tea craving and go to Chatime."}
