{"text":"I recently took several employees here for a team dinner.  The place is nice and big, with a huge menu!  The service was fine, not extraordinary but not in any way lacking.  The food too was OK.  Not amazing, but not bad.  The atmosphere wasn't loud, but it was lively.  Overall a nice place to go."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere at Claim Jumper its like a Rustic ski Lodge in Colorado but in AZ.The food here is excellent and the portions are large I had the Tri Tips with Coconut Shrimp which was delicious.The Waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed as she had a very large Party seated by us but she was very nice and got us what we needed.My Husband had the Steak and it was great as well."}
{"text":"We went there for a burger. It was a weeknight and we found they have happy hour 3-7 Mon-Fri. Good selection of draft beers,but the \"Widow Maker\" burger for $7.00 is what we'll go back for. It's absolutely the best hamburger I've ever had!
It's about $12 non Happy Hour."}
{"text":"We have a problem every time we go to Claim Jumper. I'm ready to give up. Last night I got the Grilled Chicken Pasta. They forgot to put the sauce on. It was supposed to have garlic olive oil on it. I told the server and he said he would bring it on the side. What he brought was not garlic olive oil, it was water based with lots of seasoning. So I went ahead and used it and it was not good. Only ate half the dish. We ordered the brownie for dessert. It is NOT a brownie, it's a piece of cake. I don't know if they ran out of brownies, or that's their brownie. But we were very disappointed with that. We ordered extra ice cream to go with it. That came separately just as we finished the dessert - thanks. On previous  visits to this location we've had to return dishes because they're barely warm, etc. Something every time. The only reason we come here is because we get gift cards..."}
{"text":"To say the service at this establisment is terrible would be an understatement.  Management is clearly at fault. Our waiter shouldn't be a waiter. I don't want someone's thumb in my drink. Appetizer plates would be nice to have. Food was decent, but the service is so bad, I would never return, even if the food were for free. Had to remind the waiter for multiple items that never arrived at the table. The restaurant was not packed,  so how or why our experience was so bad leaves me baffled"}
{"text":"A word of advice when dining at Claim Jumpers, do NOT go there if you are on a diet or trying to lose weight! Oh boy, if this is how the stinky old scraggly gold prospectors would eat back in the 1840's, then I think the Arizona Lottery dude is grossly underweight ( http://www.nba.com/media/suns/arizona_lottery_120.gif ).

I was fair warned by Chris T. ( http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TQo2DFe6O6LWALv_awgcCQ ) that the portion sizes are very large there, and he wasn't kidding! You all know that feeling you get when you eat too much? I don't mean the feeling like \"...wow, I'm full...\" and you keep picking at the food. I don't even mean the feeling like \"...OMG, I can't believe I ate the whole thing!\". What I am referring to is that OTHER feeling, the one you DON'T want to admit you had. The one when you try to think back on it, you start to perspire and hope no one is watching you think about it. COME ON, YOU CAN'T DENY IT!!! It's the feeling you get when you eat soooooo much that .................I'm going to say it...............YOUR EYE'S HURT! There........I feel much better, I said it.

Now, back to the restaurant. It's not their fault that I ate that much, no. It's my own fault because I scoffed at the original warning from Chris. I said \"I'm on a diet, and I can be strong\". 

The wait time would have been real long except I called earlier and made a reservation (I suggest you do as well). I went to with my wife, sister and her boyfriend and whenever you go with more than 2 people you have to order appetizers. For some reason you know you aren't any MORE hungry than if you were alone or on a date, but I think your stomach thinks that there is \"strength in numbers\" so you can take on a bigger battle. Anyway, we ordered the cheesy potato soup, some avocado thingys and garlic bread. For my meal I ordered a pile of pasta and chicken. I DIDNT EVEN MAKE IT TO THE DESSERTS (....ouch......eye....pain)!

The potato soup was pretty good, but I've had better. It had a lot of onion/onion flavoring which is a big no no for my wife, and she was excited to order it. I didn't really enjoy the avocado thingys, they had a weird taste when combined with the side of dressing/sauce stuff. The garlic bread WAS the bomb though. Very greasy and garlicky and yummy! It went great with my meal which was a chicken alfredo over linguine (something along those lines). I'm pretty sure they serve their meals on a garbage can lid (or at least a plate of that size). It was piled high and wide. 

So here's the million dollar question....\"Why would someone complain about large portion size? Take the rest home and save it for tomorrow\". Well that's because your portion size is reflected in the check. The prices were higher than a normal \"fast/sitdown\" type restaurant but the food wasn't much better. So you pay for MORE of the same that you can't even finish, and if you do finish it you run the risk of going blind!!!!

Now I'm going to put my dark shades on, grab my long, retractable cane and go to Pizzeria Uno.....They are cheaper and I love the \"Rattlesnake Pasta\".......also I think they have a special seat for blind people.   :)"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday Dinner to my baby!!! May your 3rd birthday be enjoyable at dinner and the \"Maze Park\"."}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday night around 7:40pm Walking in it did not look busy at all. We were a party of 4 took about 5 mins for a hostess to greet us. Hostess seemed to have an attitude when we were seated she then slammed the menus onto our table. Our server Melissa right off the bat seemed to be in a bad mood as well. She was training someone but that should not have affected our service. We ended up ordering our food around 8:00pm, waited 40 mins for our food!! When we realized how long we had been waiting for we asked how much until our food came out, in a very condescending voice she told us that they always brought out the salads and soups first. I'm pretty sure they do that at all restaurants we just asked a simple question and she should not have responded that way.  When we received our food everything was cold! It seemed like they were sitting under the heat lamp for a while the bread on the burgers were hard, our mashed potatoes and green beans were ice cold! On top of that the Widow maker burger meat was raw to the point where pink pieces were falling off the cooked pieces.The food was good but the service was absolutely terrible! Will not be back to this location again..."}
{"text":"Ugghh. The service makes for an unpleasant experience. Delivered food with no silverware. We had to ask for drink refills, butter, mustard. You name it.. Server was nice enough but just not at all present, so everything was very, very slow.

On the good side, my kid liked the gravy."}
{"text":"I love that's inside the Golden Nugget since I'm staying at the hotel. The food was good but unfortunately bad service from Jeffrey."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for a party of 8 and they sat us right away. Our waitress was Erica and she was the best. I ordered the fish and chips which was so good. Excellent place to eat!"}
{"text":"Seems like quality of food went down and the prices went up!!! Ordered 2 bowls of chowder and a chocolate chip calzone To go, my total was 29$!! And the portion size was crap to be charged 8.99 for a bowl of soup that doesn't even come with bread anymore . Disappointed as this use to be my favorite place to have chowder !"}
{"text":"My Fianc√© and I went there last night after driving all day from San Bernardino county...... We both were tired and hungry..... My fiance ordered the steak and bacon wrapped shrimp with a baked potato and it was amazing he said he ate everything which he never does lol!!!! But my dinner got really messed up.... I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich, I have celiac disease which the server knew when I told him I can't have gluten so ordered the gluten free bun with a side salad... My salad was really fresh but for my sandwich with a regular bun and fries on the side which I thought just came with it since I haven't been here in almost 9 years. Took a bite of the sandwich and immediately knew it wasn't gluten free and are half the fries thinking that since I told him I have celiac that the fries were ok well that was my mistake for doing that I are half the fries and got sick while still at dinner and couldn't even finish half my sandwich after he fixed my order..... He said sorry but had no idea what kinda hell I was/still am going thru and we still had to pay for my dinner and the manager was supposed to come talk to me and never did!!!!! They didn't seem to care that they messed me up and the server was even smiling a lot while he only said sorry until I told him I was sick then her looked concerned...... So WARNING if you have celiac triple check everything when you go here!!!!!! Because they won't care or do anything for you to even help with their mistake"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice. Town Square is a great place to go for a night out. The food was so-so. I ordered the steak kabobs. It was served without the skewer, but there was no evidence the meat and veggies had seen a grill. The onions were raw and there was no chared flavor to the meat (no seasoning either). My companions ordered the shrimp and ribs plate and a grilled chicken with pasta. The pasta looked like the tastiest choice. I would come back again, but would definitely order something else."}
{"text":"Ehhhhh...I just don't know. I've dined in at this Claim Jumper about twice a month for the past 8 months that I've resided in Vegas, and probably ordered the take out another 5-10 times or so when I was working more frequently in Town Square. Everything here is so unbelievably inconsistent, that it's hard to give this place a solid rating. When the food is good and the service is good, this place is definitely 4-5 stars. But when its bad...boy is it bad. 

Claim Jumper has an excellent menu and dessert selection. This is their strength and weakness - they offer a little of everything for everyone while specializing in absolutely nothing. They also offer a full service bar that's pretty handy to grab a Stoli Cranberry when you're waiting for a table on a Saturday night. And the drinks are pretty darn good, especially when this blonde guy Chris is in the bar. He makes a mean martini - the kind that makes me shamelessly fall off my bar stool when I get up to follow the hostess to my awaiting table.

The servers are hit or miss. I've had a few that were friendly and talkative and gave me free dessert for being a sweetheart. I've also had some that were outright hostile by slamming a plate or cheese toast on the table or rolling their eyes and groaning when I meekly asked for a refill of iced tea. Luckily, I've found a server that is polite, friendly, and thorough, so I just request him when I go in. \"Are you sure you're willing to wait 40 minutes for a table with him, ma'am?\" Why yes, yes I am; I've got my appletini right here to entertain me.

The food for the most part is mediocre and generally lukewarm by the time it reaches the table. But the portions are ridiculously huge. I order off the Little Jumper's menu most of the time (when I have a server that's willing to accomodate that), and even then I end up taking about half of it home. I've had a variety of different dishes (lobster, steak, turkey dinner, burger, pizza, country fried steak, etc.), and I find I'm disappointed most of the time. Their mini pizzas and sliders are phenomenal though.

Decor is nice enough. Booths are comfy. Bathrooms are clean. Outdoor spring/summer seating looks nice. The music that plays is mostly 80s and is completely awesome. It's half the fun of going there.

Lunch take-out has proven to be a worthless joke for me. Despite ordering 15-20 minutes before I even jaunt on over there for pick up, half the time they forget to put my order in, and the other half of the time something happens in the kitchen and it has to be completely remade. I appreciate the quality checks the staff makes before handing my order over to me, but I'm starving. It's just one freaking soft pretzel! Pleeeeeeaaaasssseeee feed me...I only have 5 minutes left on my lunch!

Worth noting are their fantastic managers. If something goes wrong, they're there at your table to make sure it gets done right. They're very friendly and on top of things.

So there you have it. Some good points, and some bad. I've put up with it, mostly because it was easy and a comfortable routine for my husband and I. But recently we discovered \"I Love Sushi\" so I think that's going to seriously cut into our Claim Jumper visits. Which is absolutely fine by both of us."}
{"text":"Sucked! I haven't been there for about 6 months.
We went for dinner on Friday night. Service was bad, men's rest room was dirty (stained dirty). My steak was way over cooked not very good and wasn't offered steak sauce. We won't go back to this location again"}
{"text":"I believe the food is average at best. We have gone there for lunch a few times over the last ten years for lunch. Today I selected the traditional calzone.  The dough was soggy and there was red onions and mushrooms plus pizza sauce and cheese inside.  The ingredients were barely warm and lacking flavor.  My wife ordered French onion soup and salad.  The salad did not look fresh and the soup was bad.
This food concept which started in 1977 by two entrepreneur brothers has long passed it's prime.  The service is slow and the place needs a makeover now.  It is OK if you are just passing by off the interstate and don't expect a great food experience.  At least you will not need reservations since there are as always plenty of empty seats."}
{"text":"Happy hour between 3-7pm is THE BEST deal ever!!! 

My husband and I ordered bottomless chips&salsa, chicken wings, mini pepperoni pizza, burger, bacon cheese fries, small Caesar salad and 2 beers(of course we couldn't finish em all...). They are all under the happy hour menu.  The best part? Our bill was under $30!! 

I think the burger was $7 but everything else on the happy hour menu is like $3 and $4. And the portion isn't bad at all. Mini pizza was like kids size 4 pieces pizza, but burger was big like regular burgers! We loved the deal.

I put 4 stars in stead of 5 because the happy hour menu is only available at bar area, and we had a baby with us and wish we could sit at dining area. 

But we went around 4:30pm on weekday so it wasn't too busy, we had good service and yummy food. Would love to go there again :)"}
{"text":"For some reason, my wife loves this place, so we land here about once every two months or so.  The service is inconsistent - sometimes our server is excellent, other times the service is beyond poor.  Everything on the menu (including the salads) is very heavy in calories, so if you're going to venture here, I'd make it a place to go after a long run or heavy workout.

The food is always fine.  I've never had anything here that was bad or good, frankly.  I'd stay away from most of the fried items, although my wife's post-marathon meal of choice is a Claim Jumper country-fried steak.  The best items I've had here are the steak chili and the fish and shrimp platter I had last night.  The grilled shrimp and tilapia on the platter were good, but the fried fish and shrimp were what I've come to expect from Claim Jumper - fair.

At the end of the day, I typically regret a trip to Claim Jumper.  At an average of 40-50 bucks for two, there are many better options in the Phoenix market."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I waited 39 minutes before my order was taken. Totally blown off by waiter... .empty tea glass for most of my meal. I was in this place for an hour and a half just waiting. Ugh"}
{"text":"If you're a single person dining alone, expect your server to ignore you.  The food is fine."}
{"text":"Love the environment here! The shopping and movies are right next door. The food is home-cookin' at its best!"}
{"text":"Overall the food is pretty good. Worth going back. Flavorful and moist. I've been here multiple times and it's consistent. I think being consistent is one of the most important attributes of a restaurant. You can't have a great time one time and not the other. This place is better than good but don't go in with the expectation of great."}
{"text":"I called just a few minutes after they opened to ask if I could order a holiday meal to go. I was put on hold for about 10 mins and then was told the manager was busy with orders, he was he only one that could take holiday orders, and that they would call me back in less than an hour. After an hour and a half and no phone call, I decided to call back and then was told they were not taking any more holiday orders. I asked why they didn't say that in the first place as I called right after they opened. They mumbled some gibberish abou how the manager was busy with orders, which makes no sense as you can't order online. Never dealing with this place again."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location a few times and the service and hospitality has usually been pretty good, today April 24 at about 545. While this location was not exceptionally busy as we were at the beginning of a dinner rush. 
There was no host there and one did not show up for quite a few minutes into adjacent tothe bar where I saw between 3 and 4 staff members look my way acknowledge my party of 4 and go back to standing around and joking amongst themselves.

When we Were finally seated the person asuming the position of hostess was rude and must have forgotten she is employed in the hospitality business. She sat us and stated she would bring us our place settings. She returned fairly quickly. Tossed the plates onto the table and briskly walked away.  

My party and I decided if the initial 15 minutes was already this bad, the meal and further service probably wouldn't improve although the bar was already low. As we walked back through the door one staff member was nice and wished us a good evening. The hottest/crab of the night had nothing to say but did offer up a pretty substantial eye roll.. 

I am usually pretty easy going because I live in an area with substandard service in just about every restaurant/ grocery store so you have to be exceptionally bad at your job for me to even take notice."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great. Prices were a bit high but Vegas has really become that way everywhere. Good service."}
{"text":"Tori is the best server. We went for lunch we've always wanted there - dessert! Huge portions. Tori was friendly and answered my questions and the cakes were good. A caramel ice cream cake and a butter cream cake. Delicious."}
{"text":"After you get your drink the waitress turns into Houdini.  Poof, gone, no more service for you.  Needless to say I didn't eat here, you can only sit and wait for someone to take your order for so long before you just get up and walk out.  Just a tip, don't eat here... ever!"}
{"text":"Honestly been here a lot and tonight dinner was the worst service I've ever had. How do I order a porter house dinner and I don't get my salad until my steak arrives to the table. Then I asked for medium on the steak but comes medium rare and cold."}
{"text":"This is the first Claim Jumper we've tried. We came here for a light dinner. My husband got a stuffed baker (a giant baked potato loaded with chicken and veggie), and I got a caesar salad. The food was good. My salad tasted fresh and the dressing was good (not too sour which I like it). My husband enjoyed the giant potato and he liked how the chicken was cooked and its flavor.
The atmosphere is relaxing and the service was good. The server was courteous and sincere. We felt comfortable dining there and the place was clean. We will come back to try some other items. My husband wants to try the chicken pot pie next time.
We also like its location too as it's located right in Town Square."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and every time I do I'm never let down. The service is good and the food is good as well.  I love the creamy chicken tortilla soup and the California Citrus Salad.  No room for dessert today. However, my favorite is the Chocolate Mother Lode Cake! Six decadent layers of chocolate cake and rich 
chocolate fudge icing topped with walnuts. Enough to feed 4-5 people!  The meals are affordable.

{"text":"Took my teenagers here spur of the moment after doing some shopping..first timers. It was a weeknight around 730 so wasn't very busy. Great ambiance on a chilly evening with the fire in the lobby and chess games. We were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt courteous and light hearted...joked with us and made the kids laugh. The bread is soo good! 2 of us ordered salads and they brought them out right away before entree. Fast service. We had the burgers which were delicious. Drinks stayed filled and waiter was very attentive. We were so full with the large portion sizes we took a doggie bag home. They have a very extensive menu and I noticed they have a very nice sized vegetarian and gluten free menu for an American food restaurant. Finally something for my vegetarian daughter to eat when we all want to grub on meat lol. I also like that they let you sub Boca patties for any burgers.we also ordered a to go order for my son to take home for his gf and the waiter timed it perfectly to be ready when we were done and ready to go. we will definitely be back....with the vegetarian in tow"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times in the past month and really like it. My favorite dish is the slices of tri tip roast. I always ask for it as rare as possible and pretty consistently get what in a steak house would be called medium rare which is what I like. The reason for the five star rating is that I can get a generous \"red meat\" meal that is blood red at far less than you would pay at a steak house. The sides, such as mashed potatoes, potato pancakes, or grilled vegetables are also good. The dinner dish also comes with soup and their clam chowder is excellent. On a couple of occasions dining companions have raved about the chicken pot pie. In summary, generous portions of good food at good prices. You can also join their dining club which costs $25 but then gets you two $25 credits and lets you earn a 10% credit on all your meals."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and the menu is extensive but the last two times that I have eaten here it has been served \"COLD\". The first time, I thought it might be a fluke because we were in the bar area. This last time there was no excuse. It was not busy and we were in the dining area. I go there when in the mood for comfort food and it certainly isn't comforting when it's served at room temperature. Won't be back for quite some time, if ever! Four cold dinners is far too many."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I don't know why we stayed. But we had to wait to be served for an hour. Also, to top it off our food was dry and the coconut shrimp over cooked. Disappointed.  Never coming here again. They didn't even give us a discount or complimentary anything. :( 
Zero stars for this restaurant."}
{"text":"The one star was for our waitress. I had ordered the jambalaya pasta. I've had it a few other times. But this time I came to the table topped with a ripped out piece of cartilage from the thigh. Not appealing at all. So I sent it back to get \"remade\". That was 2 days ago and I won't go into details but I've had gastrointestinal issues since then.  Am I saying they did something to my food? I really can't because I have no proof, but I'll tell you this. I will never go back. And that's a shame because they have ruined a childhood memory for me. I grew up with the original in Orange County. 
Thanks."}
{"text":"This was really bad. We went today for my father in laws 80th birthday. We used to go here a few years ago and they were good but now after going to a new owner it is no good. We had the chopped chicken salad the lettuce was from a bag. Let's just say tasteless. My father in law got the ribs and they also did not taste good you had to put so much bar b que sauce for it to taste good. And then there is the service... We were not checked on. After paying we decided to get a piece of cake and they made my 72 year old mother in law go to the bar to get the cake."}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting Claim Jumper and this time I was extremely disappointed with the service. We arrived at the restaurant around 1:30 and it wasn't crowded at all either. My waitress name was Cinthya and she was very rude. We came in to celebrate my daughter's birthday. 

After we placed an order it took very long for them to bring out the food to us and it was another waitress that brought out the food and I asked politely if she could bring me some chipotle sauce and she never came around to doing that. Almost at the end of the meal I barley saw my server at all. 

     Then I went up to one of the other servers at the front and told them that it was my daughter's birthday and then a few minutes later my server Cinthya came to the table and questioned out loud in front of everyone at the table and asked \"is there someone's birthday at this table?\" very rudely. This was a surprise for my daughter from my husband and I and for her to ruin that was unbelievably frustrating. My husband responded for a no because it was meant to be a surprise so I corrected it that yes it was my daughter's birthday. A few minutes later she brought out a red velvet cupcake and she light the candle and just threw it on the table without having the courtesy to even wish my daughter a happy birthday. 

   Then we asked for a to-go boxes and bags, she brought out the boxes but not the bags then she disappeared off somewhere! If this is how Claim Jumper training their employees to treat their customers then mostly likely we will never return to Claim Jumper again."}
{"text":"Thanks for the sorry ass service, I went there for birthday dinner with family and it was ruined. Nearly an hour after with no food only drinks and a salad that was supposed to come with our food. The waiter said it's coming it's coming, then manager came out and told us 10 minutes. 20 minutes came then finally we just decided to leave because we had yet to receive our food when other people came after h received theirs. NOT ONE SORRY FROM THE STAFF"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch 2 weeks ago on a Sunday, the food was great and served straight after it was prepped hot and delicious. Jeff our server was always available and offered us a choice of regular butter or brown sugar butter, he ended up bringing us both. From their bread to coconut shrimp, salad and everything else, this charming place knows how to make us happy.
We'll be back soon, very soon."}
{"text":"We have been here twice loved it both times   loved the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. This time ordered steak with clam potatoes. Service was super fast. Had a good time."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! We went here to celebrate my dad's 50th bday with a party of 13. Our server Mayra was the worst! She forgot 2 of our entrees which didn't come out til the rest of us were all done eating and I asked her if they did anything for bdays and she bluntly said no. I then complained to the manager about the horrible service and he then tells me that they do give a free dessert with a candle if it's someone's bday. I don't get why she would say no?! Racist?! And to top it off, at the end if our dinner she said 'happy birthday' to the wrong person! Anyway, end of story is we're never coming back!"}
{"text":"Server was rather short and rude, talking about work/ coworker related problems, saying that she was not informed that we had been seated in her section... Ordered our drinks, ordered chicken wings as an appetizer, half buffalo/half asian bbq. Not impressed by the dry/ strange taste in the bbq flavor. Anyways, when the food arrived, she had mentioned that my plate was extremely hot, then proceeded to set it down in front of me dropping the plate and almost spilling my food onto the table. Without apologizing or even saying anything about it, suggested that we enjoy our meal. I ordered the steak chili sourdough bowl, chili was warm, tasted alright, but not as hot as the plate was. After eating all of the chili, I was very excited to eat the \"best part\"- the bread with chili remains left. Disappointed by the bland and nasty taste of bread, I simply put it down. To make this long story a little shorter, very very disappointed to see that a pretty good chain in such a beautiful location just 'jipped' me of my money and time. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was the worst ever. Sat for 10-15 minutes before a server showed up. She was super somber, hard to hear, messed up the order, didn't communicate. The manager was great...that's the reason for 2 stars and not 0. Not coming back."}
{"text":"WOW! Worse meal I've had in a long time... Was about half full of other diners. So busy but not too busy. Waitress was very pleasant but food was very disappointing. Had the chicken Caesar salad and wife had club. Her frys were over seasoned and sandwich was short of mediocre at best. The grilled chicken on the Caesar salad tasted like tuna also was tuff and dry O.o Unless your hammered shit drunk and can't physically go anywhere else safely. Hell, I'd just go without, if I knew before I ordered, what I know now. Golden Nugget on Fremont St is really slippin to allow this poor of  food quality to be served in their hotel. Insult to the \"Claim Jumper\" name!"}
{"text":"I came here with my grandma and everything was amazing! Meg, our server, was exceptional. She always had a smile and made sure we had everything we needed. Her great service alone would have made coming here worth it, but the food was also excellent. We ordered shrimp and salmon that was just delicious! And the bread brought out for us to eat while waiting was also amazing. The dining experience and environment were superb! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The nachos was disgusting; did not taste like nachos.  The mac and cheese was not made of macaroni; it was made out of spiral pasta.  When we told the waiter that the nacho was not what we expected, he was very rude and said,\"Well, you guys are eating it.\"  Very bad customer service.  We also did not get our drinks until after 40 minutes, just before our meals were served.  Never going back to this place."}
{"text":"Got sat and nobody greeted us for about 15 minutes. As being guests of the casino I thought this wasn't right. So I went to the front desk and complained. They the took care of me after that. If that happened in the first place I would given them more stars. Sam the manger and mark took care of us after that. I guess we were just lumped into the rest of the late night style crowed. Next time I stay here I will try another restaurant but they did take care of us after we we complained. Thank you."}
{"text":"Let's see...in for lunch around 2pm today. It wasn't busy at all. Hardly anyone here. 

Friend had chopped steak. Chef Mike didn't cook her zucchini & squash through. It was cold & hard in the center. The replacement looked as it should, hot, steaming, saut√©ed in a pan. Chances are Chef Mike was put on full blast so who knows. 

NO legit restaurant should have a Chef Mike, aka microwave, in their kitchen. Period. 

My fish & chips were ok. Fries were cold. 

Server was nice; service was crap. No one in the joint...no excuse. 

I'm wondering if it was the weather OR the crap food & service that are driving people away. This place USED to be really good on all levels. Between my experience today & past reviews...I can't tell. 

Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"This place is great! Big portions for a fare price. My wife and I went last weekend. We shared the Calamari appetizer, best I ever had. And we shared the drunk chicken, wow flavorful, filling and big enough to share. The potato patties that come with it are great. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and were annoyed from the beginning.  We prefer tables over booths and was told we would have to wait at least a half hour for a table but could be seated immediately at a booth.  I said okay and put our name in - I could see in the background however that there were tables were available. We waited it out and were seated about 20 minutes later.  

I also didn't appreciate the hard sell tactics by several members of the staff to join their membership perks club - why pay $25 up front just to get the $25 back later in a gift card.  Most of the restaurants they were promoting are not even offered in Vegas.

The timing and temperature of the food was not good either - we ordered a appetizer of garlic cheese bread for the table which came out quickly but was barely lukewarm and the marinara sauce served with it was cold.  It took another 30 minutes for the soups / salads which would have been great but not even five minutes later - out came the entrees.  My food was all cold but if I would have returned it - everyone else would have been waiting on me and we had a movie to catch.

I believe this location gets more tourist traffic than other locations - they just don't seem to care here.  We will just go to the Green Valley and Summerlin locations from now on."}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was pretty bad. Our server wasn't very professional and seemed annoyed with our big group of younger people, I don't blame him but at least try hiding it. Told  someone from our group never to grab a drink from the bar unless they wanted to get ignored the rest of the night, pretty balsy. Another girl from our group also asked if the burgers were thick in which he responded \"yes like you\" he's lucky she took it as a compliment!"}
{"text":"The worst experience and sorriest excuse for a restaurant.   I not only found hair in my food, but this was the longest piece of hair ever.  The worst part was the hair was entangled in my food, not even just laying on  top like one would normally see.  Management handled the situation very poorly.  They didn't offer to pay for my meal nor did they even offer to but dessert.  I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I've been here like my 3rd time and what I had was again, disappointing. 

Don't get a drink that has pineapple honey or whatever, tasted like there was hardly alcohol and looked kind of muggy. Also the chicken broccoli pasta was watery last time I came, chicken quesadilla appetizer is very dry and hardly any chicken in it mainly beans and pieces of tomatoes, the red velvet cupcakes aren't the best either. 

So far I'm not impressed.. hopefully what I get next time (if there is one) will salvage my review on this place. I'll probably try something with steak cause it looked good.

On the bright-side our waiter, Cole, was really friendly."}
{"text":"Good food but nothing out of this world. Rather go to Texas Roadhouse. Excellent customer service, fast service as well. Nice family dinner atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never have been to one, but it was a pleasant surprise. Great value and tasty meal. Nice service.

Town Square is nice too."}
{"text":"I tried Claim Jumper for the first time a few years and I was not great at all! I went back to try it out for a birthday dinner and I was pleasantly surprised! We had the Appetizer combo and everything on there was great! The claim chowder and bread was amazing! To top it off the Ultimate Fish and Shrimp dinner and everything on the plate tasted great! They really have stepped up and took steps in the right direction! I plain on becoming a regular customer!"}
{"text":"If you go to Claim Jumper, I highly recommend getting the ribeye (medium) with a sweet potato. That there is a mans meal and worth the $27. I have gotten this several times and have always been happy with it. They also have lots of salads that your wife will like."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place. The salads were wilted and tasteless. Our entr√©es took forever to come out and when they did they were barely warm so by the time I was half way through my meal it was cold. I felt forgotten about and when I asked for bread it seemed like a hassle. When I finally got the bread I was almost done with my meal. This place was a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"I like how close it is to my house. The service was great and my lunch was delicious. I think the amount of food was just right, but it was a bit pricey, especially for lunch. I did like the ambiance and I hope to eat there again so I can try the cream cheese pie"}
{"text":"I don't even want to read any negative reviews about this place since they would be incorrect (in my humble opinion). Claim Jumper always has room if you don't have a reservation. Servers always polite and food always quick and great. Always large portions, take home for later. Always plenty of room between tables in case you get seated by screamers so to sum it up...ALWAYS a good bet!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE  experience STAY AWAY!! I went to claim jumper on 6/24/14 with my family as we arrived at 910 pm and they close at 930 they were visibly irritated they had to serve us. By the time we got out food there was only 2 other family's in the restaurant. After I ate the moderate baby back ribs and paid the bill we left the restaurant. I Quickly realized I left my phone about 30 feet from the claim jumper and quickly ran back and knocked on the door because they locked it. While waiting over 5 minutes for someone to open the door I used my gf phone to check the find my iPhone app and saw the phone was on and located it the restaurant still. Then someone turned the phone off and I could no longer see it. So the last location was in the claim jumper before it was shut off! I was upset because I lost my iPhone that I spent $750   Because I bought it with no contract. The manager was nice but did very little to help find my phone rather than look around the bathroom. A young bus boy saw me frustrated and said \"don't look at me man I didn't do it\" which only made it more certain In my mind he took it. The waiter and the bus boy were the only ones who had access to the table, all the customers had already made there way out. Security came and took a report but nothing happened. 4 days later I am still phoneless as I am writing this on my gf phone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! If they will steal a customers phone with important irreplaceable family pictures imagine what else happens here??? not to mention all the COCKROACHES i saw dead under the booth seats as they were \"looking\" for my phone in short no meal is worth what I have gone thru these last few days. Save your self the trouble and stay away from this location. BUG INFESTED, PHONE STOLEN AND RUDE SERVICE WHY WOULD ANYONE EVER WANT TO EAT HERE. Take my advice and stay away or experience your self why I took the time to create a yelp just to write this review. I have sent emails to the corporate office and have made calls to inform them about there employees and have not received any form of communication back. This claim jumper is going to be the parasite that brings all the other great locations down! Don't be apart of this!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the staff is always nice. I really enjoy the food as well. The calamari is awesome, I don't even care for seafood but the calamari and sauce is way freaking yummy!! I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Just finished Thanksgiving dinner at Claim Jumper. Food was \"ok\" at best. Prime Rib lacked flavor (had to pour salt and pepper on it). Turkey was dry - overcooked. Baked potato only came with butter and sour cream. The Rosemary in the veggie soup was overwhelming. I won't hold them  responsible for my wine choice but the Kendal red zin wasn't very good either. Total bill for two = 64 before tip"}
{"text":"Used to be one of our fav spots. Appears to have been recently bought by a new company. Menu has been changed, and some of our old favs are gone. Food was alright, but not what it used to be. Portions have been reduced significantly. Service was good, but the atmosphere has become like any other chain steakhouse."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give no stars. My wife and daughter ordered the ore cart.this dishes name should be changed to the ore plate of shit.the pork ribs that came with the plate had the consistency of Kingsford charcoal and dry ass pork jerky.got pissed watching my daughter trying to find a sliver of meat on the forgotten on the grill peice of garbage. This place is a fuckin money pit steer clear.save your money go to black angus or ruby's where they know how to cook meat!fuck this place I hope it burns to the ground that way it will match it's ribs!now I know why they call it claim jumpers because they steal people's money!fuck to you claim jumpers!"}
{"text":"Booooo shame on you your other locations aren't as bad. I've never been a fan but this one just turns me off.  It's always someone who drags me here and I don't know why I don't just speak up and say let's go somewhere else!! 

Steak- way overcooked, after ordering medium well, unedible on outer layers with aggressive peppering making it way too spicy for no reason except to...hide flavor of meat?? DIdn't eat 1/3 of it

Veggies-bland ugh . No I am not on a low sodium diet nor did I expect hospital food. Didn't eat barely any

My son's pizza...the greasiest oil infested rounded plain dough slapped together like he made it himself. Didn't even eat half of it

I like their pies and their potato cheesecakes. I would much rather get appetizers and dessert here always. And even then, can I accept to pay these prices for this?"}
{"text":"Long wait to get seated; then 15 minutes for server to come to the table - said she needed to take our drink orders and then go take the food orders from the people across from us - they came in 10 minutes after we did. We said we knew what we wanted- she wasn't happy about that but complied. There were 4 adults and 1 child. Two orders were simple, the child's order was also. The other adults' orders were not too complex - one asked for no mushrooms on his salad.  10 minutes later we got the drinks. 20 minutes after that we got our food - cold greasy fries along with so-so sandwich and water to drink. $90 for lousy service and mediocre service barely adds to 2 stars.  Buyer beware. And yes, there were mushrooms in the salad."}
{"text":"The food is over priced and the food lacks flavor. But atleast you get free bread. Save your money and drive to another restaurant outside the hotel."}
{"text":"It took about 15 minutes before our drink order was taken and about 6 minutes before receiving our drinks. Our order was taken at 11:29am. It took 21 minutes to get fish tacos and calamari with fries. My meal was great with the exception of the fries because they were too salty made me feel like my blood pressure was rising just by eating them on the other hand my wife fish tacos were good. We ordered the brownie finale for dessert and it was supposed to be warm and it was barely close to what it should have been.¬† Just displeased with my experience at this claim jumpers in Tempe by Arizona Mills Mall. The entire visit took about one hour and thirty minutes and they were not even busy. I am currently an awards card member. I have to say this was the worst one yet."}
{"text":"Came straight from the airport and had lunch with daughter and her fiance. Ordered sampler app, and main coarse dinner and soup and salads. App came out (taste was moderate,  being nice) and after taking couple bites the main coarse came out. Waiter walked away. Five minutes later came by and asked how everything taste. Told him we never got soup or salads first. He replies \"oh shoot, let me get them.\" Still trying to eat app and now he delivers the soup and salads. He then apologies and said kitchen  is on fire today. Needless to say didn't finish the app, or salad or soups and main coarse was COLD.  spent 78.00 for three meals. Not happy. Will not ever go again and will post all my friends on Facebook."}
{"text":"We decided to have our anniversary dinner here. Service was ok. Waitress did forgot about my water. My dish tasted good but the meat was tough. They did offer to re cook the dish. So good customer service.\""}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to other Claim Jumper Restaurants, but this is by far the best one!  As we were being seated, I noticed a huge plate of Salmon at the table next to us, and knew right then what I wanted to order, it looked GREAT!  When our server Michael brought my plate to the table, I was disappointed to see the portion size of the Salmon was much less than I expected.  Both Michael and the manager Chris explained that portions are by weight not volume, and this was correctly served. BUT as a measure of good will, they gave me a second portion on the house.  I just can't say how much I appreciate their willingness to let me know my feelings mattered, and I didn't end up eating and leaving with a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended : )  A note to the GM Mr. Austin Walsh: You've hired the perfect leader skilled in public relations in Chris. Thanks again for your excellent service!"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious!  The artichoke dip and fried calamari appetizers were really good.

I ordered the ribeye steak with sauteed mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked just right and was full of flavor.  

My family and I enjoyed our dinner and will be back.  Also appreciated the friendly and fast service.  Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and at times is good but my last experience wasn't one for the books.  I was promised sweet iced tea that was bitter, my daughter wanted orange juice and they brought one that was expired, and my steak was cooked too much even though I asked for medium.  The reason I gave it any stars was because the service was quick and good.  I will however return to the one in town square because my experience was better."}
{"text":"I went here for a buddy's bday party.

The sandwich one of us ordered was HUGE.

The clam chowder was kind of small but very fresh and tasty.

Sirloin steak was small but decent.
Mashed potatos were yummy.
So were the veggies.
Food came out warm and in a fairly timely manner considering that it was a Sunday night.

My crusted chicken creamy marinara pasta (w/ extra marinara on the side) was excellent.
I don't eat huge portions so it was just right. I didn't need a to go box.

The manager seemed very nice.

Desserts didn't interest me at this place, but the main course was tasty.

I would go again."}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place, so I finally tried ifor my first time. It did not live up to the hype that was built. It was decent service and decent food, but not worth the price....$12.99 for a half rotisierre chicken. Frys gives you a whole one for $5.99 and it tastes the same. I guess I was paying for the dish soap used to wash the LARGE plates...so large, there was so much space on them. Just saying, if I am going to pay the prices charged there, I expected MUCH better. I still may go, if someone can convince me I ordered the wrong item."}
{"text":"We were sat right away that is about the only thing I can say that was positive. This is not the claim jumper I once knew. Prices are expensive and food quality was average at best. The chicken tortilla soup was good , $7 for a cup. My husband added a salad to his meal and it was like a sampler size. Maybe 1/4 of lettuce with some diced tomatoes, shredded cheese and croutons and they charge $3.99 for that, outrageous. My son got the shrimp Fresca pasta which came with 7 shrimp. They shrimp looked like it had been dredged in flour and pan seared. The coating was think and left the shrimp for tasteless. By the time he was done taking the \"breading\" off it looked like he still had a full plate of shrimp this meal cost $19.99. My daughter got the drunk chicken. It has two pieces of 3 oz chicken maybe on top of 4-5 potato cakes and drowned in the sauce. Completely unimpressed with this as well. The sauce did. It have any flavor
Other than the tomatoes that were diced up in it. My husband and other son got the tri tip dip. It was the most value and tasted the best. Service was slow. I will. Personally, I won't be going back. There are better places out there for the money and time spent."}
{"text":"My review is really just for the salads, because they're the only reason I go here every once-in-a-while -- they're pretty good and pretty hard to mess up (I usually go for the citrus chicken salad).  Everything else here is mediocre at best, and those kind of portions are really a shame, in my opinion.  No one needs that much food - it just contributes to the obesity epidemic and gives Americans a reputation for being wasteful.  The decor is hideous, so close your eyes while you eat, unless you're into the whole Old West mining theme."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place on a whim. We were staying at the Fremont and wanted a place to eat. 

Food: It was really great. They have a specific vegetarian and gluten-free menu, which is hard to find in Downtown Las Vegas or on the Strip. Their fried shrimp almost tasted like tempura, which I really like. The vegetarian salads is a big portion, which is the first place that gives a huge portion for a vegetarian plate. 

Price: With all things considered, (delectable food, great service, no wait time, decent ambience, and good location), I thought the price was reasonable for us. It wasn't overly expensive.

Location: It's located inside the Golden Nugget, near the pool/mini aquarium. It's walking distance from any hotel in downtown/near Fremont Street.

Wait Time: We were seated immediately, which was really surprising.

Service: I really liked the service. We weren't rushed, ignored, or constantly bothered. It was the right amount. One thing I especially liked was that our waiter didn't pick up our final signed (tipped) check until after we left. I really hate when waiters pick it up when we're still sitting down and talking. Different servers presented our food, but they were also friendly.

Ambience: It's not too loud. It it next to a bar. We went at a time when the bar wasn't busy, so we didn't have to deal with obnoxious loudness. I would imagine if it is crowded at the next door bar, then it was be really loud. It is somewhat dark, depending on where you sit. You can see your food, but it is dimly lit. There are TV screens around that play ESPN. 

It is also clean and well-maintained. The tables were clean and not sticky. I didn't use the restroom here, but I would imagine it would be clean."}
{"text":"Large comfort food servings with all the calories that come with that. I find the food to always be decent and leave full but never the first place I think to eat when I want to go out. The wife does love the chicken pot pie and it is very good. The tri tip is usually pretty tasty and my MIL enjoys the fish and chips. The pumpkin cheesecake in the fall is a must have."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible. We waited 30 minutes before receiving any drinks. When our food came out about 2 hours later food was cold and was not what was ordered.. 10 out of 13 people's meals were unacceptable. We had a pasta that had plastic in it. Discusting. Several steaks  that cost 25 dollars plus was not cooked as ordered and had no flavor. And when we talked with the manager he seemed not to have a care in the world. Not a sorry or well take care of it. Nothing. This place is a joke. Save yourself some money and go to Applebees."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas for the week and wanted to try out a predominately west coast steak house.  I had the 7oz sirloin cooked medium with shrimp and the roasted veggies and wedge salad.  My husband had the Roasted Tri-Tip and andouille sausage combo with roasted veggies, three cheese potato cakes and a Cesar salad. We both enjoyed our meal and our waitress Cassandra continued to check in on us.  We did have a bit of a wait for our meal as the kitchen go backed up with a few larger orders.  We are not big steakhouse fans as we prefer a steak grilled at home but Claim Jumper was a nice change! I only wish we would have left room for a dessert"}
{"text":"Selected this restaurant, after attending a week long certification class, by going to 'Yelp for Help'. -- What an experience. Amazing to say the least. -- Upon entry had the great temptation of witnessing desserts displayed that were so tempting I almost wanted to forgo the meal.  Then was greeted by Renee, who so very graciously arranged for my seating.  Tasha, my server, knew the meal explicitly and assisted me to exactly what suited my tastes.   (Having the menu on Yelp is also  great).  Lee was so hospitable delivering my beverage and likewise was Brent with the meal.  A superb Calamari plate and the Steak served Blue Rare was perfect as we ate them on the farm.  Most Chefs have a hankering to cook a steak for its external appearance;  but, this was just as ordered, cold on the inside with saut√©ed onions and bleu cheese ontop. My most gracious thanks to tue Chef and staff.  Jeff was obviously monitoring the activities about the tables and made certain I was perfectly satisfied. --- Then came the Cheese Pie with white chocolate and a raspberry sauce.  What a delight.   A family restaurant with tables filled with all age ranges.  There is something on the menu for everyone, even a youngster's section (Little Jumpers, I believe was the section).  There is not a recommendation that I could make; oh wait, yes there is: \"Keep such a great thing going, you have everything functioning in great harmony.   That is what it takes!\"  Thank you!"}
{"text":"OVERPRICED. And I mean overpriced for crap quality food. Portions aren't even decent!! Food has NO flavor. My family and I felt sick to our stomach after having dinner here. Will NOT be coming back, and would not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"So far it's pleasant . Clean semi quiet. We got here at 930pm and they were still happy to see us even though they close at ten."}
{"text":"I ate here with a group of six friends for dinner and we were seated promptly and had an excellent server named Luis who really represented the restaurant well. The garlic cheese bread that is served with dinner is very good. I had the grilled chicken entree and it was delicious. Everyone in my group was beyond satisfied with their meals and we all left happy. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Ask for Luis and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon for dinner. The place wasn't busy at all; we sat at the bar. After being handed menus, 3 waiters, including the bartender never took our order. After sitting for over 10 minutes without one person taking our drink order, a couple walked in and the bartender immediately made conversation and got their drinks. They must be regulars because he knew what they wanted to drink. We got up afterwards and left as waiters were gathered talking amongst themselves and didnt seem to care that customers were leaving. We drove across the parking lot to Islands Burgers and was seated, served and had our order put in within 8 minutes."}
{"text":"I have to say for the price of the food I would have expected it to taste a lot better. Islands across the parking lot has much better burger and fries for about $5 cheaper per Burger. The wife had the chicken pot pie which for $16 which tasted like something you could just heat up from the frozen section at Walmart.
Service was ok . It is a very large and very classy looking restaurant that seemed rather deserted on a Friday night. Which says a lot to me about how popular this place is."}
{"text":"WARNINGWARNINGWARNING

I don't usually type up bad reviews but I felt compelled to do so for the shit experience I had with this restaurant. 

First off Ill go with the good, we had a nice server named Jen, but either she is new or she just takes too long to handle situations. 

The shit, the food service from start to finish was crappy. First, we order the appetizer combo, spinach dip, and calamari. And I gotta say, nothing tasted fresh whatsoever. The appetizer combo is greasy with your standard onion rings, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and fried zuchinni. Next the spinach and artichoke dip was ok at best but the chips were really stale, even though the manager said it was made to order, it is not. And finally the calamari is totally frozen and you can tell that from the taste of it. 

And finally our entrees, we ordered the ore cart, chicken and brocolli pasta, and the pork and beef ribs. They all come with a side of soup or salad. We decided on clam chowder until I noticed a thick film around the chowder. This shit has been sitting on the stove way too long. Its salty and real thick. Our waitteess says thats normal but that is complete and utter bull shit. Clam chowder never has a thick film around the top layer. So I decided to change it with a salad, which was pretty much pre-made. And finally we got our food. When I received my pork and beef ribs they looked decent until I felt them. They were really fucken cold! Like if the food inspection put a thermometer through the meat it will definitely be unsanitarily out of code. Anyways, I told the waittress about this and she told me that this happens alot. WHAT!? This is when shit hit the ceiling. I got my plate back less than five minutes which would probably mean what? Yeah you guessed it, it was probably microwaved and you can that from the taste. The pasta was really dry and overcooked. And the beef ribs were not tender or 'fall off the bone' at all. 

While the manager apologized for the poor food service. We told him about the shitty food and he looked surprised about this shit. And asked to give us free dessert. And we were foolish enough to take it. If I were you, I recommend to clear the bill and dont waste your money on this shit hole. 

I feel like this should be in a dinner impossible or kitchen nightmare. My suggestion is if its a convenience sake just either go to yard house or ale house in town square. Any chain restaurants are better than this. You're better off going to chilis, TGIF, apple bees, and outback than this overpriced piece of shit of a restaurant."}
{"text":"In order to celebrate the holidays (and enjoy some well-deserved drinks!), myself and the rest of the fourth grade teachers on our team visited Claim Jumper.  At first I was reluctant, worried about the prices (as mentioned above, I'm a teacher, so...); however, I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonably everything was priced!  

I enjoyed the Coconut Shrimp ($6), which came with a delicious slaw-like side.  The shrimp had a wonderful blend of seafood and coconut, not too sweet and definitely crunchy!  I also order the Fried Macaroni and Cheese ($5), which came as two very large wedges and a sweet & spicy dipping sauce.  They were nice and crispy on the outside, and deliciously cheesy on the inside.  I would definitely recommend dipping bites into the sauce! My only complaint would have to be that one or two bites, deep on the inside, were a little cold.  It could certainly have been a one-time thing, and I have to admit that I'd probably try it again.

Everything else I sampled from my fellow teachers was also pretty tasty, including the shrimp ceviche and apple-glazed meatballs.  While we're only a team of 6 teachers, the seating was set for groups of 4, so we had to just turn our chairs and chat.  Not ideal, but we managed.

Overall, the food and prices (for Happy Hour, at least) make it worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Great service and a clean restaurant.  I had the jambalaya with pasta.  It was wonderful and tasty.  Cost was only $75.00 for a family of four.  Reasonable for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service for starters....portions are HUGE & fresh! Large area too so you don't feel crowded! I'd come back...tasty! Burger queen here lol"}
{"text":"It seems most people had decent service here but that was NOT the case with our table last night. We went in for dinner and THREE tables that came after us were served ahead of us. The only reason we even got to order in the first place was because I got up and pulled a waiter to our table. Not only that, there was a table that arrived ten minutes after we ordered and STILL got their food before we did. They even ordered almost the same identical food we did (breakfast food; hash browns and eggs). The only difference is one of us got steak and eggs. 

When the food finally arrived, the scrambled eggs were really disgusting like the kind you leave in the pan too long until it gets watery and mushy. The steak was supposed to be medium rare but was barely that, more on the rare side. Hash browns also had the same \"heated too long on pan\" mushiness. Overall it was a disgusting experience for us, and even waiting for the check had to take forever. I repeat, we watched three tables that came in at various times after us get food before we did.

We may have just been that unlucky table, but everything about the experience put us in a bad mood to start off the night. Luckily it's hard to stay in a bad mood in Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here for a late breakfast on a Sunday after checking into our hotel. The place has a good selection of food and it was good enough,  but that's about it. 

The portions are huge so I easily split the Tri Tip Dip  and added a salad to be perfectly pleased. My grandparents each ordered a breakfast and were less than satisfied with the meal for the price.

The service was awful.  Plain and simple she was one of the worst serves we have ever had. She didn't know if they had Italian dressing, she took forever to get our drinks, and she asked us 3 times if we wanted ketchup before bringing it. She never came back to ask us how the food was...if she had we would have let her know that they gave my grandmother scrambled eggs instead of fried (a different waitress brought us our food and when we pointed out the mistake she said she didn't know anything about it and we'd have to talk with our waitress when she came around).

The place was convenient and that's it. Too many other good places to go in Las Vegas to waste a breakfast here."}
{"text":"\"Huge Portions!\"  It's all I hear.  And yes food fans it's true!  The portions are ginormous!  Which is both a blessing and a curse.  If you're on a diet...a heap of food on a plate a giant would use a a saucer for his tea cup.  I tend to be one of those people that don't know where the limit is.  If it's in front of me it is my mission to the world that I finish it or else an angel dies...or so I'm told.  The service was \"meh\".  Is it so hard to keep an eye out on someone's water?  They brought out the appetizers with the meal and gave me a \"not my problem\" look.  I hate it when they do that.  The food was good.  Service was poor.  Restrooms clean.  Now on to the desserts.  Who the heck could eat a dessert after eating five pounds of food.  Whoa fella, slow down.  Do you really want to do that to yourself?  It's overkill.  Final note: if y ou go to claim jumper get a half meal.  it's normal size.  Which means that the full size will be awesome to eat while you cry about why you're so fat.  Eating here makes me happy for an hour but sad later on.  Food is reasonably priced.  Parking is a little small.  There are much better places."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cobb salad. I ate a small amount of it and found a long human hair in it. I almost threw up! My husband notified the server, who notified the manager, who apologized. They still charged me for a salad I could not eat! The server told me the salad prep lady had long hair. I paid my bill, but will never eat at one of these restaurants again. To this day I still can't eat Cobb salads. This was the most disgusting experiences I have ever had. I can still see that long hair wrapped around my vegetables in that salad. I think I need therapy!"}
{"text":"We are a hockey team that was in Tempe for a tournament over the Presidents Day weekend.  We are a large group of 35, it can be difficult to find a restaurant to accommdate us.  I saw the reviews for this Claim Jumper and it was also walking distance from our hotel so I gave the manager a call.  Allison was very friendly and asked to call me back to look at her schedule - not only were we a large group it was Valentine\"s Day!!  She called me back just like she said she would and we worked out a plan for our group.  
When we walked into the restaurant it was packed, I mean packed.  The enclosed patio was set and waiting for us.  Our servers got our drink order and jumper right on us.  It is very hard with a large loud group but Danielle and Margret were great.  They handled all our needs and keep up the pass the whole night.  It was a great night for us, the food was good and we had fun.  It was a little difficult at the time we were to get our checks but that can be expected as we needed 14 different bills.  Overall it was a great experience from the start with Allison beign professional and on top of it.  Our servers Danielle and Margret were great we couldn't have asked for better servers."}
{"text":"Just got back from eating there and thought they were all right, but certainly had better.

I ordered a salad to start, the croutons were really good but the rest was swimming, or drowned, in dressing they poured onto my salad.  I figured they would give me the dressing on the side so I didn't think to ask about it, my salad was drenched in honey mustard.

I had the Absolut Tortellini which was also drenched in the sauce.  What I didn't like about it, which I wish they mentioned in their menu was that it is loaded with onions.  I like onions but that was way too much, I couldn't even finish it.  

The lemon cake and the strawberry lemonade were the only things I really liked.

Our server was friendly and nice but the waitress on the opposite side of our booth that served the customers next to us, kept blabbing on and on about her life, which was annoying, I wouldn't be surprised if the customers were annoyed too; they kept trying to order but she would keep on talking.

Probably will come back once a year, wasn't very exciting to me at all."}
{"text":"My family and I were here staying at a near by Hotel and decided to go here, plus it was my husbands birthday. We got right in for a Saturday night. We ordered the sampler appetizer. This had no flavor. It was so bland. Then my husband ordered the chicken and broccoli pasta. He couldn't even eat it, it was so bland. No spices, no taste. I tried it and I couldn't even eat it. We sent it back. I got the top sirloin and it was basically a piece of fat that had been grilled. The kids didn't even eat their food. (One had chicken fried steak and the other kid ribs) I felt so bad for my husband because he had a terrible birthday dinner meal. We ended up paying our bill, and getting snacks afterwards to compensate. The service was good, but not attentive. We will not ever visit another Claim Jumper again."}
{"text":"Food is very D lecious. Ordered me 9 oz raw sirloin they cooked it just the way it's suppose to b, mashed potato really good. Everyone that came with me really enjoyed their food. Our waiter David is the best very professional, very good customer service and patience. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"This location is conveniently located near my work, so when it comes to eating out with a group of friends it tends to be the go-to place. Usually I think its just okay, but today my experience was sub par.

2/3 of us had hair in our food. My friend ordered the pasta and I ordered a salad. Her hair was short and the manager tried to say that it was a fiber off of the bristle used during the cooking process. The hair that was pulled out of my salad was long and blonde- clearly not mine, nor anyone else's at the table.

My friend received her meal for free, while I paid for my meal in full. Kudos to them for providing a positive customer service experience for 1 member of the table, but why offer a free meal to only one of of us when each of us who had to pull your staff's hair out of our food?"}
{"text":"Bad rating for encounter with waiter while leaving the restaurant.

Came in with my team for happy hour on Tuesday, 11/29 around 5:30pm and had the waiter chasing me to the door to ask if someone was \"paying for my lemonade\" when I left my work team early to head home for the night. They were still sitting at our table enjoying the evening and ordering a ton of food and drinks. We all ordered food and drinks at the same table on the same tab to be covered at the end by our team host, yet he made a point to follow me to the door when I left. If my coworkers aren't concerned with me leaving why should you have been male waiter? What if I gave one of them the $3 for my drink?

Waiter: Follows after me. \"Hi. Is someone covering your lemonade?\"
Me: \"Yes the group I was sitting with.\"
Waiter: \"Oh just making sure.\"

Why did you need to \"make sure\" my drink on a group tab was being covered? I don't usually go to these lengths to complain but I was incredibly offended that this waiter needed to make sure my part of a GROUP bill was going to be covered. Do you not trust someone who looks like me to pay for a lemonade or have left money with my table mates who were still sitting there to cover the cost? I would love for him to explain what reasoning he had behind this because I surely can't find any. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"As a local Las Vegas resident, I have eaten at CJ several times before I started yelping and always had good experiences - especially during Happy Hour where they have one of the best and most expansive happy hour menus in town.  So a few days ago when a quick dinner decision was required for a party of 5 adults (3 visiting from other states with no CJ exposure) and a toddler, Claim Jumper was the answer.  

We arrived at 5pm on a weekday and were able to sit in the Saloon and enjoy happy hour drink prices.  

There was too much food ordered to review here - so I will stick to my general consensus of our group.  THE MEAL WAS GREAT, ABOVE AVERAGE FOOD, GREAT SERVICE, and OVERALL WE HAD A GREAT TIME!   

Some food tips here:
1.  Everyone who ordered shrimp dishes loved them!  The western BBQ shrimp wrapped in bacon was a HUGE HIT.  So much so, that my father-in-law from Ohio returned the NEXT DAY and ordered it again!!  For real!  

2.  The chicken fried steak is not exactly what Southerners are used to.  It was decent, but not going to blow you away.  It's Las Vegas - skip the chicken fried steak here people!  

3.  The potato cakes were the biggest hit.  Order them as a side dish.  You won't be disaapointed.  

4.  The rotisserie chicken which they specialize in was just average.  My father-in-law is a rotisserie chicken man and he said \"I've had a better rotisserie at Costco than here.\"  Now, he still ate the whole chicken, so it must have been good enough for him.  

5.  Hit up the Saloon during Happy Hour - they have over 15 food items to chose from on discount, and more than 15 drink specials.  It will save you lots of money!!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Very clean and open atmosphere. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. I got the ultimate shrimp platter. Again, it was good food but nothing to write home about. Portions were on the larger side so you won't leave here hungry."}
{"text":"Horrible all around. Hostess wasn't able to keep track of wait list. Seated people as they came up to stand asking how much longer. Meanwhile, half the restaurant was empty. Eventually filled most of the tables, but kitchen was unable to keep up. Burger was cold, Mac and cheese was cold. Took 45' to get 4/5 of our meals. Took an extra 15' to get daughters kids meal. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Not nearly what it used to be.  

CJ was once the best value in town.  Now prices are way up and quality is down.  We received dirty utensils, which were replaced with more shabby utensils.  My wife actually took hers to the restroom to wash them before eating.  Food was bland.  Old-west ambiance has been \"sterilized\" so as not to provoke or offend anyone."}
{"text":"Great place to get breakfast and a hot pot of coffee. French Toast was great as well as the Eggs Benedict and the croissant breakfast sandwich. Servers were great !"}
{"text":"Have been craving a steak all day and I found myself drawn to my previous experiences with Claim Jumper. I have to say not only did my porterhouse steak blow me away but the service given by Matt tonight in the bar area did as well. Exceptional customer service despite being incredibly busy. I watched 1 person after the next fill the bar area, which is self seating, and Matt never lost his composure. I will go back and specifically request him as my server. I truly hope that the manager on duty let him know that I told him how great our visit was. Food never disappoints"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Food is great. Management is concerned how your visit is going. Going to come back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time today and it was sort of... eh. I must say that the atmosphere is nice, our waitor was very attentive, & I did enjoy the complimentary bread.  We ordered sliders to start off... they were dry as its only cheese, a beef patty, & a bun. I would have added a chipotle mayo to tied it all together. The fries were delish though! I then had a Ceasar side salad and the Caesar dressing was completely flavorless. For the entr√©e I chose the Ultimate Shrimp & Fish only thing I would criticize is the fried fish it came with I would have preferred talapia. Overall, I don't think it was worth the 75 $ bill."}
{"text":"Disappointed by the serving size! Surprising, I know, at a restaurant known for their huge portions.

My husband and I are vegans who took our son to Claim Jumper following his graduation from ASU. He's a meat-loving guy who picked the place. No worries for us, we can alway find a salad that will work. My husband and I ordered the California Citrus Salad (hold the bleu cheese). So far, so good. The our food arrived. We honestly thought they split one salad between us. Another member of our party was eating the side salad that came with his entree which was bigger that our full size salads. We asked the server and were told that was the size of the salad. We had to order a side of fries so that we didn't walk away hungry!"}
{"text":"Love the service and food Here! Andrew is an amazing server he made sure to acknowledge my kids. Not many servers like dealing with kids so of course that's a big deal to me! He was always checking on us to make sure we were satisfied. My bf can be a little indecisive and Andrew was great at suggesting. Food was great service was great. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant for ten years. Then it changed hands, and the service and and quality deteriorated to the extent that I decided to never go back. However, today I received an apology letter from Texas which contained a $15 gift card. If this restaurant starts to receive favorable reviews on a consistent basis, I might try it again some day."}
{"text":"Came here after lunch and before dinner time.
Very slow.. just few tables.
It took more than 10min. To Just getting a water and soft drinks.
Our server didn't even know what he's doing.
Very bad experience.
Never gonna come back."}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of Claim Jumper but my visit last week was somewhat disappointing. Got there around 5 pm and you would have thought the place was packed based upon how long we waited. Food was like warm when we got it. I have always loved going to Claim Jumper when I visit Oregon and California but this visit was a let down."}
{"text":"I have to say i am a HUGE fan of their tortilla soup!! Omg and the garlic cheese toast (totally not good for you calorie counters) I remeber it was freezing one weekend and the hub and i went here and i was in love (again) totally hit the spot and to thaw out a little bit :D 

The shoestring fries are amazing as well and were not over cooked but had just enough crisp to them.  

There is a showcase in the front that has a HUGE and I mean HUGE 6 layer (i think) triple chocolate cake! Talk about death by chocolate!! But yes of course it was amazing! :D"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the Deep Fried Shrimp,  was awful looked like it was baked, flat and hard.  Sent it back twice.  Same!  I had the BBQ Chicken Salad, which I have had multiple times at the CJ in Valencia,  tasteless.  Our casino host even said that Claim Jumpers is the only restaurant he wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"I love claim jumpers, but the service is awful. He was not friendly, never asked how our food was. Left us for fifteen minutes until he brought the check. Then we sat for another ten waiting for him to bring it back. I understand being busy but there were only three other tables in our area, it was dead."}
{"text":"45 minute wait to get an order of soup and fries on a quiet afternoon?!?! Didn't even receive any utensils or napkins, and our server was nowhere to be seen. Wish I had gone anywhere else."}
{"text":"I would like to begin by saying that it is with some apprehension that I write this review.  I have been in the hospitality industry for almost 19 years, and I know how devastating a review such as the one I am about to write can be to a business.  However, I also feel as though I am generally more empathetic and understanding than someone who hasn't worked in the industry, because I know from experience all of the things that can affect a guest's dining experience - some controllable, others not so much.  
My experience with Claim Jumper occurred on Thursday during lunch. 
I agreed to meet my mom and a friend around noon.  They arrived before I did, and were starving, so ordered before I got there.  Once I arrived it took our server a moment to notice I was there, but that wasn't really an issue.  I looked over the menu and decided to go with the Tri-Tip Dip, an old standby.  The sandwich was described as having tri-tip meat, cheese, green chiles, and grilled onions.  I am not a fan of the texture of onions, so I ordered the sandwich without onions. 
My sandwich arrived promptly, and after I attempted to thank the foodrunner for it, he cut me off and launched into a very detailed account of how the meat is simmered in an onion broth and that it is the only manner in which it was cooked, and that if I had a problem with onions I should be aware that the meat would taste like onions.  I explained that the broth was not an issue, but I did notice that the sandwich was missing the green chiles.  He offered to bring me a side of them, and I declined, thanked him, and told him it wasn't a big deal. 
After he walked away, I picked up my sandwich and was about to take a bite, when a very harried, disheveled looking manager(I think) came over, pulled out his headset earpiece, and asked, \"So, who had the problem with the dip and the onions?\".  I told him that I was having the dip, but that there was no problem - I just wanted it without onions. Or at least I attempted to before he cut me off by launching into the same description of the onion broth that the meat was simmered in, etc. that the foodrunner did. When I tried to explain - AGAIN - that there was no problem, he repeated the onion broth explanation, and sarcastically suggested that if I didn't want the taste of onions,  he could go in back and cut the meat off the roast especially for me.  At this point, I had lost my patience.   Which is why my mom then tried to explain that no one had an issue with the onion broth and couldn't understand what the hubbub was about.  Which she couldn't express because he cut her off, too, and, for the third time while at our table re-stated the now famous onion broth explanation.  I just took a deep breath and told him that what I would really like to do is just eat my sandwich.  So he finally walked away.  Then our server, Brent, came over and asked me what was wrong with the sandwich. I told him nothing.  At this point my mom's friend laughed and asked me and my mom who we thought would visit the table next.  It was ludicrous.  
And now, for the coup de grace, I FINALLY took a bite of the sandwich, and it had onions on it, hidden under the meat. I began to pick them off, and my mom reasoned with me that I should just get something else. 
Sooo, I pushed my plate to the edge of the table and waited for Brent.  When he came by he stopped and asked me, \"Now what's wrong?\" extremely irritated.  I told him about the onions.  To which he replied, \"We already took the sandwich off of your bill - what more do you want?\".  I asked to see a menu.  He replied, \"What do you want? A menu?\". Again, his question dripping with irritation. 
I find this whole experience unacceptable.  But I wanted to give the company an opportunity to rectify the situation - with a simple apology.  No more, no less.  I composed an email on Thursday afternoon when I returned home and sent it to their corporate customer service email address, as provided on their website.  Still haven't heard back.  And none of this would have been an issue if the staff and management hadn't made it one."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  Our server was pleasant and service was quick.  I had the pear & goat cheese salad and it was the best!  My friend enjoyed his meal as well.  Prices are reasonable and the menu has a lot of options.  The atmosphere was inviting and relaxing.  Reminded me a lot of Houston's, for those of you who are familiar with that chain.  I'll definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The menu has a lot of variety and the food was pretty good.  We arrived later on a Sunday night (7:30ish), the place wasn't too busy maybe 1/2 full but it took 30+ minutes from the time we ordered until we received our food."}
{"text":"Brought a business colleague & partners here for supper at about 7 PM. We were sat down right away; it was nice to not have to wait in line. Drinks were good. Colleague had a beer; I had a Lava Flow. Tasted like a tropical punch milkshake but with added alcohol. Yummy!!!  

For supper I had the tri-tips with baked potato, grilled veggies and cheese bread. Everything was super delicious!! No complaints here!! I wound up taking 1/2 of it back to my hotel for a next day snack. =) 

The desserts looked SO good but I had no room or else I would have tried that Monster Mud Pie. (I think that's what it's called!!)

Waiter was very helpful and funny at the same time. We made sure he got a $20 tip. 

Location is VERY close to the Arizona Mills Mall. Go eat, then go to the mall for a few hours and walk it off. =)"}
{"text":"Sloooooooooow.  Empty when we walked in.  Portion of the appetizer was cold.  Servers were polite and tried.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"Chicken & rib combo very good. Cheese potatocake delicous. Bread pudding average."}
{"text":"Best kids menu in town, hands down. Fantastic appetizers as well. The entree's my wife and I had were less than satisfactory however. 

We had the fish and chips, which turned out to basically be a huge pile of greasy crap on a plate. Next time we're ordering apps for dinner. 

Service was great."}
{"text":"Good food, decent price. I think our server was the only thing that was bad but he was so bad it made the whole experience terrible.  After waiting a couple minutes for our first greet he came to take our drink order. We also gave him our appetizers. Surprise! Apps came before he dropped our drinks. He delivered our drinks noting how fast the apps were and chuckled about it. Then took our salad and entree order. After a while we get our salads and start eating. Not more than 2 bites in we get our entrees delivered. The food runner apologized and asked if we wanted it in the window to keep warm. .. ya right. We took them and ate our soggy salads after our meals. The server again made light of how fast the entree had been delivered. At this point we just wanted to leave. So we did (after we paid and tipped). Will we return? Maybe but we might sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I can't seem to find a good menu item. I've been here on several occasions and every time I come I have to order something different in hopes that it might be worth the price and actually taste good. The last time we went the hostess was on the telephone and didn't even acknowledge that we were there. Another woman came over and asked us how many, we told her two adults and a child. She started grabbing menus for us when the hostess turned around and said \"We can't seat them, each waiter has three tables and that is all they can handle right now\"  My husband and I looked around the restaurant and noticed that there were more open tables than full tables. The hostess apologized and said we that they only had six servers and that three tables per server was what she was told by the manager and we were sat about 25 mins later. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Sweet Potato, which was a small sweet potato with a very small amount of bland supposedly jerk chicken for 11.99, no sides. My husband ordered the Roast Turkey On Wheatberry for 9.49. The Roast Turkey was just like store bought lunch meat and the wheatberry bread was just like regular wheat bread. It was extremely disappointing. Our waiter was also very distant, he only stopped by to drop our food and check, our drinks which were empty before we got our food were never refilled and he didn't even get a drink for our son, even after we ordered him a lemonade two different times. This was by far the worst experience I've had at this place, but my other visits weren't much better (food wise). The only thing I've gotten from here that I've enjoyed is the Arnold Palmer, but who could screw that up?

I decided to change my rating simply because it isn't the restaurants fault that I don't like the items they offer on the menu. Most of the time the staff is friendly and attentive. What it boils down to is personal preference, I feel the food is bland and over priced but my husband enjoys everything he orders with the exception of the sandwich."}
{"text":"About like canned, bland, nasty 'food. 
 Not a clue how they stay in business, they were good years ago, but not any more."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and got a new server.  We thought the worst but we were pleasantly surprised. The server was kind, patient and very pleasant.  She did not miss a beat!  We also joined the Landrys select club because of her.  We will be coming back and asking for Rita.  Oh, did I mention the food was really good too!"}
{"text":"Howzit!?

Average food. Good atmosphere. Great service.

Kids and baby friendly with changing station and designated stroller parking area. Also a complimentary dish for kids.

Notable dish: French Onion Soup."}
{"text":"Good Landry's restaurant in the Golden Nugget - varied menu and American/Asian fare.  Something for everyone. Had a good breakfast here and was able to stick to our eating plan!  Also- good quick early dinner before heading out to the Las Vegas 51s baseball game.  Filling and wholesome- again stuck to our eating plan!  Manager Sergio is on top of things at this location.  We will definitely return-- soon!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give ZERO stars.  Should have known from when we first walked in that we should have walked right back out!

Go start, there was no one, that's ight, absolutely NO ONE at the front, when we walked in to seat us.  When, someone who looked like she may have been the hostess saw us, she signals, \"I'll be right there\" and then disappeared only to emerge about 3 minutes later and finally sat us at our table.

Sat and PATIENTLY waited for AT LEAST 5 minutes (I'm being generous with my estimation).  Finally, the waitress comes with the menu and said she'd be back...  Ya, like another 10 minutes or so.  Took our order.  Came back with our water after about another 10 minutes and said she'd be right our with our order.

We waited and waited and waited...  AT LEAST another 10+ minutes...  My daughter and I finally said, \"This I'd rediculous\" and walked right out.  I don't  think none even noticed.

BTW, it was Thursday at about 6 p.m.  The place was practically empty!  Now we know why.  They keep that kind of service up and the place will be totally empty because how does a business stay open with that kind if S#%*y service?  Well, good luck to them!

If you're reading this, all I can say is...  Stay way from this place, stay far, far away!  Unless you have nothing better to do with your time but to just sit and wait and you really don't feel like eating anyway.  Oh, but wait...  This is a restaurant.  Isn't that the reason why you would go there to begin with???"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here, portions are always huge and usually enough for two to share. I recently tried a limited time menu item, Fire roasted artichoke appetizer $9.99 and found it to be subpar.  I'm typically nervous about getting an appetizer because I worry I'll be too full to eat my meal, but this wasn't the case with the artichoke, I complained to my dinner guest that I couldn't get a single bite off of any of the leaves. Disappointed.  Otherwise, I always like the food here."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would.  Absolutely the worst, what ended up being non-dining experience EVER!  Only a 15 minute wait to be seated by 6:15 p.m. on Mother's Day.  Right there I thought we were headed for a great dining experience...  At 7:15, we still didn't have our food.  Our food was served to the table next to us.  When our food did come, my girl's meal did not have one thing correct on it.  

Her order:  Steak & Shrimp, baked potato, extra shrimp (steak well done and all fried shrimp).

Here is what she got:  Steak (medium), vegetables and grilled shrimp (just one skewer)

Sent her food back while mine Sat on the table getting cold.  Told it would be fixed quickly.  20 minutes later she was brought back a plate with a Steak (labeled medium), mashed potatoes, and no shrimp.  We were told the shrimp would be out shortly.  See above.  Still not close but I guess getting closer.  My girl and I just looked at each other and we were done.  As the waiter, why would you not check your ticket before even bringing this plate to our table???

I had had enough.  Told the waiter we were leaving and would not be paying.  He tried to argue because there had been a Coronarita and shot of tequila ordered from the bar and he would have to talk to a manager.  I told him don't bother since he obviously was in the weeds and I would find a manager on my way out.  Found the manager and told him the issues we had and were not paying for anything.  We were told they were sorry, don't worry about the bill and please come back another time and look for him so he could make sure everything was done right. My girl and I agreed we will never be back."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!!!!! It literally took our server 15 minutes to greet us (there was only 3 tables sat so no excuse) after she said she would give us a minute to look over the menu she took an additional 15 minutes to come back. They brought our food out at completely different times so my wife got her meal first 10 minutes before I got mine. They forgot to ring in one of our orders so it didn't come out at all. They gave me a rare burger when I asked for well done. I will never go back. Oh and it was our anniversary so it totally ruined our lunch date."}
{"text":"Great food and fair prices.  The mozzarella sticks are probably the best I have ever tried, and the slice of chocolate cake is the biggest $10 piece of cake I have ever seen anywhere. It feeds 3-4 people.  The service is excellent."}
{"text":"We have visited this establishment a few times,  always great service and the food was good. Well,  we returned to claim jumpers tonight to take the
 in-laws to dinner. Out of all the places we could of gone in vegas, We went to claim jumpers because we knew this place was good.. BIG MISTAKE! the service was horrible. We had a party of 8, 6 of us got our salads &soup, the other 2 got there's 15 min later and it (the soup) was cold. Again with the entree  6 came the other 2 waited for 20 min until we flagged a staff member down. We never received ketchup, ranch, cocktail sauce or refills on our drinks. The manager gave us 10% off the check. Big deal. We will never dine at this place again."}
{"text":"So this is my third time here and I must say I WAS NOT IMPRESSED! I'm not sure if the bartender was legit or not because my raspberry martini was wrong the two times he made them. My wife's patron margarita was so sweet she couldn't drink it. Over all the service was subpar and I won't be back! Also the manager came to the table with a loud voice to ask us about the drinks!!! Maybe I should've sat on the other side instead of going to happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is my favorite restaurant of all time! They use aged beef and have the best filit mignons that I have ever eaten. Make sure to ask them to put a pat of their awsome garlic butter on top of your steak. It really brings out the juicy flavor as the meat melts in your mouth. I also love their long island iced tea!"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper @ Town Square
-- Took forever to get our orders. Servers are so slow!!! && never ever try their chicken pot pie. Its so dry and its like there's no soup at all.  We told our server about it and thought that they're not going to bill it to us anymore or atleast give us a new one cos its really disappointing!! It costs 15$ and we didn't even eat 1/4 of it. But still, they charge it to us. Lame. Its all about $$$$$$$$$!!!!!!! Never gonna eat here anymore. Sucks."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give a zero star I would. The best thing about this place was that they had sturdy forks, but when it comes to the serves they can go fork themselves. Peter was the absolutely terrible beyond compare. I had to get up from my seat and hunt him down for every single thing I needed. Our food was cold due to the fact we couldn't find the sever to get what we needed to eat. The water was outrageously horrible and tasted awful. When I talked to management about how terrible my experience was, he replied \"ok\" and walked away. I won't be returning and I suggest you don't even give it a try."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a year and I won't be back. We sat at the bar and the service was really awful. The food wasn't much better. The slaw looked like it had sat out for a week and when we got our food it was cold."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this Claim Jumper restaurant last Saturday for the first time. The atmosphere was good, big dining area, the waiter was friendly and attentive. We ordered the Salmon Orleans meal to share it. We also chose the Caesar salad with the meal. 

The salad was not very good overall, very little Caesar flavoring to it. However, the Salmon Orleans meal was very good. It came with \"Potatocakes\" which is mashed potatoes breaded and fried crisp. The Potatocakes were surprisingly very good, very tasty. The salmon was well cooked, fresh and seasoned very well. Overall, we were very satisfied with the meal.

The dinner prices at the Claim Jumper were a bit higher than restaurants with comparable menu items. However, we will come back for the Salmon Orleans...it is a good meal!"}
{"text":"Not feeling like cooking or going out this past Friday night, my hubby & I decided to place an order with Delicious Deliveries. With an almost $9 delivery & convenience charge, we will just get our lazy asses up & carry out next time. Ok, on with the review... 

For an app we ordered the soft pretzels (double order). For our entrees we ordered the top sirloin with cheese potatocakes, asparagus & a sourdough roll & the whiskey-apple glazed pork loin that came with mashed potatoes, roasted veggies & a buttermilk biscuit. Oh & as if he didn't have enough sides, my hubby also got a side of the organic corn. For dessert we ordered the seasonal pumpkin cream cheese pie. 

The soft pretzels were so good! They forgot the dipping sauce but we just used yellow mustard & devoured the 2 HUGE pretzels. Hubby ate all of his sides 1st (except the roll that they forgot also) so he didn't have room for the steak, but loved all of his sides. My entree was just ok, it was pretty blah overall, the best part was the biscuit. The dessert was very good & a HUGE portion (I think that's the theme for this restaurant). 

Total (with tip & stupid delivery charges) was about $73, pretty steep for just an ok meal. Glad I tried it but I'm not in any rush to come back."}
{"text":"I have never had a good experience at a Claim Jumper. Unfortunately, this most recent visit has me convinced I should probably never go there again. The service was slow and the waiter talked about himself the whole time. He saw fit to correct my grammar when I said \"can I please have a root beer?\" Instead of \"may I.\" He couldn't remember to bring our drinks, bread, or food. Someone else did it for him. Food is overpriced and not that good considering. The whole thing was just a waste of time and money. Not to mention, they over charged the card of someone in my party and then couldn't care less that they did this. Don't go here. There are so many good restaurants in Las Vegas/Henderson you really shouldn't waste your money here."}
{"text":"What has happened to Claim Jumper? wanted to stay close to home last night with all the rain happening so we decided on CJ. I haven't been in a little over 3 years but had no concerns because it is the Claim Jumper. when we arrived we got seated and noticed the dingy and dirty feel, our table had a sticky pieces of something on it. The menus were filthy( we should have walked out then). Our salads came and they were warm, soggy and were disgusting. I also noticed a couple other tables having similar issues with the food and wait staff. Our dinners came, and it was gross. The Grilled Mahi was the worse i had ever had, Hard as a rock, could not even cut it with the supplied table knife, the rice was cold and the veggies were hard and cold. The whiskey glazed chicken was a bit better but still no where near the quality that i remember with the Claim Jumper. So after $65.00 for 2 people, i will never go back again, so many other choices in Phoenix. A couple of other tables looked like they were having a worse go around than us. Did not even stay for dessert, that's how disgusted we were.  RIP Claim Jumper !!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat. I recently stopped by for lunch and as always the staff was attentive and friendly. The food was good too and nicely proportioned. I was also informed they prepare holiday meals as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here one night not knowing they were redoing their happy hour hours and man did we luck out!  For dinner on a Monday night around 8 pm we were able to order a BUNCH of things off the happy hour menu and drinks for two- all under 30 bucks.  We've since come back on a Sunday afternoon with our friends and have been satisfied each time with the bar area's happy hour menu and a nice cozy place to hang out.  I don't know what the happy hour times are now, but the last time I called in they were changing them I think.  This location has ample parking and there's never been a wait for the bar area when I have come.  Love the staff here.  They have all been helpful and attentive without being suffocating.   Not sure if I would come here for a meal in the dining area."}
{"text":"While I do enjoy the food and the ambiance, I have never been more frustrated with the service of a restaurant. My family, including my 8-month pregnant wife at there for over 15 minutes before anyone EVEN GREETED US. We watched as 3-4 families in front of us just left. When I finally tracked down a manager, he could obviously not care amy less. He mumbled something about being a server down and offered no apologies or anything. 

I the went to the bar to get my wife (very pregnant, don't forget!) a glass of water and I couldn't for the life of me get the attention of the bartender, despite the fact that the only thing at the bar was 10+ dirty place settings (see photo). Needless to say, I was never able to get a water for my wife to take her vitamins. 

A few words of advice: Never complain to the customer about what is stressing you out. And you need to get your shit together and make it look like it's the greatest day of your life for MY sake. I'm the one paying the bill. 

Terrible experience, and I'll defintely be writing the headquarters and sending pics."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop here since it's Friday and chowder w/salad sounded good. This place was not crowded at lunch. We were led to our table within a few minutes and were informed that Heather would be our server. We of course ordered the clam chowder but I also had a house salad w/ranch and corn bread...she had the citrus salad w/cheese toast. It all tasted great and Heather provided excellent service. My meal amounted to $6.99 while my wife's was $8.99. Can't remember what our ice teas cost but our total came out to $23.52 after taxes but before the tip. We thought that was very reasonable and recommend this restaurant for lunch on Fridays."}
{"text":"How I heart the Claim Jumper!!!

This one sated my craving for their delish deep friend zucchini appetizer in a pinch. Portion for this was smaller than I've seen in other CJs. 

The decor was a wee bit less posh than some of the other CJs I've been to though. I had the black tie pasta dish...thought it came with peas but mine was missing them. I ordered the 1/2 portion and couldn't eat it all. Huge portions! My partner had the lobster tail with roast veggies and he can usually eat....but left most of his veggies as there was just so much food.

They don't have the amazing salad bar that CJ's in California and other areas have. They do have a great children's menu though. We ordered an \"I Declair\" for dessert - $10 but it's a monstrous dessert that feeds 6 or 8 adults. Needless to say, we left much of it untouched.

Service was top notch as always. I'm amazed that this place wasn't busier than we'd seen at other CJs, but it seems that Vegas is in a bit of a \"post recession\" withdrawal and many places are a bit empty."}
{"text":"These guys define \"amazing!\"  We showed up with a party of 42, after having changed our reservations at least twice as our schedule changed during a soccer tournament.  When we finally arrived, our table was ready (ice in the glasses, bread on the table).

Every waiter in the restaurant must have stopped what they were doing to fill glasses and take orders.  It looked like a NASCAR pitstop.

The food was great.  We asked for and received 17 different checks, and saw only smiles from the staff.  We left well fed and delighted.  

I had never been to Claim Jumpers before, but will look forward to returning."}
{"text":"The country fried steak is huge but is mostly fried batter.  My husband and I love chicken fried steak, but after eating some of our order we went home a felt ill.  Portions are huge, but huge isn't necessarily good. If you order the lettuce wedge salad ask them to put blue cheese dressing on it and leave off the brown sauce.  The dressing they put on it is sweet rather than savory, which I didn't care for."}
{"text":"The place is large, but it was almost empty. That should have been first clue that the place is not good. I ordered iced tea - and eventually it arrived. It had a nasty aftertaste. Kind of reminded me of lawn clippings. It took a very long time, but the waitress finally stopped by our table and refilled my tea - even after I told her not to. I managed to get her attention before she ignored me again and asked for water instead. I informed her that the tea was awful but she didn't seem to care. We also noticed a strange blue substance on the bread she brought out. A small blob about half an inch long by a quarter of an inch wide. It looked like the body wash that I use. I asked the waiter what the blue stuff on the bread might be. She had no idea. She asked if we wanted more bread. We both said no, fearing that it would have some other unknown substance smeared on it. She took the bread away AND SERVED IT TO THE TABLE ACROSS FROM US!!!! They saw the blue stuff right away and stared at it for a minute. Then they cut that part off, set it aside and ate the rest. The food was mediocre at best. The service was very slow and Katie the waitress doesn't care about her customers. I'd give ZERO stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper has been CLOSED for years. Now it is Jasmine Tokyo Asian Buffet. I just call it \"Tokyo\". Excellent, Up-Scale Chinese Buffet!"}
{"text":"Definitely not the same claim jumper of years past.  New owners are terrible with the way they changed the restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and I came here last night to celebrate a birthday. there were 12 of us and we got the  best customer service, the food was hot when it came out. It was a wonderful experience last night."}
{"text":"My Birthday Was On Wednesday, and since we are always busy during the week we couldn't do anything until the weekend...so we started my Birthday weekend on Friday night...we came to Claim Jumper for the first time not knowing what to expect. 

We came in and they sat us right away...it did not look like it was a busy Friday night. we got a good booth. I absolutely LOVED that they noticed we had a 2 year old and they took care of him like a king LOL...they placed a mat for him gave him some crayons and even a free meal! that was the coolest thing.

we looked over the Menu and they had a variety of dishes, but being our first time we had a little hard time deciding on what to get.
My wife ordered Shrimp pasta and i ended up getting the turkey club sandwich. the wait for the food wasn't long either. what i did not know is how HUGE the sandwhich was until they brought it...i didn't even finish it but it was delish! :) and so was the shrimp pasta

Great place to come eat and chillax! :)"}
{"text":"I will never go to this Claim Jumper again (possibly none).  After browsing the other reviews, I realize our experience was not unique at this location.  I completely agree with the management having no clue and the lackadaisical service.

#1 - We arrived at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday.  Not busy at all.  We were the first in our party & called them to find they had a reservation and that we would be a group of 8 instead of 10.  We told the host.  He asked if we'd like to wait for the rest of our party & we said no.  He told us to wait while he went to find out where they wanted us.

Question 1:  Why give us the option of waiting or not waiting if you're going to tell us to wait anyway?

Question 2:  Why was a table not ready for us when we were prompt for our 6:30 pm reservation?  (You might think it's because we went from 10 to 8...  see #2 to find out why that's not the case.)

#2 - By the time the host figured out where we were going, the rest of our party had arrived.  One of the 2 kids in our group made a b-line to a hugh booth right in front & I laughed that he found our table.  The host said we could sit there.  I said no that's ok.  (Really I didn't want us all to be stuck in a big long booth)  He proceeded to take us around the corner to a booth of the exact same style.  Far bigger than a party of 8 needed.  I hesitated as some of our party sat & started sliding in.  Then the host said, \"We have a TABLE for 8 over here if you'd rather have that.\"  Like I said, the place was not busy at all.  We agreed that would be better  (thank goodness since we wound up being there so long, we all got up more than once).

#3 - The server took our drink order and by that time, we all also had our food orders ready.  About 20 minutes later, we still hadn't gotten our drinks (just basic beverages, no cocktails) and had to ask if they were coming.  We were all talking, so I hadn't realized it was so long until my guy asked her about it.  It still took a while, like this was the first effort that was put into getting them.

#4 - A few of us had ordered salads.  A different server brought those out & there was much confusion getting them to the right people.  He just didn't seem to be listening when we told him where they went.

#5 - 7:30 pm (an hour in) and no food.  We also had 2 kids in our group.  Here's a tip for all restaurant management...  bring out the kids meals asap!  Crayons will only get you so far (about 5 minutes in my experience).  It was probably about 10 minutes later our food started arriving...  4 meals of the 8 were brought out...  2 burgers, steak & my tortellini.  It took a few more minutes before 3 more meals (ribs & the kids meals) were brought out...  still missing 1, my guy's tortellini.  It seemed to take them a couple minutes to realize.  Especially strange since we both had the same entree.

#6 - My guy got a couple fries from another person at our table & mentioned they seemed cold.  She said they were and that her steak was way over done.  I realized my pasta seemed dry on top and cold, as if it had been sitting.  His tortellini finally arrived and also looked dry.  The top pieces were also scorched, most likely from a heat lamp.  One of the burgers came with a baked potato, which was so cold it couldn't be eaten.

#7 - After all this, I went to the front to ask for a manager.  It took a few minutes for him to make his way to me.  I explained the situation and began to walk back to our table so he could come handle it with the whole group.  He didn't budge.  After explaining everything that happened, all he said was, \"does she want the steak re-done?\"  I said, \"Let's go talk to them.\"  He told me he'd be right there and ran off in another direction.

I'm pretty patient.  However, after hearing how messed up things were, I'd expect it to be addressed promptly.  Suddenly, I was no longer hungry.  I was done.

#8 - After at least 5 minute (likely more), the manager got to our table.  He seriously did not seem to know how to handle this.  He just asked if we wanted our meals re-done or to order something else.  Remember, we already waited over an hour to get cold, overcooked, dry meals!  No mention of taking any of them off the bill at this point either.

The delay in him addressing us & his inability to offer up a satisfactory solution indicated he was inept in handling this kind of situation.  He wound up taking a couple meals off the bill, only after I told him he needed to (someone else was paying, so it wasn't for my benefit, only to make it as right as it could be) AND he initially argued about one of the suggestions.  Frankly, by this time the whole situation was so awful, even comping the whole bill would have only vaguely been satisfactory.

In the end, my guy & I had eaten nothing but the extra side salads we ordered (thank goodness) and we wound up being there another hour for the steak meal to be completely re-done and that person finished eating alone.

In short, stay away!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I waited to be acknowledged by the hostess while she was on the phone. She could have looked up and gestured that she'd be a moment. Then there were two servers who could have stepped in. So we stood there feeling like fools waiting to be seated. 
I can't tell about the food but the service was non-existent."}
{"text":"We live in the area and this used to be our \"go to\" restaurant when we had guests in town. Not any more. We hadn't been back in a while and it was very disappointing this time. I understand this chain was bought out recently. It has definitely gone down hill since. I started with a one-star review but will concede to two because the food was edible. Though a tiny bit pricy for a casual restaurant, our experience was average at best. My chicken was obviously overcooked and very dry. The steak tips were fine. Though I didn't ask why, I did notice that one of our friends ate very little of here meatloaf. None of us ate our grilled vegetables as they were remarkably tough and tasteless. Though presentation isn't everything it is important when you've taken your guests somewhere... everything on the plates just looked messy. All this after the waitress flipped a glass of wine onto the table, onto our guests, their clothing, and purse. We realize this was an accident and a sincere apology would have sufficed but the waitresses comment was \"I've been doing this for two years and I've never done that before\". She seemed to think it was funny. Neither was she in any hurry to assist us cleaning up, she just stood there. We had to ask for extra napkins and a wet cloth to wipe wine off the ruined shirt and purse. I was thoroughly embarrassed to have brought people here and it goes without saying that I'll never do it again. My guess is that Claim Jumper is on it's way out. This area is crawling with restaurants so you've got to be competitive to stay in business. This one is clearly at the bottom of the pack now."}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouse or any salad that you would like to try it's very clean it's very tasty it's fresh and I do recommend of course the price also very good"}
{"text":"Wow, 4 years of  being a regular for happy hour, which is all day Sunday, today was the final straw for us. We will no longer be customers at Claim Jumper at Fort Apache. I ordered from the happy hour menu and my wife decided she wanted the halibut from the main menu. We waited 25 minutes before we got the food and the bar area only had 3 other tables w customers! Immediately, we noticed the halibut smelled VERY strong and my wife took a bite and there was no flavor. She said it tasted like it was frozen. She asked to change her selection and the waitress said ok. She returned w a regular menu and did not bring the happy hour menu. My wife selected 2 items that we knew were on the happy hour menu. We ate our meal and got the check. The 2 items she selected, were charged full price from the regular menu, not the happy hour menu. I asked the waitress about the extra charge and she said, well, your wife selected from the menu, I told her, you didn't bring the happy hour menu and you know I selected 3 items from it, so why wouldn't the price be from the HH menu? She huffed and left and came back 10 minutes later and just dropped off the bill. The manager took ten dollars off instead of changing the ticket to show what was actually ordered. By now, we're frustrated and just pay the bill.  You've lost a couple of regulars and when we had guests, we would always go to CJ's, but not anymore."}
{"text":"All went well until we got our entrees (chicken fried steak and beef rib tips).  The dishes were soooooooooooooo salty.  Please review the use of salt in the recipes but for now I won't take another chance.  Everything else; cocktails, appetizer, and salad were very good."}
{"text":"Party of 4. They said the wait time was 25 minutes at 6:45pm on a Friday. About 16 customers were waiting to be seated in the waiting area, and a few more in the bar area. It took about 25 minutes to be seated...but we counted at least 9 unoccupied tables and 40 unoccupied seats in the area we were seated. I Ordered the Steak Chili Baker.  Bread was hot.  The Chili inside - STONE COLD.  Like someone opened a can of .89 cents Chili from a shelf and and simply spooned it in.  The menu indicated it would be topped with \"Cheddar Cheese\", 3 small shreds of cheese. I tried 2 spoonfuls, the meal (if that's what Claim Jumper calls a meal), was sent back 98% untouched. When I told the server  it was cold, she simply said she would have it \"heated up\". This response is what made me furious. Manager came buy a few moments later with a most insincere apology and his only response was an attempt to sell me something else. The sales receipt shows \"Kitchen Error, COLD\" on it where they backed out the cost.  Cold either means not cooked, or cooked and then left out until room temperature. Either way, this is a health hazard.  I will be notifying Southern Nevada Health District.

UPDATE 3/15/2012
Both the Assistant Manager and the Manager called me (I submitted a complaint on the Claim Jumper Website) to offer their apologies and express how they will better coach their staff."}
{"text":"The 4 of us went here on a Friday afternoon mid August.  It was my son's 20th birthday and we did the whole call ahead seating and also mentioned it was his birthday.  Well we get there around 1:30 and the place has barely any people in it.  It's not like the Claim Jumper of prior that I remember.  Usually this place is busy.  Anyway, we had one lady take our drink order and then she said she was passing us off to another server.  I figured maybe her shift was over......but yet they just opened at 11:00 a.m.  So we get our drinks and we proceed to order. 

 We got the shrimp avocado dip, a bbq chicken salad, a chicken pasta dish, a mini pizza and garden salad and sliders.  When I order my pizza I get the whole spiel about it being a mini pizza and only 4\" basically I guess trying to upsell.  I say I'm fine with it being a mini and our server stops pressing.  I guess they train the staff to do this since the table behind us ordered a mini pizza also and I heard the same speech given to them.  Another annoying aspect was when my son ordered his salad and his GF ordered her pasta dish, the server said \"I will give you the lunch portion on that.  It's a bit smaller but also cheaper\" or something along those lines.  I'm thinking \"No sh** they want the lunch version.  One, it's lunchtime and TWO the hostess opened our menus right to the lunch section before handing us the menus.\"

The dip was okay.  It was sort of like ceviche.  It was good but a bit hot.  The jalapenos for me anyway were a bit much.  My garden salad was just ok.  I mean, you could tell it had been pre-made and stored in a freezer/fridge.  The lettuce leaves had that see through type quality when you try to freeze then defrost it.  And the croutons were sweet.  It was kind of odd.  So we get our main order.  My husband's sliders were just barely ok.  He seemed to like them, however I think McDonald's makes a better burger.  The fries were good though.  My son's salad was huge (you could definitely split even the lunch size) and tasted okay.  He really seemed to enjoy it. The pasta dish was a big portion also but a bit bland.  And my tomato basil pizza was just barely okay.  I wanted a side of marinara with it but our server never came back.  We had to flag down another person just to grab a side of sauce.

The kicker was at the end no mention of a Happy Birthday or anything.  This was after we specifically mentioned it to the hostess.  The only other time we saw our waiter was when he brought the bill and came to get the payment.  Our bill came to $66 and change.  I will NOT be going back.  It's funny because prior to getting our food my husband and I were asking the waiter about a vegetarian menu since we were thinking of bringing my husband's niece here to eat.  However, after what I feel was a lack of good service and just barely okay food, I won't be heading there anytime soon.  I'm just glad my son seemed to like it and I just held my tongue until I could come on here and vent."}
{"text":"5 stars for their red velvet cupcakes. Yummy!"}
{"text":"We used to come here alot when it first opened , then the novelty wore out .
         Claim jumper has good food and huge portions and a very large and diverse  menu .  They have pretty much covered there bases as far as pleasing a far ranging customer base, while still maintaining some type of quality.   I know i said the menu was huge and diverse , but as much as we used to eat here there menu didn't change much,so we moved on , anyway we decided to eat here or i should say i did.
                        The food , for apps we had the fireroasted artichokes and parmesan crusted zucchini.  The artichoke needed a little more fire roasting but was still good.  The zucchini was really good it had a nice crispy coating and  had very good flavor. 
                     I had the citrus chix salad ( lettuce, apples, dried cranberries, mandarin orange, blue cheese , candied pecans and jerk chix.)  It was a good salad with a nice sweet vinergerette, great texture, crunchy, chewy tart , sweet .  It was good but did not blow me away, kinda disappointing.
              I always order this as a side salad with my entree ,but decided to order the dinner salad portion it comes with chix.  I was always impressed when I ordered it as an  app. salad so i was expecting more out of the dinner salad.   Overall , I think they lost a step since i first came here, maybe the economy  , had something to do with it ,before on a Saturday night at 7 pm like on this night it would be a 30 min wait for sure.   Tonight seated right away and the restaurant remained half full.
                     I hope they bounce back to the claim jumper i remember, Because in -laws coming to town and they really enjoy it here."}

{"text":"I ate at Claim Jumper's on Wednesday and got a great turkey sandwich on gluten free bun (btw their GF buns are great, and they really grill veggies wonderfully). I ordered a full rack of beef ribs to go, but Thursday night at home opened the box and saw it was pork ribs.  I don't eat pork so called the restaurant and spoke to Chris, the manager. He was TERRIFIC!  Made an order of beef ribs I went and picked up no charge.  That's wonderful customer service and the food is also very good."}
{"text":"Good good but not such a good value. Prices have gone and portions have gotten smaller. Will think twice about coming back"}

{"text":"We decided to try Claim Jumper for Thanksgiving this year with a party of 9 people. We had made our reservations for 5pm. We were seated at about 5:20pm, no big deal we had a cocktail at the bar and everyone was enjoying themselves. We sat down ordered drinks and the server returned and said \" hate to be the bearer of bad news but we are out of turkey\", of course we all thought he was joking but unfortunately he was not joking. No turkey, so they offer a choice of Prime Rib, Tri-tip, Salmon or shrimp dinners. Everyone chose the prime rib. 6 of the 9 prime ribs came out undercooked so we sent them back and they returned overcooked 1 person ate theirs anyway and 5 did not eat at all. We asked for the General manager and he arrived about 10 minutes later. After my son explained what had happened he removed 5 meals from the bill. The problem is that this was our Thanksgiving dinner. On a normal night I can forgive a restaurant for having a bad night, but to be out of Turkey on Thanksgiving is absolutely ridiculous and unforgivable. To say the Claim Jumper ruined our Holiday Dinner is an understatement. We actually felt bad for the server who had deal with the incompetence of the kitchen and his managers. Claim Jumper has 9 adults that will share this nightmare story with their friends and family."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a few years as only two restaurants exist in Phoenix, both no where near I live. Food is still good, I don't understand why the chain has struggled. Lemon drop martinis were way too easy to suck down."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here earlier today, the waiter was super rude from the start. We ordered potatoes skins as a appetizer I asked if he could put the bacon on the side since I was a vegetarian he instantly got a attitude and stormed away.



Potato skins came out really fast & they were ice cold in the middle of them we gave the waiter the benefit of the doubt maybe he was having a bad day or something.

So I ordered a cookie finale and when he brought it out I noticed immediately that the spoon had a \"Booger\" on it yes I said \"Booger\". We immediately called the manager and notified her that the waiter brought us a spoon with a booger on it. She tried to tell us the booger was lettuce & that she'd bring another spoon out. We told her to bring us the check and we left

If you care about customer service and sanitation DONT GO TO THIS LOCATION

Server asked on appetizers, requested 1 cup of clam chowder for app. Server (R) brought 3 waters 3 lemons and bread. Ordered Cobb salad and requested my limes for water. Limes were brought just before the dinner plates and I had to ask for my soup. Server came back to tell me they were making fresh chowder and that it would be a while asking if I still wanted it. Soup was okay, salad was decent,. Avocado was.a bit to soft. This is my second visit to this location. Over all none to happy with the service or the food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, horrid sliders, waiter couldn't answer simple question asked regarding \"what sides come with sliders\", had to wait for diet coke as the keg had to be changed, gave waiter our order prior to 5:30p for early bird prices however I watched him take a good 8 mins to enter it in the computer.  Another waiter waited to enter his order and finally walked away.  Our waiter had no people skills, no knowledge, and moved at a turtle's pace.  No condiments on sliders, no garnish and I was not even offered any.  The restaurant was so cold that I put a napkin over my fries to try and keep them warm......didn't work.  Horrid experience!"}

This Claim Jumper is in Town Square so probably sees a lot of business, however, on this late afternoon it was pretty empty.  And while all the others were seated quietly in the main room, we were welcomed to sit at the bar tables...they must have already known. LOL

Our waitress was attentive and though clearly watched how much we were drinking, also didn't complain or give dirty looks when we tended to get a little loud.  Just kept giving us whatever we needed...love great service!!  

Thanks for coming to our rescue, it was exactly what we needed! ;0)"}
{"text":"They have great food! They make almost everything in house even the honey butter! The California Chicken Salad is amazing.

Parking is easy if you park in the south garage."}
{"text":"Stopped in late last night for a bite to eat. We had just arrived to the hotel and our options were limited. Restaurant was not crowded and we were seated immediately. 

We were not greeted by any of the wait staff or management that passed by several times without a single glance in our direction. We could understand this to be the case if they were super busy but there were many empty tables throughout.   We walked out after no acknowledgement and informed the hostess who seemed to care less! Not a typical Landry's dining experience! 

Will not return!"}

Med rare, thank you guys some place's just do not know temperature on meat. I think the bartenders name was Courtney, very friendly attentive and had full knowledge of the menu. Which by the way is too much. My suggestion is to cut the menu down and have a completely  fresh food menu."}

I got a seafood plate with shrimp and heart of artichoke cream sauce. Fish was good. Shrimp with sauce was big disaster. In the picture it made it seem like there will be lots of sauce with shrimp; however, sauce portion was very small. It was good because sauce was BAD. It was too sour. It ALSO i came with green bean with very salty seasoning. Rice was salty too.   Over all I dont think I will come back to this restsurant."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday 4/17/15 and it was amazing! I loved the way it looked. There were sooooooo many choices of food. And my waiter was great as well. Now I'm on the hunt for another restaurant like this."}
{"text":"We love this place!  So much variety and everything we've had is amazing...we always plan what were getting before we actually go because there are so many options on the menu.   The free garlic cheese bread they give is so yummy!  The new England clam chowder is delicious!  We try to eat here as often as we can!"}
{"text":"I love the feeling that you just came to Grandma's for dinner. The warm smells that greet you at the door are wonderful! The chess  and huge fireplace are a great extra touch.
   We ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and Black Tie Pasta. Both were excellent as all there meals always  are. I suggest holding off on an appetizer since the dinner portions are more than big enough! 
   I will keep going back again and again."}
{"text":"Not sure where to go and what to eat, with no inspiration, I pushed the door of my neighborhood Claim Jumper. Went to the bar, no point for me to monopolize a table by myself. Well, I enjoyed my evening. Katie did a great job at the bar, accommodating my special requests, and being supra attentive. A good conversation, 2 beers, and the night went fast. Full belly, happy face. Good job Katie."}
{"text":"I apologize to our server. We were drunk and sloppy and on periscope. But drunk and sloppy, it was still good. It was so good. It fed our drunk bellies. It filled our drunk souls. The food they served completed the night as one does with greasy, rich food after a drinking bout. Our livers were already in danger, why not throw some grease on top of the fire. I'm sure if we, my boyfriend and I, had been mature, sober adults, it would have been a more mature dining experience, a t√™t-√†-t√™t.
But that was not what we wanted. We wanted drunk and low brow and to have people text shout at us on periscope. And, bless them, CJ's did that for us. I hope we remembered to tip them for us acting belligerent. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. But thank you for the most grilly grilled cheese I've ever drunkenly consumed. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Tried the Claim Jumper during there happy hour.  Drinks were reasonably priced for happy hour.  The food was not very good tried the calamari, which must of been frozen because it was soggy and had a wierd smell to it.  And also tried the mini pizza.  The pizza was average, sauce and cheese  were good.  But nothing special i would go back for.  If not for the drink specials they would get one star."}
{"text":"As I sit here on Saturday night at 8 pm, 35 minutes after being seated I still have not received my drink. Obviously the food hasn't arrived..."}
{"text":"I hope that the restaurant sees this, but Hoda whom was our waitress was great! Honest about what she enjoys here, stepped up to the plate to bestow a perfect French 75 and recommended fun options in Las Vegas.

Charthouse Las Vegas... I enjoyed my time here even more so than our Portland Location.

If you are staying at Golden Nugget, skip Claim Jumper! Visit the fishes here."}
{"text":"A Little Better This Time\"

The service improved 100% over last time we were here. The food is decent, not great. Maybe my tastes have changed but it seems that the onion rings (a big order, certainly enough to share), have become mostly breading... Where's the Onion? Fish and Chips also have too much breading on the fish, and may have been cooked in oil that was not hot enough (too greasy). The hamburger and Thai cole slaw were very good."}
{"text":"Nothing too exciting. Just a chain restaurant. I think e service was decent and food was ok just nothing special."}
{"text":"I remember how good Claim Jumper used to be before Landry's bought them out of Bankruptcy.   Tonight this huge restaurant was about 30% full and I can see why.   Service was slow and indifferent and the food was mediocre at best.  Too bad, was hoping that they had improved from our last visit but it was not to be"}
{"text":"Laid back and classy old school dinner club feel. Excellent food and service at a fair price. Clean and not smoke filled. Ribeye is excellent service was fast."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for about three years now and I've usually been satisfied with the service. Only one recent brush with a waiter who was busy and seemed impatient.

The food is good, not stellar, but the atmosphere is great and the happy hour deals keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service & atmosphere!  Yes, you are going to pay a little more than your average restaurant but the food is so much better - it's worth the price!  It's our #1 place to go.  Hubby can get his beef & I can get fish & veggies.  Just signed up for their Landry's Select Club which gives you $25 to spend & you get $25 on your birthday!  If you are concerned about cost, go for lunch instead of dinner.  You get the same great food & we didn't even notice a change in the portion size.  Manager was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food was delicious!! I'll be back again soon, that's for sure"}
{"text":"We were disappointed in the food and the service - not up to the caliber that we have had there in the past.   Service was slow and the food was really salty... I brought guests with us thinking we were getting the normal GREAT food - not so this visit!"}
{"text":"Terrible food terrible service I bought a van at Carmax it took an hour and 29 minutes that night we went to Claim Jumper and it took 3 hours stay away from the barbecue is disgusting hundred dollars down the drain I won't be back"}
{"text":"We usually do not have issues here and figured it was a safe bet for a quick decent dinner.  Boy were we wrong!  The service was decent but our food took well over an hour to get to the table.  I should put a disclaimer here that we have a toddler and long waits can be difficult for us all.  When the food finally showed up my tri-tip was really fatty and tough, my hubby's food was lukewarm.  The manager came by but only to tell us that they couldn't find our Landry's card in the system.  We were not expecting anything free but an apology for the wait would have been nice.  I will say that we will not be returning to any Claim Jumper restaurants..Landry's has ruined this place."}
{"text":"Almost feels like its my first visit to Vegas. 
Wish I'd have visited sooner.
Food is mediocre. 
Drinks are strong."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great food and service..portions are Hugh.."}
{"text":"First time at any Claim Jumpers restaurant. My wife and I were there with the in-laws and our kids. We ordered some burgers, appetizers, and the Jambalaya Pasta. All was fine except for the pasta. For $18.99, the portion was very small, the pasta was over cooked, the shrimp was cold, and there were exactly 3 slivers of sausage. We expressed our disappointment with the Jambalaya with our server who brought over the manager. We discussed the dish with him as well and his response was to ask us if we had ever been to their restaurant and/or had that dish there before. We told him that we had not and when the bill arrive the Jambalaya was on the check. To not spoil the experience for everyone else in our party, I told the family that I had forgotten something at the table and that I would meet them in the car. When they walked out of the restaurant I asked for the manager again. He came over and I expressed my disappointment on how the matter was handled and how he did not offer to make it right somehow. His response was effectively that was how his restaurant served that dish and to have a good night. Needless to say that we will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken pot pie.  The crust was delicious... not too doughy,  not too flaky,  it was just right. The portion was big,  I don't recommend getting soup with the chicken pot pie because you don't want to get full on the soup...like I did... The good news is that you can bring home the leftover chicken pot pie. . They have a special container and a way to remove the chicken potpie from the bowl into the special container. 

Our waitress,  Christina,  was also the bartender and she took very good care of my hubby and I.  

I enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"Ambience was great. 

Restaurant was clean and awesome decor.  

Food was good. Fish was dry or oily. The Tortalini was awesome so was the flat breaded shrip. Wowow!! Zuchini tasted like acid. Everything else was average. 

Service wasn't so great. Again. I have been here three times with friend. Each time its the same. The servers barely spend any time at table. Very impersonal. Which is okay if you meet the steps of service but they don't. 

Joe was our server this time. I don't really fault him because he was really trying to do a good job.  I was certain it was his first or second day but the manager told me he was their top server. Maybe just an off night.. My main suggestion to him would be to slow down.. with 4 tables you should be able to spend more time and talk to your guest more and more frequently. We looked for him many times but wasn't around. 

Server did not know menu. Food or drink. We asked for a miller lite.. he asked \"on draft or bottle\" we picked draft.. then came back to tell us they were \"out\" when I walked out I noticed there was no draft for miller lite. I can't say i have never done the same but after a few years in the service business I learned it is worth what it takes to know the menu to the best you can so you don't have to guess or lie. 

We asked about the flavor of one of the dishes.. he said he would ask the manager.. He should know the flavors of the food.. and all the employees should taste the food (free of charge to them) frequently. 

Food arrived at different times. (my biggest dining pet peeve). 
Sent an app back. Never saw it again. Showed up 20 minutes after we waved em down and asked for it. Same with fish. 

Table was unbussed through out. water went empty a couple of times, no biggy.

Manager was aware of the many issues and really did nothing. I was surprised. When one of the guests at my table said their fish was bad.. he said \"maybe you got a bad one, let us recook it\" which is okay but really it would have been nice to be given the choice of a different dish. He seemed he wanted to do more but his hands were tied. The corporate big wigs should let them comp when things go wrong. .Then we would be back knowing it will be good in the end. you know?  I don't mind paying full price, at all, that's why I came.. even tipped good. But it's good to say \"hey, were better than this, let us make it right.\"

In the end, I liked the place and I'd still go back.."}
{"text":"My hubby and I recently visited this site for a casual Saturday lunch.  No waiting in line and food was good.  I had some delicious fish tacos and hubby had cobb salad which was ginormous.  Good tropical ice tea as a change from the usual.

Have visited other Claim Jumpers and they have the same huge menu which makes it hard to decide what to order since everything is good.  Please bring back the steak fries.  Those skinny potato sticks can get cold by the time the plate gets to the table!

Overall, a good casual restaurant that you can stop in and have healthy lunch if you choose.  Service is good and atmosphere decent . . . if you are into coal mining.  Their desserts look fantastic if you are a sweet person.  Hmm, hubby and I are not."}
{"text":"Prices has gone up from the past..but the portions are still humongous and the food is all pretty delicious and simple. The seating in the restaurant is private in most booths and tables and spaced enough to help make it feel this way. The service is not the greatest I have to admit, but it isn't the worst."}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as negative stars? Went there with a large party of 16 people (for a belated mothers day) ...had to wait outside for 30-40 minutes and when we finally got inside realized half the place was empty?! (I saw the seating chart on their computer which had red X's over most of the seating areas) We were then mixed between booths and tables (with kids) and after we all realized they had a full patio section, for groups, we insisted they move us (which they did) The only good experience seemed to be our waiter was decent and frequently checked on us. Half the food was good and the other half was definitely not resturant quality. I got the roasted chicken with green beans and a sweet potato...what they gave me was one of those supermarket roasted chickens/ a dry regular potato/ and green beans with this inedible seasoning + salt mixture...really???

For this being my first time experience going there it might have ruined things for me...just disappointed"}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch and/or dinner. I had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut and was full before I could finish the plate! The atmosphere is family oriented but also has low light booths. Price wise it's good considering it's in the heart of Town Square and it's Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my parents and ordered a steak. Everything was great, but as I cut into my steak I cut into a paper wrapper that was left on? The manager/waiter was nice and brought out a new steak, but by the time it came out we were done with everything else. Basically, it ruined my meal and in return ruined our family dinner. The manager have us a free piece of cake, but really since we had to take the food home and will probably never reheat it the food that was messed up should have been comped. 

We all agreed that we will not be going here again. 

If you do go -- do not order a steak!"}
{"text":"The place is empty for a reason. I used to bring my family here all the time and the food was great. Now there is no flavor to anything. My wife had the bow tie pasta and the chicken was cut as thin as possible and had hardly any in it. I had the chicken club wrap and all I could taste was lettuce and ranch dressing. It had almost no chicken in it either. I will not be going back. The only benefit was our waiter gave good service."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last month and this place was huge! It was pretty well priced. Not to busy staff was fast. The food wasnt that great i feel like i could get the same thing other places, very forgettable"}
{"text":"Food - WAY OVER PRICED and not as good as you would expect with the prices. We ordered an appetizer sampler. The brought us potato skins that were still frozen in the middle, we asked for them to take them back and they did and when they brought them back they were burnt. My friend ordered a steak and asked that it be done Medium Well and when it came it was so rare it was practically mooing. 

Drinks - Decent but nothing to rave about. 

Service - Poor. Our wait staff was over whelmed by their section and was running around like a chicken with his head cut off. I understand that environments like that can cause this but I have seen worse and he should have been able to handle it. The management that came and talked to us was rude and a bit snarky. We were spending over $130 in the establishment and he acted as though we were an inconvenience since we were not happy with the appetizer or one of the drinks we had ordered. When my friend explained that her steak was not cooked enough he did offer to take it back and have it recooked but by that time that had taken place she had lost her appetite.

Atmosphere - Best part of the experience.

After being spoken to the way the manager spoke to us I can safely say I will NEVER return to this Claim Jumper. For the amount of money we spent that night I would have at least expected some common courtesy."}
{"text":"Drinks:
Ice Tea - good
Strawberry Lemonade - barely ok,  definitely had better

Appetizer:
Shrimp & Avocado Salsa - chips were not suitable for the liquidy salsa, they were thin & a weird, long, obtuse triangular shape that allowed the salsa to fall off the chip easily. The avocado was not quite ripe & lacked flavor.

Salad:
Caesar Salad - ok, nothing special

Meal:
Chicken Pot Pie - really good, full of chunky chicken & veggies, served piping hot

Mini Corn Dogs - good
Mac'n Cheese - good, but the cheese was a little dried out & rubbery like the dish sat under a heat lamp

High Sierra Smothered Steak - steak was cooked perfectly (medium-rare), but the blue cheese butter ruined it. The flavor of the steak was not consistent, one bite was bland & the next would be very salty.

Sides:
French Fries - very good
Broccoli- was not strained properly & served in a bowl with about a half inch of water at the bottom that sapped any flavor from it. Would have been nice to have maybe a little butter on the side to add to it

Dessert:
Carrot Cake - really good
Ice Cream - really good

Server:
Melanie was great. 

Over all service:
Much better then the last time we ate here over 12 years ago when we were practically ignored by our server & it took over an hour & management intervention to get the wrong order. We understand that that was an unfortunate anomaly & are pleased to say the service was much improved."}

{"text":"Where is Diane Sawyer when I need her? I have an exclusive breaking 
news report. This past Friday I witnessed a miracle at Claim Jumper. 
As you know I had boycotted Claim Jumper ever since I was informed 
they no longer felt the need to offer my favorite item THE Chicken & 
Biscuits.  So low and behold a family gathering had requested my 
presence at CJs.  I'm looking over the menu and I still have anger in 
my heart because although they have sandwiches and burgers nothing 
sounded good to me when low and behold I hear rumblings and cheers 
coming from the other end of the table.  All of a sudden I thought 
someone was playing an evil trick on me because I thought I heard that 
they DO have chicken and biscuits.  Sure enough our waiter advises me that they have always offered it off the menu.  I could not believe I had 
been deceived for months but very excited to rekindle my relationship 
with my favorite menu item.. So excited!!  So when my meal came it was a little altered from what I remember but the main components didn't disappoint.  So when in the mood for a ton of cluck that doesn't suck head on down to Claim Jumper and remember if your server tells you no ask for a second opinion.  :). Until next time my friends."}
{"text":"Wish I can give it a zero. The manager is an ass! He completely blew off my undercooked burger. With all of the choices we have in Vegas, there's no need to go here for mediocre food and get insulted."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many, many times over.  The service is stellar.  It is as good as service get anywhere. Your drink does not go empty without your waiter or waitress coming to fill it up.  You are asked frequently - but not too much - if you need anything.  If a waiter gets tied up and can't get to  you, someone else comes to make sure you are being WELL taken care of.
The decor in this restaurant is amazing!!  Deer, elk and buffalo heads adorn the walls, a rustic look throughout the place yet has a warm ambiance to it.  
The food is very good.  I pretty much stick with steaks, so I guess how can you go wrong with that.  But, the people I have taken with me have ordered all kinds of different things off of the menu and always give rave reviews of it.  It isn't exactly a cheap restaurant yet it has fared the storms of economic chaos, that in itself speaks volumes to me. 
I have not a bad word to say about the place and I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Getting 1 star just because the zucchini was good.....with that being said.....don't expect to get any ranch for dipping it in, or anyone who cares that you'd like some. Service was awful! Maybe you need to order more than 2 Mai tais and zucchini to get service. The table next to us had issues as well, once again, no one seemed to care. Really, truly disappointing experience. ...."}

Price point way too high.We will not return..."}
{"text":"What a mess.

First, I called to make reservations for 6:00 PM.  I called at 1:00 and they put me on hold for 10 minutes.... to make a reservation.

I called back an hour later and made the reservation.  When I showed up, they didn't have it.

They told me we would have to wait for 40 minutes, even though the restaurant was half-empty on a Friday night.  (That's another sign.  Where is the business during Friday dinner).

They seated us early.  Didn't matter.  It took an hour to get the food.  I could hear the manager apologizing to another table next to us, so it must be common.  

Not only that, people who showed up later got their food earlier.  And the food?  Nice and cold.

Boycott this place.  Maybe we can get a better restaurant to replace it."}
{"text":"This place used to be awesome before the big corporate dog and pony show took it over. And then it went downhill. Now they're bringing their food menu is back to where it used to be (which is good), but the service hasn't improved. 25 minutes for drinks in a half full restaurant. Yikes!! Still like it tho. When I got on yelp, I planned on giving it 3 stars, which is exactly where it is now. Perfect!"}
{"text":"STAFF: Friendly

SERVICE: Very Slow (Wednesday night, with restaurant about 20% full)

FOOD: I ordered the BBQ Baby Back Pork Rib supper (i1/2 rack of ribs with vegetables and baked sweet potato). Rib meat was very good, falling off the bone, potato was huge and tasty. Vegetables were overly spiced with pepper and were replaced with steamed. 

My friend ordered a chicken dish with potato cakes and vegetables. The portions were large and she also thought it good, but not outstanding.

OVERALL: Since there are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas we won't return here as despite the good food it wasn't as good as one can find elsewhere."}

I won't go over everything that everyone else did.  The food was cooked perfectly, and came in ample proportions.  The service was very attentive.  I saw that their idea of a lemon slice in the iced tea was a small circle, so I asked for more, and got whopping lemon slices.  Very nice.

My only complaint:  it's hard to find the parking lot!  We made several wrong turns, but hunger pushed us forward until we eventually found the parking lot."}
{"text":"Well, tonight was our first time here in a while and things have changed!  Bread has been changed (just ok), much smaller portion on spinach dip (same price), very little alcohol in the long island iced tea, and wedge salad two thirds

The place was only half full yet it took 40 minutes to get my meal.
How can you screw up meatloaf and potatoes?
They were dry and tasted as if they were made the day before.
When I asked for some butter to make it at least palatable it took another 15 minutes!
By then I had reached my limit.
Never again."}
{"text":"First off I will start off by saying our service was excellent! Our server ran 8 tables all full and still had food and drinks to us! The food however was not so great. The calzone I ordered was very raw and nasty. Other items were quite bland as well. Over all the establishment was clean and neat. The beer is decent so happy hour wouldn't be to bad."}
{"text":"Hello, me and my wife visit claim jumper tonight to celebrate her birthday, when I arrive I told the young lady at the front door (Nicole) that today was my wife birthday, so we sat in the bar area for happy hour, when the server brought us drinks the margarita didn't taste right to my wife and asked the waitress to see if the bartender ( Gerry) can give us a sample of another drink instead of her wasting the drink, my wife told me that he slide the drink as if he was angry, not only that he came from behind the bar and spoke to everyone else except us. All i want it to do is celebrate her birthday not all this. I'm sorry if we ruin their night, but if I'm correct we were the customer. So much for a happy birthday celebration,"}
{"text":"Awesome food I had the Tri-tip steak with grilled shrimp and baked potato. Absolutely delicious the grilled shrimp were a nice size , the steak was tender and the glace sauce divine. My baked sweet potato was so huge I could have shared it with two others LOL. And the spiced butter complimented the sweet potato nicely. I highly recommend Claim Jumpers their prices are a bit high but worth every dollar. Our waiter was very courteous and attentive. The atmosphere reminds you of a cozy cabin type restaurant in the mountains. It has chairs that look like they were cut from logs and the booths are very spacious too. I highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Terrible. Cold tasteless food. Pasta had no flavor whatsoever. Baked potato was burned and ribs were cold in center. Won't be coming back EVER."}

If your having a BAD day dont take it on your costumer Just go home and sleep..."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. Staff at front desk was nice. Ordered our food and was all cold, husband asked for a beer and 20 mins later our waiter quickly walked by saying \" your beer is coming if you still want it?\" Whats up with that.  Waiter was trying to impress by memorizing our order and food was wrong anyway.. Prices jumped up and service sucked. Sadly won't be returning.."}
{"text":"Overall - good meal at a good price. The food is BIG and the price is fair for the size.

Service - Great! Brandi was nice and courteous. My only pet peeve was that she didn't write our order down and accidentally forgot our add-ons. 
 
Food - Extremely good! They offer bread before entrees. Started with the three cheese potato cakes which were cooked to perfection. Had a BBQ burger and I must say its worth a try. Didn't have deserts because the food is bigger than normal. But the chocolate cake looks AMAZING."}
{"text":"I love everything I've gotten here. You can't go wrong! So far some of my fav's are the blackened Bowtie chicken pasta, chopped steak (sooo flavorful!), and the tri tip. I also love their potato cakes, shoe string fries, peanut slaw, calamari and pretzel sticks!"}
{"text":"Had gotten a mailer that said lunch $9.99 start. Why not try. Service was slow. Drink refills slower. Bread with cheese was yummy! Not impressed to much with food. I had got a stuff baked potatoe with roasted veggies and chicken. I had to find the chicken. There was lots of veggies. I rather had more chicken or a balance. 
The other dish tri-tip with mashed potatoes and gravy. Same roasted veggies. The mashed potatoes was under meat once you moved it was. There was barley any. 2 drinks and 2 meals 32$. Not a good price for lunch, and slow service."}
{"text":"Making a long story a little shorter...we called ahead for a Tuesday night seating and were told there would be no wait. When the five of us arrived, we were told it would be a 30-minute wait because two giant parties had just walked in moments before. We were also offered immediate seating in the bar, which we accepted. 

The server was as efficient as she could be, given that she was suddenly responsible for about seven tables at once in the small bar area. Apparently she mistakenly believed that we were with a very large party (about 15 people) seated at four separate tables near us in the bar area, and the server put our order in with theirs. 

The food took an hour to arrive in spite of having ordered simple items: two sandwiches (one cold), two salads and a small individual pizza. The food was characteristically tasty and correctly prepared when it arrived, however. 

After the other party had left and after we had finished a single dessert that we shared, the server confided in us that she had mistakenly believed that we were with the other party and that's why our food had taken so long. She said the management was comping our entire meal as a result!

We gave the server a generous tip and we feel that the management comping the entire meal was well above and beyond what could rightfully and reasonably have been expected in a situation like this. 

Way to go, Claim Jumper! You turned what could have been an unpleasant experience into an unexpectedly terrific one! This was a birthday dinner that will have lasting fond memories for us."}
{"text":"My family and i went in for dinner to celebrate my moms birthday a couple weeks ago (with 2 small kids under 4, mind u). Well so we order, the waiter keeps sayin its coming out soon...every 20 minutes, for almost an hour and a half!!! Seriously for kids mac and chz, kids pizza, tilapia...  u would think we ordered 20 steaks! And anyone who has small kids can empathize with sitting in a restaurant that long. Brutal. Finally my brother calls a manager over, daniel, and he went above and beyond! We just wanted to know why it took so long but daniel took off the kids meals and sent out cake with a candle for mom. And of course many apologies. So thanks to daniel, ive bumped the rating to 3 stars.

Side note: i have lunch here often so i get the feeling this is a starter house for servers? If youre in a hurry, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Never going back. One meal came out after all of us were done with ours. Very slow service. Server was clueless on how to do his job. Ruined birthday celebration."}
{"text":"I love the creamy chicken tortilla soup, and their steaks are always juicy and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Food was good, service needs improvement. Asked for a drink with my dinner,  never received it. Waiter brought appetizer and salad without any utensils and waited longer that expected for them. No sense of urgency to serve guests."}
{"text":"Fresh you want, fresh you shall recieve, Our entrees indeed, and superb! First  impressions a lasting one...cheers to the hostess, and likewise to Kelvein the Server. A brief chat with the Manager was pleasant as well. Come with family, friends or colleagues...and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service and decent bar. The food quality is inconsitant. The restaurant is clean but starting to look old and a little worn inside. The buffalo wings are okay the beef ribs were dry and tough and the baked potato was even mediocre."}
{"text":"Someone contacted on here apologizing, she said someone would contact us. No one ever did! This establishment doesn't care about its customers. I do not recommend eating here, you're business is appreciated else where."}
{"text":"No stars.  Couldn't tell you if the food and drinks were any good.  Never got that far.  Walked in. Took a seat at the bar to watch the game.  Waited for the woman trending bar to come over.  No greeting, nothing. Two guys come in and sit at the end of the bar. She walks up to greet them and offers them menus. Walks by me again. Serves a beer top a person on the other side of the bar.  Makes a couple of drinks for one of the tables. Walks by me again and asks the two guys at the end of the bar what they would like. I'd seen enough and left. Went to Islands and got gray service. No wonder Claim Jumpers was empty."}
{"text":"Recently on vacation my family and I ate here. After all it's located in the Golden Nugget, making it a choice based on convenience. The food is expensive and not very good. Honestly it's worth it to go out and eat at a place that is an actual restaurant. I ordered a beer that arrived warm, I told my server I wanted a new one and she wanted to set the opened beer in a fridge and bring it back once it was cold!!!! That sums up our experience eating here! Vegas has so many options for a quick bite don't waste your time or money at this place!"}
{"text":"Ate at Claim Jumper recently (week night, party of three).  

We had 2 salads and a child's order of pasta.  We waited for well over 20+ min.

On top of this, I had to ask our waitress 3 (three) times for juice and more dressing.

Needs improving."}
{"text":"Won't come back!!
Main dish was cold and not fresh:((
Waiter just ok.I only enjoy coconut shrimps."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, never can go wrong. 
Their coffee is a must!
Happy to come back. Animir was an outstanding host! Was very informative, also taught the table of claim jumper and its origins. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"We used to go all the time. Last 2 times disappointed in the quality and I had a huge long black hair laying so visible on my sandwich I was stunned that no one else saw it. Yuk. It will be a while before I can go back."}
{"text":"I'm just glad that they brought back the Strawberry \"fields\" salad.  Yummo!  Fresh greens, goat cheese, fresh strawberries, bell peppers, onions, glazed pecans, chicken and this amazing viniagrette dressing! Wowwy Mowwy!  Oh, and it comes with a crusty buttery cheesy bread.  I have had a few run ins with bad waiter service, but the manager was always quick to come by our table to ask if anything else was needed.  As long as I get what I ordered and I dont have to poke around their tables to make \"eye contact\" with my server I'm ok.  They know they will get a mideocre tip if their service is so-so.  It's on them.  My mother got a red velvet cupcake on the house for her birthday! That was nice."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is usually a no-brainer with great food and great service. Not so at this location today. Restaurant was less than half full but service was very slow. Server never came back to check on the entree. I ordered the Shrimp Fresca Pasta, and the pasta was horribly obercooked, and the shrimp coating was mushy. Very sub par for this chain."}
{"text":"I have came here a couple of times, food is mediocre.

I will say this, the Chicken Pot Pie is my favorite dish on the menu.  I believe it is under $10, but you get your moneys worth, it is huge!"}
{"text":"for a chain restaurant I don't mind this every once and a while...the place is huge just like their portions so come either really hungry or with someone you could share with.  :) BF got the chicken and gravy and I got the wedge (which we shared because it was HUGE) and then I had some clam chowder.  Always good traditional food and not extremely over priced.  our server was super friendly and clearly LOVED her job lol but we had a great time with her-sorry I forget her name."}
{"text":"I have had many business meetings here with consistent great service and food. Their drinks are wonderful and I always make sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"We ate here a few times while visiting Phoenix. We always had great service and the food is always good. The portions are large, so you are able to share. The Drunken Chicken was excellent! The bread is warm and yummy. we tried the Motherlode Cake and it was enough for 6-8 people. Also, so good! We will visit again!"}
{"text":"This was the worst service & meal I have partaken in for a long time! There was five of us cramed  into a small booth. The only thing we asked is that our childs' order come out with the appetizer. Not only did it not come out first but we had to wait 20 minutes after ALL the food hit the table at the same time. The waitress had no clue we hadn't even received the soups & salads that came with the meals! The least of the issues was the fact I was never even offered a refill on my soda. When I finally asked repeatedly for a refill it showed up only after I left the table. It will take a huge miracle to ever get me back in a Claim Jumpers again!!! 

Why is there no negative star count?"}
{"text":"Wow...i dont remember Clam Jumpers having such extremely high prices. Actually they're outrageous prices for the value... ordered two combo and the chef beat the he'll out of it because it was thin and a half of a chicken breast & beef tip was thin slices 5 pieces dollar coin sizes for $26 and ridiculous prices for a hamburger. Dont recommend this restaurant and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service..resonable prices and huge portions. The fish and chips was terrific. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Don't know if they can't hear or just don't listen. Ordered a pizza classic size received a small size. Also asked for pico on the side of fish tacos and received the pico on the tacos. I don't complain on any review but this is where I put my foot down."}
{"text":"For a Saturday night the wait was short even though the place was full.  The food was good and plentiful.  I had the Tilapia Veracruz & shrimp, in came with rice  and green beans.  Taste blended in together great, that and a couple of beers...."}
{"text":"Best ribs i've had! price a little bit high but you get what you pay for, in my opinion, worth every cent spent! the girl at the front desk was a tad poor as we asked for a booth and she told us there was NONE but we looked around and everyone had a booth and several free booths around us too so that was the only criticism I have for them."}
{"text":"We had both breakfast and dinner here on separate days, both were delicious and good value for the price. 
Their menu has tons of options for any appetite.
I highly recommend if staying downtown to enjoy a meal at the Claim Jumper, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff!  Service was fast and constant.  Prices are reasonable for the portions.  Love this place and will be going back!"}
{"text":"My sister had eaten here before but I had not. Easy place to find. Located is a busy area of stores, theaters and other restaurants. Nice inside deco. No sweet tea. The waiter brought us some bread... Not just any bread. It as garlic cheese... Not overpowering but delicious. For apps we had the southeastern egg rolls. It came with a small oriental salad and two sauces. Spicy with a kick and really good. I had a small salad with the shrimp (spinach, lemon garlic sauce and pasta). Huge portion. My sister had a small salad with a hickory burger and fries. She really liked it. Our server was really attentive without being a pain.  Quick service and very good food. I just wished I had room for dessert because they all looked great!"}
{"text":"Was a bit worried after seeing some of the other reviews on here, but I didn't see any of the problems they mentioned. Pretty, clean building, and a spacious dining area. Service was reasonably fast and *very* friendly. Food was decent. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper seems like a restaurant I would love.  Unfortunately, it's just okay.  The look of the place is really cool, but the food isn't that good -- especially for the price.  The steak is expensive, but average at best (as an example, I'd consider Outback better at cheaper prices).  Even the garlic cheese toast, which sounds like it should be ridiculously delicious, is only decent."}
{"text":"I've been here about 8 to 10 times within the last year. So convenient that they are open 24 hours. From the rich black tie chicken pasta, their famous huge chicken pot pie, excellent steaks and much more. Tammy convinced me to get a Landry's reward card, offers you $25 to spend on your birthday every year, and points that lead to more rewards. Pretty cool. If you want great servers with personality and professionalism, ask for Bob the Hawaiian guy or Tammy."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Good drink specials on margaritas. Server was a bitch tho, forgot her name. Old hoe was from Hawaii"}
{"text":"I agree that the food is very tasty here. The only thing wrong about this place is that the portions are recklessly massive. You can feed an army with this stuff. The desserts you ask? They are HUGE. This perhaps is the reason that I am not such a great fan of this place. The amount of food does not agree well with my big belly, high cholesterol, insulin resilient, out of shape anatomy with a penchant for irresponsible alcohol consumption. Kicking my personal problems aside, I would have to say that this is a decent place for family and friends to dine in and spend time together. Great selection and service. I would have to admit that this is a bit on the expensive side. Did I mention that you get a lot of food here????"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the love for Claim Jumper. I went to the northwest location several years back with a giftcard and was terribly underwhelmed. My mom recently  reviewed the menu online and convinced me to go for dinner at the Green Valley location. We were met with a lengthy wait for a table, but stuck it out. Only to be ignored at our table for ten minutes before a drink order was taken. We should have left, but we had invested so much time already. The online menu wasn't current and the entr√©e she wanted wasn't available. A similar item was $3 more. Totally parched we finally received our drinks. The diet was flat. The iced tea was served with a rotting lemon. Then, later her entr√©e, came with a rotten potato. They switched it out, but obviously rotten food shouldn't be prepared, let alone leave the kitchen. Cheese, bacon and butter was requested with the potato, and the cheese was some sort of liquid. Ew. The rest of our meal was edible, but underwhelming and overpriced. Plus, we left with upset stomachs."}
{"text":"They don't have the Jamaican jerk chicken stuffed sweet potato anymore. My whiskey apple glazed chicken was awesome and we love their oven roasted vegetables. My wife's tri-tip was loaded with fat and connective tissue and her sweet potato was so cold it wouldn't melt the butter. They comped the check and made it right. Probably will not come back as they don't have the Jamaican chicken sweet potato on the menu and we came here just for that. Good overall, just disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was great! Our waiter, David, was fantastic! He checked on us and tried to make our meals as enjoyable as possible. However something went wrong in the kitchen and we waited for our food for over hour!!! If that wasn't ridiculous enough when management came over he didn't really even apologize he just seemed annoyed to even have to come over, it was absurd and made us all feel really uncomfortable! To top it off we barely got a discount! David was great but the management was unbelievably bad. Food was good as always"}
{"text":"When I lived in California, we would frequently go to the Claim Jumper and always looked foreword to the event.   Of course, that was many years ago and oh how things change!  I had the rib eye, I mean, I ordered the rib eye.   What I got, for $30.00, was one of the fattiest slabs of something that I would have never considered.   It was the 12 ounce cut, and more than 1/2 of that was pure fat.   It was like a slab of rib eye bacon.  Had to be the worst cut in the batch.   Two weeks before that, my wife prepared a rib eye from Costco that was simply the best steak I've ever had, and so foolishly, I believed the Claim Jumper could match the feat.   NOT EVEN CLOSE.

In addition, the print on the bill was so small that neither my wife nor I could not read it, and of course, we could not find anyone to read it to us.   As we were leaving, I tried to point this out to the host, and am absolutely certain that my concerns won't go beyond her ears.   It doesn't really matter though, as we absolutely, positively will not return.

I'll always remember the days when the Claim Jumper was a place we looked foreword to going to and that those days are long gone."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. I took my mother here for lunch and are waiter didn't take our order until 30min of us being there. I had to go ask someone if they could help us."}
{"text":"After working next door for a little over 2 yrs I became sort of a lunch connoisseur of this rustic eatery. I was always happy with the meals I got, but I did stick with what I knew for the most part. I mean let's face it there isn't THAT much opportunity to really get crazy and branch out here.

The salads in my opinion are great. Huge and if you get the lunch specials big portion for a great price. The portions of everything are massive so come hungry. The chicken pot pie is one of the best I've ever had. There is usually a good selection of soups including a yummy French Onion and Chicken Tortilla. 

Dessert is a new level of portion size depending on what you get. At least LOOK at the dessert case as you walk in, just to stare in awe. The berry pies are awesome and if you get it to go there are instructions on how to warm it up best at home. 

The service can vary from server to server. Sometimes they're at your beckoned call and other times it takes some flagging down to get attention. We almost always sat in the bar area so that could be part of the issue, it's a bit off the beaten path. 

Given they have changed their menu around a bit since they were bought out by Landry's but I didn't notice a major change in selection or quality. With Landry's as their parent company if you join their discount club you can earn reward points at a wide range of restaurants."}
{"text":"Crap..... waitress didn't listen to me..... over priced garbage.... slice of ham wouldn't cover a English muffin...."}
{"text":"Think New Jersey diner size menu, lots and lots of choices covering most major food groupings.  I had an LTO special called drunken chicken which had a pleasant creamy red sauce and was served over potato cakes.   Very generous in size and I enjoyed it.  We also tried the rib's which turned out to be very decent considering it is a chain restaurant with a broad menu.  Service was very good and the store had a good sized outdoor eating area.  Would certainly go again if in the area."}
{"text":"The word that best describes Claim Jumper is \"BIG\".  The restaurant is big with 20+ foot high ceilings, big booths and tons of seating.  The menus are big - there must be two or three hundred options.  The appetizer and main course portions are big - I felt as full as if just eaten Thanksgiving dinner.  The desserts are big enough for 2-6 people depending on which one you order.  Okay so they have quantity, what about quality.  Everything I tried tasted very good including the Ceasars salad, rotisserie chicken, fish and chips, and cheesecake. The dishes are simply but skillfully prepared - like great home cooking. I decided to go with three stars rather than four because I felt like I, as a customer, somehow got lost in all the bigness of the place. Despite good service I felt like I was along for the ride in this restaurant concept rather than in the drivers seat."}
{"text":"I heard nothing but good things about this place. My first time there will be my last sad to say. It started off with a 20 min wait just to get help. As I was waiting I noticed the hostess table was empty for 10 min, As I was there waiting a party of 8 showed up someone come from around the corner and sllhelped them and seated them. Again I still waiting to be helped and table empty again final someone comes to table looks ate and leaves. Will I can see my food I came to pick up slowly cooling off, another party of 2 shows and again they get helped and again another party of 2 all this when I am standing right in front. Finally a manger comes out ask if I been helped I don't say yes or no just ask for my food. When paying wait I placed a order for 2 not one. The hostess that was finally helping me apologized and offered to get another order going for me.  I did decline . sorry myself a head chef and owner wouldn't let someone wait 20 min to be asked if they have been helped and wouldn't have the hostess table empty"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night 7/27/15 and had many problems only saw our server once and had empty drinks for an hour and the food had been not only been rang in wrong but it came out VERY wrong and we had to send most of it back. But the reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because once we had called the manager over he told us he would now be taking care of us for the rest of the night and from there on out the service was great and we were pretty surprised when he offered us the whole $130 meal free. I'm not a high maintenance person and work at chilis so I know how it is. We ended up tipping very well but made sure our original survey didn't get anything. Anyways great service from the restaurant manager on handling the situation."}
{"text":"We went with a big group and the waitress was super nice and very helpful.  She did a fantastic job and the atmosphere was nice. I ordered the Citrus Salad which looked awesome, but tasted like cleaning spray (that's the only thing I can think to compare it to).  Not great.  Everyone else seemed to like their meal, but it seemed weird to me that they didn't specialize on anything but instead had a huge smorgasbord menu of all kinds of things.  Pretty expensive too."}
{"text":"As recently as 2011, we were eating at CJ almost every week.  The food was great, the ambiance was fun, and the value was outstanding.  

Fast forward to 2014.  Food looks the same, but the flavor has been \"blah\" over multiple visits.  Prices are up, value down.  And the Old West ambiance has been almost totally papered over in the name of political correctness.  In just a few years we have gone from loyalty club members to Not Comin' Back.

RIP, CJ."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant graduation luncheon for my daughter.  The service and food were outstanding! They helped make a very enjoyable and memorable experience."}
{"text":"Food quality was terrible, portion size for price was terrible. Sour pasta and tiny $10.00 salad! We have been going here for years and will not be returning. Left this place hungry and $70.00 in the toilet! My daughter even said my pasta was better than their attempt at cooking! My husbands half rack of ribs and coconut shrimp left a lot to be desired!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service,  kourtney the waitress is very friendly and she will Give you  the best service, I  recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"Very convenient spot for the business traveler.  Had an early dinner at the bar.  The chicken fried steak was fantastic, the bartender was attentive and quick on the refill.  Comfortable environment.  Never felt like I was being rushed.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for an office luncheon Wednesday, July 16. We all sat down and waited and waited. Our waitress came and took everyone's order for drinks and brought them to the table then left. We waited, waited and waited for some to take our order no one came. A person from our party had to go to the manager to let him know we were on a time schedule and we need to be waited on. Finally, our waitress came and took everyone's order and the food came out in a timely matter. I ordered the Fish Taco's grilled with rice pilaf. I've been craving fish tacos, I was so excited to them. Sadly, what I got was two large looking tacos and just three pieces of 1-inch squares of fish in each one the rest was cabbage and fries. All you could taste was cabbage. So disappointed. I tried to talk to the waitress and she said give me a minute and she never came back. I did not make a big deal about it because I was with a group of people."}
{"text":"Good place to watch the game and they have great happy hour. The TVs are a little oddly placed but other than that I like this place!"}
{"text":"So sad, CJ used to be so good.  I've been going to this one since it opened, and they have definitely gone down hill in the last year or so.  Our last visit (which could be our LAST) was horrible.  The menu was filthy with dried food on every page.  I was brought a bottled beer that was 6 months expired.  The spinach dip lacked taste and the chips were cold.  Cookie on the dessert was hard and cold.  Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Second time in and wasn't great! For the prices being so high you should receive exceptional service with no mistakes. My girlfriend ordered a second beer didn't get it and I didn't get my salad I ordered. Not a great place to dine for me."}
{"text":"All I can say is avoid this location, not even worth my time to say how bad a experience this place was!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday to have a relaxing late lunch. Our waitress was \"Ash\" who is new there. She was a very good waitress and answered all our questions. I got a wrap and questioned that fact that it said \"cheese\" and nothing more specific about what type. Ash made sure that I did not have \"bleu cheese\" on my wrap which I informed her that I would not like. She was funny, nice and took great care of us."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful... party of 4, waiter brought salads for everyone, but didn't bring mine.. said it was because mine was my entree.. so I got to watch everyone eat, while I had nothong.. at this point we have been here for an hour.. and still no \"entree\" side note.... worse bloody Mary I've ever had."}
{"text":"I just want to say what a wonderful experience we just had at Claim Jumper. As US Navy veterans we decided to take them up on their special veterans day meal and it was excellent.  We both had blackened Atlantic salmon, which was yummy.  Their CJ Red Ale was a tasty accompaniment.  We just had to pay for the beer and thanks to anonymous donor,  our beers were also complimentary. Thank you so much Claim Jumper for doing this.  It really made our day. And our waitress Desiree was the best. Considering that it was just her and one other waitress,  and it was packed with Vets, she had a great attitude."}
{"text":"Wow this place has really seemed to go downhill the last couple times we visited over a period of about a year. They are Officially on our black list now. They can not for the life of them cook a MEDIUM Steak LOL it either comes out Black and Blue \"Extra Rare\" Rare Or Well Done.. Sad really.. Then when you ask them to refire it to medium it comes out very well done LOL Well now me and the wife are now Very Well Done with this place.."}
{"text":"I had heard about Claim Jumper before but never really knew anything about it. I always assumed that it was some kind of crappy buffet place, but today I was proven dead wrong! In short, this restaurant is damned fine Western cuisine. The service was top notch. Every employee we dealt with was friendly, and not a single person we interacted with seemed anything less than happy to be there. We were helped promptly, served our food and drinks in the correct order and with perfect timing. The food was outstanding! Beautifully crafted and delicious. I have not even the slightest complaint. Very reasonably priced and filling portions. Definitely worth the experience. Will be happy to go back again!
Thank you Claim Jumper staff for making my day :)"}
{"text":"Food was great & staff was awesome.  My Mom didn't care for the tortilla soup & sent it back but enjoyed her steak."}
{"text":"Have been here the last two nights as I am here from out of town. Last night John was my bartender and he was awesome. Tonight it was Johnny, equally awesome. Very friendly and food was great. I highly recommend the widow maker burger."}
{"text":"Service was ok, the guy was slow even thou it was 3pm on a Monday.  App came out ( artichoke dip) was a little over room temp, not enough chips left a 1/4 of a bowl. Have chicken steak dinner, was very bland , mash patatos was very bland, gravy very bland and watery, the chicken fried steak was good but the breading was not sticking to the meat, so when u thought u were taking a bite of meat but it's just breading. Only reason I gave it two stars is because the table and the dishes was clean."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular Claim Jumper once every month or so for the past 7 years. The quality of service and food have gone down steadily during those years.

Visited last night (perhaps for the last time).  Arrived and the restaurant wasn't busy. Elderly couple was ahead of my family. They got seated immediately.  Hostess made us wait for a few minutes.  That's fine. Maybe they sent home wait staff early so they had to seat in one area. When we get seated, the elderly couple ahead of us was seated across from our booth. They had drinks and had ordered already.  By the time wait staff noticed us, the couple already started on their meals AND got refills. We were still without beverages and had one set of utensils.

Once the waitress got to us, drinks and food were delivered in a timely manner.

We ordered a cheeseburger, kids pasta, kids sliders, and a chicken fried steak. The food was satisfactory except for the steak. Mind you,  there is no half portion option for this dish anymore. Vegetables aren't included either. So I get this monochromatic mound of food on my plate with white gravy smothered all over. The steak covers the whole half of the plate, but as I cut into it, I discover the chicken fried part - the batter - was nearly 3/4 of the steak. The meat was probably hammered down to a 1/4 inch slab. After is I got down with the meat, my plate was still full but mostly of batter.

I get it. Got to make your cuts somewhere if the restaurant isn't performing. It is, egregious,  to charge me $15 for batter, though. So I left this place feeling swindled and neglected."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant chain, the food is consistently amazing and the service is very good, once you get seated.  One thing to keep in mind with regards to eating here, there is always a line up and you will have to patience to get a good seat.

That said, the menu is very large so everyone should find something they like and they do mind making changes to the orders to account for any particular needs.  The only other thing that you should know is come hungry because the portions are generally very large."}
{"text":"First time in Arizona and certainly won't be my last time at Claim Jumper! For starters I went with the fried zucchini which was breaded and sprinkled with Parmesan. I also got the Widow Maker Burger which was packed with bacon thick cut cheddar avocado red relish and ONION RINGS! Everything was delicious and our server John R was customer friendly and food savvy which was a plus! Great food with an awesome atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Always a good experience here. Servers are very friendly and the food is typically great. Last time I had a bad dish the manager offered to take it off of the bill immediately and provide me with something else. It's nice when a manager offers to make the situation right instead of putting you in the awkward position of having to ask. Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Overpriced Junk food. I had some ribs chicken and beef. All over cooked. Plus a appetizer platter that was $18 for cheap fried food. No bread and just mediocre service. Bill was $70 and we split a plate. Me and my boyfriend honestly I felt ripped off. I would not suggest eating here, Lower the prices or increase the Quality."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout from grub hub. The beef ribs dinner was 1 rib. It was like a terrible roast attached to a bone. Completely inedible. I could barely cut it with a knife. I sawed a piece off for the picture. Husband tossed his pot pie in the trash after realizing the hard bits were not uncooked carrots, it was the chicken. Completely disgusting meal, inedible meal."}
{"text":"Use to be my favorite place to eat. They have changed to menu!!! No more jumbalaya!!! I went their for my bday last week and had to walk out after the staff had told me they have gotten new owners. Told all my girlfriends and they are so sad,it was our girls night out spot too. Guess they wont mind loosing a few twenty people. But seriously they need to bring it back!!!"}
{"text":"It is true, unfortunately due to the awkward location this Claim Jumper was unable to keep its doors open.   Many of your favorite servers have been thankfully relocated to other locations.

Please support the next closest location of Claim Jumper in the Deer Valley 30 complex off of the 101 & I-17."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today.  Host greeted us right away and seated us immediately.  Then it all went downhill from there.  The host said that Dana would be taking care of us.  Well, after 15 minutes of waiting for a server we never saw one.  Mind you that the restaurant was virtually empty.  Now I know why.  After about 10 minutes the host that sat us walked right by our table and never  paid any attention to us.  Then as we were leaving the same host saw us and let us walk out, without even an apology or questioning why we were leaving right after arriving.  Their staff seems very clueless.  No customer awareness at all.  We will never be back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! My family and I were looking for some place different and close to our hotel so we decided to eat at Claim Jumper. Our server Warren was excellent and helped make our first visit here a really great experience. As for the food, we all enjoyed our meal. From the cheddar bread to our individual plates (grilled shrimp with clam chowder, top sirloin, classic cheeseburger and black tie pasta) everything was excellent. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a family meal at decent price. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"10 of us, who go out to dinner every Friday night, decided to try this restaurant's location.
We were informed upon sitting and starting to order cocktails \"Happy Hour\" specials only occurred if one were to sit at the bar.  I suggested possibly the waiter could question the manager to possibly extend the policy to 10 people who just arrived and were going to order dinner - the manager approved some special pricing which we have yet to determine.  
Dinners arrived  a little more then 1 hour after ordering.  The restaurant was not full and no one was waiting for a table when we arrived or left.  One asked if there would be some bread - as he is a diabetic and needed some food - we were told it came from a \"different window\", but the waiter would see we got some.  After several suggestions before and during the meal - it never arrived.  Refills on iced tea and water were rare at best - my iced tea, after requests, was filled at the end of the meal.  Then the waiter, after questioning us several times as to whether we were happy and all was well, came to the table, obviously at managements insistence, and gave us nothing more then a spiel on joining some sort of club for $25, for which we would after buying meals get a free one or some sort.  
I, very nicely, informed the waiter I would assume the over 1 hour wait for meals was not his fault and that management had a lot of nerve to now request possibly joining a \"club\".  Very nicely I informed him I could only speak for myself, but I would never return and would write this review.  The food was OK -nothing special, but the service was just not there.
The management, or lack thereof is in trouble if this service and attitude were to continue."}
{"text":"5 of us went to celebrate my daughters birthday. 4 of us were content with our food, but my Son In Law was very unhappy. He had every reason to feel as he did. He ordered Fish and Chips. The fish was almost all breading and had hardly any fish. The chips were small and exceedingly dry. The entire plate was not edible. Also my drink, a raspberry martini,  had very little, if any, alcohol in it. At least I could not taste it."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Went there for happy hour and tried to charge me 50 dollars for a 35 dollar bill.  When i noticed it the bartender didnt evem look at the bill.  He took the bill to the manager and brought  it back wrong again. Second time it went back, didnt even ask me anything and brought it back correct.  They really thought i was a sucker that was just gonna pay for anything.  Thats rude and inconsiderate.  Wont b going back there.  No wonder theyre goin out of business."}
{"text":"This one particular location is huge. The environment is warm and friendly. I've been here multiple times and it makes me homesick for california. Their tri-top and bbq shrimp is my usual... pretty good if you want steak. Their tortilla soup is a huge huge miss. Would come here again, Claim Jumper will always be a regular place to have a cozy sitdown with family."}
{"text":"Jeffrey was our Waiter and gave us the most remarkable service that I have experienced in many many years. Not only was he very attentive but he also went over and beyond when we requested to have three pot pies made early in the morning to take to our 89 year old Dad that loves them.  Instead of blowing us off and saying they're not available until 11 o'clock the next day he went out of his way and involved management that stepped up and saw it through. We picked up three fresh pot pies in the morning.  Our  Dad absolutely loved it and was also impressed by the level of service given to us by Jeffrey and the Management at Claim Jumper's Golden Nugget. Kudos and many thanks!!

{"text":"This was one of our best restuarant experinces. the food was delivered in a timly manner for being busy. Our waiter Christian was very personable and attentive.  My husband ordered steak and egg breakfast and the steak was cooked perfect along witht the eggs and hashbrowns also got french toast done golden brown and moist, my daughter  had pancakes and bacon done wonderful., and my denver omlett was amazing. then the manager  Justin came by to check on how wer were doing. I deffinatly will come here when we comr back. !!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this only has three stars. I moved here a couple of years ago and have been coming to Claim Jumper more and more. I receive the best service from James and Jens!!!! They are awesome!!!! Love them!!! The food, the friendly servers and the fun makes for a killer package!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our restaurants of choice. Went here this past weekend. Wow! This place has gone down hill.  Salads were always fresh and tasty.  Now they are soggy and use mandarins from a can.  Just not the same fresh ingredients anymore. Yikes!  Pizza was tiny. They used to have a nice size pizza to go with the salad now it is a small mini pizza that a 10 year old wouldn't be satisfied with.  Not going back, to many good places to eat at with my money."}
{"text":"Big hit!  We were welcomed at 5:45pm and were offered a great booth.  The welcome was as warm as the weather - warm and breezy.  The extensive menu was a small challenge, after asking the waitress about smaller servings we settled on one order of a small rack of baby pork ribs and one order of shrimp and tilapia.  Drinks arrived as did ice water with lemon.  We watched huge servings drift by as we waited.  Our order was prompt and looked great.  Both meals were delicious.  Great presentation followed by great taste.  The atmosphere was lively without being too noisy.  The tried the share one order of carrot cake but we were too full to complete it.  The bill was fine for popular-level restaurant with no alcohol.  All in all, a satisfying experience and recommended."}
{"text":"Disappointed !!! Our food took forever to come due to the restaurant being under staffed and mediocre food.  The waitress was very nice and took of the main dish of the bill. The shrimp on the past was soggy and the past very acidic . Sad since we were celebrating my husband birthday ."}
{"text":"Yes - the best chicken pot pie in America.  There is no question that when you are hungry for feel good food, this is thebest place to go.  The portions are giant and the food is heavy (in a good way).  If you are on a diet, don't even look in the direction of this place...

The bar is huge and the Staff is nice.  I would absolutely recommend this location in particular - its really nice and no matter what you order (the chicken pot pie being the best - and also the potato pancakes are fairly awesome), you will leave happy and FULL!!

Go here, its tasty!!"}
{"text":"Went here with the family right after they opened.  They sat us right away.  I got the widow maker burger it was pretty tasty for a chain style burger.  The portions were huge!  Wait staff was just ok, caught her yawning a couple times we had to order the kids drink twice.  Other than that we were pretty happy"}
{"text":"For a upper-class dennys style restaurant like all at claim Jumper is on point their portions are usually pretty good. I enjoy their salads in the desert is usually always really well if you have that service is always pretty good I've only had one negative experience with a salad that I could see the plate at the bottom of it LOL. But for a good go to an expensive nice restaurant I pick claim Jumper if I'm in the area keep it up thank you for the great work"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.....its just an over priced yuck....   my 10yr old ordered a pizza and apple slices with caramel... had to ask first for the apples then the caramel dip.... my teen also ordered a pizza the 3 cheese. adding a cup of soup. both pizzas same size same toppings...kids pizza 7.99 ....adult pizza 11.99 plus the 2.99 for  the soup which they tried to charge me 5.99. I had the chicken fried steak....which came out covering the whole plate...it was mostly breading that was too hard to eat. and the country gravy was very watery and had no flavor....  hubby ate his seafood jamb la said it was ok... over $70  for a meal that sucked....and server hardly checked on us to see if we needed more drinks or anything...
we will not be going back"}
{"text":"Went here about a week ago with my family (party of 6).  We always have difficulty finding a place, as everyone usually wants something different.  The menu here has many options.  The service was timely and our waiter was readily available, but not annoying.  The food was very good, and very large portions are offered.  The ambiance is that of any typical neighborhood restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The carrot cake is wonderful, as well as the pretzel appetizer.  I will return here again, as it is very family friendly, and the menu can please everyone.  The manager came to my table, and stated that he had to comment on how well behaved my children were.  He thanked us.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"Nice quality and delicious food, they are not stingy with their portions for the price. Ambience is nice and intimate even for a busy night. We had 3 children with us that all ordered Hi-C orange and they only charged us for one, and the refills kept on coming. Overall we had a wonderful experience and we will always come back :)"}
{"text":"Ordering off the happy hour menus on a Saturday morning was fun! 
I suppose the disappearance of every morsel of the widow maker from my partners plate speaks volumes! Yes it's a delicious burger!  Fish tacos were yummy as was the Caesar Salad.  Last time we nibbled on a ' Slice' of chocolate cake! Rich, sweet , moist, and HUGE! Needless to say it took us three days to finish it at home!!  Service was good food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, this time went to the bar area, if u wanna watch a game, not a good place to watch, tv's can't be seen from certain areas. Waited and waited and no one came to our table or greeted us, so we left."}
{"text":"I can never go wrong with a great taste or a great meal, I appreciate friendly staff and wonderful management everyone was well respectful always asked questions to make sure my seating was fit and we'll enough especially with a stroller with a baby with me. Before I could sit dow. Hostess always knew the question before I asked and moved the chair for my stroller, waiter was courtesy and respectful and I couldn't be happier.
Black chicken pasta was always best prepared greatly and I never ever complained it was always made perfect and I have had the same meal for 3 years 
Very great texture on the pasta and great sauce has a great spice to it, my favorite  again"}
{"text":"Was sat and waited for 15-20 minutes with no sign of a server in my section whatsoever.  Told hostess on the way out the reason for leaving and the only response was \"bye\".  Stay at the golden nugget frequently and will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"This place used to be good, if i could i would give no star. My husband and i ate there,very disappointed the sliders and fries my husband had were cold and greasy .the only thing good was the sauce to dip his fries in . My chicken fried chicken was 97% breading  and the meat didn't have any taste/flavor .the service was very frustrating  took like an hour and a half to get our food out to us,there was like 3 other tables in the restaurant and  we  were the first ones to sit down and order they avoided our table,we were the last table to get our food ,the server came back every 3 minutes asking what we were going to order then after we ordered something to eat ,she disappeared for like 30minutes  o.o  ,and it was cold and we  did not feel welcome ! .we talked to the manager all he did was take 15.00 off our order. :( if u plan on going to this place don't! ,your better off going to burger king ,i mean seriously  this place is a joke!!!
Wish Gordon Ramsey could fix this mess!!"}
{"text":"Zero STARS really but you yelpers know to give a review you have to give them at least one star 
    AGAIN............0000000 Stars
This was my Birthday dinner choice I used to eat here all the time but closed my nearest location with that being said I will never return to this location again
The service was REALLY REALLY  bad so bad that one of my guests remarked to the waitress that she had her hands full and needed some help 45 minute wait just for the bread !
Secondly I ordered the Meat loaf and after about 10 minutes INTO ordering this guy (Manager) comes to the table with a oh well  figure it out attitude to tell me they were out of meat loaf !!!!!!!!
I ordered the fried steak what a horrible decision it was advertised as angus beef but it tastes and looked like a Swanson frozen dinner entree 
Over all this was a horrible experience 
This Claim Jumpers the way I have experienced them in the past does not  meet standards, quality or Management skills I have experienced in the past 
You almost get a sense that they know it's bad but who cares I really believe this Tempe location is getting ready to close just by the quality and atmosphere I experienced 
I'm going to REDO my Birthday dinner tonight and forget I ever went CLAIM JUMPERS IN TEMPE AZ now that I've Yelped about.... Lol"}
{"text":"Went here for a Friday night dinner with my wife.  Since the restaurants at the shopping centers further north on I-17 were jam packed, we thought we had lucked out when we found nobody waiting at Claim Jumper.

We were seated in a dark booth.  I mean DARK.  Too dark to even read a menu.  When i wiggled the light bulb in the fixture in an attempt to shed some light on the table, I was greeted with a big \"POP\" and sparks... followed immediately by about 4 servers running to our table asking, \"Did you touch that?\"  I replied yes, and they said, \"Well don't do that.  You just knocked out all the lights in the whole row.\"  Sounds safe to me!  Seriously, if you need the number of an electrician, I can get one for you.

So we resigned ourselves to dining in the dark.  In retrospect, it may have been a blessing in disguise given the absolute mediocre quality of the food.  To be completely fair, the tri-tip steak was actually pretty good.  However, the fried shrimp were more or less exactly what you'd expect to get at other \"fine dining\" establishments like Sizzler or Red Lobster.  Mashed potatoes and vegetables were forgettable, too.  As a capper, they brought out my cold, burnt, lifeless cheese bread about 10 minutes after the rest of the meal arrived.

Our server... let's just call him \"Dundee\".  He passed by our table literally a hundred times during the course of the meal, but actually stopped exactly 4 times:  Once to take our order (somebody else took the drink order), once about 45 minutes later to apologize for the delay, once after being flagged down by my wife to re-up our long-empty drinks, and once to drop the check.  The service was so amazingly bad, I wanted to leave ZERO on the tip line (something I have never done in my life).  My wife took pity on young Dundee, and said that she thought it was probably \"his first day\".  So there ya go, Mate!  I don't know how long you've been in this line of work, but your service was so bad, my wife thought that it was probably your first day on the job.  That's the only reason you were tipped.

1 star for non-existent service, 3 stars for mediocre, overpriced food."}
{"text":"Great restourant. 
Plenty of food and nice staff. 
I like when people are considerate and profeccional."}
{"text":"Meh! Definitely chain dining. I am always disappointed and I've tried several options. Everything tastes as if it were frozen and salt seems to be the main ingredient to most dishes."}
{"text":"We drove in from San Diego to watch some spring training and ate at Claim Jumper, primarily due to its proximity to our hotel. The food was great and the portions were huge. Our 8 year old wasn't feeling well from the trip and in our haste to get him back to the hotel we left our iPad at the table. I went back a few hours later, after we realized it was missing, expecting to be told they didn't have it. Instead the manager came out and told me they had it in the office. Highly recommend Claim Jumper for the food, customer service and integrity of the staff!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few days ago for dinner. Had a Dos Equis lager ($6.50) and ordered an Atlantic salmon entree blackened, served with veggies and rice pilaf. ($22.99). Also ordered a side salad. Then, in a case of my eyes were bigger than my stomach, I ordered the Chocolate Mother-load Cake ($11.99) that has six layers of cake and is said to be a \"top 5 most decadent desert\". The menu says it is great for sharing and I would agree that probably six people could share it and still have left overs! The food was good and so was the service. I'd return if I was in \"Lost Wages\" again!"}
{"text":"Service much better than taste.  Everything just tasted like salt.  No concept of flavor. If it weren't for the good service, this place would be just like Norms or Carrows."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times at this town square location.  Not too bad.  Staff here are really nice.  I don't really have a favorite dish here as I don't eat here that often.  All american food.  I've tried their meatloaf & fried country steak.  The chicken quesadilla for an appetizer is awesome though. My friend & I had dinner here while she was in town & she ordered this as an appetizer.  Boy! that thing fills you up! It's sooo good.  It's a good thing we shared the country fried steak after having those quesadillas!  =) The biscuit we had together with the country fried steak, I didn't really like.  It was pretty heavy & thick.  My friend liked it though.  I usually love biscuits but this was just a little difficult to eat.  The mash potatoes was alright.  Nuttin' special.  The one thing I do remember though during another visit here, was there was a list of calories for their dishes in this restaurant for those calorie counters.  Servers are super nice & the place is clean.  I've never had any issues.  Only reason for the 3-star is that I haven't eaten anything here that was worth going back constantly. Maybe the quesadillas?? hehe =) This restaurant is convenient while you're at town square shopping & wanna get something to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Meat loaf is best anywhere.  Blackened chicken pasta was perfect.  Portions huge.  Enough to split or take home for tomorrow's lunch.  Fun decor, good service."}
{"text":"Went to use Landry's birthday reward. Our server was nice, but the food was not so great! We ordered from their lunch menu."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is awesome but on our visit on 1/15/16 him the waiter was terrible didn't get refills when we needed them . He threw plates down on the table. He only visited the table about 4-6 times to check up on us . We had a total of 8 guests and sat under the antler chandelier . Like I said the food was amazing but the service sucked ."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. Each time we had a different server,and each time they were good. Every time we came for Lunch we try to get there around 11:30am,  because, by 12 noon the joint is Jumping!
The Clam Chowder is good, not great . Salad ,just OK. The food is good,but my friend likes to go there all the time. I think It is a place you could visit once and awhile and be good with it.
I have never had Desert here. But, they display them in the Showcase and they look amazing. 
I should of taken a photo,but I did not. They have the largest slice of cake I have ever seen. From one of the Tallest cakes I have ever seen.
It is decorated very Rustic, as if you are in a hunting lodge. It is very clean and parking is all around the building. So there is a lot.
it is worth a visit. They are very friendly. The greeters in the front are very happy to see you.
 I like it."}
{"text":"Friday night was my first visit to this location and I won't be back. The host was very friendly and seated us right away but our good experience ended there. 

I was in a group of 10 people. The waiter came to take our drink order and left without getting 2 people's order. When he delivered our drinks, he didn't realize his mistake and didn't get them drinks until he came back for our food order. Then he refilled our glasses with the wrong beverages. The restaurant was pretty empty so I expected the service to be a bit more attentive.

I ordered the club sandwich and a salad. My salad was wilted, over-dressed, and the vegetables tasted like they had been out at room temperature for most of the day. My sandwich was equally disappointing. I honestly ordered it because the picture in the menu made it look so appetizing with fresh lettuce and tomato layered thick with the meat and cheeses. The skimpy lettuce and tomato were wilted. The avocado I paid to add was tough and flavorless. The bacon on the sandwich looked to be a pre cooked product that they didn't even bother to reheat before putting on my sandwich.

After talking to a couple of people, I found out this is not unusual for this location. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been going to CB a lot of  times in CA.. I was like a CB here in AZ !!! I I've been going like 3 times the food is not the same , the service is not the same and the atmosphere really reaks . Where is managment are they really interested for the costumers.. I guess this CB really needs some work. 

The Salad water in it, I had to drain it, Full rack Beef Ribs burnt, the drinks got to beg for more. So where is the service , not even \" Is everything ok, any more Drinks ?\" oh but here they come with the Bill and tell them that you did not eat what you did not like, nope can't take that off the bill. Sorry Claim Jumpers, I'm Jumping off, not coming back ."}
{"text":"The breakfasts here are awesome. You can pretty much get whatever you want. The even have smoked salmon with a bagel! The bacon and French toast is delicious. I took the advice of our server Tami, she was phenomenal. I will definitely eat here when I'm staying at the Golden Nugget or visiting downtown :)"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food quality is not. If you want to order sandwiches is ok but entrees are over priced and not good."}
{"text":"We visited Claim Jumper for my Father-in-law's birthday this past weekend and were disappointed with the service. It took almost 40 minutes after we ordered to receive our meals (which were salads) and each time we wanted something additional it took a couple of reminders for the waitress to bring it out. Overall the food is okay, but an hour and a half lunch is too long for my liking."}
{"text":"Mitchell was our waiter. He was pre-warned by our daughter how difficult the family could be with ordering. It was cute every time one us would order he looked at her and said \"I already knew that\". LOL
He was very attentive to our grandson and brought out a plate of cheese and apples for him to snack on while the food was being prepared. 
He also had a heads up about two of the guests having birthdays. He tried hard to get someone to order dessert but we were all to full so he went an extra step and brought out two small to go boxes with a candle lite and sticking out for both ladies. We all sang Happy Birthday. Mitchell was on top of his game and we enjoyed our food and fellowship."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location about 5 years ago and then the food quality seemed to take a dive.  Recently, I decided to try it again as Landry's took it over, and it is much better again.  They have a great bar where you can belly up, eat great food and enjoy a brew while watching a game.  Good location.  I recently tried the tri-tip and the chicken pot pie and both were excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was pretty lacking. Took forever to get refills and had to ask a different server for items we asked our waitress for. The Italian lemon cake taste very similar to macaroni grills but isn't as moist."}
{"text":"I have certain go tos on the menu like the Cobb Salad which I love. It's chain food but I love what I normally order and the location is convenient. We have even ordered delivery before and the food came fast and fresh."}
{"text":"The men's restroom urinals looks like they have not been cleaned in months. It makes you wonder how clean the rest of the restaurant is."}
{"text":"Never had anything but perfect service here! I'm from Southern California and when my boyfriend comes out to visit this is our go to place for a few reason, one being that the staff is always super nice, two it's super clean, and three the fish tastes way better than back home in Long Beach."}
{"text":"Went for the brunch, not a good idea. They didn't refill the food. Had to ask for everything we wanted."}
{"text":"I have to take my students there on a weekly basis (their not the same students every week, my classes only last 1 to 2 weeks) and they are always super happy, saying that the Europeans amoung them complain about the size of portions and the Yanks complain about the lack of choice...so i guess the old addage is true you can please some of the people some of the time..yadadada! Anyhoo, generally the food is good, and the service is ok. We book tables for anywhere between 10 and 20 people and generally they cope well with bringing all the food out at the same time; but don't let that fool you, it has taken 30 mins before hand to get our drinks refilled....so i guess it really does matter who your wait staff are.

The food is good although it can be slightly greasy with no flavour, i also recommend the Jamaican sweet potatoe (it comes with jerk chicken and clover honey...yummy!) and a good pudding is the green tea creme brule (it tastes better than it sounds!) it's a tiny pudding, about 6 mouthfuls but it's totally snacky!"}
{"text":"We went to Claim Jumpers in Avondale and had terrible service.  We had to wait over 30 minutes for our meal and also had to ask for our check because the waiter seemed to disappear for long stretches at a time. We also had to get up and find a manager twice to ask what the problem was. The manager never approached our table and no one ever apologized for the poor service. Our experience took over two hours and the restaurant was not very busy.
Not going back and I don't recommend this place either!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas I go to Fremont Street and then the Golden Nugget! I love eating at the Claim Jumper there because their food is reasonably priced and delicious!! Good portions also. We were there a few nights ago and it was awesome once again. I had the barbecue chicken sandwich and the tomato herb bread is delicious on it! Their shoestring fries are also very good. Tami  was our server and she was excellent. We did not have to ask for anything such as refills or condiments- she offered before we had to ask for anything! I definitely enjoy visiting this location when I am in town."}
{"text":"I hadn't even heard about Claim Jumper before visiting for the first time recently. I really liked the inside look of the restaurant, but didn't find the food to be all that memorable or delicious. Maybe it was because I personally ordered the burger, but we also had an appetizer and I ate enough off of my wife's plate as well and she got steak. It was all not bad, but there was nothing that really entices me to want to come back for awhile. I'm sure I will return someday, but it is not a place I plan on visiting on a regular basis."}
{"text":"We thought we'd try again, five year after our first experience. It will be another five before we return. Nuf said?"}
{"text":"I love Fernando & a young blond bartender who always have a smile on their face.  Mitchel was awesome.  Sandra was the worst.  Hope she doesn't do anything to our food & I hate to say that.  She answers you w/ a what?

The best happy hour in Town Square!  Calamari is usually really good, but today it smelled fishy & was limp.  It's usually fried as sliced calamari steak & is firm.  You really can't go wrong w/ the delicious fried pickles!  Mmmm!  

One day they messed up some orders & gave us all this free food!  Why does that always happen when you're on a diet lol!  No complaints & everyday before this they would have 5 stars!

Besides the Calamari not being great, the service was the absolute worst.  We like sitting at the bar especially cause service is great.  Mitchell gets 5 stars & usually Fernando is there too who is always attentive & personable."}
{"text":"Food was decent . It's a chain, you know what to expect . The worst service I have ever had at any claim jumper"}
{"text":"We have been here in the past. So we wanted something tasty for New Years, so we both tried something new. I had the sweet potato and chicken, very tasty. The presentation was a 10 taste 7 would of been a ten but the chicken was a tad dry had good flavor. The wife had a BBQ hamburger, it was favorable and juicy with steamed broccoli. For the sweeter side we had the I-declare wow it was huge and she feels 10 pounds heavier, \"NO she did not eat it all\" I had the cookie with ice cream also very large and didn't eat it all. Service was a bit slow being the place was not super busy.

Overall I will come back there are a lot of items to pick from on the menu."}
{"text":"Came to eat here about 130am and I must say I was surprised to see many ppl here eating. Edgar I believe was our servers name, he was very professional and nice. Always made sure our drinks where full and checked in on us throughout our dining experience making sure everything was fine. I had the Clubhouse Sand which  which was really big and tasty. The fries where a little bland and kinda meh... But the sandwich itself was great and would order it again. My gf had the cheeseburger and she loved it, she basically ate the whole thing and had dessert after too.. She ordered the chocolate cake which was huge!!!! ate only two pieces kinda felt bad for leaving so much leftover, hope the guys in the back was able to eat it lol... Other then that would definitely recommend eating at this Claim Jumpers in the Golden Nugget...."}
{"text":"This was extremely disappointing. Went last night with a family member to grab dinner and to share a couple items from the menu. For an appetizer we ordered the potato cakes, which I really enjoyed and they are now about 8 in an order instead of 3 (they used to be served as 3 potato pancakes). The slaw that came with the potato cakes was refreshing but lacked flavor. We also ordered the clam chowder and a side house salad. The clam chowder looked like it had been sitting for a while and straight out of a can! I returned the house salad because it looked like wilted iceberg lettuce drenched in ranch ( I had ordered the dressing on the side). We ordered the tri tip and grilled shrimp, at about 25.00 for the entr√©e I was expecting an amazing meal. The shrimp were insignificant and the tri-tip extremely salty. We ordered the ice cream and cookie dessert but it still fell short. The atmosphere is nice and the place is elegant and clean. Our server Jordan was great, he was very attentive and always stopped to check on our meal and drinks. Although service was very good, I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"What's with the current trend of restaurants having a 15m wait when the restaurant is literally half full? Looking at you Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"They had a sign as we walked in stating Happy Hour on food & drinks in the bar area. We ask for the hh menu and was told by the waitress that they just stopped that yesterday. Told her about the sign, she said that it wasn't any good. Asked to speak to the Manager, (never came). When she ask what we would like to order we told her we would like to order from the HH menu, she said, \"I turned the sign around so it's no good\". We got up, to walk out, told the Manager, he then said he wanted to make it right with us.
Sorry, a little to late, should have come over when we asked."}
{"text":"Claim Jumpers Veteran Appreciatation Dinner this evening & even though CJ may have lost a bit of its luster from the early 2000s, the food was still delicious & the wait staff were working hard. Some customer sevice polishing could go a long way in trying to work towards standing out in an overcrowded restaurant area with PF Chang, Mimi's Cafe, Cheesecake Factory, etc... We ordered the Tri-tip w/ Grilled Shrimp (delicious especially with the peppercorn sauce although it could use a bit more sauce), Chinese Chicken Salad (dressed perfectly & portion size was huge), and the Chocolate Calzone (a chocolate lovers dream & only offered in certain locations)."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend and his father to get a nice meal for his father's birthday and it was completely ridiculous. It took forever to get anything, our poor waiter was overworked and we asked for bread and it came out at the end of dinner. My boyfriend asked for steak sauce three times. His steak was rare instead of medium and they did not include the mushroom and onions he asked for. It took 25 minutes for a manager to come speak to us and our waiter constantly told us he was getting us dessert and yet nothing. For the prices, this was absolutely ridiculous. On top of it, the food was nothing special. Definitely should not go."}
{"text":"Long wait for a table even though they had a lot of empty tables tells me that they were understaffed.   Food was wonderful.  Server checked on us once and that was all.   Gave a 4 because it was an \"as expected\" visit.  Nothing to make it remarkable."}
{"text":"Extra point for a very good gluten free menu and servers knowing what gf means. I could have given a 5-star rating if the dessert selection included some gf options. They take dessert seriously since their case at the entrance features a 6-7 layer chocolate cake and other delicacies. A nice gluten free chocolate cake would be a great addition! The black tie chicken pasta is very nice with the gluten free pasta."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic lunch today. I enjoyed the pork ribs and rotisserie chicken. The blueberry muffin was delicious. Our waitress really took care of us. She took empty plates promptly, and always kept our drinks full. 
My only complaint is that the men's restrooms needed to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Came in for my first time and thought I would give happy hour a shot. Terrible idea!! 2 bartenders at 4:30pm, 4 guests at the bar and a 5 min greet time. No bueno. Ordered drinks and some skins, what a joke of a potato skin. 2 tiny halves that were fried harder than a potato chip!! I won't be returning. And I'm a regular to townsquare."}
{"text":"I may have just come on a bad night but the level of customer service I received was horrible. They are lucky I was not a secret shopper."}
{"text":"It's Claim Jumper.....they have a huge menu with ton's of different types of foods to choose from. A little pricey but the serving sizes are worth the cost. Esp. their desserts! They have a cool Happy Hour menu in their bar area and/or patio. I'm kinda bummed they got rid of their lobster tails. Never had any issues with customer service here. There is more the one location in town. I've been to all 3 so far. Definitely a place worth checking out!"}

{"text":"I agree that once Claim Jumper changed hands, it will never be even close to what it was.  Aside from the disappointment factor, the food is OK.   It is convenient to eat here if you are staying at the Golden Nugget, but other than that is is just somewhere around average in quality and expensive for what you get.  The service is better than the food.  The portions are OK, but not at all what they used to be.  Dinner flavor was better than breakfast.  If I had had breakfast first, that would have been the last visit to Claim Jumper.  The Motherlode cake is pretty much the same, but the portions of other desserts were smaller (and no Ideclair).   The omelets are definitely not omelets ... they are overcooked eggs made like a pancake then folded and stuffed with toppings that aren't that great (like undercooked cold broccoli).  Because the toppings aren't cooked with the eggs, they fall out.  You find yourself chewing doggedly on your omelet-like egg pancake, not because you want to but because you paid $15 for it and are hungry.  The Claim Jumper decor of days past is now limited to a few pickaxe's and pans on the wall.  If you have many fond memories from Claim Jumper, don't expect to revisit them.  Just make new memories somewhere else."}
{"text":"I forgot this place was here.  What a great dinner and service we had. We will be back often for this fantastic clam chowder!"}
{"text":"Just left a very disappointing visit at Claim Jumper. Ordered Classic Hamburger and it was the size of a  hamburger in a Kid's Happy Meal. Fries were lacking and not hot. Our other order was a BBQ chicken sandwich  which was  mediocre at best. 50.00 for 2 sandwiches and 2 house Bloody Mary's. Not the quality I have had and expect from Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"Claim Jumpers has consistant good service. The food is on par for what it is. I reccomend hanging in the lounge Sundays during football season as they have the bestest deals on some their tastiest while calorie laden appetizers, burgers & of course Claim Jumper beers.
That is all for now."}
{"text":"Five stars to Chassir, our wonderful bartender!  Roe had to leave for a family emergency & was also great.  Chassir was right on top of business w/ service, drinks & food.. awesome!  

Wish the food was as exceptional cause I would give five stars for both, but rarely the case.  Our mini cheese HH pizza was dripping w/ a pool of grease & I can assure you that even for the $5 HH price, I would not eat it for free.  Hours later we still regretted even eating one slice.  Thankfully we didn't try the mini pepperoni cause I can't imagine the grease on it.    

The only worthwhile item on the HH, as I've found out the hard way is the Wedge.  Very fresh & crisp Lettuce & I love balsamic & blue cheese mixed.  The bacon on it & red onion were in perfect portions & I asked for no tomato.  

Excellent portion so just take off the Spinach & Artichoke, mini pizzas & add the calamari or something.  I am totally satisfied w/ five stars for the HH Wedge, but it's like hit or miss w/ the other items on HH.  I even got a free item for our bday month in June & was still left disappointed in their food.  You end up spending more on HH to get satisfied or have to complain.  I have eaten off of the regular menu & the best item is the calamari & dessert!  Next time, will have to try that again.  It's a large portion also.  Add the Wedge & I think it would be a perfect meal.  We will see next time."}
{"text":"I ordered for Dinner: BBQ Baby Back Pork Ribs (Half Rack for $19.99) with vegetables and oven potato. Food tastes very good. 

Another time i was for lunch there: I ordered Parmesan-Crusted Chicken for $12.99. tastes again very good.


Overview:
BBQ Baby Back Pork Ribs Our original tender ribs basted with our smoky mesquite BBQ sauce then flame- broiled - Half Rack price: $19.99

Parmesan-Crusted Chicken A lighter portion with saut√©ed Roma tomatoes, onions, white wine, garlic, oregano and basil atop creamy marinara pasta. Topped with baby spinach and shredded Parmesan cheese - price: $12.99"}
{"text":"My son's favorite place and has become a family thing. Kind of pricey but worth the service and the food is great."}
{"text":"Used to be good.  Went there tonight.  Seemed like everyone was tired of working.  Food ok, burger was in 2 pieces like it broke on the grill or it was leftovers from someone else.  Nobody in the place on a Saturday night.  Another place off my list that I used to enjoy.  No one that works there appears to like where they work nor the customers who pay their bills.  Place is tired and needs to be put out of it's misery."}
{"text":"Seems to me that the menu has changed since the last time I was in here and this time I found a tilapia Bianca which I opted for the mashed potatoes instead and it was absolutely delicious. The fish was lightly floured and pan saut√©ed and covered with a white sack containing artichoke hearts shrimp and a white wine taste.  The food was flavorful fresh and delicious.  For my starter I chose the baked potato cheddar cheese soup and it was divine.  So portions were very big and I left the restaurant with the rest of my food to go which I had the next day for lunch.  I was able to enjoy my delightful meal toys and I will certainly go back again for more. Service was awesome they were fast and friendly and a cheesy bread was absolutely delicious and hot right out of the oven.  I'm thoroughly enjoying this new menu"}
{"text":"Pitiful excuse for a Landers property. Does a severe injustice to what I thought was a safe bet to take a group of customers.  WRONG. Poor service, slow, crazy small drinks, mediocre food....how much worse could it be?  Martinis are served in glasses so small I thought it was a joke at first. And while prices are not over the top, they are too much for what you get.  Obviously they have some serious management issues at this property.  Avoid it until they get their act together."}
{"text":"I remember when they opened their doors 20 some odd years ago...people were stacked up waiting for hours!  Now??...you can walk right in and get your pick of tables.  After today's service... I might know why.  We sat in the bar and was waited on by Casey...the mighty one struck out this time!  My wife and daughter were never asked about refills, we watched as she paid a lot more attention to the young man sitting alone at the bar.  Next time we come we will be sure to ask for Taylor who has always been great!!!"}
{"text":"Don't think I've ever been to a Claim Jumper before, but I gotta say that recently my sales rep ordered 40 take out chicken pot pies due to a customer request.  They were really delicious!  Take out size is about a 4\" circumference but I hear if you dine in, it's the size or a 12\" dining plate.  They also offered a unique salad with shredded lettuce, vegetables and coconut that I wouldn't have expected from this place.  At any rate, a nice surprise from Claim Jumper, where I now feel the urge to perhaps try this place and dine in sometime."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Claim Jumpers since Washington. This location lacked the atmosphere I was accomstoned to. We had one of their drink specials which was good. My wife ordered the rib eye with crab meat and I had the 28oz Porterhouse  (a steak I get when I can). You can see from the pictures that the side salads are really small. The steak however are cooked perfectly. I wish this app allowed us to give half stars as well."}
{"text":"Wir kamen hier auf Empfehlung und es war ein sehr angenehmer Abend. Abseits vom Strip ein gutes Steak-Restaurant. Stimmung ist authentisch, Essen ist lecker.
Stephen hat uns sehr freundlich bedient."}
{"text":"Food was very expensive for the portions, ceaser salad tasted like fish and I had another house salad to replace it, only had a few bites when food was served so I took it home, not very good. The shrimp fresca was good. Our waitress was so busy talking to other staff members she had no time for us or her other tables, most likely will not return"}
{"text":"I came here last night for a wedding reception. The reservation was made for 5PM. We got there on time, but waited at least an hour to be seated because the group reservation was in the book, but not in the computer. We were informed of this by an older gentleman with glasses. I would suggest sticking to one method for future reservations. Having to keep up two methods of record keeping for reservations = double the work, a waste of time and money and results in errors like this one! 

We also waited ridiculously long for our appetizer and starter salads. By the time that we received our appetizer, half of the group had already received their entree. Then when our entrees came out, there were a few items that were way too salty - my husband's potato cakes and the mushrooms and onions on my steak to name a few. 

Two stars because the waiters/servers were so friendly and helpful throughout the \"last-minute\" arrangements."}
{"text":"Went last Saturday afternoon (5:30 reservation), a party of four for a pre-Father's Day dinner. Waiter took our drink order and they appeared a few minutes later...all very good. Ordered our appitizers (potato skins and artichoke dip) next and they came out after about 10 minutes. Placed our dinner order.....during our conversation and after 10 minutes into the appitizers....the salads appear!! What? We weren't asked if we're ready...finished with appitizers etc. So here are two young ladies standing at our table with salads. I sent mine back and one was left on the table...not five minutes later the darn dinner appears. Really? Seriously, the place was hardly busy and we were completely rushed through the meal. The manager came by to rectify the situation and I explained that the 'nice dinner' we were expecting was ruined due to lack of communication with the customer.  He deducted $20 from the bill which was a very nice gesture but still the dinner was a big negative. As for the food....the tri tip was dry and well done when it was ordered rare. The half chicken was dried out as well, roasted veggies were the only thing that was made fresh on the plate. The highlight was that the beer was cold, the sangria was good and Fireball/Angry Orchard was an unique combination. 
In the past we have enjoyed happy hour at the bar and thought that dinner would be a nice treat for our out of town guests. Methinks Not."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times and they can be anywhere from one to five stars, When they are on their game service can be first rate but have been here when they just obviously didn't have enough staff. My advise is to go on traditionally slower days so you don't get the bum's rush and the pressure to order your meal, appetizers and drinks all 60 seconds after you sit. I understand they need to turn the tables to turn a bigger profit but it won't put them out of business if they come back a second time for my order. The food just like the service is all over the place from blood still flowing in my chicken to a nice crispy skin well cooked meal. If there was one thing they could do better it would be to improve on their consistency and hopefully to the higher standard. Again this place can be a good experience but it really is a roll of the dice, so go when they aren't overly busy."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way to Sedona and met with a couple of Phoenix friends, first time for all of us, and conveniently located off 17. It was a nice welcoming modern Southwest decor, and we had a friendly attentive server. I usually heed low star reviews and was wary, but my friends made the pick. No worries though, because we were not disappointed. My bf and I usually share our dishes so we are comfortably sated and not stuffed or bringing home left overs, so we ordered the tri tip dip which came with a cup of au jus and steak fries. There was plenty for two, and they served it up in the kitchen on two plates. The tri tip was plentiful and hanging over the side of the bread, and the bread held together nicely when dunked. The meat may have been a tad underseasoned eaten by itself, but dunked, it was perfect, the au jus not the usual over salted. We were happy our experience was a 5 instead of a 3."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie- WOW!! A must have if you're craving some good comfort food! Huge portions throughout the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Claim Jumper.  I am disappointed with some of the menu changes since CJ's was bought out by Landry's.  The service is usually pretty good.  There is nothing phenomenal about the restaurant, but it is still good food...although a but pricey for some items ...$4.99 for a cup of soup is a bit steep for the portion size.  We tend to eat in the bar where it's a bit more relaxed.  Just avoid the bar on Friday nights as the Zappos crowd is a bit loud. They are not obnoxious...just loud...and it slows down service a bit. 

Menu favorites: all of the salads, potato cheese soup, pretzel sticks, gigantic club sandwich, chicken/mashed potato/cinnamon apple dish (PLEASE BRING BACK THIS DISH WITH PORK!!!)"}
{"text":"I just wanted to share that Edward, the server who acknowledged he's been there for about a couple months now was phenomenal. Myself and family members joined your venue for the evening and I must say his personality, work ethics and just the sense of professionalism was outstanding! Outstanding, that if I owned a fine dining restaurant I'd hire him in a heartbeat after a service like that. Claim Jumpers, I have to say you are lucky to have him a part of your team. He is honestly a great asset to your company. Treat him good and give him a raise! I really hope Edward reads this. I've been in the customer service field for many years and I know customer/guest service when I see it. Keep up the good work! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"15 of my co workers and I went to the claim Jumpers on fort Apache and Charleston a couple of night ago.
We had the worst possible service ever.
Our server by the name of Alfred was rude, unfriendly,
No personality and incompetent.
It was an aweful experience with him.
On top of that he over charged us and not once said sorry.
We will Never come back here."}
{"text":"We had the salmon with rice pilaf & tri-tip with fried shrimp. Both dishes were prepared perfectly & delicious! We've eaten at this Claim Jumper several times & have never gotten a bad meal! That's why we keep going back! Angela's service is amazing too. We would suggest asking for her! Very nice & friendly. Thank you Angela!"}
{"text":"Came here for a company lunch and got the sliders with fries.

Not bad place to come, but the sliders were pretty average. Did like the service and how they can accommodate large groups.

We also shared a large slice of chocolate cake, which they are quite famous for. Cake was wonderful -- very rich and delicious, but can see myself getting sick of it if we didn't share it."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong here for happy hour!  Appetizers range from $2 - $7.  A few drinks and appetizers will fill you up and leave you happy for around $20 with tip.  The sliders, fish tacos and pizza were very flavorful.  Staff was quick and friendly.  Good stuff!  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Not a terrible place if your hungry at 3 am in Vegas. Burgers were mediocre, service was pretty good for 3 am.. I wouldn't not go back, but I'd go somewhere else on Fremont if it were open as late"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of old school chain restaurants at all. A few friends and I were meeting at the movie theatre to see Girls Trip and decided to stop here and pre-game a little before.  I didn't yelp a place near the movie theatre.  My fault!  I wish I did!  It was a Wednesday evening around 5.  There's only 4 tables with patrons in the saloon area, one waitress.  She was flustered and irritated.  Her service sucks.  The cocktails sucked.  Between the 7 of us we ordered HH margaritas, HH mojitos, HH Long Islands, and HH house.  We all had only 1 HH house drink, after that we all decided to step it up a notch and order regular cocktails ... hoping for less sugar and a higher alcohol content.

The food was only OK.  Nothing special at all ... everything fried for the most part.  We all only had 2 drinks and left the minute we were done.  We wanted to hang around a bit, have a little girl time before watching Girls Trip.  Claim Jumper wasn't the place for that."}
{"text":"After a long drive, we stopped at Claim Jumper and was seated within minutes by a friendly host.  Our server, Ronnie, hooked us up with some soft drinks right away, gave us a few minutes, and came back to take our order.  Service was great with Ronnie refilling our drinks without us having to ask, giving us an update on how much longer our food would be, etc. all while being personable and friendly.  Food was pretty good.  All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to many claim jumpers as I used to live in California. Food and service for the most part is always great. The negatives about this location inside the Golden Nugget is that their menu is about one third the size of a normal claim jumper menu, there's no saloon or happy hour, and the service is hit or miss.  I've never had a server ask me if we had the yelp app and politely ask us if we could do a review.  I said of course we can!  Our server Tammy gave us the best service we've  ever received at any claim Jumper. She went above and beyond in every way. She was very friendly and interactive. I work in the industry myself, so I highly appreciate her making us feel like we were the most important table in the whole restaurant!  I opted for their famous chicken pot pie and my bff chose their amazing clam chowder and calamari appetizer. I was stuffed, but really wanted the butter cake topped with fresh berries & ice cream. Yum!"}
{"text":"I really don't like much about this place. Incredibly slow wait staff and the food is just okay. It may be that it's just not my style of place, but I held high expectations when going there my first time and none of it lived up to what I thought it would be. Menu options seemed limited and it was a bit overpriced for such an average place."}
{"text":"I've been to Claim Jumper several times now, and finally decided to take the time to review. 
Food: 
First, the complimentary cheese bread is delish. I always get the strawberry lemonade, yummmm. 
So far I've had country fried steak- decent, Widow Burger- YUM, Shrimp Fresca- mmm mmm, Salmon- GOOD, 12oz Bone out Rib-eye- MY FAVE. Let's not forget the clam chowder .
Staff:
My waiter tonight was attentive (I forget his name, but ALWAYS kneels down to take orders) quick, knows the items well and quick. I've had some grumpy hosts in the past, but I'm sure everyone has their days. 
Pricing:
the food and quality is is priced reasonably. 
OVERALL:
I'll be returning"}
{"text":"It was just ok.  We went just before close so we wanted to ensure we were in and out.  Everything was good that we paid way too much for what we got. For 3 people the bill was over $100."}
{"text":"Agree very much with my fellow yelpers about the HUGE PORTIONS!

Walked in on a Saturday for lunch, no wait, was greeted by the friendliest hostess. 

Our server Christopher was excellent, as soon as we were seated he brought us this amazing warm garlic bread, right out of the oven. It was soooo good!!

They have the best kids menu, so many choices. Each meal comes with a drink, side and fries! My son said their fish and chips were the best, the fish was crispy and tender and despite the huge portions, was all gone! 

I had their California citrus salad which has all the things I love, mandarin oranges, cranberries, green apples, candied pecans,  avocado and blue cheese. However the lettuce and mandarin orange were limpy so wasn't as great as I expected. 

The Drunk Chicken was excellent, grilled chicken breast served on than amazing bacon vodka tomato cream sauce and potatocakes. I think I stole all the potato cakes from my husband's entree! The potato cheddar soup is good. 

We were so full that didn't get a chance to try dessert. The restaurant inside is quite dated and needs some serious upgrade. We were initially seated on a table with ripped seat, our hostess was kind enough to change the table immediately."}
{"text":"We went Friday the 13th. Maybe that was the wrong idea...I am mainly giving it a 1 star due to the not-so-good service and the expense of the meal not being worth what we received. First off, we made reservations, and glad we did. We walked in and it the waiting area was about 15 people. We walked up, got brought right to our table. I'd have to imagine a lot of people made reservations, as there were a lot of empty seats.
We sat down, my friend got the house merlot ($7) and I got a domestic beer ($5.25). We ordered the zucchini sticks. VERY good! a light breading, and ranch dressing. I would recommend these. You get a huge pile of them, so best if there are 3 of you to share since it is an appetizer. They also brought out a big loaf of warm cheddar bread.
When salads came, we did not get any cracked pepper. The people behind us did get fresh cracked pepper. 
My friend got the blackened bow tie chicken, I got the rack of baby back ribs. The blackened chicken was good, but not fantastic. You can get better pasta at a cheaper price at Pasta Cucina inside Sunset Station Casino. 
As for my baby back ribs... I only got 7 bones. There are 13 ribs in pork, granted a couple of ribs may get left off on the shoulder. Basically you are NOT getting a rack. You are getting a half a rack, cut into two sections. I would guess they are taking a section of 3 or 4 that should have been on my plate, and putting it on someone's plate that ordered a half rack. And my \"supposed rack\" was $25.99!!! I was told gravy came with my mashed potatoes, it didn't. by the time it came, the mashed potatoes were cold.
Now maybe this was a mistake. If it was, the manager can contact me here. I doubt that will happen as I am sure they give everyone a half rack when they order a rack. 
Bottom line, we paid about $75 for a dinner that we felt cheated on and that the service left much to be desired. For that price you can go to Carve steakhouse inside Eastside Cannery and get great service, both get the Rib eye or prime rib (both are fantastic) and get out cheaper. But no drinks (hey, you are in a casino, gamble and drink for free). 
Just too many good places to eat in vegas and not walk away feeling like you were cheated."}
{"text":"I know they have been busy tonight and that is understandable for February 14th but I do expect my food to be good when it comes out. I should have know because we have had problems the last 3 times that we have come to this location. I had to ask for lemon 3 times to go in my water. My husband and I ordered a pick 3 to share. The ribs were very good but the grilled chicken breast was chewy and dry.  I didn't even attempt it after 2 bites.  Oh yeah... we got the chicken tortilla soup that should be called chicken flavored thickened broth because it was a stretch to find chicken or tortillas in it.  We ordered green beans as a side and we got seasoned vegetables. The waiter went to get the green beans and brought out a plate of dried whatever. See the pic and judge for yourself. I have never had brown green beans. This is it for me. I will make the hike and go to another location because it's apparent that this location does not want to do better.  Yes they are aware of my past disappointments because the last time we came they emailed us a survey to fill out and I was very detailed about our experience.  I would not recommend anyone come to this location unless you want to roll the dice on service and the quality of food."}
{"text":"the worst experience i have had in my whole life - took my grandson out for his graduation.  ordered a martini that came with ice (watered down) martini's dont have ice unless requested, complained to waitress who told bartender, bartender wouldn't do anything, called over the manager who made it himself - here's the kicker, they charged me for 2 martinis (never drank the first) then my meal of ribs and chicken came and the ribs were burnt, showed the manager, he said \"oh they are burnt\" and never replaced them.  they ruined a happy occasion and i truly hope you print this so they don't ruin other people's special days!   zizzalouie@yahoo.com"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on two mornings.  You REALLY want to come before it gets busy.  When busy, seating is quite slow and it takes a while for anyone to acknowledge you.  The breakfast is good and reasonably priced.  It is brought to the table VERY quickly.  The service workers are GREAT and REALLY friendly!!"}
{"text":"When you are at the Golden Nugget, and you are staying a couple of days, the Claim Jumper is a convenient restaurant near the Carson Tower and next door to the Cadillac Bar.  After you've looked at the shark tank for the umpteenth time, it is no wonder that fish is not your order.  We ate at the Claim Jumper twice, one was a late night snack where we had to hurry because at 10pm they close for once a month top to bottom cleaning.  Wow, that is encouraging to learn....cleaning the kitchen and the restaurant.  I had the vegetarian Boca cheeseburger.  Not a big fan.  The next morning we came in for breakfast.  Yes, the carpeted place did appear to be clean with tables and chairs back to where they were.  I ordered French Toast and it came six slices of thick sliced sourdough dipped in an egg batter and grilled to a dark brown crust.  It was a big portion but it made up for the Boca burger I had the night before.  Waitstaff was otherwise ok and occupied with other tables.  He brought me a stainless steel carafe of fresh coffee so I could sit and enjoy the rest of my breakfast.  More points on my Landrys reward card.  I like the Claim Jumper and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 10 and I had the tilapia Bianca and I was not impressed at all. Although my Absolut lemon drop drink was good and the dessert was awesome I had the warm butter toffee cake.  Service was ok not great."}
{"text":"I've eaten here seven times in the past two weeks and not once have I been disappointed. The hostess, servers, and managers have always been great. The servers remember what I like to drink and what items I've tried before. I've tried a variety of foods and have never been disappointed. The managers always come by and check to see if everything came out right. I have not been able to find any reason to believe any of the negative reviews about Claim Jumper. I was there the night of the alleged cockroach incident and I think it had more to do with customer attitude than anything. You usually get treated the way you treat people and it sure looked like it was mostly about getting a free meal. If you are going to call someone down by name you should at least have the courtesy to get their name right. Both the health inspector and the exterminator where called and that seemed to be the only bug on the premises. It just seems strange it would appear front and center on a plate and no one would notice is. Based on what I know about the people and the place I would stand beside management and staff for their handling of the situation and I will be eating at this place many more times in the future."}
{"text":"The most delicious meal I have had in a long time. Service was awesome, they know how to take care of their guest! John was an excellent waiter. We are going back on Wednesday and will ask to be seated in his section. This is our first time in Vegas and have been treated like royalty! The filet mignon melts in your mouth and the hickory smoked chicken is to die for! Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Service was great. The food was disgusting. Ordered clam chowder and it was barely warm. Then ordered fried shrimp and the shrimp was not deveined. Seriously?! I'm paying $18.99 for fried shrimp with the poop vein still intact?! Ugh. Also ordered plain iced tea and it was frothy and super bitter. Definitely not at all impressed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you like Calamari you MUST try it! Hands down the best I have ever had -- and I order it a lot !! 

We have been here twice and both times we had excellent food and service! Large portions for dinner menu. My husband and I split one entree this time."}
{"text":"Completely absurd portions... I thought I was going to have a heart attack from the mountains of food.. food was pretty ok!  Kind of a goofy half joke place.  Neat tall cakes."}
{"text":"I have ate here a few times and have always been satisfied with my meal, I tend to stick with what I like so I ordered the chop steak and chicken tortilla soup. This visit was the day they gave vets free meals so my husband and I went because he is a Vet, we ended up waiting over an hour because the place was packed with people there to eat. When it was finally our time to sit and eat the waitress thank us for our patience which was nice. We ordered our food and they brought out this garlic cheese loaf that tasted amazing, the last time we were there they had the sun dried tomato one which is also very tasty. We waiting a lot longer than normal for our food but the nice waitress we had thanked us again for our patience and brought us out another loaf of bread to nibble on while we waited for our food. The have a clam chowder soup my husband gets and he says it's the best he has had. My husband got the talipia plate and he enjoyed his food he said it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My chopped steak was disappointing for the first time, it was way over cooked and was a little burnt on the bottom i ate it because i didn't want to have to wait for a new one and also i was appreciative of what they were doing for the vets. I will visit again becasue i think they were just having trouble keeping up due to the volume of people there. When we finished our meal the waitress brought us our bill for my food the drinks and my husbands soup and thanked him for his service which was very nice. The thing that always is the same when we dine here is the amazing customer svc and the quality of food minus mine for this meal."}
{"text":"I walked in here with my girlfriend and are from out of town. We were greeted with insanely nice service. Every single person I engaged with was extremely friendly. The food was, of course, huge in proportion  I enjoyed everything I ate. The bread, the French onion soup, salad, quesadilla, and chicken pot pie. We didn't get to finish because the portions were so big but left very satisfied. Great job guys. Whoever is managing is on it at this time of day."}
{"text":"We were stuck down in Tempe and needed lunch for us and the kids so we tried it. I will say the food was surprisingly good! I had Cobb salad and hubby has the tri-tip dip. Kids liked their Mac. And our server Jason was fantastic. However the decor and overall feel (and old smell) is very tired. The ladies restroom looked like it was stuck in the 80s. But it was clean. If they could up their ambiance a bit I'd give it a solid 4. Wouldn't take much to do and I think they'll need to in order to compete with all the great chains these days."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Love the Tri Tip dinner.  Good service.  Nice big bar area!  Coming here more and more often"}
{"text":"Service and food were impeccable! I plan on trying the bread pudding on my next visit."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the claim jumper.  The food wasn't hot, the service was .. blech and it was just disappointing for the amount of money spent.  I would never go to this location again."}
{"text":"I stopped by for my birthday last week to have dinner and cocktails with my friends. I was disappointed that Fernando was not able to be my bartender as he is my Favorite from their Town Square location, but he introduced me to Peter and Ritchie and they took great care of us! Peter went out of his way to make my night extra special! My party was very happy with how they handled our consistent requests being it was a few of us. I would definitely recommend Claim Jumper especially their happy hour! If you are dining in ask for Fernando and if you are at the bar Peter or Ritchie hopefully can take care of you! I hope your experience is as wonderful as ours was! 10 Stars for all 3 of them! **********"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know it's a chain but in my opinion it's a pretty good one. Most of the food that I've had here has been exceptional and the service is always fast and friendly. They offer a decent soup/salad combo or salad/sandwich combo at lunch for only $7 bucks! The salad is always well tossed and properly dressed. The Clam Chowder is spot on with flavor and creaminess. The French Onion and Chicken Tortilla are not bad but they do leave a little more to be desired. Just recently I had the California Works Pizza and it was sublime and can easily be shared between 2 people. All the portions here are fairly large. Make sure you get a dessert to go so you can split it with family or co-workers, My boss calls this place \"Calorie Jumper\" with good reason to."}
{"text":"Best food i have had in Las Vegas and the service was great. Had spinach dip and crab cake appetizers they were amazing. The garlic cheddar butter bread so good. Shrimp fresca and steak and shrimp steak was cooked perfect. Wanted to save room for chocolate calzone desert but next time."}
{"text":"Claim jumper was our last stop this morning before checking out and heading home. I wanted to sit in a booth, but they were busy and we didn't want to wait for one so we took a table near the back of the restaurant by the kitchen. Everything on the menu sounded tempting. Our server Tammy recommended the French toast, Country fried steak and eggs, and the Scrambler. Decisions! Huge selection to choose from.  I usually listen to the servers' recommendations because they know what's good! Actually ended up trying a few other things too, and the portions were huge. Claim Jumper is known for their large portions of comfort food and great service.  And Tammy really nailed the service she was friendly and attentive, she also recommended to post any reviews on yelp however I was already writing it out!  Hands down the best experience in combination of great food and wonderful service!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here. I was in town again, this time with my mom and godmom and they wanted something similar to a Red Robin type of place, so I thought of Claim Jumper.  Service was great (again) and so was the food.  I ordered the same salad I ordered the last time I was here (BBQ chicken salad), and they both ordered club sandwiches and my mom had the mini sundae (she didn't really care for it).  I guess I have to take back what I said the last time that I wouldn't choose this place myself.  I think it's growing on me, especially if you're looking for a place with a variety of foods (especially comfort foods), for a good price.  Gave it an extra star this time! :)"}
{"text":"By far the worst food I have had since visiting Vegas. I ordered the roasted tri tip and shrimp and it was absolutely terrible.  I am a steak person and I could barely eat it.  The shrimp were pounded flat but tasted like cardboard. I am surprised at how bad.  The water tastes like metal and had a bad after taser even.  I had to write a review.  There are so many better places."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time. The food is mediocre at best now. For the price there is so many other places worthy of your money. Service is great. I just wish the food was as good as the portions are big."}
{"text":"I'm wanted to be generous and give two stars, mostly because I hate being THAT lady who has one bad experience and destroys a place on Yelp.  Let me just say, though, that when a party of four walks into a restaurant two hours before closing on a Friday night and you have only one table seated in each section, there is clearly a reason.

To start, the place was darn near empty when we got there, so when my boyfriend wanted a booth, it was no problem.  We were then seated at a booth that was obviously used for two diners, as there were only two place settings, and it was a bit of a squeeze with my mom and thirteen year old brother on one side and my boyfriend and I on the other. I should note that I barely clear 5'2\" and wear a size 0 or 2, so I generally have no issues with small spaces, and my brother isn't much bigger.  We sat there, but I thought it was insane that every other booth in the section was open and they gave us the smallest one they have.  Our server, whose name I will omit, was attentive at first, got our drinks, and then made sure we had a carafe of water and tea for refills, but that was apparently so she had to interact with us as little as possible for the rest of the night.

She made no suggestions, nor did she offer to answer questions when we were trying to hammer out which/ how many appetizers to get, so since we hadn't been in years, we ordered way more than we needed to.  Okay, fine, it's a business, and the bigger the check, the bigger your tip, so I will give it to her.  

Once we ordered our entrees, we didn't see her again until she asked about dessert and if we wanted the bill.  Another staff member brought our plates, and when my mom mentioned that her sandwich was wrong, the lady stared at her while she started to pick it off the sandwich right in front of her.  Her response AFTER my mom removed the items she asked to be excluded when she ordered the dish was finally \"are you sure you don't want me to take it back?\"  You just stood there and watched her pick it off, lady, you can just leave. 

The food was not nearly as good as I remember from when I was younger and the restaurant first opened.  I get that it is a chain, but all of us had something wrong with our dish, and they were all sloppy and thrown together by clearly unskilled line cooks.  My vegetables were drenched in oil, which soaked into my potatoes, and I didn't even touch the mushrooms and grilled onions on my plate, as they were limp and soggy and I really wasn't sure how much I honestly wanted to force myself to eat.  We were too tired and had been ignored for too long in an empty house to care at that point.  I just wanted to leave and wasn't about to ask for a manager, since everyone in the restaurant was in the back the whole time we were there.  Not a single person said anything to us when we left, and the two people at the cooking/staging area behind the dessert case were too busy having personal conversations to notice we left.  Kind of makes me wish we had just dashed, but we paid and tipped 15% out of pity (we usually tip 25% because we know how underpaid restaurant workers are).

Even before out waitress showed up the last time to talk about the check, my boyfriend said we're never coming back.  Now I know why I swore off chain restaurants so long ago.  Claim Jumper is full of a bunch of fast food quality workers and to be honest, I've had drive through cheeseburgers that were more appetizing and put together with more care than the slop on our plates last night."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is our fall back choice when we can't decide where to go. Always good service. If they happen to make the order wrong, they will make it right.  Love this restaurant. Consistently good."}
{"text":"They condensed the menu and don't even serve the garlic cheesy bread on the side anymore. Service was slow and the place was dead. The flavor in what we ordered just wasn't there. Super dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal here tonight, had a seafood platter. Fish and shrimp were fried in semi-rancid oil. You have to change your oil occasionally! Also nothing to dry your hands in mens room - no air dryer, paper towel was completely out. I expect waaay more for the prices you pay here."}
{"text":"We came here just to use our Landry points. I have to say this is one of the nicer CJ's I've been too. The place is well maintained and reminds me of steakhouses back in the day. Plus they have happy hour all day on Sundays that is pretty good and cheap."}
{"text":"Tried to order from claim jumper tonight and wow am I disappointed. Usually I really enjoy eating here at least once a week. Tonight I placed my order and 3 min later I get a call that they are out of steaks and out of sweet potatoes. I know this is not a major issue but to me if you are a landrys affiliated establishment this is unacceptable. 
I WILL not be ordering from claim jumpers for a long time now."}
{"text":"This place use to have the BIGGEST portions ever but since Landry's bought them out recently, the portions have shrunk with the prices remaining the same. If you frequent Claim Jumper, it is very very obvious that they cut each of the portions by about 1/3 which is very disappointing. The menu is still pretty much the same minus the prime rib. Service is always top notch.  This is still a must try place... but now each person should probably order their own entree. =(

MUST TRY: clam chowder, meat loaf, chicken pot pie"}
{"text":"Used to go from Sky Harbor to CJ when visiting PHX. Now that we live here, it has gone to quite mediocre. Still has big portions but the beef tastes more like your typical frozen fare"}
{"text":"Been a long time since dining. We ordered some of the higher end meals. The crab cakes were not very good and served cold and had a shell in it. The artichoke dip was bland and nothing special. I can make better at home. The Filet Oscar was bad. Not seasoned, served rarer than ordered and small and the amount of crab meat on top was a total joke to warrant the higher price from just ordinary Filet. The asparagus was undercooked and hard. The best 2 things about this outing was our server was great and the Ultimate pepper Mary was awesome. Other then that, I doubt I'll ever go back between now and the amount of time it takes me to forget how bad the place is. Expensive bad food."}
{"text":"We stopped by Claim Jumper on a busy Tuesday evening in Green Valley to grab a bite to eat. The food was good, but the service was GREAT!

I cannot say enough things about our server. He was the epitome of a waiter, and I seriously left him a 50% tip. Friendly, efficient, helpful and just plain funny --- he really made our meal fun and was joking around with the kids the whole time.

As far as the food goes -- Claim Jumpers' bread is delicious and I feel like I've gained ten pounds just after having a few buttery slices. After loading up on bread, we couldn't finish our \"real meals.\" Lol..

My BBQ chicken sandwich was enormous (all of their meals are truly made for two here) and tasty. My younger daughter ordered a pizza which was reportedly good. My older daughter went with chicken fingers and basically none of us could finish anything we ordered. In a nutshell, we took most of our dinner home after gorging ourselves on bread. 

However, the price is decent and the customer service was outstanding. Not to mention, we have tons of leftovers!"}
{"text":"Well the food was bad and took longer than if you went to the store bought the ingredients and cooked it your self! No joke I was ready to leave before I ever received my entree. Slow service for no reason. The restaurant was half full and employees just not on the ball here. I've been going to Claim Jumper Restaurants since early 90's. I started going to the restaurant in Long Beach Ca. My first experiences were spectacular! Beautiful rustic restaurant with stone work and fantastic service. The food at this location never changed and is of top quality. Shows having inexperienced staff and management can not up hold a high quality culinary experience that folded this restaurant chain. Regional Management needs to step in and clean house of staff. A half full restaurant unable to serve their customers is a disgrace."}
{"text":"Well the waiter was a little elusive and I ordered the Bar-b-que Ranch Salad....I had the same salad at Cheesecake Factory the day before....bad choice! The salad was no comparison to Cheesecake Factory! It was a lot to be desired!"}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour on a Wednesday. Turns out happy hour is all evening on Wednesdays (@ least it was this day). Got the street tacos. Pretty decent for $4. Service was slow & it seemed the bartenders do not like to make eye contact. Waited 10 minutes before getting my 1st beer. Some guy who looks like he might be the manager was behind the bar & he had the most miserable look on his face the whole time he was back there. He defiantly would not make eye contact. Not sure based on service if it's worth going back. I haven't been there in serveral years & I guess that's why."}
{"text":"Two years ago, this place was a 4-5 star experience. Fun atmosphere, good food and large portions. My husband and I had Claim Jumper as our \"anniversary dinner\" place, and used to go probably bi-monthly. 

On our last visit though, they had changed the menu. My first suggestion is that if you change the menu, the waitress should start with \"Have you guys been here before,\" followed by a \"Oh well, we changed a few things\" if they say yes.

My staple food is the Stuffed Idaho potato, and I had no notice that they changed the recipe. Instead of a beautiful mountain of chopped brocoli, carrots, and zucchini under a layer of cheese, the potato was covered with greasy onions, veggies, and peppers. Additionally, the skin tasted hard as if it had been microwaved- which is not the norm for a $13 potato. 

The Zucchini appetizer had also been changed. Instead of large strips of zucchini with light breading, the recipe is now tiny (as in calamari size) strips with a copious amount of over-salted breading. I used to enjoy being able to taste the vegetable- now all I taste is salt. 

There are good things though- the waiting staff is always pleasant, but with a  lack of personality. The chicken fried steak is my husband's favorite, and someone we go with always gets the chicken pot pie and loves it. 

Overall: too expensive for their cheapened recipes (2 beers, 1 drink, 2 1/2 off appetizers and two meals was $80). Probably will not return anymore, which is sad since the Claim Jumper has been a part of so many memories with my family."}
{"text":"While in town I decided to give Claim Jumper another chance.  I purposely didn't read my first review before coming back in an effort not to be biased by my first review.  Claim Jumper has now changed my mind.  This is a solid 4 star restaurant for a chain.  

I had the BBQ burger again without realizing I had it before.  It was a solid representation of a great burger.  It was cooked perfectly with some pink in the center (I ordered medium).  The bun was fresh and tasted like a homemade roll.  The salt and pepper shoestring fries were glorious!  According to my latest experience, this place is no comparison TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.  

I also had dessert on this trip.  I'm a bit of a lemon cake snob as my grandmother made the best lemon cake in the world (it has been scientifically proven). I had the lemon cake for dessert probably against my better judgment.  Grandma Pauline is turning in her grave as I write this but CJ's lemon cake is a strong contender for best lemon cake in the world.

I will definitely be back to CJ's the next time I'm in town which happens to be next week."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service! I was here 10 days ago around 1:00 pm and again now at 1:30 am and it takes forever for someone to even recognize you at your table and the wait staff has no personality. I would eat somewhere else but it is the only restaurant open at Golden Nugget. The food is decent only."}
{"text":"First Claim Jumper visit!  Best steak I've has in a long time - our waiter (Animir) was friendly and excellent.....so glad we came!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with fellow Yelpers Robyn N.,Arlin B.and Rand H. and I had the tenderloin tips that came with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. Well the food was real good the service was real good and the decor and layout of the restaurant was real good so I guess I will give them a real good 4 stars."}
{"text":"Dim lit but very noisy restaurant. Surprisingly popular despite a pricey menu. A good place for a date or business dinner. Server was extremely nice but apologetic because everything was running behind due to so many people having dinner there. I don't see myself frequenting this or any other Claim Jumper in the future."}
{"text":"Been here before and we tried it again. Walked right in and didn't have to wait for a table. They brought bread before we order and had our meal but there was no butter. It would have been nice to have it but I thought it would have taken some time to get it. I had a burger, and I had have to say it was good. The service is OK but I wished the server would have come around more. I ran out of my drink and when I needed it I was empty. They push some food reward club on us which I didn't like. The reason was it was for a lot of different restaurants that are not in this area. They seem to me they are pushing it for some reason too. Maybe the server get points or something like that."}
{"text":"I have been to this place four times. Each time I have come, I have ordered something different. I cannot believe how unbelievably unsatisfied I was for the price that we had to pay for my meal. I will not return a fifth time."}
{"text":"We came here over Memorial weekend for a late lunch, early dinner. Lunch is served until 3 or 4 so that was awesome. We ordered off of the lunch menu and still didn't finish all of our food. The portions here are a good size and they have a big selection. Their bread they serve with the meals was really soft. The food came out at a good pace. 

My husband and I had the tri tip steak with coconut shrimp. I subbed out the mashed potatoes for a baked potato. It was so good. Not to mention a big potato. It was served with a creamy sweet butter. My daughter had the bacon burger. That thing was massive but she finished it off. One of my boys had the kid's sliders which came with fries and grape. My other son had mac n' cheese with fries and apple slices. The apples were really fresh and were served with caramel dip.

Our drinks were refilled without even asking. BIG Plus for thirsty patrons. We shared a pitcher of their CJ Red Ale. It was light and refreshing and went down without a fight. It paired nicely with our meat. We took a slice of mile high chocolate cake to go. 

They also have a happy hour menu which is served at the bar. I highly recommend that. Also make sure to sign up for the Landry's Select Card to get your rewards points. It's good for several restaurants and attractions."}
{"text":"Although this is a neighborhood restaurant for me I've only ventured in during happy hour that runs from 3-7pm Monday through Friday and only available in the bar area.  I always applaud a place that offers specials of appropriate portions that not only satisfy a budget but flavor as well.  During this last visit I tried the tacos which were tastier than I expected and gave a nice appetizer.  As with any time I eat out I try either fish or a salad and really liked the chinese chicken salad since it quite a huge portion but had ample amounts of chicken.

Sure this place is a chain but the Happy Hour along with having actually good food is enough reason to stop in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Could probably give 0 stars if I could but the server was nice didn't want to make his job hard when he has no control over what happens in the kitchen. So my family and I are guests at the hotel this restaurant is located in and decided to have dinner since it here. Ordered a pot pie for myself and for my brother he wanted pasta. So the first time the server came out and said that they ran out of whatever pasta we ordered and recommended us another pasta so I let that slide. The wait time is ridiculous as well so we wait a little longer. AND the manager comes out and tells me that the pot pies are over cooked basically INEDIBLE so they offered to give me the menu so I can order something else but seriously I'm done at this point we've been waiting over half and hour and only had the garlic bread as an appetizer. So I just cancelled whatever order for myself. The food comes out and it honestly was just no. The blackened Atlantic salmon that was recommended by the server was SALTY AS FUCK. Even with the lemon on the side. And the calamari wasn't even crispy because of how much oil there is with the breeding. Smh the worst kitchen and I honestly wouldn't come back I'm pissed ridiculous but I'm nice enough about it to not say shit bc it's the holidays."}
{"text":"We used to come here quite regularly. Had to stop coming because my doctor told me to cut down on my sodium intake. I looked at Claim Jumpers nutrition information online and almost everything they make is full of sodium. Some meals are more than a daily recommended amount of sodium! I gave two stars because we usually get decent service. The food sucks though. Should offer heart healthy meals."}
{"text":"I had the Widow Maker burger, the wife had Roticery chicken. Both were yummy! Had been quite a while since we'd been to a Claim Jumper, since the one in Scottsdale closed down several years ago. Still enjoy the ambiance AND the good food!"}
{"text":"Received excellent customer service tonight(our previous visit, the waiter wasn't too friendly)...This visit, our waiter went above and beyond..I had mentioned that my daughter was planning on getting the apple cobbler, but ended up not having any room. He surprised us with an order of it packaged to-go....super sweet of him! Thank You!"}
{"text":"The family And I enjoy coming during happy hour as they have decent prices on the happy hour menus. Tonight we had extended family over and for 9 of us we only had a 70 dollar tab to include drinks. 

I am not sure if Claim Jumper managers read these but our server Sean was awesome very attentive. 


Good food good portions and good service rates the 5 stars"}
{"text":"Many changes in the recent years. Serving are still XL. Quality can be hit or miss. Go for happy hour, right near the expensive drinking spots.... Perfect for happy hour... Try the widow maker..."}
{"text":"2nd time here. I ordered the fillet minion wrapped in bacon combo with crab cakes. I loved the crab cakes but was not impressed with fillet minion. Service was good but at the end of the night there was a guy screaming in the kitchen.. We were probably the last guess for the night but still unprofessional.
1st time I was here I had the jumbalaya and it was amazing.
Both times I had plenty of left overs to take home. Large portions appropriate for the price."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service! I dined in alone while I waited for the storm to die down and had a great three course dinner. Jamie was my server and she was so friendly and helpful. Best service I have gotten here hands down. I started with the calamari which is my absolute favorite. House salad was great and tri tip steak was mouth watering good the Demi glaze was the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Come hungry.   No really, don't eat for like 3 days then go to Claim Jumper.   I've seen this much food feed entire families in documentaries on the National Geographic channel.   

The food is good, from the appetizers to the entrees, right on through the chocolate cake the size of a chihuahua it is solid if not spectacular.   The service however is on top of it - I never wanted for a refill on my Iced T and the server was attentive and very nice.    

 If I could add a half star for 3.5 I would."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner here for my last birthday. The menu was 21st century comfort food, which I find so annoyingly common that a star comes off based on that alone. It would be so wonderful to have so many restaurants in town if they were not the same menu by a different name. That being said, I can expect nothing different from a chain restaurant.
The surprise was that the food and service were good. Of course Claimjumper can boast about their delicious cakes. I suggest most of them, so go with some friends and have wine and cake.
I was also turned off by the manager who stopped by the table. He was nice, but with his headset and mini microphone he seemed more like the FBI than the Maire'D. This is another trend in this level of restaurant. Conclusion...3 star. If the same place were a neighborhood boutique without a script, it would rate higher for me."}
{"text":"This is going to be kind of hard to review, if we were going completely off food vs. how long it takes to get out of here (that's a hit and miss thing).. I think the rating would look very different on either. I hope that makes sense, so I'll choose the rating at the end of this.

Food.. this is standard American.  I've been here a few times with coworkers during lunch and it takes forever. It will eat your entire hour and then some, I know it's busy, I know it's not fast food, but sometimes it is hella slow and sometimes you are just making it back.  We've gotten burgers here, the artichoke and spinach dip, I learned a trick to call ahead and get their gluten free pizza, and then bring it back to the office.  I was really surprised, Claim Jumper has the best gluten free pizza at any chain I've ever been to.  It's worth remembering for that alone.  

This was weird, the other week a friend from work and I walked in and were told the wait was 15-20 minutes for a table but the bar was open seating and serving the full menu.  We sat at the bar and waited, I went back up front and grabbed a couple menus so we could look through it until the bartender got to us, and she immediately requested our ID's... which I thought was weird since we hadn't ordered alcohol and we're both obviously over 21.  I thought that was necessary specifically if you were ordering alcohol.  My friend left her bag at the office since I was buying lunch and didn't have her ID on her, but she's obviously of age, and regardless we just wanted lunch.  We ended up going to Brio.  Oh well. 

I think I'm just going to continue calling in to go orders on days I want gluten free pizza and I'll call it good... sooo 3 stars."}
{"text":"We have been frequent guests at this Claim Jumper but tonight we came in for a family dinner. All I can say is the food was bland!! I got the Blackened bow tie chicken pasta and the chicken wasn't blackened, it was shaved so thin you could barely tell the difference between the chicken and the pasta. There used to be a spice to it but now it tastes like nothing. My husband ordered the chicken club wrap and all you could taste was mayo and tiny bites of chicken. Needless to say I am very disappointed, if I wanted to eat bland food I could have stayed home and ate a jar of mayo for free!"}
{"text":"Darelyn provided excellent and friendly service at this location. She tended to my gluten-free dietary preference and made excellent recommendations with my bacon cheeseburger! So delicious! I would have given five stars however, we waited 30 minutes for our food which had nothing to do with our server-- who you should ask for! :)"}
{"text":"Good size portion but service here has never been great. They don't come around and check how your doing or if you need refills so pace yourself on your drinks. Food has always been good and plentiful and it's not a bad place if you can get past the service."}
{"text":"REVIEW IS FOR CLAIM JUMPER. 

Absolutely terrible service. We waited forever for our server to take our food and even longer to get our food. Our server took forever to get us coffee and drink refills. 

My mom's order came out incorrect with cold food and the chicken tasted so bad that she left it. She ordered her potato w extra butter and instead it came out cold with sour cream. There was no use asking for it to be fixed because every request took about 10 minutes to be fulfilled. 

I drove in from out of state to celebrate both of my parent's birthdays and they chose this place. I told the hostess, the server and whom I believe to be the manager back in the kitchen that it was their birthdays. Not one single person said happy birthday to them as most restaurants do. 

I ordered chocolate cake to go and the box was delivered with STICKY chocolate fingerprints ALL over the box and I had to wipe it down and ask for a bag. 

The server did seem he was irritated that we asked to move tables at the very beginning. We were all VERY friendly to the server but even so it made not an ounce of difference. I could post the server and manager's name but hopefully this review will suffice in them getting their act together. But I won't find out because I will never return. 

Unfortunately it could not have been more disappointing experience and I certainly will never return. I ADVISE everyone to steer clear of this establishment.

Trust me. You will receive better service at McDonalds. 
And management please feel free to reach out for specifics."}
{"text":"Mccormick & Schmicks, located on Hughes,  used to be my spot for happy hour, and the company decided to CLOSE from one day to another, without notice. The wonderful staff was not notified either...such a shame. Now, Claim jumper has new staff, poor service, and their menu isn't as versatile. No thanks. I'm going to Banditos Grill (in the same parking lot) for better service and delicious menu items on happy hour."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we had a disappointing experience at the Avondale claim jumpers restaurant on Friday evening. Service was slow, not attententive,  food.order was wrong, we had to ask another waiter for silverware to eat with...when we were paying we ask for a bag for our take home boxes...never got a bag, we ended up just leaving frustrated.
No one was at the front desk when we were leaving, people coming in just stood there looking lost.
Not sure what was going on there last night, but dissapointing for sure..."}
{"text":"Great food and EXCELLENT SERVICE!! My waiter was all over ensuring we had what we needed! What a great experience!"}
{"text":"I swear I have never had a bad meal here! Lunch today was fabulous and the server was great. He had 6 tables and was killing it like a champ! Go have a great meal at Claim Jumper!"}
{"text":"I love Claim Jumper's restaurants and this location is no exception.  Frankly it is the best location I have ever been to and this one recently opened inside the Golden Nugget.  They have all the usual fair including the full racks of baby back ribs which are my favorite.  John S was my server the day I came in.  I placed my food order as soon as I walked in and spent some time browsing the drink menu which is probably the opposite of what the staff is used to.  However, I was starving and saw no point in drinking on an empty stomach.  John was more than happy to comply.  I ended up ordering the full rack of baby back ribs with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  I also ordered a small caesar salad and a belini which tasted quite good.

Their service is awesome.  I walked in at dinner time and was seated right away.  A food runner brought out my caesar salad within 5 minutes of ordering.  Another food server also brought some bread but I asked them to give it away because I wanted to lay off the carbs.  The drink came 5 minutes after that.  And then after probably another 5 minutes, the ribs came.  These guys really brought their A Game because I am used to waiting almost an hour for my food at the locations in California.  As soon as I finished up a plate, someone walking by would offer to clear it for me.

The food is of course tasty and filling.  The drink was scrumptious.  John rang up my order in no time at all.  Honestly, I was probably in and out in 30 minutes - which was totally fine by me because I had 10 hours of Electric Daisy Carnival to head to.

Did I mention that they are in the Golden Nugget?  Of course I did!  But you know what is really awesome?  You can get anything on their menu sent to your room for room service for like $5 more!  I know, crazy right?  Why settle for boring hotel fare when you can eat Mongolian beef and brocoli!  Needless to say, I highly recommend this location!  :-)"}
{"text":"We had a great server, only good thing. Food doesn't even taste good if you're drunk.
Blackened Thai pasta was bland, the citrus salad had cheese that was overwhelming, tasted old and the chicken was like old deli meat.
I had the chicken tenders, fries were good, & that's about it.
Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love going here with big groups for special occasions! The menu is huge so there's something for everyone. The portions are very filling, you definitely get what you pay for. The food has always been prepared exactly how everyone wants which is impressive with big groups. I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 because there wasn't any wow factor that set it apart from similar restaurants. I would've also liked it better if the rooms were better lit."}
{"text":"Went to claim jumpers this past Sunday before a concert we had about an hour and a half before the show and sat at the bar to get instant service to avoid the wait. Boy were we wrong to do that we sat for 15 minutes before a server not working the bar finally asked us for our drink order the actual bar was sparse maybe three other couples of two people, one of which was done with their food. It took a total of 48 minutes to have the bartender actually ask us for our order by that time we had to go and went without eating due to poor service time. The crappy part was upon us asking for our check for the beer and iced tea a couple came in and sat at the bar next to us. within 8 minutes (also timed) they had drinks and the bartender was taking their order all in all bad service for customers prepared to tip well and have a good time the $9.50 beer was the nail in the coffin for me never returning to that location again"}
{"text":"I'm gonna take some heat for this, but I really don't care.  I LOVE Claim Jumper.  Say what you will about chain this and chain that, but I hold this restaurant higher than your average chain and with reason.

It takes everything bad about American dining - huge portions, over-the-top decor incl impressive old-school ceiling fans, fattening desserts and huge tedious menus and unabashedly flaunts it.  I call it the Sierra Nevada version of Cheesecake Factory.

I've been going here for years - so I may be blinded by the nostalgia value, but I think the food is of better quality than your typical chain.  I very rarely come here anymore because every location is far-flung since Claim Jumper is adored by suburban soccer parents from here to Chicago, but my buddy out in South Tempe got me to make the trek last week for his birthday.

My favorites here are:
* Tri-tip french dip, which is delicious and classically Californian.  
* Rotisserie chicken with red skinned mashed potatoes or cheese potatocakes as an option.
* Country Fried Steak - with the mashed potatoes adorned with a red apple. :)
* Parmesan crusted chicken with angel hair marinara.
* Meatball calzone which is bigger than your face.

If you can finish dinner here AND leave room for the gluttonous Chocolate Mother Lode cake or Mud Pie for dessert, I would like to meet you and shake your hand just to be sure you are human."}
{"text":"I went with my mom and sister and our food came out and while I was taking a drink of my soda I noticed a hair in my food. I called the waiter over and he took care of it. I was pleased with how he handled it. Then a manger came over apologized and offered us free dessert and my meal was free as well. They did an outstanding job on handling the problem. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We were told to go here when we first moved to Vegas.  Like the 2 star rating says...I've had better.  The service was slow, and our waiter forgot to bring our appetizer.  My husband got the ribs and said they were prettty good.  I got the steak and should have sent it back...it was tough and dry.  Overall the ambiance is loud and crowded.  We are used to chain places, but I guess I expected more.  I may go back some day to give it another shot....but there are too many other declicious spots in Vegas:)"}
{"text":"Totally messed up!! Waited over 20 min for our food in a empty restaurant!! Being in the restaurant business, that is not good business!!"}
{"text":"I am Jack's human liver pate . . .

Some of my family seems to LOVE the Claim Jumper . . . my aunt and uncle went there twice in their week vacation here . . . mainly because they give you enough food to choke a yeti

But what kind of food?  I promise you most of it has spent ages pre-packaged and/or frozen, and has had more than it's fair share of reheating.  The first time I went I had the meatloaf and it had freezer burn.  The grilled veg were mush.  The turkey dinner last night was good, but only a notch above cafeteria food.  Didn't stop me from shoveling it down . . . all I wanted to do afterwards was go home, lay down, and rub my belly

Because see, that's what the Claim Jumper is.  Loosen your belt and force feed yourself.  They should rename it Gluttony Junction       

Both of the people who had the steak loved it, felt it was well cooked.  The only real food surprise for me was the fried calamari . . . big hunks of nicely deep fried near melt in your mouth calamari.  The little endive salad that came with it was a nice touch, though way too much dressing

The place is inviting enough, some nice theme design quirks, and our waiter was very attentive without being cloying.  The wait for a table could have been awful, but there were plenty of empty tables in the bar area so we grabbed one.  The drinks are weak as shit though, and I say that not just because our group are all alkies . . . I say it because the drinks were week as shit.  The CJ hefe was meh.

So Gluttony Junction . . . not someplace I'd ever recommend, but with good family or friends, in the end it doesn't matter where you end up."}
{"text":"Food was OK, but the service sucked today. We have been to this Claim Jumper and the one in Henderson multiple times, but this place sucked today. Luisa, our server, seemed like someone pissed in her cheerios. We were the second group of people in the place. 2-3 other families got their appetizers before we did. Also, timing is key when eating at a restaurant. When our appetizers come out as well as our soup and salad, then 5-10 minutes later the main course come out. Seriously? We barely even got to finish. Claim Jumper has lost our business and we will never go back. Tip was less than 10% because of this service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I are big fans for Claim Jumpers salads. We probably order one probably once a week. Our favorites, California Citrus Salad & BBQ Chicken Salad. We've eaten here numerous times, now we're taking it to-go. Why only 4 stars? It's a bit pricey for salads, I think.

I do love how many restaurants now offer to bring your order out to your car. It's great for us lazy people. I did go in this time, though. 

Kristina usually takes the to-go orders. She is very organized, friendly, and efficient. She knows our orders by memory. Lol. Good job!

I remembered why I liked having them your food out. You can avoid looking at that humongous chocolate cake at the counter calling your name. Willpower... Just the salads..."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place when in town. Brought my mom here for her 60th Bday. Tabitha was an awesome waitress and super friendly. I ordered the Center Cut Filet and was amazing. Mom had the ribs and I stole a few and very enjoyable. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got so many negative reviews, we just went there today as a family, and had a great time. The menu is similar to the likes of Applebee's, only with more variety and a bit pricier. We paid $12 for lunch for adults, $6 for kids. The service was outstanding, that's why i'm writing this review, the people who work there deserve 5 stars!!! The food was good enough for my taste, i had the trip tip, it was tender and very tasty. There were lots of business people and ladies \"doing lunch.\" The atmosphere was great, beautifully decorated, i recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour. The food was pretty good. 3 cheese pancake was good. Also, the pulled pork sliders were good. The service was not good. With every time from taking a drink order ,to getting our food , to getting some ketchup ( seemed like the waitress went to California for it), to getting the check, it took forever to do these tasks. Look for another Claim Jumper for quicker service."}
{"text":"This location is now shut down. Only been open for a month or 2. It used to be a Mcormick and smicks. What a shame, they had good service and good food."}
{"text":"What a disaster!  The only reason I gave one star was because there were no negative star options!  Definitely not a place to go with a large party.   We had a party of 13 and a reservation for 7:15 to have a celebratory dinner.  We all stood in the lobby waiting for our \"reservation\" for about 40 minutes. We were the wait was because they didn't have enough menus.  Really??? My bad, thought it was pretty standard to have enough menus for your guest.  It was about 8 pm before we even placed our orders. Every part of this experience was horrible.  Dinner/salads started coming out before the apps.  I never got the drink I ordered, we kept being told refills were coming which never happened.  Some of the dishes were just so awful they were inedible. 2 of our party ordered tri trip which looked like it had just been scavenged somewhere from the kitchen and thrown on the plate. It was so tough they couldn't chew it. I ordered the chicken parm pasta which was nothing like the description.  The breading was soggy and needed to be cooked longer and it was pretty tasteless. I was skeptical about even eating it wondering if I would get sick. The talapia and shrimp dish came out missing it's sauce.  Potatoes came with no toppings and the beef ribs were full of fat and rubbery.  We had to ask repeatedly for things like toppings and drink refills.  By the time they did bring toppings for the potatoes, they had to bring new potatoes because the original ones were cold.  The manager finally came over and started trying to help our waiter play catch up by bringing out drinks.  One couple had to share a glass all through dinner because their drink never came.  Our server was clearly in over his head and freaking out making it a very uncomfortable experience for all of us. His attitude and lip service was like we should share the blame for his misfortune of having to deal with our large party.  When the waiter asked if we would be needing separate checks he was very excited when we said no, one is fine. He then tells us, that's awesome, you guys just don't understand I'm dislexic and this is really difficult!  PRICELESS!  

Our host was very upset because it was his intention to treat us all to a great meal and experience.  Unfortunately CJ has gone way down hill!  Meals used to be incredible and a very special experience.  Not the case this time.  Go somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE AND FOOD!! We've enjoyed this restaurant in the past but this last visit was HORRENDOUS!! The restaurant was not busy and we were seated right away (about 7:30pm). We ordered an artichoke dip, country fried steak, and a lobster tail. We waited over half an hour for our meal. The lobster tail was dry, which could have been a result of it sitting under the warmer too long. We told the waiter and he got the manager to come check it out. He asked what we wanted and we told him we wanted another fired up. Surprisingly, he asked if we wanted more butter, as if that would have made the dry rubber lump any better.  After waiting another 15 minutes, our waiter asked if the new one was better. At that point, it was a rhetorical question because we didn't get it yet. He went to check on it and promptly brought it, which probably meant that it was sitting in the window...again.  We never got refills on our drinks and attention was sporadic for such a slow restaurant. The dip was ok, no artichoke flavor, and the CFS was ok also, but nothing special. The waiter was supposed to bring a box for our leftover muffin and bisquit, but he took so long that we just paid the check and left. We never even got a comp anything for our troubles.  Very disappointing. Most likely our last visit to Claim Jumper.   : ("}
{"text":"We haven't been to Claim  Jumpers in awhile and when my daughter asked to go because she remembered the Mac & Cheese still very good I had the Ribeye so good my daughter had Salmon Oscar with a side of you know what!"}
{"text":"I'm giving credit to my husband this time...  100% his idea to stop in for happy hour.  Great choice!

We walked in to be greeted immediately by several of the staff.  We were there during happy hour times so we wandered into the bar/saloon area.   This is definitely a large bar area with booths, tables and outdoor seating as well as plenty of seats at the bar.  Only a few tv's in there so place yourself accordingly if you want to watch a game. 

Our waiter, William, was over in seconds to greet us.  He provided exemplary service the entire time.  Definitely knowledgeable of the menu with great suggestions.  I'll make sure to ask for his section next time! Thank you William!

We opted to split some pretzel sticks w/cheese.  Only $2 on the Happy Hour menu.  Love it!  But we can't just stop there.  We also split the Widow Maker Burger.  Phenomenal!  They cooked it perfectly as requested.  This sandwich is piled high with smoked bacon, onion rings, avocado, cheddar and tomato.  The burger was juicy and delicious. I would definitely get this again.

They have pretty good HH Menu options.  With happy hour times everyday and ALL day on Sunday, it's really convenient.  I would love to stop back in again soon!"}
{"text":"Be careful, both times I gone to this location they double tip on your credit card.  They dont have honest people that work for them. 1st time I can see its and individual issue, 2 times its a bad management issue."}
{"text":"I have left a review before as well....but I think that I have found my every time order item off of the menu and I actually crave it as well....the fried fish tacos!!!! Soooooo gooooood! Speaking of....I would kill for some right now! :)"}
{"text":"I was tired, had just checked-in to the nearby Holiday Inn Express, and saw the Claim Jumper at the edge of the parking lot. For the convenience, I was penalized with a bill of $47 for salmon, caesar salad, diet coke, and a slice of cream cheese pie! Yikes! The blackened salmon was covered in spices twice-over, so it was too salty -- so salty that I should've sent it back!"}
{"text":"Went in for the Veterans Day special. Waited over 1.5 hours to be seated (pretty sure someone else claimed our name as we were waiting outside), but we knew we'd have to wait. Service was outstanding - kind and quick. The mozzarella sticks were delicious (some of the best I've had). All our dinners were tasty. My only negative was price. It was way too expensive of a place to frequent - maybe will return for a special occasion. Nice \"homey\" decor as well."}
{"text":"I was hungry, so I took myself out to dinner, because I'm a loser and I have no friends.  I tried out the \"ore cart\" (sampler of baby back ribs, beef ribs and chicken) because I'm a fat pig.  Then I felt depressed and hated myself for the rest of the day.

All in all, a successful outing.

Of all the meats I tried, the ribs were definitely the highlight.  I don't know why I ever order chicken in restaurants; it's always dry and tastes the same anyhow.  The ribs taste very BBQ-y though, just like the kind pappy used to make.  Unfortunately, that means it's mostly burnt and dried out.  But don't get me wrong though, it's GOOD...

Afterwards, I went home and wrote my will.  Where do you go from there?"}
{"text":"Gluten free friendly cheese burger. It was delicious. Mom had clam chowder not gluten friend but yummy."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for food that was so cold the broccoli had ice on it still. Sent food back and asked to speak with manager. Waited about another 15 minutes and manager finally arrived and she took the entr√©e off the bill. My steak was good but too bad I had to share thanks to the horrible service! Southern California is much better.  Management hasn't a clue here.  And the place wasn't even packed! Giving it two stars, only for the waitress that served us!"}
{"text":"We were going to be at the Golden Nugget Hotel to see a show. We decided that we would get an informal, inexpensive dinner before the show. We chose to eat at Claim Jumper. We had eaten at Claim Jumper in Town Square many times. This was the first time we were trying it at the Golden Nugget. Despite the hotel and the restaurant seeming to be very crowded, we were able to get seated immediately. Our server, John, came to the table and Took our drink orders almost immediately. He returned with the drinks and an oversized croissant as a starter. The bread was really fresh and incredibly buttery. Yummy. I ordered the chopped Cobb salad. The portion they brought was humongous. All of the ingredients you usually find in a Cobb salad, only more so. A very large amount of eggs, bacon, avocado, sliced turkey, tomato, bleu cheese crumbles, and more. I got a bleu cheese dressing on the side. The portion of the dressing was also large and filled with chunks of real bleu cheese. I came in hungry and this was still way more than I could finish. My wife got a hamburger and a side of fries. Each was prepared exactly the way she ordered and she said was excellent. The only negative to the meal was that the noise level in the restaurant was quite high and made conversation a bit difficult. Was this gourmet dining? No. However, this was a perfect informal, inexpensive place to dine before a show with excellent food and really good service. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this Claim Jumper many times in the past, always had a positive experience. Tonight we were coming as the first part of a family celebration. We made a 7 PM reservation (yes, Claim Jumper takes reservations!!). We realized that we would be pressed for time for the after dinner celebrations, so we came 20 minutes early. The hostess was very sweet but she told us they couldn't seat us before our reservation even though we are Landry Select members. And they did get us seated right on time for our reservation.
I ordered a Cobb Salad. My wife got the widow make hamburger. The salad was huge (couldn't finish it). Tons of turkey, bacon, egg, avocado, tomato, and more. Excellent. And my wifes widow maker was a great presentation and very tasty. Also so big she couldn't finish it.
The manager came over and apologized for not being able to seat us early (huh? - they did nothing wrong. They honored our reservation) The manager then took our orders and acted as our server making sure the rest of the meal went perfectly. He even comped us 2 desserts (chocolate layer cake and a strawberry cake with ice cream - each delish!!!).
Definitely coming back again soon."}
{"text":"We usually really like Claim Jumper but we always go to the one in Tempe.  MUCH better customer service in Tempe.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"For the longest time, I drove past this place thinking it was called the \"Clam Jumper\". Now that I know better... well, I still call it that anyway. It's not bad for what it is: a junior Cheesecake Factory knockoff with a giant menu of massive portions of super-caloric food and laughably huge cake slices for dessert (for $11, natch). 

SLIDERS were dry and overcooked, served with LTOP but no condiment sauces? Enjoyed the good-quality thick-cut cheddar, selected side of SPICY THAI SLAW which was actually really fresh and light.
BF got the TRI TIP PLATE, meat was a bit tough but well seasoned with a tasty demi sauce, sided with nice roasted veggies and some dismal mashed potatoes. Added a large cup of the CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP, which was actually really flavorful!

Portions were huge, left stuffed. Service was friendly. Much like CF, menu doesn't really have a focus so it's hard to decide what to order."}
{"text":"Wow. Slow Sunday got the pasta jambalaya. I had it before and it was really good. That's why I give it 2 stars. This time not even edible. It was tasteless and very almost greasy and soggy. It kind of annoyed me the waitress didn't ask if everything was ok when someone takes 2 bites says they don't want anymore and no box. I figured too much. I guess I could have said something just thought it was very obvious. Well it cost me 60 bucks to no I will never eat at claim jumpers again. Thx"}
{"text":"I went for my anniversary dinner. I really wanted beef ribs and it's close so I thought lets go.
The food was horrible. Stay away. I got the beef ribs and they where served burned like charcoal and mash potato's where ice cold. Literally like potato salad. I will never go back there. Do yourself a favor and don't go.
The manager said she would give me a discount, but didn't. The bill was full price. 
I was disheartened and just paid the tab and left.  
They didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. 
The fact the place was mostly empty on a Friday night should have been my fist clue.
If you want beef ribs Bobby Q's is the place to go."}
{"text":"The staff here is pretty good. They definitely could use some tips on speediness, but overall they are about average. The food is the highlight, as it should've, at CJ's. I would recommend the chicken pot pie or the barbecue chicken salad. They also have a nice, light Mahi Mahi that is worth trying."}
{"text":"Came in about 8:30pm on a Friday night, not busy, seated right away, hostess was pleasant, but nothing special just going through the motions.

Server was prompt with her routine spiel, mechanical and robotic, polite, but indifferent. Very accommodating adhering to specific requirements to the order and quick to bring additional requests to the table.

Entrees arrived by runner before even halfway through with salads. When stated we were still working on our salads he shrugged his shoulders, dropped the plates, and left.

Ordered the Ore Combo with baby backs, rotisserie chicken, and tri tip all were very good and nice size portions however, in my opinion the demi glaze on the tri tip was a fail and should of been served on the side. I mentioned to the server I did care for the sauce, she quickly apologized and just as quickly walked away. Also ordered a tri tip dip, that came out served on a galvanized metal chicken feed tray or something to that effect very tacky, but the sandwich was good.

When presenting the check the server also presented a high pressure sales pitch to join Landry's Select Club for only $25, her determination to close the deal ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing and stress free evening out. 

Was charged for a lemon aid when I asked for a slice of lemon for my water. An unapologetic manager happily obliged and removed the lemon aid charge from the bill and then felt it necessary to assure me nothing shady was going on. Um...O.K. ?????

Not the best experience as far as a warm friendly, inviting, atmosphere goes. The service was adequate, but the hospitality felt aggressive, disingenuous, and forced at best. Less than welcoming.  However, the food that was ordered was good and the cooks seem to know what they're doing... take out orders might be the best way to go here."}
{"text":"I've been having Claim Jumper withdrawal since the ones by my home have closed down and the only one close by is 45 miles away in Irvine, CA.  I saw on yelp there was one in Vegas so we decided to come here since we are fans of CJ.

I ordered the country fried steak . The portions were huge and on top of that, I got two. I only finished one. I did eat the mashed potatoes which were very good. I had to take the rest back to the hotel.

Our waitress, Holly was very nice and gracious.  Excellent server. I will be back again on my next trip to Vegas to get my CJ fix again."}
{"text":"I was here last night and the people were really nice! This morning however, our waiter Luis Carlos was a nightmare! 

He was rude, and took forever to fulfill or even take our orders. Other people were complaining also, so it's not just us. 

The manager was nice on trying to help though"}
{"text":"The absolute best things about this place are the pretzel, bowtie chicken and cornbread muffins. I could eat these everyday from here if I could."}
{"text":"Great wings, cold beer, terrible waiter. :(  my boyfriend and I went out for beers and an appetizer on my night off. we were seated in booth and approached by our waiter who's greeting included that he was almost off for the night. we each ordered a beer and when they were brought to the table we ordered wings. Our beers were 6.50 and we planned on having a couple each. The Waiter returned to our table one time to ask if were were ready to order food we said \"no thanks\" but we were not ready to leave. about 10 minutes later he returned to ask if we wanted our check. My boyfriend said no, and the waiter asked if we wanted something well, my boyfriend starts to order 2 more beers and the waiter walks away. we atte.pted to get his attention for his next three passes and he ignored us every time as he rushed around to his other tables closing checks. we paid and left. we are headed to buffalo wild wings to resume our date night. I probably should have given 2 stars. ugh."}
{"text":"I have to start with a disclaimer. Among the chain restaurants, I am partial to Claim Jumper ( you can look at my reviews of their restaurants in Town Square and Downtown Vegas which were positive). We were coming from the movies at Green Valley Ranch with friends and thought we would have an informal, after the movie, dinner at the nearby Claim Jumper. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there. We got seated right away and our server came to the table immediately taking our drink orders and bringing the oversized croissant bread plate for the table. The bread was the highlight of the meal. When at Claim Jumper, I usually get one of their salads and my wife usually gets a simple hamburger (bun, burger,  bun). I wanted to try something different, so I ordered their jambalaya. Our friends ordered salad and a burger. My jambalaya came first. Few minutes later, the burgers came. And then the salad. My friend took one bite out of his burger and we had to start looking for the server to send it back. He found it so over salted that it was virtually not edible. My wife wanted her burger medium rare with nothing on it. It came medium well with lots of lettuce and tomato. The server said it must have been someone else's burger. My friends wife also had to return her salad. As to the jambalaya, it was a good sized portion of what looked like a plate of linguine with 6 shrimp on the perimeter. I did find two small pieces of what looked like luncheon meat chicken mixed in with the pasta. There was absolutely no sausage. There were no vegetables that I could find. In my experience, jambalaya should have some kick to it. This was absolutely bland. I can't say that the dish was bad. But it certainly wasn't good. And it certainly wasn't anything that I would call jambalaya. They did make good on my friend's burger as well as my wife's burger. But they were brought to the table separately much later,  well after I had finished my meal. The salad came back even later than that. So while we all sat at the same table, we ate our meals separately. At the end of the meal, someone who I believe was a manager came to the table with the standard \"so how was everything?\" frankly, she should have known and come to the table with an apology. The bottom line for me: 1. When at Claim Jumper,  stick with ordering the salads, they do a good job with them in general. 2. Don't eat at the Green Valley Claim Jumper. Stick with town square and downtown. Those kitchens seem to work well. The Green Valley outlet, not so much."}
{"text":"Super delicious food, as always! We started with potato skins & ordered a burger as well as pasta! Very happy with this visit! It was confusing when we walked in and the hostess really took off almost to a sprint while seating us  we will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, and very nice atmosphere.  Waiters are very jubd and polite. We did not have to wait on our drinks the waiter was on top of everything."}
{"text":"Bad service can really ruin an otherwise terrific experience. Our Happy Hour Group in the bar yesterday  was treated very rudely by the server. He wouldn't tell us his name because in his words ' he gets a bad attitude when he's busy and didn't want to get into trouble. \"  Refused to let us go to the bar to get things quicker, tried to take a chair from us that we were saving for a later arriving friend, never cleared dirty dishes or glasses, no refills offered had to chase him for service. It took 15 minutes for a food order to be placed.  I would have liked a second beer but he never came around to get a refill order. He told one guest that he hadn't ordered anything when he had. Blame the guest? Totally unprofessional and we expected better. Put name tags on your servers and let's have some accountability, okay?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. This time the service was really slow and they weren't that busy so not sure what their deal was. 
When we got there it was not that long to be seated but once seated at our table we waited like ten minutes till someone came over to greet us. We had plenty of time to decide on our whole order while we were waiting to be greeted. So we order drinks, appetizer, main meal all at once. 
The appetizer came out in just a few minutes but it took longer till we got our drinks. For the appetizer we had the potato cakes, quite yummy. 
It took well over 40 minutes from when we first placed our order till we got our main meal. Quite a long time for what was ordered. I enjoyed the parmesan chicken it was different but still very good. 
Because we were too full for dessert but still wanted the have the huge chocolate cake, had to get it to go. 
Overall good food and drinks, but terribly slow service. Some of the prices here are a little ridiculous, too."}
{"text":"Food is good. 

However, service is nice but slow. I waited for my dessert for 30 minutes. The cookie was over cooked and so hard it couldnt even be cut with a fork. The cookie was cold and not warm like its supposed to be, and could tell it had been sitting in the kitchen ready to be delivered to our table because the ice cream was so melted it covered the whole of the cookie. 

Our last experience wasnt any better. Luckily, the manager came out in our last visit when he noticed our food looked bad just as it was being delivered! He's the only reason this place got an extra star."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad meal at any claim jumpers. The meals are large so you will have left overs and the warm up very well."}
{"text":"Not sure how many stars to give, so I went in the middle.  Five stars for how good the BBQ Chicken Salad & warm bread was.  ONE STAR for the manager of this restaurant today and the clueless server.  The waitress seemed to be confused about it being a free meal for Veteran's and said \"they just threw this thing together.\"  Um, no we go every year.  Then she takes my husband's driver's license that has VETERAN written on it and takes it to the manager, she is gone a long while.  She comes back and says \"we need more proof.\"  Not only does my husband have a Veteran License (that you have to really jump through hoops for in Nevada to get it), he has his Military ID in his wallet, wearing a Marine Corp ring, hat.  Then to question him.  She said \"we get a lot of people in here trying to get a free meal.\"  I said well we aren't one of those people and here's our proof.  Then the manager comes to our table and doesn't believe my husband's ID nor Military card, I honestly think he didn't even know what one looked like.  That about sent my usually calm husband into a rage.  I said, I am so offended right now.  Are you going to check all of the women and men's ID's that served or are serving our country's DD214's?  He said, yes I am.  (ya right)  I'm pretty sure some of them aren't carrying those around in their wallet.  I know I sound like I'm throwing up all over this post, it was just so sad how my husband was treated and to be kind of referred to as a liar.  Showing his ID should have been all they needed to see, but no, they took it to ridiculous levels.  Really?  Shame on you guys."}
{"text":"Being an out of towner, I must say this location is good. Christopher was our server and done a great deal taking care of us and tending to our needs. I had dinner with my family and there was only one mishap of a wrong order which totally wasn't Christopher's fault. The problem was solved fast and we kept chugging along. I enjoyed their chicken as the breast was white and juicy. Overall the experience was good. The restaurant is small but it's located inside a hotel. I enjoyed my time here today!"}
{"text":"I only gave them two stars because they had the game on. Other than that this place is gross! I ordered a simple chicken tortilla soup and it was cold. I also order a glass of wine...UHG not cool. I have to admit the wine was cool but that wine glass was dingy and disgusting-.- the silver ware look like it had been through World War II . The waitress act like she had an attitude if we had a question. Not liking this place. This is the first time and definitely the last. Oh please STAY AWAY FROM THE SHRIMP AVOCADO SALASA... my mother got sick right after she ate it...."}
{"text":"As a Landry's Card member I expect at least professional courteous service. \"Dolly\" from the Philippines is one of the rudest people I have met in my life, even after showing her my Member card.  If it wasn't for the others in my party being so hungry we would have been out of here.  I will update my review after dinner but I am SHOCKED that people of that lack any people skills whatsoever work in a service industry.

The server and other hostess were fantastic.  I am really disappointed with the Claim Jumper chain.  It's the black sheep of the Landry company."}

He was also extremely attentive and made the dinning experience very enjoyable. He introduced a new Club card to us to save money on our next visit and his pitch was so spot I just had to add it on the tab. Make sure to sit in Jeff's section on your next visit you'll be sure to enjoy it..."}
{"text":"Food was actually amazing and our server Samantha (I think) was very nice. However, it took the hostess a while to notice us and when she went to seat us she ran to the table leaving us running after her to catch up. Also, I think Samantha may have given herself an extra $3 tip on our card charge. Our bill was $47 and some change, I left a $10 cash tip. When I looked at my bank account I had a $50 charge. I would have went back and questioned it but we didn't keep our receipt so there wasn't a way to prove it. Mistake on our part, so watch out for that!!!!!"}
{"text":"The wait was 15 minutes long..... we waited with no problem.

We were seated and later greeted by our waitress. 
I asked for water with lemon, and a spicy cilantro margarita.
My guy ordered a Stella.

Our drinks took at least ten minutes to come.

The margarita was awesome.... Worth the wait.
Possibly the best margarita that I have ever had.
However, the Stella was lacking a little...and not as cold as it should have been.

One thing that really WOW'd me, was that they have a \"baby\" plate. 
That I had never seen before, or heard of at any other restaurant. 
And it's complimentary! 

It comes to the table, covered in saran wrap,  with a stick of cheddar cheese, a slice of turkey, apple sauce, and mini orange slices. 

Gourmet, no. But very thoughtful. It kept her busy.

We ordered a BBQ chicken pizza as an appetizer, along with the shrimp with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and slathered in BBQ sauce.

The pizza comes out, and it is the wrong size. That gets sent back.
The shrimp were quite good. I would have liked more cream cheese, and they could have gone a little easier on the BBQ sauce. 

My water was almost gone... Our waitress walked by us at least four times, and didn't refill it.

oh, and did I mention that I was the only one at the table that got water.......? 

When customers are drinking, aren't you suppose to supply water..? Or do these people not watch Bar Rescue.?

One water between the two of us was kind of lame. Between our waitress and the supervisor, they both said that they were \"getting our drinks\" 3 different times... 

Geez. THANK GOD IS WASN'T SUMMER.

We both ordered another round.
My margarita was again, awesome. However, the Stella this time was flat and gross.. The supervisor took it away.

The right size pizza comes out, and we munch on that. It was good, like better than Metro Pizza good. Happy with that. 

Still waiting for water refills.

I ordered the Frisco burger, on grilled sourdough, with thousand island and fires.
My guy ordered the beef ribs with fried Mac and cheese.

When our food finally arrives, I take a bite. Salty.
I take a drink of my water (waiting for ice cubes to melt, at this point).
I take a second bite to make sure that I'm not too loopy.... Still salty.
I pass it off to my guy (who loves salt) to try it. He thinks it's salty too. 

UGH. The fries were good though. Best fries ever.
A bite is taken out of the fried mac and cheese, and it's not hot.

I finally am able to flag down our waitress, and we let her know about the unsatisfying food. We take dessert (red velvet cupcakes) to go.

This was probably the longest dinner experience I have ever had in my life.

The check comes, and even with my over salty burger and the flat, warm beer taken off, our bill is $93. 

Yes, $93. My guy thought I was joking.

Red velvet cupcakes are Ok. Nothing Bundt Cakes has waayy better Red Velvet.

Stick to just drinks and appetizers here. Nothing else is worth it."}
{"text":"I have never ordered something at claim jumper that wasn't delicious. Today I ordered Asian chicken salad for 15.99 thinking it would be delicious. Nope, the ingredients were poor and there was a gallon of dressing on it. My lettuce was swimming in spicy peanut dressing. I couldn't eat the whole thing. Service was great as usual though."}
{"text":"I've been alive and well for a very long time. There are a lot of things that I've seen and done. I've experienced a lot of first time events and I'd like to share one with you all.

Earlier this month, my girlfriend and I visited Las Vegas and we picked up a taxi to take us to Town Square. Our driver was a friendly guy and he mentioned that Town Square was very nice place and that he and his wife always eat at Claim Jumper every time they go. He even made sure to mention that he always orders the meat loaf.

We don't have a Claim Jumper in Hawaii and the name made me instantly curious. We made our rounds at the mall and we stopped in Claim Jumper to have lunch. 

Our server was a friendly guy and he made sure to stop by our table often to check up on us. He made some suggestions about the menu and away we went. This is what we ordered.

-Meatloaf. For the first time, I took a recommendation about food from a taxi driver. This meatloaf was awesome. It was better than my mom's and please don't tell her that. It was juicy, tender and tasty. It came with some awesome mashed potatoes and asparagus. 

-Shrimp stuffed jalapeno. Wow. These guys were huge. And tasty. And awesome. We got the six piece order and should have gotten the four. Someone could easily order the four and have that as a meal. 

-New England Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl. This is what my gf ordered. Now, I\"m not a fan of clam chowder but the one they serve here is pretty damn good. 

The food here is awesome and so is the service. I wish they had one where I live because the menu is so diverse and there's a ton of stuff that I'd love to try. 

So upper management of Claim Jumper if you're reading this, consider it a hint."}
{"text":"I've always heard how large the portions are here so I guess I was imagining these huge plates of food that are impossible to finish in one setting.  I'm not sure if they have scaled back but the portions definitely didn't live up to expectations.  

It is basically like a cheesecake factory with a sprinkle of a miner camp.  

I ordered a calzone with pepperoni and a wedge salad.  The wedge salad was awesome.  Lots of blue cheese, a large piece of chilled iceberg lettuce, balsamic dressing, red onions, and some other stuff I can't remember.  It was really good.  

The calzone was very chewy and greasy.  The sauce was too sweet and the entire entree just didn't do anything but make me think I ordered wrong.  

The service was very slow and the waiter let my glass remain empty for a long time even after I pointed it out to him.  He was nice but the place was half empty and he wasn't on top of it.

If I ever came back here I would probably just stick to the salads and bring a water bottle.  For 50 bucks for 2 before tip I would expect a little more from the food and the service side."}
{"text":"If you want a GIANT salad for about 11 bucks, then this is your place! Good food, but sort of average. When we were there, the AC went out and our meal was comped. Yes... Summer in Scottsdale... You don't want your AC going out, at least not during business hours!"}
{"text":"Went in and sat in the bar area. There were 2 people at the bar and 2 tables of 2. One was done and leaving. We waiting 15 min then ended up leaving. had 1 bus boy tell us he would send someone over when we first got there. Never got any service. While leaving stopped the reception to tell them about our lack of service and she just said well thanks for coming in. No apology. No wonder it was empty."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would.  Worst service I have EVER had.  Waited forever for a waitress that didn't listen to anything we said.  Asked for no croutons on our salad and no lemon in our water and tea.  Guess what we got, you guessed it lemon and croutons.  The kids asked for ketchup with their fries, we got it as we were done eating.  My husband asked for a glass of ice for the ice tea, we never did get it.    Had chicken pot pie and it was so dry I couldn't eat it.  Ribs were burnt.  Waitress was terrible.  We had been there 2 hrs by the time we got our check, and i had to basically yell at her to get that as it had been 15 minutes since we asked for it the first time. No apology, only excuses.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Me and my partner came to eat lunch here and what a huge place. There's tons of seating for group parties and such. Casual acquaintances etc to eat and hang out oh and a bar as well.

We came here at around 2pm and did not see a hostess to seat us. We waited for 5 minutes until one of the waiters greeted us and sat us on a booth. The food was a bit inconsistent. For appetizers, the spinach artichoke dip was amazing. The side salad was bad! It was really soggy and the dressing tasted stale. 

It took an hour to get our entrees! My fish tacos were so oily it sogged the bottom of the foil. Nope not coming back!"}
{"text":"This has been the worst dining experience of my life to be the least. Three and a half hours it took to serve our party of 20. In the first hour and a half I had not even gotten my second drink. Service was dragging to say the least. When the food finally did come out two and half hours after we ordered the majority was cooked wrong and cold. This was called to the managers attention a blonde woman and she was super unprofessional. We watched her talk to our server and roll her eyes then walk over to us and spit out some half ass apology. I'm not sure why it took 30 minutes to get our server to come get a drink order then another 30 minutes to bring the first drink. Then another 20 before they even took our order it went on and on. My gosh it was pathetic. If I wanted to spend 4 hours at a restaurant and spend as much as we did I'd pick one with much better food and reviews."}
{"text":"Far and away the best meal I had in Vegas this trip. I had the club sandwich and it was huge and very tasty. My wife had the meatloaf and it was fantastic! The waiter was helpful and nice. The Keno lady was a bust but what do you expect, I don't think she was a restraint employee so I won't deduct a star. The salad I had with my meal was great and the bread they serve pre meal was perfect. I look forward treating here again."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at Claim Jumper using their wifi writing this review. Like others said, we should have listened to the reviews. We ordered potatoe skins and they were burned. Every bite was the taste of ash. My Cesar salad had 1 little sad crouton.  Ordered my Bone in Ribeye steak Medium Well and outer portion of the stake was great until I got to the middle and bone areas and it was completely Raw! Less than rare! And the Crab mash is disgusting and full of oil. Never again."}
{"text":"Always had good service here! Food is great, portions are HUGE. I always order the entree and take half home for the next day. They serve bread to the table beforehand which is helpful when you have kiddos who are hungry."}
{"text":"We came over for a late meal.
Place clean and host was attentive. Our server was Jay and he was professional and great with details.wife was happy with her sirloin steak and me with my club sandwich."}
{"text":"Somehow this chain charges as much as a fancy steakhouse for some entrees. My two chicken cutlets served over potato cakes and with a bacon tomato sauce was about $20. The other entree was a stuffed baked potato and that was about $14. Both entrees had their moments and were easily edible, but over priced by about $5 each. The entrees were served with soup or salad and they were average, but the free garlic bread thing was excellent and buttery. The ceasar was standard, pre-made and chilled waiting in a refrigerator for customer to order, while the soup had no taste and the potatoes were cut incorrectly which made the soup tough to eat. Chopped would have been better. 
  
   Ok, my main beef with this place was the use of fake or plastic cookies in the display case at the front counter. The cookie in that case looks real and it looks good, almost like a smores cookie. Yep, all those cookies were painted to look good, so when I ordered a cookie to go from the case and it did not look anything like that cookie in the case, I became curious and learned of the fake cookie thing and fake cake too. The cookie was still good, but the one in case looks better, but probably would not have tasted better. Either way, put some real cookies in the case cause it is basically false advertising on this chain's part."}
{"text":"I got a salad to start with. It has old mushrooms on it with chunks of cheese that were sour. My friend ordered the American breakfast and the sausage was raw and the eggs were very dry. The food was not prepared well at all or it was just very old. Very disappointed. Only giving two stars because the waitress is nice."}
{"text":"I like to be greeted by my server, I like to hear them introduce themselves in their very own special way, as most servers have their own type of charm....my server last night did not exist.  I have greeted by a sweet jolly girl who told us she would take our drink orders until our waiter showed up.. Okay, that's fine, he must be busy......(\"The words too busy shouldn't exist in a waitress vocabulary\" Thank you Mr. Pink)

About 5 minutes go by and still no sign of our waiter, which was okay I suppose since we didn't even know what we wanted yet.
Another few minutes and FINALLY he shows up. His intro was \"ARE YOU READY TO EAT?! :D\"
Lol, uhm, okay. So we order the artichoke dip, and after some debate between the Cobb salad and the potato-cheese soup, I chose the soup...thanks to the lady next to us who looked like she was REALLY enjoying her French Onion.

Server leaves. The only time I see him again is when I hear him talking to the other waitstaff about how he can't wait to leave....and then later when he returns our check...douche.

The pretty sweet lady who I wished was my server came and filled our drinks, as our waiter never returned to check on us....

Food came out. Ok, I already knew Claim Jumper was just, meh. But we ate there because it was close and easy....But believe me I won't make that mistake again....

The artichoke dip was gross. We both took about 3 bites from it.  The chips were pretty good though :D.

My soup, had the look and taste of friggin Velveta. VELVETA! Did someone seriously poor Nacho Cheese in my soup? It was horrible. I also loved my garnish of a huge piece of wilting parsley. Mmm.  
The only thing I ate and actually enjoyed was the cheesy bread. OOoh that was some yumminess.

My friend ordered the vegetable soup which was WAY too salty. 

I suppose this isn't the best way to review a business like Claim Jumpers because usually their soups aren't house and are frozen and defrosted...I'm not sure if this is the case..

Either way, the next time we saw our server is when the cutsey little lady asked if we wanted anything else and we asked for the check...she took our card and our waiter returned it and said his good byes. Both of them asked if we wanted boxes, twice, since we pretty much took 3 bites from everything on the table...

I've been to Claim Jumper before, and I suppose that experience was A-OK. But after tonight I will never return. Not worth the time and money."}
{"text":"I took a business associate of mine to lunch here earlier this week. We came in around noon and the place was nearly deserted, 2 maybe 3 tables occupied...WOW! Our server was attentive and friendly but the food wasn't like I remember it being. Everything was good but NOTHING was GREAT. I will say this though...if your hungry, you won't find bigger portions anywhere. My friend ordered the chicken fried chicken and it would have dwarfed TWO regular sized dinner plates, it damn near hid the platters they use as plates. Come hungry but maybe wait for dinner...the steaks on the Menu looked good but also like way too much food for lunch."}
{"text":"We have not been to claim jumper in a few years. I remember when this establishment rocked and was always full. Not so on this Sunday evening. Now I know why. Service was extremely slow which does not make sense for the empty building. Portions used to be huge...not so much any more. Chicken fried steak used to be one of the best I have had...not so much anymore. Dried, over cooked and a smidgen of gravy. mashed potatoes were chunky, lumpy....not anywhere near what I remember...all this for $16.....go to cracker barrel for under $10 and get a better CFS with more fixins. $79 for 2 meals, appetizer and 4 beers....Crazy."}
{"text":"Two adults and two kids walk into Claim Jumper for a birthday dinner.... (Where's the punch line?)

We were sat at a table with no share plates, but we had utensils. She delivered bread (amazing btw) and we still had no share plates. Ordered spinach dip, no share plates. 

Ordered two lemon drop martinis.....(sigh) hold the lemon seeds please!!!! Yes, I am in the industry, but bar tending 101 = know how to make a martini!!!! She placed them on the table and I immediately noticed about 4 lemon seeds at the bottom of my martini, almost looking as a garnish, and one in my friends glass! I state the obvious, about both drinks, and she takes one away to get it fixed. I find it odd that she is suggesting the one drink at a time method, but then again... Maybe she didn't hear me. She brings back mine and says, \"they don't strain them\". lol. YOU THINK??? Then I mention the lonely seed in the other drink, again, and as she reaches for the glass... I just decided to get it out myself with the old straw technique. 

On to the entrees....
I ordered the jambalaya pasta which came out looking completely different than the menu picture. It was like a soup with a ton of noodles on top. That being said, the noodles were extremely bland with no seasoning what so ever. Plain noodles. The sausage.... No flavor. So... I pretty much ate the shrimp on the plate and sent it back. My friend ordered some kind of bow tie pasta that I tasted... And although she ate it, I've had better at Olive Garden. Maybe we didn't pick the right dishes to order... Or maybe they need help on their menu. 

I mentioned this was a birthday dinner. I mentioned that when I made the reservation, and the host obviously never told the server. The kids and I mentioned it was their moms birthday, and when she brought out the birthday cupcake... She didn't know who she was bringing it for. She tried to give it to the kids. Lmao

(Sigh) That is all"}
{"text":"Been here several times pretty much just to go have few drinks at the bar. I've been noticing that the times that I have ordered I have either had a miss order by them not sending out an appetizer or that the order was partially incorrect. While I was there they gave me a spicy chicken wings which I can't eat and the last time was he didn't bring the appetizers at all out to our table. The waiter did apologize and offered us a extremely huge chocolate cake to take home for free. That was a nice treat. But I must say the food is very good and Atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"To start, do not come here if you have a small stomach. What everyone says is true, you really will not be jumping at claim jumpers as you may break your ankles due to the weight you gain after eating here. 

To start, we go here at least once or twice a week every week. We always sit in the bar and have become regulars so just a shout out to the awesome bar staff Lina, Johnny and Vince. You guys are all awesome and if you ever go to the bar at claimjumpers, make sure they are bartending and you will be well taken care of. 

As for the size of the food...it's all huge and I can never finish my meal much to the annoyance of my boyfriend...I got their Motherlode Sandwich once and I will never get it again. This sandwich seriously lasted me for the next 3 days. It's about 7 inches tall due to the 16 oz of meat inside of it. That is a 4 person meal in itself. The only thing I have been able to finish to date is their giant baked potato which is huge and comes loaded with chicken, zuchinni and squash in it covered in cheese, they also give you a side dish of alfredo cheese as well. 

The deserts are also huge! The cheesecake here is to die for and if you eat enough of it, it probably will kill you. The slices are about 4 inches tall and come with handmade whipped cream and chocolate chips normally. The apple caramel cheesecake is also delicious but to filling. 

My boyfriend really enjoys their chips and salsa as they make the salsa there. They have two different kinds though, ask for the fire roasted salsa, it's spicy but delicious. Also he loves their seared ahi (I hate fish).

Over all, it is a bit pricey but you most certainly get what you pay for here. Also the interior is beautiful, it's like a lodge for gold miners. I would highly suggest going during happy hour at the bar if you're going to drink as drink prices are cheaper and appetizers are half off. It's 3-7 pm."}
{"text":"Let's just say, when you have good food, good service, and good atmosphere, you have a great experience!

Shout out to Marcie, our waitress! She was awesome, and very friendly. Top notch in my books!"}
{"text":"I will start this off by saying do not EVER go to Claim Jumpers for a special occasion.  I realize that last night was Valentine's Day and they would be a little slow but they were terrible in handling the rush.  We made reservations for 8 pm and the hostess said that would be fine on the phone.  We arrive at 750 and did not get seated until 9:15.  I really do not understand the purpose of making reservations if you will not be seated and hour and 15 minutes after your reservation.  I also had my son with me which made the wait longer in a sense.  As i asked the manager who was on duty and the hostess what the situation was during our wait, they continued to give me the run around and had no idea how they were going to handle the situation for anyone.  We had a party of 4 people and 1 child and they could not find a table, yet they continued to seat parties of 2.  Whoever was in charge of seating did a poor job of making space.  The manager or whoever was at the front along with the hostess was very rude and did not seem to want to be there.  I understand it can be a tough job at times, but it is their job and if you are going to be in that line of business you need to understand what it requires.   Once we were seated they basically stuffed us in a both knowing we had two children with us.  Just very disappointed and bothered with the service early.  When we walked to the back there were 4 empty 4 top tables that would have been perfect for our group.   So when it was all said and done we were there from 7:50 pm to 10:30 pm. Not good for a kid on a school night or for people that need to get up early the next day for work.    

With that said, the waitress on the other hand was great and really tried to make up for lost time.  The food came faster than the time it took us to sit down. The food was amazing and in very big portions.  I really want to go back during a slower time and enjoy myself (don't know if I will). It was my first experience and now I know why.  It is very hard to enjoy a meal waiting two hours with kids that are hungry.  We will see what transpires.  Like I said I am not downing the food nor is the waitress, my concern with how they are being run during special events and rush hours."}
{"text":"I usually receive good service at this location. The food is reliably delicious (if you like the type) and it is kept well cleaned."}
{"text":"I Always dine at the bar. 
Go there about once a month.
One of the bartenders on afternoon shift is the best service you can get. Fast on drinks and knows how to make a killer whiskey sour. Great food portions are huge. But well worth the money. Little pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This service at this establishment is subpar. 
My parents and i went to this location for lunch and the hostess was polite and seated us 3. We sat for about 10 min before a server came over to take our drink order. I peeped my head up to see if they were on the way, no one. Someone finally came over and we ordered 3 beverages non alcoholic  hot tea, iced tea, and a diet cola and it took her over 15 min before she came, the restaurant was practically empty all of 4 other tables were also looking for their servers. I told the hostess not to worry about our beverages and that we were going elsewhere, that the wait time for beverages was completely unacceptable and she said OKAY, in a sarcastic tone. I wouldn't recommend being a single loved one to this establishment. Take someone here you plan on breaking up with! Perfect beginning for a shitty service"}
{"text":"Service was slow in the beginning, French onion soup is gross, and the salad was soggy. Our dinner were amazing though! The Shrimp Trio was SO good!! Best aparagus ever!"}
{"text":"Stopped for early dinner. Server was Donnie. Top shelf food and the service was exceptional. We hadn't eaten here before but will be back. Some really great food. We had soup, wedge salad and a burger and fries. All superb. The cheese bread is very tasty."}
{"text":"They have the best Sourdough Soup Bowls! The Potato cheese is delicious. Their burger and fries are pretty good too. And if you love desserts, this place is for you. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on December 30. Traveling on south side of Phoenix and decided to eat here as we don't have one near us on North side. Wife and the Chicken Pot Pie which was hugh and delicious. Lots of chicken and pastry. I had the wedge salad which was excellent and the ribs were great."}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe this restaurant is in the same family as Mastro's.  Granted, I wasn't expecting anything near Mastro's, but this was worse than fast food.  Margaritas are on special- wow apparently your bartender doesn't know the difference between margarita mix and sweet and sour.  Sent it back and tried the \"house IPA\".  Worst beer I've ever reviewed on Untapped.  We went simple with the appetizer sampler.  Cause for concern when your food comes out in under 4 minutes- yes, because it's all pre-maid and sitting around waiting to be served.  Never visiting this or any other restaurants in the Landry's chain.  The operator and franchisor should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Can't say Claim Jumper was our first choice but I'm glad we ended up eating here. Darin was our server and provided exceptional service. He was attentive, professional, and genuine. He even managed to sneak up on my boyfriend to give him a birthday dessert. If you go to Claim Jumper, try to get Darin!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 20 or more and they did an excellent job of hosting my nieces 20th birthday- I couldn't of asked for better service!! The prices were with in reason and the portions were enormous!! The children's menu sizes were as big as the adults!! Thank you for the amazing service tonight"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We had a variety of appetizers and all different selection of dishes. 
Our waitress was very nice and kept making sure our large group was satisfied. This is my 1st time at this location and just as the rest in town, beautiful clean atmosphere, not too loud and very calm, which is great when you are meeting up for meetings or want a quiet setting. 
They have some really good garlic cheese bread and very flavorful tropical ice tea.
Just a little heads up. . . . location is kind of confusing just because its in a corporate center and if you miss the turn you might just hit the free way so be careful."}
{"text":"Good service, they got the two stars for service. Terrible food! I would not recommend coming here. The scrambled eggs tasted like buffet eggs. Gross! We got old fruit and stale toast."}
{"text":"I usually never venture out to Avondale, but my friends dragged me to Claim Jumper last night.  First off, the restaurant is massive and very wooden.  It felt like a fancy cafeteria with a few sprinklings of Gold Rush era flair.  Our server was attentive, but a bit nervous.  The menu was unwielding.  My friend and I split the zucchini spears which were panko breaded.  I liked them, but wished the spears were thinner and the ranch dipping sauce was thicker.  For dinner, I enjoyed the meatloaf sandwich.  It was stellar.  Melted cheese, bbq sauce, aioli, and buttery grilled bread.  Overall, my experience was good, but not a 20 minute drive good.  If you live in Avondale or close by, then definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"YUM! Went here around 10 after seeing a movie. I haven't been here for a few years and it was my boyfriends first time. It was still as good as I remembered!

Our server was really great. He recommended some things off of the menu that we decided to try. We ordered the spinach dip, tenderloin tips, and baby back ribs. Everything was awesome. The tenderloin was perfectly tender, ribs had a great sauce, and even the French fries had tons of flavor. 

Will definitely be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Service is very slow here and the servers are not welcoming at all. Most of the servers are older ladies who look so absentminded. We were waiting for someone to order but the waiter didn't come. So we asked a lady who was counting condiments on the tables. She replied \"no, I don't do that\".
I tried the baby back ribs for lunch, some how the taste of the barbecue source stayed in my mouth 
Until night."}
{"text":"Ate at bar , happy hour bottle beer $4.00, ordered tri tip beef sandwich, thier version of French dip, vert good, tender and flavourful,  all employees friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I tend to stay away from chains.  I don't know what had gotten into me.  I wanted a steak.  I wanted large portions.  I wanted $10 spinach artichoke dip.  I wanted good service.  I wanted GREAT FOOD!  

Fortunately I almost got it all.  Fortunately.  For some reason the proverbial glass was half full last night.  If not for our waitress being a complete angel I could have easily lost it.

The meal was pretty much perfect.  The main complaint was the inability of the kitchen to put out a medium cooked tri tip.  The first one they put out was served rare and well done.  Our poor waitress had obviously had to put with these sort of things alot and was visibly shaken.  I cannot stress enough how awesome our waitress was and quickly reminded her that we appreciated her efforts.

The second tri tip that came out was rare, Med rare and medium.  At this point I said fack it and just enjoyed the rest of my meal.

We then got visit from the manager, a charming gentleman with a shaved head.  We were shocked when he revealed to us he was well versed in the lost art of customer service.  What a Guy.  He understood that his kitchen was stinking up the joint and that we wouldn't be paying a dime for the kitchens mistakes.  

Normally I would not make a statement as bold as this but...

Our waitress Jodie and the shaved head gentleman running the joint are directly responsible for earning Claim Jumper a few new customers for life.  What a breath of fresh air to be treated like a paying customer.  ;)

Thanks Jodie and shaved head dude.  You're both bright lights in an otherwise dark night.  Stay gold......"}
{"text":"I must say I was blown away by this restaurant! The food was phenomenal. I had the clam chowder for starters and the garlic cheese bread, which was the best bread I've tasted from a restaurant in a while. 

For dinner I had the Pasta dish with Parmesan shrimp and pasta and it was amazing. Although, I was almost full from the chowder, I couldn't stop eating the pasta. I was so full and had enough food for another meal the following day. My mother ate the pot pie and it was stuffed all the way to the top (not full of air), and the crust was delicious.

I even snuck a bite of the meatloaf our friend ordered and the flavors were great! The beef and pork mixture really rocks. Only thing I didn't try was the famous chocolate cake which is massive! But I'll be making a special trip back just to try that Food Network worthy dessert! 

Great service, awesome staff, will be returning."}
{"text":"My first time here. Food was good. Service was great our server Tyler did a great job. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Came here since I was staying at the hotel down the road. Ended up at the bar most nights. They have their own beer, which is cool, but it isn't the best ever. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was in the neighborhood I would go back."}
{"text":"I went into the bar at 12:15 asked to have the Angel game put in the TV. I ate lunch sat there with no drink refill, left at 12:50 they still didn't put the game on. I was the only person in the bar! Pathetic service"}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Our waitress Brooklyn was great! We ordered the porterhouse steak cooked to perfection  definitely coming back soon"}
{"text":"A place that I would like to frequent more than I have. The food is very good but the portions are so large that I feel I need to bring my family to make it whorthwhile. Everything is jumbo sized as if it were being served to Paul Bunyan. I usually enjoy their clam chowder and still think it is one of the best I've ever had. I also enjoy having their slab of ribs. And to wash it down, get from friends to share the mother lode chocolate cake. You may feel like you have succumbed to gluttony, which is why we only come here every so often. If we came every week I literally would be the size of Paul Bunyan."}
{"text":"Most likely won't be returning. This is based on food quality and price. Bread is very salty and food did not stand out. I ordered the rotisserie chicken and fiance ordered the 2 entree special. Total with drinks came out to $60. Portions are quite large. Environment is very classy and clean."}
{"text":"Stopping for lunch with a group of four. The portions are massive and the food is low on salt and heat. But the ingredients, while uninspired were fresh. The Thai slaw was good. Service was friendly. Definitely an older crowd."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here was really great. My wife and I both got the rib eye steak.  The steaks were prepared at a perfect medium.   I can't say enough good things about this place . Both steaks were cooked to perfection they were soft, tender had a wonderful sear to them and had  great meat flavor. They were delicious and melted in your mouth. 

The staff was super attentive the entire staff was impeccably hospitable. I must note that the service here is amazing. Everyone was so kind and accomodating and our server constantly checked on us. From beginning to end we had an exceptional experience.

For dessert we split a slice of Motherlode Cake. The Motherlode a six layer slice of decadent chocolate cake and rich chocolate fudge icing topped with walnuts. This cake was featured on the Food Network as one of America's \"Top 5 Most Decadent Desserts\" It was the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted.  It is rich in flavor but not overbearing with chocolate.  Perfect balance of sweetness & flavor,  Not dry & not over moist.  The \"slice\" was huge. It was so big we brought a lot of it home for another day.  

FOOD: Everything is so incredibly delicious, tender, juicy, seasoned and cooked perfectly and so flavorful. The meat was tender and buttery that the FIRST BITE WAS HEAVEN. Both were seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Compliments to the chef for that!  PRICE: Typical steakhouse pricing. SERVICE: Spectacular service - from the hostess upon arrival, to our wonderful servers throughout our meal! It was delightful -- unobtrusive, yet still engaged, informed and friendly, CONCLUSION: Food absolutely amazing! (Portions are big, we couldn't finish ours and we didn't even order any appetizer as we really wanted to savor the steak RETURN  FACTOR: 100%.

{"text":"Wow. what a complete disappointment.  Awful service,  cafeteria level food... so bad. 
Our server was pretty terrible, the drinks just as bad - when we finally got them.  Embarrassing I even ate here, I should know better. Was being lazy about driving - but could have had better food at McDonalds. Brought it up to manager ( who based on these reviews has his days cut out for him) who took my check - with my credit card and disappeared!!!! Lolzzzz!  He never had the balls to come back to our table, had the server come back and pretend nothing was up. My own fault for even considering this place at all.  so gross."}
{"text":"This place use to have 5 stars and now it can't even deserve one star. Let me star by saying if you go out to eat at a restaurant you expect for everyone to get there food at the same time so you can eat together as a family, not so you have to eat while someone in your party waits to get there food while everyone else eats cause at this point we are starving after waiting an hr for our food !!!!!! Keep in mind 2 adults and 3 children. So my husband order steak and shrimp, as soon as he gets his plate put down first thing he see is a big black hair in the mash potatoes. We show the server the hair she grabs it say I'll be rite back, she walked toward her manager and the manager then takes the plate goes to the back doesn't come back till about 3 mins to tell us don't worry I took care of it I'm making you a new one. Walks away does not say sorry does not ask if we need anything. At this point me and my husband are so fed up with the rudeness and the way they attend this situation. It's hair not nice to have on your food in a restaurant. Ten minutes pass and the steak is still not out at this point we want nothing and just want to leave are bill was $80 you tell me where the she took care of it part was ? Ridiculous Olive Garden had done way better job with managers apologies and come to the table rite away and talk to us and make you feel better . Not this place I will never come here even if the have my favorite soup. So upset of how they handle their situations like this and the manger should most defiantly not have this position ."}
{"text":"Good chain bar/restaurant.  I went there for lunch and had bar apps. Tasty but a little pricey.  I definitely would go here after work for a happy hour or if I need to go somewhere that has a menu that everyone in the family could get something from."}
{"text":"So I have been to Claim Jumper four times in the four years I have lived here.  Every time I have went here, the food has been hot garbage.  I still cannot figure out why people like this place?

I've had their pasta, their fish & chips, their chicken and probably a salad and every time I ate their food, I want to vomit.  The funny thing?  My husband has been here probably five times and every time he runs home to go to the bathroom.

Yes, their portions are huge.  Its very \"old-fashion family style food\" would be the best way to explain it.  But to me, it does not taste fresh at all.

We went here last night (that was my fourth and final time I will ever go to Claim Jumper) their soda was completely flat. gross.  They tried to get us non-flat soda, but it didn't work.  

We started with their \"famous\" cheese bread.  Nothing famous about this.  And it came with a marinara sauce.  The waitress came to clear the table and said \"weird... that sauce looks really pasty\"  ewww!  My husband ordered the pork tenderloin, with mashed potatoes and stuffing.  Disgusting.  He ate most of it, but he was starving, but it didn't look good.  I had the fish & chips- batter was horribly thick, to the point that i could easily take off the batter and just eat the fish.

We woke up this morning promising each other that we would never go there again."}
{"text":"I haven't been disappointed in a Restaurant like this in a loooooong time! We went here for lunch, and you could tell everyone there hated their job. The hostess was blah, and our waitress was nice, but disappeared for 45 min after we got our food! Then when we finally found her she made us wait another 19 min to bring us the check then another 15 to bring us our change. When we finally got our change she only brought us 5 dollar bills (no ones) to ensure we'd leave a larger tip. (This is our biggest let peive!) so annoying. Also if you are in a wheelchair like me... It's annoying when the place is empty and they want to sit you in the middle of a room of tables. It's hard for us to get through all the chairs. Why can you seat us on the side where it's much more convenient? Duh? Also the have made many changes to the menu, and don't make a lot of the stuff we like any more (like the delish garlic cheese toast). We had a bad experience last time we went too, but decided to give em one more chance. Won't be back again! Don't waste your time or money on this place!"}
{"text":"They did something different to the zuchinni which isnt as good as it used to be but not bad on the happy hour menu.  Hubby upset they took his fav newcastle off tap."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for the very first time today 1/19/2017. I ordered the meatloaf and mashed potatoes it came with a side of vegetables. The vegetables also came with a small roach on top. At first I thought it was something else perhaps part of the grilled onions. I had my boyfriend take a look. He turned it over and sure enough there were legs We were shocked. I was able to quickly flag down our server and showed her she made some remark like \"oh no\" and called her manager over. The manager Lauren Dawson came over and introduced herself as the \"manager\" she never once gave us her name we had to request for her to come back and had to ask her for it. She treated us like she was inconvenienced. Like she wanted us to leave like this was no big deal. She asked if we wanted her general manager to come over. Really? Why do we have to ask? Why didnt she come over from the get go? Is this the way people are treated when they find a bug in their food. My boyfriend didn't even eat a quarter of his meal because he immediately lost his appetite. We waited 30 minutes before we finally got our food then to have this experience! We were treated horribly by Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"I'm used to the Claim Jumper in LA that is ah-may-zing. I talked this place up to my boyfriend who had never been and it was truly a disappointment. 

First of all our waiter wasn't the friendliest. He kept cutting us off midway through our order to hold on and would run to the back. There was only one other couple there so it's not like he was busy. 

When we asked him for menu suggestions he advised us that he was a vegetarian that ate fish and chicken and couldn't give us many suggestions 

When we put in our drink order came back with one of the drinks and he told us that the bartender was just sent home to catch a flight and the remaining staff only knew how to make one of the two drinks we ordered. It would have been nice if they could have let us order a round before the bartender was cut especially because we asked for the drink menu. 

When I ordered my steak he asked how I wanted it cooked. I said however the chef recommends and he has the nerve to insinuate that the chefs were Hispanic and liked things over cooked and I said the chef that created the menu not the line cooks. Nevertheless I asked for a medium rare steak and got a well done steak instead. 

Truly disappointing and not like the claim jumper I'm used to for a meal that cost us over $100."}
{"text":"Food was good, we actually had their lunch special while there. The service is another story. When we walked in, the girl who was upfront, was on the phone. Looked at us and continued talking. It was about 5 minutes before someone from the back actually came up and sat us at our table... the girl upfront, still on the phone. It took another 5 minutes before we were acknowledged by our waitress. It also took a while before we got our food but every we asked for something, we were waiting on it. They need to work on their customer service skills seriously"}
{"text":"Well this was my second time eating here and I have realized that this restaurant is poorly managed. After reading previous reviews, it's clear that some of these people don't have experience working in the food industry, because the empty tables with a long wait time has to do with the amount of servers working at the time. 
I didn't have a problem with the seating, however, the service was unacceptable. As a former town square Tommy Bahama restaurant employee, I am well aware of the customer service that a thriving and growing restaurant is capable of providing. 
     I came in on Friday February 3 around 9:15 for happy hour. We sat in the bar, which was pretty empty for a Friday night. There was a few two-tops and one couple seated at the bar. The female bartender was a woman with long dark hair and the managers were two middle-aged men with short dark hair. They almost seemed to be floor supervisors to me--due to their lack of professionalism and attention to guests being served undercooked food.  I ordered the pulled pork street tacos and the fried pickles and peppers plate. After ordering drinks, my boyfriend and I moved to a table because we wanted some privacy. We were now seated at a high top table closer to the main entrance of the restaurant but still in the bar area. After moving to the table, the female bartender didn't come to our table at all. Not even once. We asked Peter the super cool busser for bread which he brought immediately and it was great! We had to keep asking the male bartender who looked like he had already been cut and closing up, for anything we needed. The food runner brought out our food and my pickles and peppers plate was very hot-which indicated to me that it had been sitting in the expo window for a while. So I'm guessing the expo line must not have had their tickets in order because my street tacos plate was cool and seemed to be freshly plated. So after receiving our food we felt much Better. My boyfriend ordered the widow maker burger and it was delicious!! Great price during happy hour. 
     So I began eating my pickles which were amazing at first. I found a fried orange slice in the mix so I was confused and began digging through the plate to find out if it was intentionally cooked in the dish(which it was) and I just set them aside because I wasn't interested in eating a fried orange slice(peel as well) and I immediately lost my appetite after completely examining my dish. I found an orange and pickle stuck together in a big chunk so I broke them apart with my fork. The orange had a hunk about an inch thick of raw fry batter. Obviously food-borne illnesses is not something I take lightly.  As I said before, the female bartender didn't come back to our table at all, so my boyfriend decided to get up and bring the plate to the bar. He told the bartender what we found and she said \"oh ok, do you want me to have them make you another one?\" Which obviously, I'm not in the mood for after just almost eating raw batter. So we told her to just take it off of our bill. Which she did, after she went over to the expo line and spoke with the two managers for about five minutes. Then all three of them came walking back to the bar-the female went up to the register and the two male managers stood outside the bar and spoke to her for about ten minutes before anyone acknowledged the issue at hand. I figured a manager would come and talk with us about the raw food we were just served, but they continued to talk with her and laugh and joke around and it seemed as if they were so consumed in her that neither of them thought it was necessary to come speak to us about our meal. 
     Finally I sent my boyfriend up to the bar AGAIN to tell her we wanted our check. She agreed and brought us the check. After talking it over with my boyfriend, we decided that she does not deserve a tip due to the lack of customer service and attentiveness. If she had been attentive and helpful and concerned with our meal we would have thought differently. She didn't seem to care at all and the kitchen obviously has issues and the management(supervisors or actual managers) couldn't even recognize a serious health hazard, (which will be reported to the health department) or even offer a simple apology. For this- I feel very sorry for the team at the Claim Jumper Town Square restaurant.  I'm sure none of the management team will recognize this review because they didn't seem to care about our entire situation last night. Try getting a bartender with a brain or a management/supervisory team that cares more about the customers than trying to flirt with their own employee all night."}
{"text":"A good place to indulge in some comfort food and a huge piece of chocolate cake. We took our friend out to Claim Jumpers to celebrate his new job. We really enjoyed our food, the service was fast, and the resturant was cleanly. My absolute favorite part of the visit was dessert. We got the massive chocolate fudge cake to share between us (and still had left overs) it was a nice experience with some yummy comfort food."}
{"text":"OK food and OK service for OK prices, there are far better places to choose.

{"text":"Absolutely terrible service and prices that are insane, essentially Dennys food for triple the price!"}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars if I could.  The reason why it is not 4 stars is because I found Famous Dave's which serves way better ribs.  The wait for this place was LONG.  We waited about 45min to be seated...but it is partly our fault for not making a reservation.  The food is pretty good and with really good portions.  Our fav is their apple cinnamon muffin...mmm...yum!

*Service = pretty nice
*Ribs = good but tough sometimes
*Apple Cinnamon Muffin......SO GOOD!
*Cherry Coke = they actually put in cherry syrup in it.
*Price = good
*Atmosphere = interesting"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this restaurant chain. I was very pleased to see a Gluten Free menu, yay! Also, they have great happy hour prices and some relatively healthy options. I liked the atmosphere in the bar area, which is where we dined. I always like a large long bar with plenty of seating as well as table options. 
The food I ordered was tasty and service was efficient, fast and pleasant. 
The area I was in seemed clean and organized and the restroom followed suit. 
I would like to come back here with my happy hour peeps to give it another try."}
{"text":"Great food!! Service was a tad slow but other than that good was excellent. Ordered the tenderloin tips and the brownie finale for dessert! Was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my opinion of this place has changed and after the last two visits, my family and I will not be returning.    The quality has gone way down.   Very expensive for a  low quality meal.   Two dishes had to be sent back from our table as they were terrible.   What a shame because it used to be really good (when I wrote my 1st review in 2015).  They also took the best fish dish off the menu, the tilapia.   Too many other places out there to give them another try."}
{"text":"Attention, people: stop going to places like Claim Jumper. This particular location is the Heartbreak Hill of those ubiquitous thirty page menu chains, where no dish is executed well or particulary delicious.

May the list commence: An aloof waitress who forgot my drink order until I reminded the girl who brought our food out; a hamburger with a stale bun not cooked to order; a cold baked potato; wings that had a fishy taste to them; oh, and our food came out in ten minutes. Do you know the only way that miraculous feat was accomplished? A microwave. Trust me, you can tell.

Enough with these big, \"hearty\" portions of shit food. Shit food is exactly that. If you must go to a place like Claim Jumper, make it TGI Fridays. Their happy hour never ends and at least their burgers aren't microwaved."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken salad was different, but very delicious, but the service was(how to explain) unsatisfactory. I was enjoying my plate and attempting to finish it all. The server comes around the corner and asks if I was done. I did not have half a second to answer and he just took the plate from the table. I was very shocked! I felt as he hated his job and so did the other male servers around the restaurant. My experience here was not enjoyable! I'd go to any other restaurant in town square, but this one ever again."}
{"text":"Service here is very slow. I had a fish combination plate and it tasted like it was FULL of sodium. Not impressed. I hear the ribs are pretty tender, but that's not enough for me to ever want to go back and eat there again."}
{"text":"So out of the blue our Boss who was celebrating a birthday along with two other coworkers within the same week says were all going out to lunch, he didn't get any arguements from me! I figured it would be one of are usual spots, but to my surprise he said  we were going to Claim Jumpers.
From the moment were walked in we were quickly greated by the hostest with the mostest, he was funny & friendly and laughed at my inability to count to 4.
Mike our waiter was friendly, and took great care of our table. I ordered their infamous pot pie and was not disappointed. It was way too much food but tasted so good it was difficult to resist pushing myself into a food coma. I snuck by the counter and quietly mentioned it was a three people bday lunch and before crazy birthday surprises could commence my team decided it was time to go. Before we could get out the door the hostess with the mostest and waiter were bagging up baked birthday to go treats. 
Great customer service goes a long way.... thanks for helping us celebrate! 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is over priced comfort food. They do give huge portions, but I don't think that justifies the prices. I would never go here without a gift card. It just so happens my MIL gave us a gift card for Christmas, so off we went on New Year's Day for lunch. 

It was not busy at all and we were seated within 5 minutes. We started with the onion rings as an appetizer. They came out super fast, but I soon found out why. They didn't fry them long enough so they were still partly raw. I didn't care for them but my boyfriend said they were okay so we just left it alone. 
For our meals I ordered the chopped steak and he ordered the chicken friend steak with the potato cakes on the side. His meal came with a soup or salad and he chose the potato cheese soup. That soup was bomb. It had great flavor. Looking back at the menu, I realized I should have gotten a soup or salad with my meal also. Our server was off in lala land so it's no surprise she forgot. 

Our food took a bit longer than expected. I was surprised since the half raw onion rings came out so fast. When the food finally came, it was good but nothing special. The chopped steak comes with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and grilled onions with a demi glace, but there was hardly any demi glace on my plate. It was really tasty, but I just wish there was more because most of my meal was dry. The cfs was okay also. My favorite part of his meal was the potato cakes. They have cheese inside they are freaking delicious. After all was said and done our bill was $51. Luckily our gift card was for $50. But see how ridiculous that is? $50 for 2 people for mediocre food and service? Not cool.

Yelp 2015 Review #4"}
{"text":"So out of all the places I could choose, I chose this place for my Birthday dinner.  BIG MISTAKE!  The place was not busy, and we were seated immediately.  We ordered drinks, mine was sloushed over the rim leaving a sticky residue on the glass...and that was just the beginning.

BUG OUT
Yes you read that correctly.....there was a bug in my husbands salad.  We alerted management who assured us that our steaks would be perfect.

Oh how WRONG that was.   I ordered med. rare, my husband med.  This was switched around.  I was willing to eat his larger perfect for me steak, but my sweet potato was lukewarm at best.  And this didn't as the manager took both plates away even before iItold her about the potato
Round 2, his was fine, but mine well done.  

We ended up walking out."}
{"text":"I just took my son and daughter to this restaurant tonight I've eaten there before over a year ago and food was pretty good they've change the menu however tonight we sat down the manager status gave us a free appetizer because of the situation then she told us she was going to give us the best waiter that waiter came and sauce got us our drinks and never came back for over an hour!

Then on top of that when we are about ready to walk out of the restaurant the food came all three of us ate our dinner and left and we all went to our homes and called each other within 20 minutes and we all had food poisoning and sick

I am never going back to this restaurant employees are rude inconsiderate
Food was horrible.. Asparagus was old hard and overcooked and my daughter ordered salmon which was old and smelled old and was dry horrible horrible!!"}
{"text":"The Claim Jumper in the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas is a very good medium priced dining experience.  I recommend the Chicken Pot Pie.  It ended up being a big meal for me!  The servers were very attentive.  I recommend visiting this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We don't come here too often, but my BF absolutely loves their chocolate cake.
We had dinner last Saturday, and as usual, the service was great, the food very tasty and the portions huge as always.
The only difference was that I left my credit card by mistake; when I called to ask if I indeed had left it there, the manager confirmed it and assured me that it was being held in their safe. I had no issues with any 'funny' charges and they returned safe and sound.
I really appreciated that :)"}
{"text":"4 stars for our server Dylan. He was super cool and funny. I ordered the chop steak with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions in a peppercorn demi glace with mashed potatoes. The chop steak was SO SALTY! The demi-glace was delicious though. I really think that sauce made the meal come together. I was just disappointed how salty my steak was. I'm not a person who returns stuff, because I don't want my food messed with, so I just ate it without complaint. My bf ordered the chicken fried steak and it was HUGE. He is a big eater, but he couldn't even finish that. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, a burger and meatloaf. One thing to mention is they are no longer selling garlic bread. Instead, they bring a medium size roll with a marinara sauce brushed on top. It was ok, but nothing special. 

I ordered the motherlode cake for dessert for all of us to share and that was amazing. Super chocolatey, decadent and rich. Yum. I would come back to this Claim Jumper, but I would order something different."}

My Husbsnd and I order chicken wings for appetizer ask for them to be extra crispy and they were under done  so of course we sent them back next we order our food my Husbsnd chicken fried steak was dry and nasty so sad my dog would not eat this food so my Husbsnd  order the carrot cake to go and our waiter forget had us waited for over 30 mins for a dam carrot cake to go and when the cake came It did not look like everyone else cake big It was small little cake . When been going  here for the past 4 years and today I decided I will not  go back bad customer service waited to long  and customer Service suck so guess what  u lost me as a good customer will never come back  so sad I really use to like this place will  not recommend to anyone and please don't try and call me or email me there nothing u can do change my mind u suck and I hope the manger read this cause she walk right pass us and did not ask how was our services with her fake old clip board on her hand who dose that ? I guess bad customer Service and food and bad services"}
{"text":"Prices have gone up, menu has gone down, no more salad bar, service was very good but service can't overcome the excessive cost for food that's just ordinary."}
{"text":"Can't give 0 stars so have to give 1.

Avoid avoid avoid. Total disaster!! Slow service. Incompetent management.

I suggest you to to Yard House instead."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Always great service. I have also had food delivered from them!  Great food my favorite thing  is pot pie!"}
{"text":"By far the worst Claim Jumper location I've ever been to- not because of the food, but because of their management and service. 

I came here with a party of 5 after finding out that Yard House was a madhouse. Haha. We were told that there would be a 45 minute wait here, which I was okay with considering it was around the holidays. However, when the hostess led us to the table, I looked around the restaurant, to find more than half of the tables empty. I furious. We waited 45 minutes for what?

On top of that, our waiter was absentminded and forgot a lot of basic things that we had to keep asking him for. We asked him three times for more bread, and he never got back to us. We had to ask another waiter, only to find that they were still in the oven. 

It's a shame that their management and customer service were utter disappointment, because we actually really enjoyed all our dishes. I can't see myself giving this place more than a 1 star, only because I felt completely misled by the management thinking that we were waiting for 45 mins because all the tables were full."}
{"text":"First of all, heed my advice and don't come here.

In the past, I used to like to take people to Claim Jumper when it was in Scottsdale. The food was always good and we always had a good time. I was sad when this location closed. I thought that the Tempe spot would be good. Wow, how things have changed for the worse!

I took my Mom here for Sunday dinner and boy was I embarrassed. My mother ordered a vegetarian stuffed potato (allegedly, one of the menu \"favorites\"). The potato was obviously reheated in the microwave because it was unevenly cooked and burned in spots. The \"roasted vegetables\" had cold spots and were needless to say, undercooked. The cheese on the top was melted but wasn't warm. The potato was dry and the toppings just didn't help make it taste good.

I ordered meatloaf. I received two small slivers of meatloaf. They were not very warm either. I had the same problem with the \"roasted vegetables\" that my mother did and my mashed potatoes were ice cold. I told the waitress about the mashed potatoes and she brought me a small plate of mashed potatoes that were clearly over nuked. The best part of the meal was the Diet Coke.

Including tip, this meal cost $38.00. Shame on you, Claim Jumper!"}
{"text":"We walked in to a not busy restaurant and decided to eat on the saloon side to have the happy hour menu. We waited at least 5 minutes and finally I went back to the hostess at the counter and asked if someone would be over to bring a menu, she said yes, but a few moments later, she brought them over to help get us started. 

We waited another 5 to 10 minutes with still no server. I stood up several times trying to find someone and the third time the server saw me. Why is there no system of notifying a server when some is sat down? 

Food was just ok. Drinks were decent. Server was nice. 

The local yelp! reviews noted the same issues but I thought it was isolated but, it appears to be the norm. Disappointed in the overall experience so we won't go back."}
{"text":"Food is typical American but they definitely make you drool as you walk in and are approached with the case of desserts. Large menu for lunch and dinner and cozy lodge like atmosphere. Great for big groups, and they do offer a kids menu. This location has. Weird fly problem though! But every server we've had when coming here has always been nice. My favorite menu item is the Chinese chicken salad and the coconut shrimp."}
{"text":"Had a great experience eating dinner with family at this location last night! I can't recall the gentleman's name who served us but he has a heavy accent if that helps describe him. He was attentive and always made sure we had what we needed. The food was great too!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my last review of this establishment,
Stopped in after a long day was looking for a couple of cocktails and some dinner. 
This time did not reflect our past visits here, waiter was super busy and service was not as great as it could have been. 
After placing my order and waiting 35 minutes out comes my burger it was not as I had requested.
Tried to flag waiter down for ten solid minutes before he came over.
I explained what was wrong and he said sorry it was his fault and he would order a new burger.
This burger came out in five minutes and dropped in front of me. After requesting that a different waiter send over the manager, my waiter came by to ask about my burger.
The Manager was nice and she did remove the burger off my check but nothing else. After two hours, I had two drinks and some chips no dinner... Sucks"}
{"text":"Breakfast. Food was not warm, portions are big but that's no fun when it's cold to begin with. Service was atrocious. Our waitress couldn't even get the beverage order straight for 5 people. Forgot our to go order. Then completely disappeared for 25 minutes. We couldn't get our check and ended up having to get the maitre d to get out of the place."}
{"text":"We headed here with a large group (14) early evening and were seated right away on a Thursday night.  alot of other reviews said it would be busy but it was less than 1/3 full when we arrived.

We took a good selection across the entire list of entrees and everything was palatable but nothing stood out as outstanding.

One of our party had a steak come out a bit over done....after he sent ti back the manager (impressively) was at our table in less than three minutes to apologize..I've never been in any restaurant with a response time that fast.

They have an extensive list of beers and a decent wine list.

We did not try any of the deserts (which seems to be their claim to fame) so you'll have to make your own call.

I'd say, for a mid-price eatery, that you get what you pay for the service is sharp and was a decent value."}
{"text":"I give the restaurants five stars and happy hour in the bar (saloon). three stars. The restaurant menu is fantastic, I've tried many dishes and they're all good quality. My current favorite is the California citrus salad.   The happy hour food menu is unimpressive, tried several items and they were all at best average. Skip happy hour in the bar and head straight to the restaurant. 

I would also like to note that I always receive friendly, good service from the wait staff here."}
{"text":"I was the first to arrive at the restaurant. The waiter, Mitchell, immediately greeted me. He instantly gave me my drink of choice and came over right away when the rest of the (7) party showed up. His personality was delightful as he was very courteous. The salads and appetizers came out on time. He was very accommodating with how picky my family and myself can be. When I asked about the mini trip dips, he said they could still make them even though they are not on the menu. 
The check came on time! 
Also, when I asked for extra aujus, he gave me a container to take with me. 
I had the meal for leftovers and it is delicious. Thank you Mitchell! :)"}
{"text":"First time going and all I have to say that it is really good! Also, best service I've ever had. I would definitely go again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Good food and Ice cool beer! what more can you ask for. the chilie is awsome"}
{"text":"Love this Claimjumper! 

I visit lovely Las Vegas quite frequently for work and whenever the boyfriend tags along and we have a car, we always hit up the Claimjumper for a tri tip dinner and a chocolate chip calzone dessert. 

This location can get pretty busy so call ahead and make a reservation. Also the saloon is pretty small so don't bank on sitting there and having a drink while you wait. 

Great service and friendly staff. We are loyal fans."}
{"text":"Look, this is a chain and so you know what you are getting. This location has extremely nice staff.

They have very good food for a great price, very clean and large. Great for groups! 

Nice to go out to dinner and not spend way too much like most places in Vegas.

Desserts are great, specials are great...good spot to bring the fam!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Claim Jumper before, and didnt know what to expect. My wife and I had been driving by this place since it opened, and we decided to try it out last night.

Their motto has got to be \"go big or go home\" when you visit this place.This chain is the absolute epitomy of american waste with food. This is exactly why America is fat because of places like this. The portions are of extreme size, and Im sure some championship eaters couldnt take down the \"Ore Cart\". Would you like some ribs with a side of pig and chicken? No thanks! 

However, I had their Pot Pie and it was one of the best I have had. I really enjoyed eating it, but I couldnt help to think about how many calories this thing was.. according to the online menu its 2200 calories, and 1400mg of sodium. My wife had the goldrush chicken which is sorta like a chicken marsala but with madera instead. It too comes in at 2000 calories, and 3000mg of Sodium!!! (Ill bet she will be retaining water today!) Its not that I usually think about how much calorie intake I am taking in during dinner (actually never until now), I just couldnt help to think about it when we saw the extreme proportions that were coming out of the kitchen. 

We asked about dessert just out of curiosity sakes because we saw some 7 layer \"motherload\" cake someone ordered (for themself). We asked if they had any kind of sampler since they were all so huge. Indeed they do, its the Eureka Sampler for 15$ with about 5 different deserts on it. We didnt go for it, but we were told it would feed a large party just fine. Their heffewizen beer was actually pretty tastey I thought.

Pricing wasnt bad, two entree's and 1 alcoholic drink each with tip came to $50. I will definately visit again, but Ill make sure not to eat all day before going."}
{"text":"Arrived around 12AM and was seating 5min apon arrival. Our server took our drink order and was quick with that. He took our food order and the food took quite long. It took about 45min for them to cook our food and we ordered pastas. They do not have a bathroom, You would need to walk out of the restaurant and take a few lefts just to get to the bathroom. Overall the food was great but the service was slow."}
{"text":"We only come for the happy hours and sit in the bar to eat.  It is a good blend between a large open space, sports on TV and its mellow for families or if you want to be able to talk.  The food is hit or miss as with any chain and some things are better then others or can be generic.  Service is okay, can be a bit spotty sometimes if your at a table  depending on how much the staff is tying to cover but enough people are around that you can flag someone done if needed."}
{"text":"Sad to say terrible line cooks on italian side. Manager tried to make it better, my mood would not allow to try again. Calazone was cold in the middle and had 2 
tablespoons of Italian sausage. Stay with steaks or chicken for a meal."}
{"text":"I'm normally a Claim Jumper fan but this location is really hit or miss with their food and the service has a lot of room for improvement. Been here maybe 5x hoping that it would get better, but it doesn't. We're members of the Landry's select club so we try to use it as much as possible but we might just give up on this CJ. 
Stay away from the chicken strips, they are like cardboard. Chicken fried chicken is good. Motherload cake is awesome as always."}
{"text":"Four of us went there after Gordy Brown show which was excellent, being it was in same hotel (Golden Nugget) Price were typical high hotel prices, I had fried shrimp,tasted, like they just came out of a frozen shrimp box and microwaved. Can't think when I had a worst meal. Other three people in our party had meals with the same result. Service was very good, but did not make up for the bad meals."}
{"text":"Second time here. Food and service were both good. Look forward to coming back soon. Would have been 5 stars, but why have a vip pass to get seated & stand in the vip line and get passed over several times until someone in the regular line points out that you are there.  Everything else was great,  the other not that big of a deal, but wanted to mention it."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. There weren't too many people so we were sat down quickly.  Our waitress got our orders and drinks very fast. 

We started with an appetizer, lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was prepared well, very tasty and crispy. We were also served garlic cheese bread.

For our main course, I had ordered the country fried steak and a house salad. The steak was cooked well, but it had a bit too much breading on it. My fianc√© ordered the ribeye with a house salad- they were made very sloppy. Her ribeye was cooked as she ordered (medium rare). The food was all cooked very well, and I felt that it was totally worth the money. 

My problem I had here was the atmosphere. The restaurant was full of people who lacked manners and courtesy. The waiting staff seemed very rushed and wanted to turn the tables as fast as possible. I have memories of this place being very classy, but it seems to have dropped it's standards. While the food was good, I much would have taken it all to go."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper used to be our favorite place to eat.  Notice I said \"used\" to be.  Recently they were purchased by Landry's and now everything has changed just a little bit--but not for the better!  My husband's favorite thing to order was prime rib with a side of fried zuchini, a chopped bleu cheese wedge salad and garlic cheese bread.  My favorite thing was the onion rings!!  They had the best breading...but NOT anymore.  The prime rib is now gone off the menu, the garlic cheese bread is nothing to write home about, and the bleu cheese wedge is also gone.  They changed the zuchini and onion ring breading to a more floury, flaky recipe...and it was already perfect.  We ate there today for lunch, and Brad said he is never going to eat there again.  I eat there typically on Wed for a playdate with my son...but since the change, we have started searching for other venues.  My friend Laura used to order a salad off of the lunch menu.  When she ordered it they would ask if she wanted Jamaican style chicken or grilled.  The last time she ordered it they didn't ask...and she didn't notice, but figured out when she was done with her meal.  She said, I knew something was different, they didn't put chicken on it.  We then checked the price, and it was the same price...but now without chicken.  I have one phrase for you CJ--\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it!\"

One last thing, the service is still great...they just can't be as confident about the food as they used to be!"}
{"text":"The staff are amazing, informative and friendly. The food was good, we all liked the flavours and the portions just right."}
{"text":"As my rating suggests, I like this place but am not wild about it.  There food is genuinely pretty tasty and generous, although the prices could be cheaper.  Onion rings, great.  Meatloaf dinner, quite tasty but not as good as their meatloaf sandwich they took off the menu a few years ago.  I hear they will still make it though if you ask politely.  Spinach artichoke dip, ehhh...  Widow maker burger, pretty tasty, expensive though but that's why you get it during happy hour!  Speaking of happy hour, not bad prices and a good selection although it could be a lot bigger.  Happy hour is only available in the bar area too which sucks because sometimes you have a big party that wants cheap food and drinks right?  I've had mixed experiences with the drinks here or rather how the drinks taste.  Sometimes they are on point, other times they are terrible.  Gotta be consistent!  Not bad for a local place but not somewhere I frequent."}
{"text":"I get lunch here often.  Its about the same price as a fast food place and better quality. I order out and Sam always does a great job on my orders."}
{"text":"Ok food and subpar service.  We never received our bread service and was offered one refill at the end of our meal, despite our drinks being empty when food was brought out. One we gave our card to pay it took another 15 minutes for her to run the card and return it."}
{"text":"We arrived and hostess was very friendly and helpful. 
Got our order and food flavors all-over the place, crab cakes taste like box or worse crab was very runny inside, than our salads look like seating inside fridge for a while, Porterhouse \"oscar\" was tough and tasted like a \"mexican carne asada\", crab on top of steak was runny and very poor. Veggies way overdone. Server (mature female) drop steak knife on floor and left it there for the entire experience. Place looks clean and theme looks on point. Just our experience felt like an ihop but with a price of $80 per person."}
{"text":"We went for a late night breakfast.  The food was wonderful.  Everything was well prepared and fresh.  Service was even better.  It was a little pricey, but I expect it's probably typical for Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here at 230am after a night of drinking with family and had some breakfast.  It was a standard breakfast.  Everything cooked as ordered.  The bacon was a little thin but still tasted good.  Came back next day for lunch when we were picking up our vehicle and I had some chili that was pretty decent.  I would eat here again.  Both times the service was great, better late night though."}
{"text":"One thing you have to like about traveling is that you get to try all of those restaurants that you see commercials for -but never see in person. Today I got to finally try a Claim Jumper.

Claim Jumper is decorated like a giant cabin, with wood beams and buck antlers for chandeliers. The menu is part Cheescake Factory and part Chili's. Lots of salads, sandwiches, burgers, pastas and pizzas.  They also brew their own beers and have a healthy selection of beers on tap.

I went with the Grilled Cobb Sandwich, and a cup of French Onion Soup.  The sandwich was fantastic! It had a garlic mayo and a grilled specialty bread that set it off. Perhaps a little overboard on the bleu cheese, but I can deal with it. The soup was kind of plain, I've had better. 

Our waiter, Kyle, was on point and the manager was a stud for giving us a free \"slice\" of caramel apple cheesecake because a server happened to drop a glass right next to us.

Claim Jumper is cool. Far superior to Chili's, Outback, Cheesecake Factory, etc. I'd definitely come back. 3.25 stars."}
{"text":"Comfort food overload. Everyone talks about their humongo chicken pot pie, but did you realize they have a $2-$7 Happy Hour daily? 3:30-6:30 mon-Friday and Saturday in the morning sometime I think it's 11-4. Sunday is funday because happy hour is all day long! They've spruced up the place and I hope that more fun, young locals start hanging out here as it's close to my home. Would love to meet ya!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!! I can't get enough of the steak chili! our server was always smiling and my beer was always full! she never forgot anything and didn't even flinch when she was asked for chop sticks by our sugar buzzed teenager!!"}
{"text":"I haven't even been seated yet and I'm pissed. Been waiting 30 minutes for my son and I to get a table and the place is 3/4 empty. 7:00 on a Sunday night? Maybe I should just leave and cut my losses! What a great way to guarantee this place a NON-OPTION in the future.
Ok cut to 7:30 we finally got seated. The waitress was lovely, the food was a solid 6/10 so not worth the wait."}
{"text":"So I am a huge fan of Claim Jumpers! I love the ambience of their restaurants and love their food/menu options. I have yet to eat in at this location and usually just l place an order to go. 

It was a rainy Sunday and decided to order the fish tacos to go. This is one of my favorites and do to them usually having it as a lunch special I have had it many times . I am well aware that this chain normally takes a long time for their orders so the wait time was a bit long but the food makes it worth it. However on a Sunday there is no lunch special so for the fish tacos it's about $16. Got the food and checked it in the car, their was no side/fries. This would be fine if the price went with the order but I definetly  wanted my side for what we paid however did not want to wait another 30 minutes for fries. However when we called the manager Scott, he took care of us right away and the food tasted amazing. For that I am giving this location 4 stars for service.
It's nice when a place takes care of an issue and takes care of its customers . It will definetly keep me coming back. Looking forward to their amazing food and going to try dining in next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their happy hour menu is fantastic! The staff is always very friendly, and I enjoy sitting in the bar area. The raspberry martini is amazing, and the BBQ chicken sliders are delicious."}
{"text":"Stoped by with the family for my little sister's birthday, ordered a cheeseburger and Mozzerella Sticks. The cheese sticks were huge and delicious, the burger, also very large and tasty. The have these amazing super thin shoestring fries with awesome seasoning. First time I've been to this location, usually frequent Town Square but is very comparable. Service is very consistent between the two. Large portions, good location, great service, and plenty of seating. A little bit pricey depending what you order, but overall a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazingggggg lemon pepper fried zucchini. Seriously amazing. Crisp, fresh zucchini in a perfectly seasoned tempura-like batter, served with ranch. 

EAT THE HOME MADE CHICKEN POT EFFING PIE. 

IT'S SO GOOD. 

Then there was carrot cake. Eat that too. 

Last piece of advice: Wear expandable pants because you will not leave as the same pants size you were when you entered."}
{"text":"My visit was absolutely terrible! The restaurant had a wait and we were offered bar table seating. The waiter was extremely rude and seemed inconvenienced by my request to clean the table. I stood there 5 minutes until he even came over. After he cleaned the table he did not offer anything to drink. He simply walked away. My wife went to the restroom and her stall was completely out of toilet paper and the bathroom was a mess. My wife let the manager know but he didn't seem to care or apologize. As I waited for my wife all I can hear is the terrible waiter screaming across the bar to another waitress. Unprofessional. After 10 minutes of being ignored we decided to leave. I approached the same manager and let him know how disappointed I was in the experience. He didn't even seem to care. Not much customer service. Sad....this town lives off of service."}
{"text":"I never really considered Claim Jumper for breakfast, but that just changed.  A perfect breakfast burrito with salsa just hit the spot.  The blend of ingredients was amazing and wrapped in a fresh, soft tortilla.  Couldn't have asked for anything more.

The waiter was attentive and brought everything we requested out quickly."}
{"text":"I was very surprised to see this at the Golden Nugget. We where here for a hotel party and wanted to grab a quick bite. 

After walking around we discovered this spot. AMAZING!! Great service good prices and the food wasn't bad at all! 

We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"For over a decade, Claim Jumper was one of my favorite family restaurants. Things changed when the Landry's corporation began taking over. Favorite dishes like the Whiskey Chicken, Gold Rush Chicken and others started disappearing. Prices slowly crept up. A favorite of mine, the salad bar, is now only available in a couple of locations. Then before you knew it, no more muffins with your entree.

Landry's, thanks for ruining a good thing. I have to remind myself not to be tempted coming here based on memories of great past experiences."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Food sucked. & made me miss my shopping trip. 

When we first walked in, there was no one at the host desk so we decided to sit at the bar. We were then greeted by the bartenders & they offered us to sit at a booth on the other side of the bar. Once we had a seat at the table they offered, the table was extremely sticky. You could tell it hasn't been wiped. 

We ordered the lemon pepper zucchini to start off with while we looked through the menu. They gave us the happy hour menu also, even though it wasn't happy hour. 

The zucchini came as soon as we were done ordering out entrees. Pretty fast. We ordered the roasted tri tip with a Caesar salad & the stuffed BBQ shrimp that was on the happy hour menu. 

We waited on our entree for about 30 minutes and it didn't look very appetizing. Also, veggies were more on the colder side. So you cantell it's been sitting at the window for a while. 

Once our entree was almost done, the BBQ stuffed shrimp finally comes out & it looked like crap. I don't even know why I ate it. I don't know if they were rushing for closing but the presentation on the plate was horrible. 

And to top everything off.... When we first got there, I asked our server what time the shops closed & he said they closed at 9:30pm on Sundays. Which I thought was weird because that's a super random time.  We finished our meal at 8:15pm.. Rushing to make it to the mall. Turns out they close at 8pm on sundays. 

I went back into the restaurant, yelled across the bar to our server & told him I appreciated the false information he provided and made it pretty clear that I was unhappy with his service."}
{"text":"I really liked my dinner at Claim Jumper inside The Golden Nugget, and I had high standards since I was really looking forward to a restaurant that had closed. They start by serving warm, tomato & basil bread with marinara sauce, which was amazing. We got the chicken tenders and one of the sandwiches, and we were not disappointed. The service was pretty good. We got a pitcher of water so we had plenty for the entire meal and our food came out fairly quickly. It seemed crowded but we were seated at a nice table immediately. It is also located close to the parking structure, which is convenient. I would go here again when in town."}
{"text":"Use to come eat there every lunch and dinner. Stop because the new management are not to friendly and not helpful!!! Wish they didn't change anything. They hate mall employee! I don't know why!!"}
{"text":"I usually find going to Town Square to be a pain in the butt.  However, sometimes this is the best meeting location for people coming from all over town.  Had a very good dinner here for a large group.  Our server was very friendly and efficient.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner without being overly wowed.  Love being able to cross the street after dinner to shop at Sephora."}
{"text":"Can a restaurant be any darker inside then this place?  Thought about turning my flashlight app on to help read the menu.  The food is decent and reasonably priced.  Service is friendly.   Need to try the happy hour which looks to be a good value."}
{"text":"I was at town square shopping and decided to stop in for lunch. I've always strayed away from this restaurant because the portions are huge! But gave it a shot to check it out since it's been awhile.

They have lunch portions still a lot but doable for a quick bite.  I had a wedge salad and fish tacos. Love the fish tacos, really good flavor with the mix of dressings. The wedge salad looked really pretty! Presentation of the salad was topnotch. Lots of toppings, definitely not just a wedge with salad dressing. 

The widow burger was huge too!! There was a lot going on in the burger and was overcooked since we ordered it medium but overall the burger was really flavorful. A little overwhelming but I'm sure it will hit the spot for someone who's hungry and loves burgers!

Service was great. We got there a bit early so we avoided the rush but from the first hello to the final good bye, everyone was really nice and friendly. 

They have a dessert fridge up front and oMg they all looked amazing!!! Too bad I was so full. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but the waiter Adam could of smiled once and maybe had a bit of a personality. I ordered the tri tip hoagie. Nothing special but the bread they use is amazing ! Finished it off with the carrot cake which is amazing ! Food 4/5 , Service 2/5 !"}
{"text":"Bartender Louisa was great! Had the French onion soup and it was pretty good."}
{"text":"1 star and that is too much. After 1 hour being on the table with no food (we order appetizers with our meals) and nothing. Finally one salad came out and 10 min later our food. My burger was bloody. Spoke with manager he comped the burger and the chips. I didn't touch the burger disgusting. Server was awesome but manager showed very little concern and was acting like he was doing us a favor. My second bad experience so I won't be back. No wonder this place has 3 stars poorly managed."}
{"text":"Stopped by last Sunday to catch some football while shopping at Town Square. They have happy hour at specific times Mondays-Saturdays, but on Sundays it's all day at the bar, score!  Happy hour specials include drinks priced at $4-8 and appetizers priced $2-6, which can't be beat!

We ordered some drinks, as well as a few appetizers from the happy hour menu. My favorite were the wings, which were sauced perfectly and my least favorite were the chips and salsa, which was super watered down and had little taste to it. The chips were also super salty. You have to try their beer while you're here. I had the hef and it was so refreshing, especially after a morning of shopping.

Service was a little lacking, but we were sitting at the bar which isn't exactly place where you should expect to get fast/decent service at any restaurant. Here they only had 1 bartender overseeing the entire bar area on a football Sunday. We never got silverware or napkins and I ended up having to grab some that were set on a nearby table and also used our drink/bar napkins. C'mon we had wings, can we at least get 1 or 2 napkins?"}
{"text":"Sunday night: call for a reservation for a group of 8 for that evening.  I'm told \"I need you to talk to the manager\", and I'm put on hold.  Five minutes later, the gal picks up again, \"I paged him and he's on his way\".  Um, really?  I have to talk to a manager.  Yes, yes I do.  After waiting on hold for a total of 8 minutes, the manager gets on the phone.  He tells me there's an opening at 7pm for our party of 8, which means he thinks they should be able to seat us by 7:15pm.  Hopefully.  

Erm, no.  What part of reservation means that you'll seat us by 15 minutes later if we're lucky?

We took our business elsewhere and have no desire to try this place again.  Good job, manager \"Todd\"."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar section and our server, Kristina, was so nice and attentive. And the happy hour menu is so awesome here. The Widow Maker burger is amazing! Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 stars but gave them a 4. I come here a lot for lunch. My coworkers love this place. It's good, but not awesome. Large portions great service, widow maker burger good. chicken pot pie good. fish and chips wasnokntoo me ... i think the portion was too large and i was tlking too much ... felt a littly oily for me ...but its fried food :), The seared ahi was relly good and i also like the loaded baked potato. The menu has a lot of choices."}
{"text":"Great happy hour Drinks and food  having the meatloaf  and appetizer stuffed barbq shrimp
My son Adam is having the meatloaf and lemon pepperZucchini. Always excellent"}
{"text":"Here's an update. I left the Town Square Claim Jumper disappointed and let down on mothers day and shared my experience with you all.  Since I was posting from my phone there are a few other issues that I didn't even go into detail about.  

Hours after posting my original review I received a call from a manager of Claim Jumper.  He told me that I had posted my review on his restaurant in error but seemed genuinely concerned with our experience that prompted my horrible, but accurate review.  I was extremely apologetic that I had not been more prudent to make sure I had the correct restaurant, even offering to get back on Yelp! to correct the error so it would not reflect poorly on his establishment.  He assured me that was not necessary as a Claim Jumper is a Claim Jumper and this review had him concerned.  He told me he was passing this on to the district manager and that I would hear back from said district manager later in the day.

Fast forward two and a half weeks, I've never heard a peep from anyone else.  Its no wonder to me that management failed to correct the issues while we were dining with them.  Clearly, the district manager isn't upset about the service they are providing so why would management, and in turn their staff, do anything to correct their deficiencies.  

The kicker?  I just signed on Yelp from my computer so I could correct my error anyway because I'm a decent person that way.  According to Claim Jumpers website this location IS the location that I reviewed.  So either Yelp! has somehow crossed something on their end, or the gentlemen who called me was too ashamed to admit it was HIS restaurant.  I suppose either of those is understandable.  

I stand by my original post - NEVER again."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Beware! The bad customer service here may actually make you sick!! I have been here a plethora of times! I just wanted a simple to go order. The guy behind the counter didn't acknowledge me when I came in. When I asked about getting something to go , he said it would take about 15 mins then walked away! I kid you NOT! Oh and he didn't come back! My order took 25 mins and the lady came out with it had such a horrible attitude it almost knocked me down! She practically shoved my order to me and walked away! There was no thank you, no sorry for the wait, nothing! Duh, I'm not coming back!"}
{"text":"What happened to claim jumper? I used to think it was the shit! (in a good way that is). It was good but not as good as it used to be. 

Made a reservation for 630 pm for 4 adults and a child. 

Walked in was seated right away, with a really sweet waitress. She offered my daughter apple juice and a booster or high hair. For the first time ever we chose the booster (dun dun dun) and it surprisingly worked out. 

We ordered an app, fried calamari, which was a small sized portion and came with a side of asian peanut salad. I wasn't a fan and it didnt seem to pair well with fried calamari. 

I asked if they still had the salad bar, which i was a huge fan of but nope they discontinued that. BUMMER! That was one of the main reasons why we came.

I ordered the tri tip dip, which has caramelized onions, roasted peppers and monterey jack cheese. Hold the au jus please, and add a side of ranch. YUM. It came with string fries. Pure perfection. Probably the best dip I've had (except in CA where the dip was invented in downtown LA)

Husband got a bacon burger with fries. They majorly messed it up. he asked for the meat to be well done and instead it was medium rare. He still ate it after I told him to return it, he doesnt like to return food. he swears cooks will spit in it (As i roll my eyes). he said it was okay, nothing special and he wouldnt order it again. he told me he wished he had ordered my dip.

 Our guests both got pasta dishes. They liked them and got sides of the soup. I noticed the soups were tiny little soups and the pasta dishes were half the size that they used to be.


My daughter got the kids meal, which was mac n cheese, oranges and french fries. it was huge! No wonder kids are obese now adays. She ate half of the mac n cheese and a couple fries and was full. It was good though because now she had a meal for the next day :) She loved it, them again she will eat any pasta thats smothered in cheese. 

Our food took about 25 minutes to arrive, not bad for a super busy friday night."}
{"text":"Came here last week and the service was superb. Why? Because we had two cranky pain the the butt kids (terrifying threes and a one year old minus a nap) and the waiter did everything in his power to make our meal wonderful. He brought over extra crayons, little snacks to keep them occupied til their food came. And actually had their food come to get them started before ours. Brilliant! ( he must have had kids of his own!)   I don't know if it was the fact that I skipped lunch but my good was really good. My Cobb salad was huge. I think it lacked lettuce but made up for it for the crap tons of bacon (super crispy), boiled egg, chicken slices, ham, a whole sliced avocado, blue cheese crumbles and the homemade ranch. I got a cup of potato soup with it which really hit the spot. Super cheesy, love the carrots in it, and the large chunk of potatoes. 

My husband got a Caesar salad and couldn't believe how large it was and a cup of tortilla soup which he said was creamy. My daughters meal was huge. Three times the portion I serve her. It came with a entree,  and two sides. Which we picked spaghetti, mandarin oranges and steamed broccoli. We took home most of it. The spaghetti should have had more sauce but that's my only complaint! :)

Now I just need to come for happy hour minus my toddler!"}
{"text":"It's nothing fancy but a good time for the price. We come at happy hour and explore the happy hour apps. 
The calamari is usually great. It looks more like chicken fingers because they slice the rings and make them flat but they are really good sized chunks. Fried pickles are another dangerously delicious hard to resist item."}
{"text":"Pretty standard american fare.  Not spectacular.  Not terrible. If you want a good meal with ok service, this is a fine place."}
{"text":"Seated immediately for lunch. The stuffed baker was insurmountable and the rotisserie chicken was absolutely fire. Renee is an exemplary waitress and complimented the entire experience. Portions are great. The cookie finale will have to wait until our next visit."}
{"text":"I had the loaded baked potato.  That was a meal itself.  Chicken and veggies are stuffed inside and and topped with melted cheese.  My mom had the jerk chicken sweet potato.  She said she liked it.  I had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert and that was delicious also.  I want to go back to try other things."}
{"text":"The one thing I can say about this place is that it always delivers when you are really hungry. I was spending the day with my aunt and cousin so I wanted a place that had great food and plenty of it ( they like to eat to lol) and claim jumper was near by. I had not eaten here since the last time I ordered a widow maker burger and they almost had to cart my overstuffed body out the front door, but I knew I would be OK with backup in tow. 

The place had the same decorations that I was used to (mining tools,carts) but it seemed to be missing something. Normally the place is packed but there seemed to be many open seats (was a Sunday afternoon after all). We were told by the greeter that it was open seating and that we could sit anywhere we wanted which was nice but kind of weird. The NBA playoffs were on near the bar so after deciding on a booth that allowed my cousin and I to view two T.V.'s we were greeted by our waiter. He gave my family the rundown since it was their first time here on how big the portions were but also informed them that they now also offered half portions as well. I was kind of bummed that I would not be able to get my glass of raspberry ice tea( they no longer serve it) but our waiter was quick to point out that they do serve a tropical ice tea which was really good.  After my aunt finally placed her order for a appetizer our server was off to the kitchen to place the order. 

Now as I said in my last review when it comes to the food this place is top notch. The problem is with the staff as there seem to be many of them but none that are really interested in getting your food out in a timely manner. Our apps were on the table in what seemed like minutes which is not hard considering that it is probably already pre-made but our entries took over 30 minutes to come out! Not cool. But it did give us time to sit and watch the game. My cousin ordered the BBQ ribs which she said were smokey and really good. I decided to temp fate and ordered the widow maker with seasoned fries which looks like the burger version of the matter horn at disneyland. After the the normal looks of shock that newbies get when they eat here for the first time, we dug in. Each bite was delicious and flavorful. The bacon, and avocado worked better than Steve Nash and Amare in their game against the Trailblazers. Normally I switch back and forth between fries and my burger but this massive monster had me in it's grasp and would not let go.

All things considered this place still suffers from the same issues it did in the past. Anyone who knows me knows that bad service is a deal breaker when deciding if and when I will return to a place, but when it comes to eating here I guess I have to bend if not brake my own rule lol. Our server made this little family gorge fest a better one so I will return but just not right away. For now claim jumper you can keep all your stars but until the staff problem is fixed you are still in the danger zone."}
{"text":"The spinach artichoke dip is really good and the potato skins were on point. I like claim jumper, the service was good and the waitress came around decently often. I was upset that there was food sediment in my first glass of water and that there was a little bug in my cousin's salad. The reason for the critter was that they use \"fresh ingredients.\" My food order came in wrong. It was just one of those days. I know their franchise is pretty good but I haven't had a great time at this one particularly. Everyone should get a second chance, maybe Ramsey should step in :) 

2 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Poor service. Cold unflavoured food and charged us double + items we did not order. . This is seriously the worst. I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in here for something to eat before a movie. We usually would hit Yard House but weren't in the mood for crowds. 

This place just gets worse every year. I have been to Claim Jumper about 20 times at various locations. I used to think it was great when I was in high school, but the older I get, the more I realize that chain restaurants are just awful. 

I ordered a cup of the cheesy potato soup because it's really my favorite thing on the menu. They get one star for consistency because it always tastes the same and always hits the spot. 

I ordered fish tacos. My gf ordered Parmesan crusted chicken and pasta. My fish tacos came with rice, I asked for fries instead. When the food came out, there were less than a handful of fries on the plate. O_o The fish tacos LOOKED good, but when I bit into one, I realized that the fish was LITERALLY the size of a small fish stick. One tiny fish stick inside a large tortilla shell with a ton of cabbage and a pretty tasty chipotle sauce (the only good thing about them). I couldn't believe how small the fish was. Ridiculous. 

Ashley's pasta and chicken was just okay. 

This will probably be my last time visiting any Claim Jumper. It just isn't worth it. For $35, we could get a substantially better meal elsewhere. 

I really hope Claim Jumper reads their reviews and figures it out!"}
{"text":"Good, standard food. Definitely a chain that's consistent - I've been to several around the country, and they're all pretty much the same. I go for meetings, but only once in a while on my own. It's a bit pricier than similar chains, and doesn't really offer anything to offset the cost difference."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie not as big as before. Burgers pretty good. Not bad for a hotel coffee shop."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and parents for a quick dinner after church. My wife and I have been to the location at Town Square so we wanted to compare. We had the fried calmari to start, grilled chicken and ribs combo (easily feeds 2 people), california citrus salad, clam chowder, and hickory bbq burger with fries. The calamari was probably the most tender calamari I've ever tasted. They were a little on the salty side but the marinara sauce it came with helped tone it down. The burger was good and had that \"smoked\" flavor to it. My parents liked the chicken and ribs as they said it was better than Tony Roma's. My wife liked her chicken salad and had took some to go as they give quite a big portion. The only downside that I have is that they don't serve the chocolate chip calzone here for dessert. The Town Square location has it and it was THE BOMB! Other than that, Claim Jumper is good resto to satisfy your grilled grub fix."}
{"text":"First walk in is amazing. The place is big and spacey and great for large groups. Everyone who works here is very welcoming, I didn't feel rushed taking order, service here is great! It's my first time here today and I think I will be coming back with a bigger group, it's a great place for family :)"}
{"text":"While our food was good, the service was not. Our server Tabatha was absolutely terrible. No drinks, had bread, salad, dinner, and side plates stacked on each each other on our tiny two person table. She never picked any on it up. I could barely see my husband. She of course got our order wrong and with a shrug of her shoulders left it. We wanted to order dessert, but weren't even given the option to. Just a simple here's the bill and walked away. 
I wanted to speak to her manager but never saw her again after dropping the bill. I really can't believe had bad she did at her job. Again, food was good but she made the dining miserable."}
{"text":"When you are at the Town Square location, Heather is one of the bartenders and is absolutely fabulous.  Grab a seat in the bar area and she'll give you excellent service!"}
{"text":"Steak, and shrimps!!! huge salad good drinks!!! 
Thats where they get you!!! those \"Long Islands\" are pricey!!!
Over all, good service , good food  and no wait!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here when I wanted a free meal, because they screw up your meal everytime. They literally comp meals left and right. 

I went there with friends they got an ore cart (which is a whole dried out carcass) and we got a chicken. They came out soo dry.

I mean like dry dry. Like it was beef and chicken crackers. 

The waiter came over and said he would comp it and he could see how badly dry it was. Then he said free dessert.

So we naturally each ordered our own personal dessert :)

My mom went there and there was a waiter some how broke a glass on her lap. Dont ask how that happend but they tried to giver her a free Claim Jumper shirt!!!!

My mom was like Wtf! you jus ruined an expensive shirt and I have glassshards in my arms and legs. 

So they gave her a free meal and a $100 gift card.

The french onion soup was all I used to get there before I was aware what was in food. I cant vouch for whats in there, but it doesnt matter anyway the food is bad.

They are really really accomodating but I think its because they are used to fucking up all the time. 

If you want a free mediocre meal, come here."}
{"text":"The service was slow. Server was nice, but had trouble recommending anything. We order the potato cakes as an appetizer. very bland. The server agreed. 
 We both ordered burgers on the sourdough bread. It was mostly bread. They didn't put the sauce on mine but did on his. They said they would be medium well. My husbands was medium rare while mine was well done. The flavor was good. Considering the size one could get a better bigger burger cooked right at Carl's Jr.
The manager did come over and comped the appetizer. When we mention that there was too much bread and not enough meat, all she could say was :they didn't center the burger right\" after showing her it could fit on one slice of bread cut in half she says :yes that's just how we do it\". Really? You can't just use a different size bread? Or flatten the burger? Oh hey how about NOT PUTTING IT ON THE MENU!
Not worth the money!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody.

Here is a copy of the email that I sent to the General Manager, Austin Walsh, on the business card that I was given when I asked for one that night. However, the manager on duty that night, Mr. Chris Luevano, was not good and we're thinking if this is the right card.

Dear Mr. or Ms. Walsh,

My husband has been trying to get in touch with you over the phone since September 30, 2017 and he has been told that you are out of town and will be out of town until October 07, 2017.  He called you, yesterday, October 09, and was told that you are still out of the office and will not be in for another week.  He did not leave a message to return his phone call in fear that you would not receive it.

Therefore, I am writing this email message to you in hopes that you will receive it.  The purpose of this message is to inform you of the terrible experience we encountered at your restaurant on September 29, 2017.  Every Friday, my husband and I go out to dinner; we like to try out different places but will, often, return to the restaurants we like.  WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO YOUR RESTAURANT!!!  Nor, will we be recommending your restaurant to any of my co-workers who, like us, have Friday night date nights.

I have been to Claim Jumper several times for lunch but not for dinner, so, I recommended Claim Jumper to my husband for dinner that night.  In all the \"Friday date night\" dinner we have had, dinner at your Claim Jumper was the worst dinner we have experienced.  WE sat in your lounge are for dinner because we wanted to enjoy your happy hour drinks.  We were able to order a bottle of wine and a glass of beer and an appetizer right away but after that our waitress, AMBER, did not return to take our dinner order until 25 minutes later (almost half an hour!).  My husband and I, both, ordered your BBQ Chicken Salad and, unless it is made different for dinner it tasted quite different from the same salad that is served at lunch.  There was hardly any BBQ sauce in the salad and this is my favorite part of your BBQ Chicken salad.  After ordering our main course, it took another half an hour to get our meal.  Without going into too much more detail, which I do not have the time to do in this email.

However, what really lead to my husband's phone calls and this message, is that we had an even more horrible time with your manager!  He gave us quite the attitude when we complained.  I asked for his name and did not understand the pronunciation with his last name and asked him to spell it, please, and boy did that upset him.  That's how I received your card, in which, he said he would write his name down.

Bottom line, would you wait 2 hours for a salad?  AND, we paid for the alcohol, the appetizer, and 1 salad after all of that!  I thought you would like to know that I will be placing my complaint on yelp.com and why.  

10/13/207 - Additional comment:  Tonight's Friday date night dinner was at Cheddar's in Chandler, AZ and I give this restaurant a thumb's up for quickness of seating, service and the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have tried various dishes. I have to say one of my favorites is the meatloaf...and I don't like meatloaf! Their side salads are also quite delicious, I think the crutons are sweet so it gives them a great flavor."}
{"text":"Sat down and wasn't acknowledged for over ten minutes.  Notified the hostess who just stared at me.  That was enough for us - sorry, way too many other options Downtown than to put up with being ignored."}
{"text":"This s place is great and has a very big menu with so many choices. The portions are very large so expect to take a doggy bag with you. The desserts selections are also really good and they have the biggest chocolate cake slice ever. You can even buy the entire cake if you wanted to. I think it's called the mother load! 
Happy hour is extra good here because everything is cheaper and the food is so good. The bbq chicken pizza is great and the HH portions are smaller so I don't feel stuffed."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper has been my families restaurant of choice for birthdays, celebrations, or just anytime. I have never had a bad experience here, and I've been coming for about 12 years.
Claim Jumper has excellent food! I especially love their (appetizers) onion rings, zucchini fries, potato skins, & southwest egg rolls. I could eat their chicken Caesar salad anytime of day, along with the country fried steak, mini corn dogs, BBQ burger, & a lot more. Their 6 layer chocolate cake is to die for, it's the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Their carrot cake & chocolate calzone is amazing also. Amazing food and good prices.. Service is wonderful  and it's a clean restaurant. I'd recommend it to ANYONE!"}
{"text":"We spent a few days in the Golden Nugget and at the Claim Jumper a few times.  The staff and food were both very decent.  The prices for the grub was on par with everything else in the tourist district (meaning slightly higher priced for what it is).

I would say that if you are in the area and hungry that this joint is as good as any other and they have a fairly varied menu."}
{"text":"New England Clam Chowder in Sourdough Bowl $8.99

BBQ Baby Back Ribs & Chicken Entree $24.99

Chocolate Chip Calzone $7.99

My wife and I came here after going to the Apple Store to fix my phone. The setting reminded me of Tony Roma's. The chowder was great. They make their soups daily and it tasted like it; very fresh and a good ratio of potatoes/vegetables to clams. I love scooping a piece of the sourdough on the bottom of the bowl and eating it with the soup. The ribs and chicken entree came with a side salad, roasted vegetables, and rice as our starch. The ribs tasted similar to Tony Roma's but more on the smokey side whereas TR is a little on the sweet side. Both meats were very tender and the vegetables were quite flavorful. They were a little greasy however bc they use the leftover roasted meat juices/oils as the flavoring. The chocolate chip calzone was BROKE DA MOUTH (again, excuse my hawaiian accent)!. Warm and gooey in the center, the calzone pieces came with ice cream which helped to tame the sweetness. The feeling reminded me of eating a ice cream sandwich in the most comforting way. This dessert goes on my top 5 of best desserts in vegas (along with the Sticky Toffee Pudding at GR pub). Overall, the food here was very good and they have a great happy hour menu. Their ribs, in my opinion, were still not as good as Tony Roma's but everything else was pretty good. My wife gave it a 9/10."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just left this location and had a very bad experience. We got here at about a little after midnight and had a 15 minute wait. We got seated and had a good waiter. We both ordered the top sirloin meal, medium cooked. One with mashed potatoes and green beens. The other with a baked potato and green beans. Our first order was cold. Even the waiter was curious of why we haven't received our meal and after while the manager sent the \"ok\" to send our plates out to us. We had to send our meals back. The second time our order came out our meal was over cooked on the steak and it was also cold. We left at 2am, not impressed and furious over the service of our food. I knew it wasn't the waiters fault, however the management was a huge disappointment. He was not sincere and seemed irritated because we simply told him we would not be paying. I left in tears because it took everything in me to be humble and not go off because of the poor mistakes they made. I would not visit nor recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Tarin our server had outstanding service. Super mellow guy yet attentive & friendly. Food took no longer than around 10 minutes. All the dishes were delicious & the whole order was correct. Price was fair for the quality of food. Really recommend to check this place out if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"My family was in town the first weekend in November for my nephew's university graduation. We chose Claim Jumper as our one special celebration meal together (there were 15 of us). It was so disappointing.

We had been driving all day and the kids were starving. Our waiter was slow, impatient, and incompetent. He rolled his eyes at us several times. He spent too much time trying to pressure us into buying some card for regulars even though we don't even have Claim Jumpers in our state.

He messed up over half the orders. For instance, my nephew's wife never got part of her meal, and the kids never got their drinks. My nephew asked for no onions and got onions. He forgot to ask what side I wanted, and blamed it on me 20 minutes later: \"You didn't tell me what you wanted.\" He didn't give me a chance. 20 more minutes after that, he informed me that they were out of what I ordered and shoved a menu at me. I chose the chili in a bread bowl that he highly recommended, and got chili without a bread bowl. My sister-in-law barely touched her food because it wasn't good. We are not a picky group! By then we were starving and even though we were right by his POS station, we rarely saw him and couldn't get his attention, so we made do with what we got. The chili he highly recommended tasted like canned Nalley chili with some chunks of meat thrown in.

Then he couldn't split our check, even though we told him at the beginning that we would have separate checks. He was huffy and impatient as we told him again who was together, and since we'd been there so long my brother finally told him we'd work it out on our own. He rudely said, \"Good, because see what I'm dealing with?\" and showed us some crazy chicken scratch diagram he made. He was clearly not trained or qualified or something when it came to serving a big group. 

When we analyzed the check, I saw that he had charged us for my original meal that they were out of, plus the one I ordered to replace it (which wasn't right either, but I ate it). It took at least 15 minutes to find him and bring it to his attention, and then he was huffy and abrupt about it. I got a half-apology but no offer to make it up to us in any way. We contemplated going to the manager but we were exhausted and just wanted to go to our hotel.

I hope that was an unusual experience, because I honestly have never had such rude and incompetent service in my life. I know that food service is hard work and I try to give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt, but there was no excuse for his sloppy waiting and especially his rude attitude. 

Thankfully, my nephew took me afterward to the other side of town to get the best street taco I've ever had. :) Next time I visit him in Vegas, I'll definitely avoid Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"Johnathan Day (I think that's how you spell it) was our server and he was absolutely wonderful! I loved the food and his friendly service!!"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper located inside the golden nugget hotel Downtown Las Vegas.  Came here for my nieces culmination post lunch.  
Only to be disappointed beyond belief, because I've had so many great experiences with Claim Jumper in Phoenix and Los Angeles.  The food was either bland, greasy and/or over-fried.  Tried to force myself to eat it but couldn't bear it.  The water was good and so was the waitress, but that's about it.  I won't be coming back and I highly recommend that everyone reading this stays away!!!!i"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love the food here.  The menu is big and there's lots to choose from and every time the food is consistently good.  I don't know what it is about this location, though, but the service is HORRIBLE.  One time I came here with my family (consisting of my 5 year old nephew and 3 year old niece), and it took almost a half hour to get our order taken (and the place wasn't even busy).  Then when the food FINALLY came, they brought my nephew's grilled cheese last (and it came about 5 minutes after everyone's meals were brought).  Isn't it serving 101 to bring the kids food first??  The server never apologized for things being messed up or taking ridiculously long.  I recommend the Town Square location."}
{"text":"This was my first time to claim jumpers in years and it will be my last. They have a gluten free menu which I was thrilled to see since my kids and I can't eat gluten.  I ordered a plain burger with nothing on it but a gluten free bun. It came with fries. My kids had gluten free pasta which also came with fries. My order came out and the burger had pickles and mayo on it. My moms calamari was soggy. The waitress apologized and took both back. 

My second burger came out but was on a gluten bun. By the third burger, a person who I assume was the manager (she never said), brought it out and informs me the fries have flour sprinkled on them so they aren't gluten free. At this point I had been eating my kids fries for 10 minutes. I couldn't figure out why fries would be offered with two orders that I specifically stated need to be gluten free. The manager wasn't very apologetic. She brought me a potato and left. 

When we tried to order ice cream for my girls the waitress said they weren't sure if the ice cream had gluten in it and they had no ingredient list. Normally I wouldn't think ice cream has gluten but who would have thought fries would have it sprinkled on. When the bill came I thought my burger might have been comped after all the issues we had but it was not. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding ! Great customer service! Food was very tasty! I will be coming back again! It was a wonderful first time visit."}
{"text":"One word: Molasses! This location is extremely slow around lunch. I came in with 6 of my co-workers on a Thursday around 11am. There were probably around 2 or 3 tables with people at the time.  We were seated promptly and our orders were taken in a timely matter. It took a little over an hour for our food to arrive, and 2 of the 7 dishes were ice cold. The cashier did remove the items from our bill, which was nice. I don't want to be completely negative, so I will say I ordered the mini chicken artichoke pizza which was extremely tasty. Claim Jumper is fine.. chain food, huge portions. I would just avoid this location during lunch."}
{"text":"Donnie was great! Super professional and very courteous! The ribs were super meaty today! And the baked potato was huge! Looked like a pounder! Couldn't handle dessert but dreaming about the cheesecake it's Al amazing."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to claim jumper it's with my boyfriend and we've always had a great time there and are very pleased with our food. Deep dish pizzas, shrimp pastas, cheese burger with all of the toppings. Ya everything's awesome every single time."}
{"text":"Probably closer to 3 1/2  stars.  Came here on Business after an extremely hot day in PHX. AC was out in the office I was working in and the swamp coolers used as a temp fix were barely tolerable.
Needless to say, I really needed a beer or 3.  The Pyramid Hefeweizen definitely hit the spot.  Nacho's were good and the Widowmaker burger(avo, bacon,double cheese and onion ring) I had was the best I've had in a long time.  The waitress was very cool and put up with a lot of good natured double entendre's from our testosterone laden table.  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I've been to the new location twice since it opened. 
I haven't had a disappointing experience yet. I've ordered the chicken lunch special and the 2nd time I ordered the chicken pot pie which was delicious. This place is a block & a half east of the Las Vegas Strip on flamingo in the Howard Hughes office park where McCormick & Smiths used to be. They bring out freshly baked bread to stuff your face with while ya wait too."}
{"text":"Large portions and very good food.  Don't sit in the dinning room you'll miss out on the happy hr deals!  Last visit I didn't even order off the dinner menu, I got a couple orders of sliders, some onion rings, and some zucinii off the appitiser menu (during happy hour).  THere was more than enough food for two.  What a great deal."}
{"text":"They serve good food and you get your money's worth in portion size.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  The decor is...WAS excellent.  It was done in the theme of the 1800's gold rush era.  Then some idiot in corporate, probably some brainiac bean counter with an MBA from Harvard with absolutely no common sense decided that the belt driven fans had to be replaced by crap you can buy at the local hardware store..  Dumb move but typical of these corporate types who only look at the bottom line.  That's my rant."}
{"text":"Service gets worse every time we go and we go less each time because we start to remember how bad it is 
Food is good but on the high side for what you get 
But it seams they will be closing soon because a restaurant can't run 75% empty and stay in business 
Service service service  very bad won't be coming back here for a long time if ever again use to 2-3 times a week"}
{"text":"Elderly waiter couldn't understand the appetizer we ordered. He hovered over my shoulder to read it. Then, we ordered our meals. I got the chicken pot pie and asked for a Caesar side salad, and he told me \"no, that's too much food.\" Excuse me? If I want an appetizer sampler, a salad and a pot pie, and share a stuffed baked potato with my husband, I will. I now am forced to live in Trump America, so I might as well order gluttonous amounts of food and dare everyone around to judge me.

I told him that was fine, I wanted the salad. I had to repeat it three times before he RELUCTANTLY wrote it down, chuckling about so much food.

When the appetizer platter and salad arrived, the woman who brought it out tried giving it to another table.

The platter was lukewarm, at best. But tasted fine.

The salad was good, albeit warm, and not as monstrously portioned as I'd been led to believe.

I watched him wander aimlessly between tables, with a confused expression. I wondered if he was having a stroke.

We wanted to play Keno, so my husband waved down the Runner. We watched the Runner walk to the table next to us and take their ticket and start to walk away. Only when she glanced over her shoulder did she see my husband waving his ticket. 

Our food came after this. Salad and appetizer platter totally eaten. Loaded potato was lukewarm. My pot pie was the only food we ordered that was the proper temperature. 

Seriously, the food was subpar, and barely warm. And Mr Magoo would.not.stop.hovering. So, I began writing this review. My soda was empty for 30 minutes, while my husband had a carafe brought to him.

Then Mr. Miyagi had to go and we were introduced to Lurch, the 7 foot waiter, who would assist us. And placed the bill on the table. We weren't done eating ffs, and I'd have wanted dessert but it wasn't even offered. 

Finally asked for a refill.

Lurch has come to the table no less than 5 times in 15 minutes to bother us. Didn't even ask if I want my pot pie boxed up to go.

For the record, because this matters, I worked 13 hours overnight, as a nurse, and was starved and wanted to have good food and sit. I was insulted by being told no, I was ordering too much food. I'm 5'7 & 135 pounds. And again, spent 13 hours on my feet, burning energy. 

My husband is 6'5 and could snap Lurch in half.

We may have eyes bigger than our stomachs. It's our decision to buy more food than we can eat. Trump embodies that right to overindulge and ya'll wanted that so don't try to dictate my life.

And yes, we ate everything."}
{"text":"Regular good ol American food :)
The dishes arnt humongous so you can just about finish your dish adjust about ... Fuuuuuu-I'm-full-but-not-that-full. Noted yummy dish: the breakfast burrito. I was pleasantly surprised with the medley of grounded chorizo, cheese and eggs which made for a nice meal. Pair that with a cup of coffee and you are ready to start the day!
I also enjoyed their many choices of salads and fruit. 
Good service"}
{"text":"Sure it's a chain restaurant. But it's a consistently good chain restaurant with a large menu that offers something for everyone. Service was pleasant and efficient. The food was good. If your looking for something safe and reasonably priced Claim Jumper is a good choice."}
{"text":"Great food I love the coconut shrimp. The menu has a huge selection which you can enjoy for a month without eating the same thing."}
{"text":"It was not busy, but took 20 minutes to get a drink, the soup and salads were out before my drink came out. The server was not observant, the manager cleared our table at the end of he meal, but didn't ask how things were or if we needed anything else. The only reason we tried Claim Jumper was because I had a gift card. Would not recommend and will probably not return to this location."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience.  For starters, they eliminated my favorite starter: the Nachos.  Claim Jumpers had the best Nachos around and now...they dont.

Our experience didn't get any better.  We waited nearly 15 minutes just to get two cokes.  We waited another 15 minutes before the server (bartender) decided to come out from behind the bar and actually take our orders.  He was too busy having a good time, apparently telling jokes with his bus boy buddies.

The pizza I ordered was awful....much worse than somethiing that wouldl show up at my front door from a Pizza Hut order.  The rest of the food was good so Claim Jumpers gets two stars instead of 1 but it's safe to say I will never be going back to Claim Jumpers again."}
{"text":"How I wish there were 0 stars!! This place was horrid! We waited more than 30 minutes and never got food. Not to mention we watched 3 other tables seated after us receive their meals. How long does it take to make a burger? The server never even came back or updated us on anything. We just got left sitting at the table. Ultimately we left because we weren't ever served anything other than water. Horrid service during a slow time in the restaurant. Horrid. I will never return to this restaurant again and would caution others to steer clear."}
{"text":"Came Thursday 7/14 at 5:20pm for a simple take out dessert order and I was ignored by a waitress with blonde hair and a nasty look on her face. She was at the register by the dessert display and looked down ignoring me while I asked to place an order. Miserable person."}

{"text":"Been to other Claim Jumpers.... This one's service and food mediocre. My husband and I went there for dinner and although there were many tables open was seated with a view into the kitchen. Ordered southwest rolls that were more soggy than crispy. I ordered a salad for dinner and the lettuce was warm. My husband said his steak was just ok. Our server wasn't very attentive. I won't pay this price again for what should be amazing food and service. Sadly disappointed because it was one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago area."}

Was served with fresh fruit.
My dining partners ordered Soup and Salad.
I hot tea and 1 ice tea!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken-fried steak which tasted like the grease was old and the gravy was very salty. We also had fish and chips which were really really bad overcooked and the insides were mushy. Overall it was a very bad experience and we will not return."}
{"text":"There food was so fast food....the coconut shrimp was all batter and when I told the waitress she didn't even take it off the bill the ceasar salad had chicken on it that was from the deli at Frys needless to say would not eat here again...oh and my husbands burger was rare in the middle even when he asked for well done!"}
{"text":"The food is pricy, that would be okay if it were good. But it is NOT. Undercooked potatoes, cheap tasting meat, and cooks mess up order even if waiter is specific. Would be a 1*, but waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"I love this claim jumper. The service is always phenomenal. We usually sit at the bar and Mike our bartender always treats us with great service and he's nice. I will come back most def."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times... good food. Nice gluten sensitive menu. Cool thing... they offer actual gluten free beer made by New Belgium called Glutiny. Pretty awesome. 

The main reason why I came to write today is because in our very large party of about 20, my husbands, my daughters and my food slipped being put in. So all food was delivered some 15-20 min later and ours wasn't there. 

They immediately offered no charge salads or soups to us for the wait. I wasn't concerned and neither was my husband but my 2.5 year old needed something so she got what they called a \"baby plate\" which included cheese, applesauce, and oranges. Pretty cool to keep her occupied. 

Our food came a while later... my daughter now had a full adult plate of grilled chicken rather than the kids version, but that was ok with us and her too. 

While eating the manager came over and apologized and told us our meals were on the house since they were not entered with the rest of the table's meals. 

We didn't even complain or make a face... we are super easy going because I know shit happens in the food industry and it's not like they did it on purpose. 

I was pretty thrilled that they immediately offered the meal for free... spoke of good service goals. 

This experience will always have me remember this place for going above."}
{"text":"Let me say that they have the best Onion Rings ever! My wife and I were visiting from Hawaii for 8 days and we ate onion rings there ((4)) times. Since they are open 24/7 after we gambled, drank, enjoyed the Fremont strip, this was the place to eat. Our waiter was a male who was from Hawaii and it was such a coincidence because we were visiting from Hawaii. We forgot his name but every time we went here he took very good care of us. We will definitely eat there again on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Went for Fathers Day. Table was dirty asked for it to be cleaned, wasn't until the food started coming out. Our salad, apps, and dinner all came out at the same time. The food was like warm and disappointing, especially for the price."}
{"text":"This place is always good when nobody can decide what they want for dinner. They have something for everyone. 

Location: It's location is very convenient. right off of the 215 and Green Valley pkwy. Parking is never a problem.

Ambiance: The restaurant looks like a log cabin. They have a fire place in the waiting area with comfy seating. The restaurant is family friendly with large booths.  

Service: They do an excellent job as far as service. Everyone is friendly, professional, and move quickly. They defiantly know how to deal with volume since they are a fairly large restaurant.

Food: I like the kids menu for my boys. They have a good selection along with sides and desserts. Plus the portion is big enough for an adult. I've tried there french onion soup, new England clam chowder, tri tip dips, club sandwich, BBQ ribs, grilled chicken pasta, California citrus salad, BBQ salad, Chinese chicken salad, and many more. Every time I've been pleased. Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I was so underwhelmed by this place. The best I can say it's an older version of Cheesecake Factory, way too many menu options and the decor gives me a MCL Cafeteria vibe. Our waitress never introduced herself, the apps were decent, however the main course...NOPE! 
I had the half rack of baby back ribs, meat was tough and the sauce was thick and bland. I had a sweet potato on the side, awful, awful, awful!"}
{"text":"Well we had 1 previous visit to this restaurant 2 1/2 moths ago and found out that they were bought out by Landry's. That night we found out that our favorite menu items were removed or replaced with cheaper, and much lower quality menu items. 

Tonight for a change we thought we would try it again. The ONLY reason we did was because this was the place we would always take friends and family when they came for a visit. As we struggled to find something on the menu we ordered drinks. I ordered their draft Hefeveiwen and was told it would be served in a frosted glass. It was not. I was told they have a \"Chiller\" that sometimes frosts the glasses, wasn't happy and asked that it be taken away and ordered a soda. 

Real simply I ordered the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes. My wife and kids received their meals and everything was going good until I put the whipped butter on top of my mashed potatoes. It wouldn't even melt. Some people wouldn't complain but I asked the server for \"Hot\" potatoes. She apologized and went to get me fresh mashed potatoes. I was also served a brick of a biscuit that I didn't even touch. When the potatoes came I put them on my plate and tried them. Well.......friggen barley warm! Now I'm just plain pissed. The manager comes over and asked if those were better? Hell no they aren't! She promises me that the food sits in a warmer and they scoop them out of that. I don't give a crap! IT IS STILL FRIGGEN COLD!!!!!!!!! Well she leaves in a huff and says that she is gonna get this right! 2 minutes later someone(not my server or the manager) sets a small plate of microwaved mashed potatoes on the table. Screw it! I'm not eating them. 

As far as I'm concerned I am DONE with Claim Jumpers. What a great way to F*^% up a good restaurant. Thanks, but NO THANKS!! I will NEVER be back, and will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"We eat out 3-4 times a week so I know the Vegas restaurant scene pretty good.
Tonight went to this restaurant at 5:30 PM for happy hour.
Ordered wedge salad, calamari and pizza plus drinks.
Requested bread while we were waiting which took a long time to arrive with no butter.
Waitress came to table to say they were sold out of wedge salad??? No lettuce at 5:30 PM is unheard of. She subbed a very small Caesar salad which came out after bread was gone. Tiny order of calamari arrived 15 minutes later and pizza came after we were there ONE HOUR!!!
Pizza was soft doughy like bread.
Manager came to table and asked how everything was. We told him above and he took $9 off of a $17 check. 
We will not be back I'm afraid.
Have had bad luck with all Landry restaurants we've tried so far.
Last time we were here I gave place 4 stars but no more. Don't know what changed but adios amigos"}
{"text":"Gone downhill since Landry's bought them.

My food tasted like it was rewarmed.

I sent my plates back because they were dirty.  I sent my eating utensils back 4 times as each set had food on them.

For 10+ years I ate here while traveling and this was always a staple of mine...service and food was bad and I won't eat here again and from the looks of the deserted hughe restaurant everyone else has come to the same conclusion.

Avoid."}
{"text":"I had a gift card so I decided to give Claim Jumper a try again after swearing off of it a few years ago. The portion sizes are much smaller than I remember and the prices seem higher. The wedge salad was good. The ore cart at $29.99 had 4 babyback ribs 5 small shrimp and about 6 small pieces of tri-tip. I had the most disgusting country fried steak ever! The gravy had curdled  and the breading was overwhelming and super gross. It even smelled bad. I sent it back and the manager didn't even bother to come by to apologize. They offered to get me another entree and dropped off a menu then failed to come back for 10 minutes! They did take it off the check. I went to the counter to order cake and they made me wait, wait, wait. The manager comes over and in a huff I tell him my cake should be free. He gives it to me for half price. Ha! Ridiculous...."}
{"text":"Best bbq chic salad reminds me of the CPK one years ago.  Enjoyed the raspberry peach bellini too."}
{"text":"Two of my co-workers and I went to Claim Jumper on a Friday for lunch, we all ordered the fish tacos on the recommendation from our server. I guess ordering fish tacos from a place like Claim Jumper was our first mistake, but this is Arizona and we figured it couldn't go to terribly wrong.

The issues started before we were even seated. We stood at the entrance for a solid 10 minutes despite the place being mostly empty. Apparently no one was paying attention or just didn't care that there were potential customers waiting at the door. We were all hungry so we persevered and were finally seated. As I mentioned, we all ordered the fish tacos. Our server recommended them and said that they were the best fish tacos she had ever had. When our tacos arrived we were not super impressed. The fish fillets on the tacos were tough and just barely warm. The corn tortillas were also tough, almost hard in spots. Everything was extremely greasy and bland.

Our server came back and asked us how everything was, when we told her that it was not good she argued with us! She said that their fish tacos are really good, but of course we couldn't expect them to be great because this wasn't a Mexican restaurant. This is the same woman who had 20 minutes previously told us these were the best fish tacos she had ever eaten! The manager came over and offered us a third off of our bill, we accepted because we just wanted to leave and certainly didn't have time to wait for something else to be prepared.

We asked them to split the bill into three equal portions, which they did without a problem. Two of us paid with cards and one member of our party paid with cash. She paid with a $20 bill (her total was $9) and the server never came back with her change! She just disappeared.

Thoroughly disappointing, I'll never return."}
{"text":"Great place in the Golden Nugget and open 24 hours! Perfect for breakfast if you don't go to the Buffet!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it was beautiful inside. But my food was so salty, it was like eating a salt lick. Our waitress was an older woman, with VERY heavy perfume. She seemed like she was trying to be nice, but she made kind of a rude comment for adding a vegetable to my entr√©e."}
{"text":"What's one to do when one has a Claim Jumper gift card to use and the local Claim Jumper closes down? Bring the gift card Vegas!

That's exactly what happened to me and what I did. Someone gave a Claim gift card as a gift awhile back but I never got to use it. When the one near me closed down, I didn't really want to drive a long way to another one. When my trip to Vegas came around, I remembered a Claim Jumper that I'd always drive by on previous trips and I decided to bring my gift card with me.

We went to Claim Jumper on a Saturday night and this place was packed! We didn't have to wait for a table however and our menus were presented to us right away. I got the gold rush chicken dish which the waiter claimed was his absolute favorite. The other two in my party got the meatload and a pizza respectively. 

Like other yelpers mentioned, the wait time for the food to come out was long! The waiter came by twice to apologize and tell us the food would be on it's way. We were all pretty hungry by the time the dishes came out.

It was a good thing though that we were hungry because the portion sizes are huge! Both the meatloaf and the gold rush chicken dishes had two pieces of their respective meats. These dishes also came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables. 

The gold rush chicken dish was good. The chicken was tender and flavorful with the melted cheese on top and it well with the oh so soft mashed potatoes! I loved the grilled vegetables! It had a good mix of eggplant, carrots, zucchini and squash! Yum! I got to try a little bit of the meatloaf and this was also good. The meatloaf had a tomato like flavor to it.

The dishes were so big that we had leftovers that lasted for two more meals! (Another's day's lunch and dinner). It was that much food! Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but the giant motherload chocolate cake that we saw upfront looked absolutely delicious! Hmm maybe next time ;)?"}
{"text":"A meal from hell.  My tri-tip was ok, as was the meals for my wife and one of our daughters.  However the calzone that the other daughter ordered came out with raw dough.  They made another one and it was also raw.  The manager said he would take care of it and he wouldn't charge use for it.  At that point we ordered a barbecue chicken .pizza.  Well the first thing we see on the pizza is a decent size chicken bone. So we call the manger over and he says he will take that one off the bill and did we want anything else.  He then went off to get us the bill. When he comes back he states he would take off half the bill.  We reminded him that it took two house for this fiasco and he would either take the whole bill or we would be speaking to corporate later.  So two hours later and my one daughter leaves hungry.  They completely ruined our family meal."}
{"text":"First time ever eating at Claim Jumper. We have one by our house back in California, but never been. Lets just say we had the BEST experience at this location. My boyfriend and I came around 11pm. Our server was Jon. He was very prompt and friendly. We have NEVER had such great service at any restaurant. Jon went out of his way to make sure we always had full glasses and we enjoyed our food. Everything came out super quick. You don't find many great servers that actually enjoy their job like Jon. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We ate here last month, but we were just up there again yesterday in the same parking lot. The first time we went, there was an awful rotten egg smell permeating the air. This is the place one of our friends was determined to go though, so we went in. The food was great, but the smell was still in the air as we were leaving. We thought it was a one-off thing, but yesterday the same smell hit us immediately as we approached Claim Jumper while driving through the parking lot. Otherwise, the service was great and the food the same as any other Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"I really couldn't tell you what it is that makes my boyfriend love this place (I happen to think it's all the ketchup they offer you in little bowls--being that he's in love with ketchup like he's in love with me, but who knows?). Anyways, he does and so we've been a few times. The service, I'm not going to lie, is exceptional. They are very friendly and knowing of someone who had to work at this particular one can say that they know their stuff (they *have* to). I have tried the veggie burger and it was the same kind of patty they use at Dennys (Boca burger, I believe), so it wasn't exceptional or anything. Another time I ordered the individual mozzarella and tomato pizza. It was pretty good. Whenever he gets a Claim Jumper craving, I'm going to order it again."}
{"text":"The food is good. Service was a bit slow but it was dinner time and we had a large group. The server was apologetic and friendly. 
I would return."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my birthday, and I have to say that I'm more than a little disappointed at the place now. It used to be one of my favourite restaurants ever but I'm dropping it to three stars now (it barely missed out on two).

In order to explain why I have to take you back in time to my very first visit to a Claim Jumper back in 1999 or so. It was in California and I was visiting the US for the first time. There was a two hour wait (which I had NEVER experienced in Oz - who the hell would wait two full HOURS to eat dinner?? #murica, that's who). Back then they had cards with words on them - like \"Golden Nugget\" or \"Prospector's Trail\" that they gave you because restaurant pagers hadn't been invented. They would call out \"Golden Nugget, party of four\" when your table was ready, I suppose so that your privacy wasn't invaded by your name being blasted out over the intercom? Anyway. We all went in and the first thing I noticed were the size of the seats and tables. I was wondering what manner of creatures needed seat benches a full two yards deep, until I saw some of the patrons. Five hundred pound people waddling about, it was straight up like being on that spaceship out of Wall-E. Anyway. Got my meal and it was gigantic! There was even a red apple on the plate as a bonus. I was amazed and delighted at the variety of foods and the portion size.

Fast forward several years to after I'd moved to the US and been living here for a few years. My teammates and I went to this CJ's for lunch one day. I wasn't feeling hungry so I thought I would just order an appetizer, and got the nachos. When everyone's meals were brought out, the nachos plate was singularly the largest thing on the table. At least two pounds of food, and my god was it delicious. I ate and ate until I was stuffed, boxed the rest and STILL had two meals' worth out of the remainder. Best/biggest nachos EVER.

They have an appetizer/side called cheese potatocakes, that are served with this white \"herbed salsa\" drizzle. They and the nachos were my absolute favourite appetizers of any restaurant. Purely divine. And then the have their prime rib - not spectacularly prepared or anything, just really well cooked and delicious. The prime rib became my favourite prime ever, over and above any steak restaurant I'd ever been to, except perhaps the one from Cattlemens which used to be on 83rd Ave in Peoria.

I didn't go to CJ's super often, because it is a little on the expensive side, but each time I went I enjoyed my meal thoroughly and it was quite a treat no matter the dish or the time of day.

Back to the present now. I went to CJs fully expecting to order my classic favourite, the prime rib. I didn't see it on the menu. And I learned that they don't sell it anymore. Not only don't they serve apples on your plate now, but they don't even have the bowl of apples at the front door that they used to have. They no longer serve the country's best nachos platter anymore. They no longer serve the \"I Declair\", a giant custard/pastry/whipped cream dessert that was the size of a loaf of bread. They no longer have the goat cheese and beet salad. Their menu has shrunk to about half its size.

The waitress was okay, but just a little clumsy in her delivery. She asked us if we wanted dessert when one of us was actually in the restroom at the time, for example. Nothing real bad but just.. *shrug*

They still have their potatocakes and those were still as delicious as ever. But the bread used to be this darker pumpernickel if I recall, and now they have some sort of cheese loaf. They used to have this amazing texas cheesy toast served as a side. Last night I didn't see that as an option. And my thirty dollar (!!!) one-pound ribeye was NOT worth thirty dollars. Honestly, I can buy a one-pound ribeye myself for eight dollars and pan fry it in some Penzey's spices at home with no drama at all. For thirty bucks I want something that's pretty damn close to Gordon Ramsay quality. This was a good steak, but it was absolutely nothing special. And finally, I got a honey pineapple margarita. It was okay, but tasted very little of honey and nothing whatsoever of pineapple. I should have just got the standard frozen marg.

Actually, we should have just gone somewhere else. I'm dropping the score here not because I got a cockroach in my meal or the flatware was dirty or anything like that. I'm dropping it because of my abject disappointment at returning to a restaurant I once considered among my top five eateries that has completely fallen from its previously-great heights and is now nothing more than an average crapbox place with woefully overinflated prices. The lack of a significant wait for a table on the Saturday night before Mother's Day seems to prove that I'm not alone in this sentiment. Bye CJs. It was real.. once."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper continues to be my all-round favourite restaurant in the US. First time I ate at one in California I was blown away by the portion size (so big that they were serving apples on the plates) and also by the taste of the food. Their prime rib is absolutely delicious, and second favourite of mine is the rotisserie chicken - especially with their barbecue sauce. In fact, if you get any steak there, get that BBQ sauce and slather it on - it's wonderful.

Varied menu, giant portions, reasonable price, consistently excellent service, giant tables available (they're usually spacious as hell inside), lunchtime portions, and the biggest desserts I've ever seen in my life. No exaggeration, the \"I Declair\" custard eclair is literally more than enough for four people and about the size of a loaf of bread. And the amount of drinks they have almost defies belief, although I'm not a mega-alcoholic I find myself continually shaking my head every time I look at their drink list.

They do call-ahead seating as well. For most locations, including this one, it's probably a good idea to take advantage of that as Claim Jumpers are often packed on Fridays and Saturdays.

Meal highlights: Prime Rib, Nachos (one serving is enough for FOUR people), Rotisserie Chicken and possibly the most delicious appetizer on the planet, Cheese Potatocakes.

Really, this place just craps on everywhere else. If I was ever on death row, I'd have my last meal ordered from this restaurant hands down. I'd give them ten stars if I could."}
{"text":"Here's a restaurant that has absolutely ZERO control over their kitchen and their wait staff. I'm highly allergic to eggs, so when I order something I always request that they check with the chef first to ensure I'll be safe. I ordered one of their Widow Maker burgers during happy hour and twice asked the waiter about the egg issue. He assured me it was fine. When it came, it had a sauce that looked suspiciously like mayonnaise. When he went back to the kitchen, he must have asked the dish washer about the eggs, because he came back and said \"All OK\" and I dove in. Within three minutes, I was in the restroom choking. It was LOADED with eggs. When you are in business to serve people food and you can't get your kitchen to prepare something without eggs, that's a sad state of affairs. The boss was called over, a guy named Paul, and he basically did nothing. We left with a $20 bill and sick as a dog. The food my partner had was served luke warm and was marginal at best. This is not a quality establishment, for sure!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here twice last week while staying at the Golden Nugget.  I have to admit, the food was excellent. 

The place is very clean.  Prices are reasonable (for Vegas).

My only reason for the 4-star was the slooooooooow service on Friday Morning.  The server seemed almost annoyed that she had to bring me my food."}
{"text":"I avoided eating here because of its historically known giant portions.  That is no longer the issue.   Now, when I order there are actually healthy options like spinach Ahi salad with normal portions.  The mini pizza is really mini. The plates are big, but portions reasonable. The mother load cake is giant to be shared.  Nice happy hour drinks until 6:30pm. In town square mall. family of four $80 approx"}
{"text":"What can I really say...everything is big and great.  I come here often and have never been disappointed.  Very high consistency."}
{"text":"I just had dinner with a group friends, and with all of us being as original as we are, we all decided to be cheap and get the 4.75 california quesadilla. Little did we know, we all asked for chicken, and when the bill came for the table, we were all charged 11.95 for the chicken quesadilla! How were we supposed to know?! Our waiter was the nicest guy in the world, but he gave us little tips on what foods to choose.

Customer service wise, great people who love to help, but you would have to ask! Come to this restaurant with an extremely empty stomach because two people can share one plate it seems!"}
{"text":"I went to this Claim Jumper last night (8/6/14) for happy hour and was really impressed with the food and service.

Their happy hour menu has a great assortment of food and is affordable.  Our waiter Efren was very attentive and polite.  At one point he was running to our table when he saw me trying to get his attention.

But what really impressed me was when I noticed I forgot my reciept this morning, I called to see if I could pickup the reciept today and instead they emailed it to me right away.  IMPRESSIVE!

Thanks Efren and Jeanna!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Was not that busy and had to wait an hour for food to come out. Almost feels like they forgot we were here."}
{"text":"bleu cheese butter on my rib eye steak?? YES PLEASE!!! quick service and great food...the prices are on the high side but its high end food..."}
{"text":"As always Claim Jumper has tons of choices and very large portions. The wait staff was wonderful. I just got a burger, but it was cooked to order and perfect.  Would I go back?  I always do."}
{"text":"I have been going to Claim Jumper for probably over 10 years. I have known it  to have a warm and attractive atmosphere where the service is usually excellent and the food is always good. Claim Jumper is a wonderful place to sit and be able to talk to friends or family. There is no loud blaring music. Claim Jumper has  got a huge menu that you can make choices from and you are able to make substitutions to their menu. This visit was no different. I came here to meet my friend for dinner where we both needed to relax and just eat good food and talk. Claim Jumper always has a very attentive wait staff making sure we had everything we needed. I think it's funny that they always ask you if you want dessert considering their portions are huge. Would I come back here again yes yes yes."}
{"text":"Hi again folks! so it has been quite some time since I have been to Claim Jumpers. Me and the lady took my son out for late lunch. I was happy to see that a vegetarian section was on the menu. Very many vegan choices but was happy anyways for the effort. The place is still decorated with that country and snow Lodge feel. The people are nice and our server was nice. Probably could have been a little more friendly but they were nice. I ordered the lemon pepper fried zucchini sticks and a side of fries. My wifey ordered the pork sliders with fries. My son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. While we were waiting they got our drinks and delivered a cheesy bread which I couldn't have but both my son and wife said it was really good. I didn't see much of my server but my drinks stayed filled and the manager walk by one time and said hi. Now let's get to the food. Portion size is still large which is a plus. Like I've said before leftovers are always great. Each meal looks very appetizing and the food was tasty. My wife and son both agreed and the atmosphere was nice as well we sat outside in the patio. good job Claim Jumper! Keep it up it seems to be working! If I could add anything it would be more vegan options. Now I don't want to take away from this place as it is a meat-and-potatoes kind of establishment. But maybe a couple vegan options wouldn't be bad. Thanks again for a good time!"}
{"text":"I only come to this place when there's an occasion to celebrate. This restaurant is fancy! 

25 people accommodated in the center of the dinning area. We only had one server but he was a good one, very pleasant and good looking too (according to then girls I was with). 

I ordered the Shrimp Fresca pasta w/ Spinach, (no tomato) in a lemon kind of sauce. It was the first one that stood out to me and one of the ones that had a picture inside their menu. Speaking of, they had so much to choose from in their menu that it was slightly overwhelming for some people, including myself, to choose what to order. 

Nice place to dine in."}
{"text":"The food is great here, for a price.  Though if you look hard enough, you can find a decent priced meal.  I came for a holiday meal with some friends this past weekend.  There are many new restaurants and businesses in the area, so it was fairly packed (not to mention all of the out-of-towners for the bowl games).

As usual the soft pretzel appetizer was amazing, a double order for the 5 of us was sufficient.  I got the BBQ chicken sandwich (which was about $10).  It was well worth it on delicious tomato/cheesy bread that was roughly the size of a frisbee.  

Though we were all stuffed, we splurged on the \"I Declaire\" Eclaire dessert.  It was a good choice to split among the 5 of us, though there was still some left over at the end it was not due to taste but due to limitations of the human body..."}
{"text":"First time at the Golden Nugget.  Wanted to find a restaurant off the street with good food.  The General Tso's chicken was delicious and their Chinese food is made at the Chinese parent restaurant so it's authentic.  A neighboring table had the pot pie and it looked amazing. Must try that next time.  Loved the bread at the table too.   Waiter was very friendly and the wait was about 15 minutes. Great experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Server was a little slow but he did bring my kid a Carafe of Shirley temples with extra cherries so that rocked! She loved it ! I think the serve maybe had alot of floor to walk that place wish huge and we were but the big windows. Anyway nice and clean good food good service."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with the food this time around. I ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was kind've salty. The broccoli was cold, the chicken was over salted and somewhat tough. Not the usual quality of food that I am used to here."}
{"text":"Like the Arby's commercial (which I love), meeeeee likey.

When I lived in CA, I frequented CJ quite a bit and never had a disappointing meal.  I think I'm secretly in love with the chocolate mother lode cake and disguise it by saying how much I enjoy the restaurant and think their food is great, yada, yada, yada.  

I was happy to see this location in NV and decided to get my favorite salad, the California Citrus Salad, to go.  It's a great combination of greens, avocados, mandarin oranges, green onions, golden raisins, cranberries and candied walnuts.  Soooooooooo good!  

While waiting for our orders, my co-worker and I decided to get a brownie to split.  It was big, of course, so it was like having one whole \"normal\" brownie.  Sad to say, this was the first disappointing thing I've had.  It wasn't as moist inside as I expected, not as chewy on the outside as I would have liked, and I now realize I don't care for nuts with my brownies.   Oh well.  It was chocolate, so there was no way I wasn't going to finish it.

If you haven't been to CJ, you're in for a treat.  Just save room for the chocolate mother lode cake!"}
{"text":"Arrival time: 12:14pm
Bill received: 1:54pm
Customers: 1Adult /1 Teenager / 1 pacient toddler
We were seated in a booth. Carpet underneath contained a lot of food debris and someones pocket change. 
A lunchtime \"15 minute wait\" turned into a 43 minute wait and was knowingly handed an inop buzzer but told, \"...it will be okay...its flashing & vibrating, just wait for it to stop or when it vibrates continuously\" (which it already did and \"LO\" on device may have meant low battery??)
Batter dipped zucchini spears tasted like fish; didn't bother returning them. Tortilla strips served w/ Artichoke dip were saturated with grease & excess salt. Missing napkins & silverware when appetizers arrived & were almost done eating them when they were delivered, after asking waiter twice. Daughter had dental appointment after lunch but still cut it close to arriving late to appt. We were not prepared for a near 2-hour lunch at a barely mediocre restaurant at best.
My advice to consumers: Order a To-Go dessert and you may  be satisfied with Claim Jumperso in Avondale. The To-Go dessert we ordered was absolutely AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Great place! The bread was amazing and it was only a short time until our salads and entrees arrived. Friendly host and waitress. Food was all great (steaks and jambalaya) and we all left full and satisfied - especially after sharing a piece of six-layer chocolate cake! Great service with great food."}
{"text":"The one thing that Claim Jumper does that makes it unique is HUGE SERVINGS.  We're talking, leftovers for days servings.  The service is usually pretty attentive and quick, although there can be a bit of a wait some evenings.

This is my mom's place to go out to eat when she has her choice.  It's...OK.  I mean, yeah, it's huge - but sometimes you sacrifice quality for quantity.  It's pretty much standard, chain, Apostrophe S food.  Nothing thrilling.

Their huge chocolate cake slice, however, rules the school.  7 or 9 layers or something like that.  I blame it for my stomach."}
{"text":"Easily the worst restaurant service I've experienced combined with incorrect orders and mediocre food.  Feels like any other option would be better."}
{"text":"When we saw a Claim Jumper, we were pleasantly surprised since we had not been in to a Claim Jumper in YEARS, but had good memories of the food. Despite the reviews, we decided to give it a try for old times sake. Sadly, I think the meat they served me was actually from the last time we ate there... but I digress. 

The restaurant was relatively empty when we arrived. Our server was pleasant. We ordered our food/drinks and eagerly awaited the foods arrival. We were hungry after a long day of car shopping and had one more place to stop that supposedly had the car with the amenities we wanted in stock, but food first as we knew it could be a lengthy process. 

Our orders went in promptly, but it took a long time for our drinks to arrive (no refills), the. A surprisingly small salad and much longer still for the meals. Both our meals looked good. I eagerly dug into the mashed potatoes for the chicken fried steak, which was delicious. I then took a bite of the chicken fried steak and something seemed....OFF. I chewed for a moment thinking maybe it was an unusual spice... but it was SO WEIRD, that I began to worry that it was spoiled and spit it out. Never in my life have I eaten food that actually TASTED spoiled!  GAG!!!   My husband then tried it, to see if it was a weird spice, and he too thought it was spoiled/funky. I stopped eating and pushed my plate away so I could let her know, even leaving the mashed potatoes since I was sending it back.  She didn't come back for at least 20 minutes. In the interim, my husband shared his chicken salad sandwich and fries with me. The sandwich was okay, but had more mayo than meat, which was disappointing. 

When the server came back, she apologized and said the manager would come to see us. We asked if it would be soon, because we had somewhere to be. We should have just asked for the check because A) we waited for another 20-30 minutes with ZERO service or a manager ever arriving. B) we had a car we wanted to buy. 

Long, disgusting story shortened, the manager never came but the price was removed from our check. This whole nasty ordeal took 2 HOURS!!! No inquiries or apologies were made, no compensation other than removing the one item from the bill (maybe I would've ordered something else??). We left hungry, grossed out AND the car we wanted to buy had been sold
In the interim. Ugh! 

I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!! #vomit"}
{"text":"Chain steakhouse with great portions. Sit in their saloon to skip the wait at the door."}
{"text":"Usually the food is good ....but I picked up a roast tri- tip and the cook poured the glaze over the meat instead of putting it in a container like I got last time. See pic for the result."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place for a nice dinner out either as a couple or as a family. But the last two times we have gone, the prices have gone way up, portions have gone way down and wait time for your food is ridiculous! The only positive is the staff is still friendly and works hard to do a good job but it doesn't cover up the lack of quality or quantity. Sadly I would not recommend this to anyone in the future."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on their opening night and boy am I glad we did. We were greeted by the hostess upon arrival and promptly brought to a table. Our waitress came by shortly after and took our orders and then brought over some of that wonderful herb seasoned bread with the marinara sauce... Omg yum! We decided on entrees my bf got the ribs and I got the sirloin. Both meals were cooked to perfection. The ribs were fall off the bone and packed a lot of flavor. We were very impressed with the wonderful service here. I will definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"They served awful crumbling pancakes my experience was completely diminished especially when he didn't take it off the check!  Took 50%! Just an awful experience!  Server was a very sweet lady! Nice tip for her!"}
{"text":"The Rotisserie Chicken with Double Veggies -  Pellegrino (with limes) Health meal tonight!"}
{"text":"Came with 12 other friends and we were seated promptly but we didn't get menus. I had to go up to the front to get my own and one of the waiters just told me to take as many as I want and when he found out we didn't get any, he asked me for the ones I took because he \"had to do something\". 

Ordered the lighter option of the country fried steak and holy cow, it was still huge! It was good but nothing special. Came with mashed potatoes and a biscuit, both were basic. My friend just ordered a baked potato with sour cream and butter and she asked for more. Took about 15 minutes for the waitress to bring it out to her and she was almost finished with her $5 baked potato. My other friend ordered tenderloin tips and he said his plate was good and the vegetables were grilled nicely. 

A plus is that we were able to get separate checks."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience! Best food we've had on our vacation so far and I doubt it will be beat! Great service, amazing food, and good prices as well! Will be making this a must go to place every time we return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Just called to make a reservation.
Me- \"hi may I make a reservation\" 
Her- \"no, you can walk in we need 24 hour advance.\"
Me- \"it's actually for Saturday\"
Her-\"oh yeah, hang on\" 
Puts me on hold.

With the attitude I just received I'm thinking of taking my party of 12 somewhere else. Let's hope the service makes up for the already rude service I received. 

UPDATE: should have taken my phone call as a DO NOT COME HERE experience. 

One of the host was rude as hell the one who sat us actually apologized for the others rudeness! Haha 
Upon being sat we all received a glass of water then asked if we wanted appetizers, we ordered a couple then i asked for apple juice for my child so everyone else started ordering drinks, well our rude ass server gave us attitude like we already had drinks why order more. Our waiter was rude and kept giving everyone dirty looks, yes we were a big party but defiantly no excuse to give dirty looks and treat us badly. When refilling drinks he refilled some wrong, asked to have it fixed and he gave major attitude to my grandmother and said he can handle it .... Still brought back the wrong drinks (root beer instead of Dr Pepper) they just drank it anyways. One of the people at out table did not like their meal a manager came out and asked if there was something else they could get him he said can I just have ketchup and I will try to eat this, he tried didn't like it so asked for the drunken chicken to go. Nothing was compensated they tried to charge him for both he had to ask the server to take the bill back and take one off. I will never return to this restaurant!!! If I could give 0 starts on the service I would!"}
{"text":"Claim jumper - Fremont Street
When friends and family come visit we usually hit the Golden Nugget in downtown. There are a few good restaurants in here but claim Jumper is the favorite and it's 24 hours. I asked our server Tami if I could order something that was not on the late-night menu and she said she would ask the manager. Never had to ask for refills, sauces of any kind, even the check. She said she reminds  all of her guests about yelp. Great service and great food, as always!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Claim Jumpers for a while. But it was an amazing lunch. Our waitress, Kelly was super. Ask for her when you go to Claim Jumpers. Wow, the pretzels were the BEST. The tri tip sandwich and chicken fried chicken were amazing. We'll start coming more often!!!!"}
{"text":"Took forever to get my food. Approximately 45 minutes for just a Kids Pizza and A Burger... I definitely would not recommend this location. And the manager's are so tacky... Never again..."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's and bread bowls are so delicious! Our server seemed like she was really stressed though or intoxicated bc she was a little forgetful and took a while for waters and such. Food was yummy and the atmosphere was cool. Nothing out of the ordinary but I'll most likely be back for another bread bowl!"}
{"text":"I'm totally missing something here.  I think the food is terrible.  I hear great things.  I've even gone 5 or 6 times thinking I must have just ordered the wrong thing.  One time a friend of mine ordered the rib eye and they brought out a sirloin.  They did correct it, but in the end neither were good.  I've tried the burgers, they were bad.  The calamari is not real calamari, just long strings of fried.  Chicken dishes are bland, ribs were terrible and this looks like the type of place to get ribs.  I just don't get it.

So many people love them.  I don't see it."}
{"text":"If this wasn't a 'chain restaurant', I would have given it five stars.  But it loses one star for being one, unfortunately.  However, the service I got while here was absolutely terrific.

The server was sweet & kind.  The food was on the money.  I ordered the \"GoldRush Chicken\" with a salad, and three of us split \"Chocolate Motherlode Cake\".  We all had food left on our plates, as well as the cake was hardly touched, after we all ate a healthy portion of it.

I went to buy a t-shirt as a memory of the trip, and they were out of my size.  So, the manager gave me a larger shirt, for free!!  He had me laughing and made me feel so welcome, that I vowed to definitely come back the next time I am out in Vegas.  

A great spot, great food, and wonderful, welcoming employees."}
{"text":"Occasionally, the office will order lunch from Claim Jumper and I also pass this location on my way to work every morning, but I've never actually dined at the restaurant until a couple weeks ago. My family had a good first experience here!

Our food was just okay, I'll be honest, but the service we received from Warren was absolutely phenomenal! Exceptional to say the least. Warren was very courteous and helpful, especially when we had questions about the menu. Warren was also attentive and on his A-game from start to finish. My family loved his outgoing personality!

I ordered the Drunk Chicken (what a name) and it was actually better than I had expected. The chicken was extremely tender and still maintained its moisture, despite the fact that it's grilled chicken breast. The Bacon-Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce tasted mainly of bacon and was a bit too oily, but yummy nonetheless. Who doesn't love bacon? \"Potatocakes\" aka croquettes were nice and creamy... As if I needed more carb intake after that mouth-watering garlic cheese bread!

The portions at Claim Jumper are generous and very filling. We all went home with leftovers! I wish I had room for dessert because the Chocolate Motherlode Cake looks to-die-for!"}
{"text":"Love Claim Jumper!  Went there for my wife's birthday dinner and everything was absolutely delicious!  Ordered some calamari and artichoke dip appetizers and ribeye steaks for our main entree.  Everything was so tasty!  Our server was very friendly and efficient.  We love the setting and the raging fireplace was very nice since it was cold that night.  Claim Jumper is one of our favorite restaurants.  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday happy hour disappointed its hard for our server/bartender when he's the only person staffed to handle the whole bar and the surrounding seating food was really good. Drink prices could be better for happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. First time at a Claim Jumpers and it won't be my last. Our server's name was Dillon, and he was awesome!! We had a party of 8, and he shared with us their most popular appetizers and main dishes. We had the zucchini sticks and onion rings to start, we also ordered their famous homemade strawberry lemonade and tropical tea (which are both bottomless btw). He also helped suggest a better way of ordering one of their lunch items for a better deal which my dad appreciated. We didn't save room for dessert, but it was my uncle's birthday and Dillon was nice enough to bring out a small dessert for us to try. I'm pretty sure it was a buttercake...whatever it was...it was SO GOOD, left my dad speechless.  It was like a half and half mix between \"haole brownie\" if you're from Hawaii you know what that is and CPKs butter cake. 

The portions are generous, prices are reasonable and service was great!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing!  Ordered chicken fried steak and it was over seasoned, heavy and just bland .  Overall,  very disappointing as I love chicken fried steak and I'm  not a picky eater. Told server about and they didn't offer an alternative.  I barely ate it and still charged me for it.  Bad food and service!  Maybe it's my fault because I also had fried calimari and fried zucchini as appetizers and all fried food tasted the same and it was just blah. Nothing special considering what they charge.  Don't come here KFC has better food if that gives you a perspective.   Not coming back and don't recommend you come here either."}
{"text":"The main meals great.  The service slow for a party of 9 it took 2 hours to eat.  The dessert of red velvet bundt cake was gross.  Dry and the frosting was sour. Do not order that ever.  
Such a high priced place and if the service was good I would have given it a 4.  Nothing for dessert."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would BEWARE the general manager of this location is a complete asshole! Went in for my moms birthday eat here all the time and I admit her food and two of my adult sons dishes came out good but my third son and I ended up leaving with nothing to eat.  He ordered medium well got rare the cut of meat do bad couldn't cut thru it then I had the rotisserie chicken w baked potato and there was a pebble in my potato witnessed by the waitress and the asshole manager walked away before the conversation was over and brought me a fresh potato did he bother to listen that the fricking pebble broke my tooth!  Like I was going to eat anything at all after losing a tooth down to the gums really? Ya corporate here I come this dude has no customer service is rude and there is no way I will ever come here again"}
{"text":"The interior is really nice and comforting. However, the food is mediocre at best. Their shoestring fries are pretty good, but everything else is bland. The food took an hour to arrive at the table. Service wasn't the best."}
{"text":"We have a girls lunch out once a month and chose this place for December.  Boy, what a mistake.  I went to the one in Henderson when I moved here back in '03 and I remember it being very good.  I don't know if they've all gone downhill or just this location.

First of all it took about 20 mins to get our drinks and another 10 before our order was taken.  30 minutes to place an order on a Saturday at 1pm?  Not that it mattered because they could have brought out random plates from the kitchen and still would have gotten the same amount of orders right.  The waiter was nice enough but when we pointed out the errors he replied \"What do you want me to do?\"  Well after waiting almost an hour to get our crappy, cold, incorrect food we didn't want to risk sending it back to the kitchen and wait for them to correct it.  We were told \"the kitchen was slammed\" ... did he not know we were sitting in the same room he was?  And that we have eyes?  Because the place was less than half full so I fail to see how they could be \"slammed\", which by the way is also not my problem.  I don't care if the manager didn't staff properly or people called in, you're supposed to be professionals at this level, its not Burger King.

Anyway, my pretzel appetizer was wrong, my blackened chicken pasta was cold and bland, and they make mojitos with ground leaves for you to choke on.

I was really disappointed and doubt I'll go back to any Claim Jumpers as there are so many other places to try in LV."}
{"text":"My kids sent us here for our anniversary and I gotta say it was pretty good."}
{"text":"hell yeah!  I just ate a muffin with whipped butter that's as big as my head!

jerk chicken with sweet potato was great.  baked potato was as big as a football.  they need to test the food here for some serious growth hormones..."}
{"text":"Another 5 star for me.  We went to the Vegas location while we were at a trade show.  We actually went there twice in the same week because of their famous margaritas.  I had the chicken pot pie the first time and a traditional cheese burger the second.  Both meals were fantastic, but the chicken pot pie is a must have.  Huge and delicious.  Prices were a bit high but worth it.  Takes like home cooked and not production food.  I will definitely return for the pot pie."}
{"text":"I was craving chocolate cake!  Came for dessert and ended up not getting my usual chocolate cake.  They had their cheesecake pumpkin pie which was rich and creamy.  I had the red velvet bunt cake which was the cake was light and airy and the frost was creamy not too rich.  We also dove into some calamari and the slaw that comes with it yum!!! The slaw reminds me of a Chinese chicken salad. I usually hate slaw but this one yum!!! The calamari was thick cuts of calamari which was coated perfectly and crispy on the out tender on the inside."}
{"text":"Terrible Service and Terrible Food! I went around 5pm with my boyfriend for his birthday dinner, and we ordered a burger and fish and chips. The burger was good and huge for a 10+ burger. Fish and Chips were horrible! The fish weren't cooked through and it was so mushy in the middle. I gagged. My stomach felt weird after and I threw it up because the after taste was still there. I told the waiter, and then the manager came. The manager didn't even apologize he just told me \"I'll take that plate for you\" and then left. What kind of service is that? They took that off from my bill but man at least the waiter was nice! Good tip for him but the manager is horrible! Dear god fire him! You guys gave me food poisoning!"}
{"text":"First visit. Won't be the last. We had the Tri-tip Sandwich and Veggie Wrap.

Mmmeaty Tri-tip Sandwich with side of au jus and fries.

Veggie Wrap. Spinach, red onion, avocado, roasted red peppers, tomatoes, cucumber, olives, feta, cream cheese, ranch dressing. The side of Thai slaw was filling!

Our server was Shane. Great, friendly, attentive service!"}
{"text":"We came in for a turkey dinner on Thanksgiving with a family of six. Our reservation is for 5 PM and they ran out of turkey at 4:30 PM. What a shock. I highly recommend getting a Stouffers frozen food turkey dinner if you want Turkey on Thanksgiving and you come to Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"We've always liked the food at Claim Jumpers.  The Cob Salad is great and huge.  But today they really surprised us.  We walked in and one of my kids says, can we have a red velvet cupcake for dessert dad?  I said let's see how we are doing when we are done eating.  As we were nearing the end of our meal, the restaurant manager came over with the cupcake and said, I heard you guys up front at the check in when your son asked if they could order the cupcake and I wanted to give you this one.  Talk about surprise and delight.  They went way our of the  way for us for no reason at all.  We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it's very cool.  The staff if very friendly and attentive, made some great suggestions for meals.

We had a large party for Mother's Day, the food was great and the atmosphere gave us a comfortable place to visit and catch up.

I would recommend this Claim Jumper if you are look for good food, service and food"}
{"text":"Service was good, tri-tip & mashed potatoes were excellent & the portion was huge. I would give 5 stars, but my husband's steak & shrimp was way over priced for the portion size! Also, fries were so good. I couldn't stop eating them!"}
{"text":"I used to like Claim Jumper more. If you're hungry and come here, the food is usually good and you'll probably still take something home which is nice and this is why I'm giving 3 stars. The service is lacking big time regardless of restaurant location. They seem to have kitchen timing issues or something...the food for the whole party never comes at the same time, ever. Not the brightest waiter either - it came to the point where we were betting on the next dumb thing he'd do."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but I am sorry to say we won't be back. After 2 visits with horrible service we gave them one more shot last night. What happened to the food? The black tie pasta was over cooked and mushy. The portion size was small. And the cake - my all time favorite motherlode, awful!  Dry and tasteless. It's a sad day..."}
{"text":"This restaurant served good food, but we were very disappointed that they didn't have their chocolate lava cake available when we were there for dinner.  When we ordered the cake, we were told that they forgot to prepare the cake and it would take an hour for the cake to be ready."}
{"text":"Worst ever like a big Denny's. Service was very pushy. Couldn't relax because we were asked every two seconds if we were ready to order. My soup was cold and salad tasted old and nasty, also my margarita tasted like juice. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Won't ever come here again. 
Had the ribeye it had hardly any flavor at all. The server never asked how the food was. But I mentioned several times that my food wasn't any good and she did nothing. When boxing our other food my boyfriend said box it up and I said I'm not going to eat I didn't like it at all... And the server was there when I said this and still did nothing. I'm also a server and when a guest is upset I do whatever I can to make them happy. I was CLEARLY upset and She did not do a thing. The guest should always feel taken care of, but sadly here it felt like they could care less."}
{"text":"I never wait to be seated.  I like the bar area, it has tables and benches, ect. and never has a wait.  You feel like you are sitting in the main part of the restaurant.

I really enjoyed the veggie burger I had last time we were there.  It was better than I've had at fancy restaurants.

The huge portions are fun because you always have enough for a meal the following day."}
{"text":"Apparently they've changed things up in the last few years. All I had heard for years was how huge the portions are, and it just wasn't like that at all.

I started out with a Mai Tai - it came in a huge glass, which was a little intimidating, but it was mostly ice, so turned out to be a normal drink. Tasty, nothing extraordinary.

I ordered a 12-oz ribeye along with fried mac and cheese. The steak was cooked nicely, had a pretty good flavor. The fried macaroni was pretty interesting. Had a sweet crunch on the outside, and just regular macaroni and cheese inside.

For dessert I went with a chocolate chip cookie and ice cream - pretty good, and not a crazy portion.

Overall, I liked it, but just don't see a huge draw. I'd probably keep it in the same category as Cheesecake Factory or someplace like that, where I wouldn't make a special trip to go, but wouldn't avoid either."}
{"text":"My husband and I met my parents here for dinner and were sat at 8:05pm a few weeks ago. The young man that sat us made a remark that they were slow and our server Wendy(?) would be at our table shortly. He was correct that the restaurant wasn't busy. There were 3 servers bustling around (you'd think they had sections that were full, but each server had one or maybe 2 tables.  We sat there with our menus for about 10 minutes and finally someone took our drink order (not Wendy).  He drops off the drinks (2 waters and 2 sodas) and we still wait for Wendy to take our order. Every once in a while when I tried to make eye contact with any employee they rushed by us like we weren't even there. I was getting very irritated by the lack of service so far because we have always had great service when we have dined at this location. In fact, we already knew what we were going to order.  No one even acknowledged our table. My parents being old school didn't want to leave and just wanted to wait longer for a server. By then we had been sitting at the table for over 35 minutes. We got up and left. I have never walked out of an establishment. The host that walked us to our table opened the door for us and told us thanks for dining with them and I told him we didn't even eat and no one stopped at our table to even take our food order. He just snickered, waved and said \"ok!\" We ate somewhere else. I will never go back to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT RIBS! and just amount of sauce to cover them! mashed potatoes are delish. shoestring fries are delish. grilled veggies are delish. excellent service but dimly lit in their seating area. kinda didn't like that type of atmosphere when eating my riiiibs!"}
{"text":"Tonight was a reminder why I don't eat at claim jumper if I can help it.  It was my son's bday and his choice, so we went. Took forever for someone to come greet us after sitting down, food was so so, took a long time and just luke warm when it came out, seemed like it probably sat for a while before being delivered. When we were finished, dirty plates were left on the table until we left. No water was offered or brought to the table. Over all, not a great experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for happy hour while we waited for a phone. Happy hour wasn't bad, prices are reasonable. Except the food dish were kind of small. If they made the dishes a little bigger would have been good. Would go back soon!"}
{"text":"After we got done enjoying a wonderful movie at the new Harkins Theatre down the street on Mcdowell road; we chose to dine here. I am a Landry's Club member, and I did have some points to redeem that have remained untouched for quite some time.

We had some trepidation about coming here an hour before they were about to close, but we were famished and just wanted a quick bite to eat.

This place used to be fairly consistent in their quality, but such was not the case this time around.

The service was good, even though our server was busy tidying up various tables in preparation for close of business.

However, the food was none too appetizing. The crab cakes were under cooked, and they burned my Calzone. They did offer to send it back, but at that point in time; I had pretty much given up on enjoying anything that they had to offer. 

My wife's turkey sandwich was an admirable effort, but these types of sandwiches are none too complex to prepare anyway.

Needless to say, except for Motherlode cake; there really isn't anything about this place that warrants a return trip. Which is disheartening because I really used to enjoy this chain of restaurants."}
{"text":"It was the first time I'd visited a Claim Jumper and we were impressed. We visited on an early Saturday evening and even though it was busy we were well looked after. 

We chose to sit in a booth in the bar area as it looked so nice and open. 

We had rotisserie chicken and baby back ribs and they were both really good. The starter salads were really good and really quick to come. 

Service was great, food was great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"food is so bad.. definitely not fresh food. Calamari was soggy. Ordered the blackened chicken bow tie pasta. The pasta was soggy and there was barely any chicken in the entree. Probably 2 oz. The entree looked like it fell on the ground then was scooped back into the bowl then served. Really really bad food considering the decent price of this place."}
{"text":"If this is the Claim Jumper by PHX (sorry, we aren't familiar with the area), we want to give a shout out to Courtney, our server. She was great! 

Our hotel staff recommended a steak house on top of a hill. Rooster something? We initially went there. And it looked really cool. But it was 8 p.m. and there was a 90 minute wait. Uh, no. So, we did a quick search for other nearby steak places, and despite our vacation pledge to avoid chain restaurants, we ended up at a Claim Jumper.

But Courtney was worth it. We sat in the bar area and we waited for Happy Hour to start to order and get some half price appetizers (which was really funny as we watched the clock tick down with Courtney. But hey, saving money is saving money!). Hubby got the calamari and I got the soft pretzel. We both liked our choices. Hubby said his entree steak was really good and I liked my vegetarian wrap. I was so full from the pretzel, I could only eat half. I really appreciated that all the vegetarian options are gathered in one place on the menu. Makes ordering easy and clear. 

By far, what we most enjoyed was Courtney. She was so upbeat, friendly and chatty. We like servers with personality! I hope her new kitten is a joy! It was a great start to our vacation. We kept talking over the next few days about how much fun we had with her. How often does THAT happen?? And she was a great server, too....very attentive, good recommendations, remembered special requests, explained the charges on the bill....

The food was really good, but our server was even better. Thanks!

(Our visit was April 22, 2017)

ETA: we never got the cheesy bread. Maybe they don't serve it in the bar? Or maybe not at that location? Not a complaint, just an observation."}
{"text":"Arrived and were seated pretty quickly, the service isn't bad and food was good. Prices are ok, haven't been to a CJ since the one near my house closed. So it's nice to see prices are about the same and the food quality is gooooood. I recommend the Hickory Burger, wasn't dry an had a great taste. Very pleased with"}
{"text":"A few years back, this used to be my favorite restaurant. That is no longer true.

Big portions are good if the flavor is just as big, but this isn't the case for (this) Claim Jumper. 

Appetizer platter was large and had a good variety. The baked potato entree was bland; the veggies were okay. Alfredo sauce didn't do anything for me. We also ordered chicken fried steak. It was two huge pieces, about 5\" or more in diameter, and from my sample, tasted pretty good. A lot better than my baked potato, that's for sure.

Desserts menu is decent sized, and even their \"mini\" desserts are enough for two people to share. The mini I-Declair was good, but not the greatest and I wouldn't order it again.

The only good thing about this place was the service. It was huge, no wait (due to there being lots of open tables on a Saturday night), and quick service. We didn't have to wait too long for our appetizer or food. Our waiter was entertaining and funny and should probably quit this job and be a waiter somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good prices, decent food, and a relaxed atmosphere.  I would eat here over anything in MGM Grand.  It's in the golden nugget, so it's nice to get out of Fremont for a bit and grab a bite to eat.  It seems like chain food, like a Champps, but was prepared well.  My wife had the trip tip which was decent.  I had the heart attack burger which was great.  The waiter was friendly and attentive.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it was a great value and better than a lot of other places we ate in vegas.pp"}
{"text":"Some of the best costumer service I have ever had. I showed up late to my 6:30 reservation and still got our seat almost immediately. The waitress, Christina, came to check up on us every 5 minutes or so to make sure we were doing okay and asking if we needed anything. The manager even came to say hello. My boyfriend and I ordered the BBQ salad and the chicken club wrap and it was amazing! Not to mention the complimentary bread they give you before your meal gets there. Our meal took 5 minutes tops to get out to us, the fastest I've ever experienced. And the prices are great as well. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"ALL I WANTED WAS SOME FREAKING TORTILLA SOUP!!! 
...

We were seated immediately which was fabulous. Then... no one even LOOKED at our table for 15, yes 15 minutes. When our waiter finally decided to show up it took another 5 min to get our drinks and we both had soda. Totally unacceptable. Then we wait another 15 min for our order to be taken. Thank god our food came out when it did because I was ready to walk out the door. Two stars because I happen to love their tortilla soup and they have a fun and lengthly drink menu. I may never go back after this though."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since Townsquare first opened. I can honestly say I've never had a bad experience. All the times I've gone here I've went w/ either my girls, my man, or my brother. The restaurant itself is pretty massive. Recently I've been sitting at the bar area for the happy hour specials. I have certain dietary restrictions and when I order the staff is more than happy to fulfill my needs."}
{"text":"Never going back.  Went on Easter Sunday at 11:00, restaurant was empty. Several hostess's, never said hi only said it's a 10min. wait, no smile just rude.  When we were finally got a seat in the restaurant it was still empty and I asked our waiter why they made a us wait.  He said no idea because they were ready.  Very unhappy hostess's for this high priced restaurant. Waiters are always very nice."}
{"text":"ONLY because one of my WORST dining experiences came from here.. DO you not rate higher.. BUT someone I adore.. adores the CJ.. I always find the service here so slow.. and Im not sure why.. I generally have been in the afternoon.. I do like the french onion soup.. but service... ITS alot about the service.. and every time Im here.. its horrendously slow.. HUGE desserts.. I mean like can serve a party of 3 for each.. get the berry cobbler.. my oh my"}
{"text":"Ok went here for my cheat meal.... Love their chicken tortilla soup and blueberry muffin. Had a salad too which was good. Everyone at the table loved the meal. The waiter was excellent and kept my drink full. 
One of the best things about this restaurant is that they give the kids free oyster crackers and a turkey cheese plate. For the little ones sometimes it's enough as comes with oranges and applesauce."}
{"text":"I am a member of the Landry Select Club (the Franchisor of this chain), and have tons of credits.Therefore, when we got done with my wife's symposium not too far away from here, and she wanted to grab a bite to eat - this was the de facto destination.

It was a busy Friday evening, and there were a lot of large groups present. However, our server, Bailey, just did an amazing job making sure that we were always taken care of throughout the evening. 

My wife had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sweet Potato, and I had the Ultimate Fish & Shrimp.

The sweet potato was stuffed with chicken and bell peppers and were just delicious. 

The Ultimate Fish & Shrimp's portions were just very generous. 

Nothing stupendous here as far as dishes are concerned, but they are delicious and well prepared, nonetheless.

What made this a 4 star rating was just the diligence and attentiveness of Bailey. Her attention to detail was commendable and exemplary."}
{"text":"Our family went for dinner tonight and we were extremely satisfied with everything we ordered and the service. My favorite part of the meal was the cheddar potato soup. It was awesome!! Really, everything was!  We even ordered dessert which is something we seldom do. This will definitely be one of our regulars from here on out. Our waiter was Donny. He was friendly and polite with just the right amount of humor. I love the decor as well, beautiful!"}
{"text":"We had family in from out of town and it just seemed like too much work to cook for 12 on Easter so we made a reservation at Claim Jumper. 
Our table was all set up and ready for us before our scheduled reservation time, so we sat quickly and was able to start getting our cocktail orders in. 
The bread. Oh good gosh, that bread. I couldn't stop eating it. 
It's as if they combined crack and yeast then tossed on some butter and cheese. 

I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich with fries. I've had it before and it's never disappointed. But, I took one bite and the whole table could see something was wrong. It tasted horrible and had a thick slime. UGH. 
So I motioned for the server who quickly asked what she can bring me instead. Since I was torn between the mushroom sandwich and the pulled chicken sandwich, I ordered that. It came out in a hurry and was fantastic. 

My brother ordered a steak med-rare, unfortunately it was VERY well done. If you wanted a well done steak you may actually think they cooked it too much. So naturally he asked for a new one. The manager brought out a new one pretty quickly and my brother cut into it then asked the manager what cut it was. The manager quickly responded \"rare\". It was bright red and bloody. 
At this point, everyone was half done with their dinners so he simply said, no need to bring out a third steak or toss this back on the grill.  

My mother ordered shrimp and ribs. The ribs looked fantastic. The shrimp which she asked to be very well done, was undercooked. So she had to get new shrimp. 

So why the 4 stars? The manager Tim.

They could have just recooked our food and barely acknowledged their errors, but he was fantastic. He kneeled down next to me so I could clarify some errors and ensure him we're not trying to be difficult but his kitchen screwed up big time. He adjusted our check and sincerely apologized. 

Our server was sweet. I can't for the life of me remember her name. but I'm sure she won't soon forget our table. I appreciated her responding so quickly to our issues and getting them resolved. 

We've been here many times before this and will continue to come back. Hopefully the kitchen got a stern lecture. 

But, honestly, if it wasn't for Tim, I think the experience would have left such a negative impression, I probably wouldn't have been in a rush to come back. But, given how great the whole front of the house staff is, we'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I really love the location of the place because of it's convenient proximity to all the shops.  I've been here twice and one time we did not recieve the greatest service and food took a really long time. However I recently went back and had a much better experience. I ordered the fish tacos with french fries off of the lunch menu and got a water.  Everyone else that I was with also ordered from the lunch menu.  We all very much enjoyed our food.  Our waitress was incredibly sweet and our food and drinks all came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I am the DUKE of Cliam Jumper.  And I am claiming that this location is offically closed.  For reason I am unaware of.  Our dear server and staff friends who are always friendly have been relocated, thank goodness.  

If the service was great at this location then I expect nothing less from other locations."}
{"text":"If this restaurant was not inside the Golden Nugget, I might give it four stars.  I stay at the Nugget twice a year for a furniture convention and it's always underwhelming. So, unfortunately I have to take a point off for the atmosphere. 

Putting the ambiance aside, I have to say I enjoyed my breakfast. It was the last day after six nights of Vegas shenanigans, so I was looking for a \"get back on track meal\". I got two poached eggs, bacon, sausage and a side of avocado. Everything came in a little side plate, I found it funny that they couldn't plate it together. I also ordered coffee and loved the entire silver coffee pot that was promptly dropped off at my table.  

Overall, it's clean, convenient, good service and a good value. They are open 24 hours.  I felt much better afterward than the previous morning after the Nugget buffet."}
{"text":"I can't believe I ate at Claim Jumper twice in three days. I guess that's what happens when it's your hotel's late-night dining option...

I'm trying to be fair with this review and to not focus on my second experience, which was a solid 1.5 stars. So, starting from night number one (a solid 3.5 star meal), I think it's more than fair to level off at a three. Too much math? Ehhhh...

My first piece of advice: Order the mozzarella sticks... that's all. Hell, order two servings. They're delicious. 

Second piece of advice: Do not order the spaghetti and meatballs. The menu shrinks down to a limited selection after 11:00 PM and the pickin's are slim. Frozen meatballs, overcooked noodles and a canned sauce - definitely not mom's S&M. 

Third piece of advice (to the restaurant management): Please don't sit customers (us) at a table three feet away from a man that is shampooing the carpets. The machine was insanely loud and at one point of our meal the nozzle was within a foot of our table. We looked at each other in amazement as there was no shortage of booths or tables throughout the entire place. Sup CJ? Were you mad at us?"}
{"text":"CJ is now the basic cafe in a hotel and you can't go wrong. 

We knew CJ from their stand alone locations in CA. This is not a traditional CJ but has an altered menu that also includes some other items, like breakfast. This isn't fancy, it isn't identical to the other CJs but you can't really knock it for much. The service could be a bit slower at times but they are still doing a bang-up job. We had breakfast and it was quite yummy. French toast was a huge serving and made with some really spongy and savory bread, great doneness. Omelette was what one would expect from a place like this, good, done well and basic. I am sure the lunch/dinner is more on par with other CJs and if you want a basic menu of good food then here you go."}
{"text":"From 12/19/15

We needed to take a shopping break, and grab some food so to the claim jumper we went! This place is huge, there is plenty of seating available which is good, I am sure this place gets packed.

Our server who was very much on top of things in spite of being busy with other customers. She took our orders; I got a calzone with spinach and mushrooms. It took a bit of time for our food to come out, again I think it's because they were busy.

Once we got our food, I dug in, my impression of the food was okay, just a bit bland for a calzone and sauce, but it wasn't bad just needed garlic.


Next time come back, I have a different entree."}
{"text":"It looked exactly like I remembered 10+ years ago! Love the fire place to warm up next too when you first walk in and the staff was cheerful when greeting us. Over all the restaurant was clean and orderly. Menu is extensive and there is definitely something for everyone. Prices are a bit high for a neighborhood restaurant with the average dinner meal costing $18-$20. Appetisers we $10+ each as well

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad for $16.00. Folks - it was huge (see picture) !! I'm talking two people could easily share this. My daughter had a kids Mini Corn Dogs which she claimed were \"amazing\". We considered the enormous slice of cake for desert, but for $12 I decided to stop at Smith's on my way home and buy myself a whole cake!!! 


 The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the issue I had was that our napkins. They were still slightly soiled even tho we could tell they have been laundered. We unrolled all 4 sets. All had small flecks of dried food left clinging to the fabric. Nothing to do with the restaurant - just something that the person rolling the forks didn't catch. Over all good experience for a slightly fancier chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for lunch with friends yesterday.  They told us that they had the membership card.  So, my husband and I decided to each get our own so that we could both get the benefits.  Imagine our surprise when we were charged $25.00 each!!  Our friends didn't pay when they had originally gotten theirs.  That is totally ridiculous.  No other restaurant charges for their cards!  After we informed our waitress to take one away (we should have had both removed), she changed her attitude and became a little nasty.  We really should have had both removed.  
The food was good although the clam chowder didn't have a lot of clams in it.  
Ladies' room??   absolutely filthy!!"}
{"text":"Eh, it's average. 
We were here on Valentine's Day, we had a reservation but may not have needed it. The food was OK, they forgot our bread, they were kind of pokey.

I'm not in any rush to go back."}
{"text":"I am a huge claim jumpers fan. This particular location is a definite stay away from. We waited almost 30 minutes before we could even place our order, then it was almost an hour before the food came out. My husband never even got his meal and after they brought out the rest of our meals the manager came out and said I'm sorry we're out of Alfredo sauce. It took them an hour and a half for then to tell us this. We were expected to eat without silverware and asked for ketchup twice before it Appeared after the food got cold. Then the straw that broke the camel's back was when I opened up the chicken pot pie and it was a flour pasty mess and not the creamy sauce it usually is. Gross. The manager did take it off my bill but none the less we wasted almost 2 hours and left hungry."}
{"text":"OMG talk about a waste of time! Horrible service and waiting for your food seemed like a lifetime. Was in the area and decided to stop but next time we'll stick to the Henderson location."}
{"text":"You had me at 24oz drafts for the price of a NYC pint.

Claim Jumper is your average American diner type restaurant, but they will one-up the competition with the fresh bread they serve before the meal."}
{"text":"Portions are huge! There is no way anyone should eat a full meal here. I'd say as far as quality they are average. Great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"We had our Office Christmas party here today. There was 30 of us. I just want to give a huge shout out to Stephanie who waited on us and did an amazing job. She worked her tail off. Thank you Stephanie, great job."}
{"text":"Great place to go with family and friends for a good meal. Don't forget to order one of their wonderful desserts they proudly display in the front entrance waiting area. Claim Jumper's has a Happy Hour during the week in the bar, be sure to ask about their off menu items for added selections. 

The TV in the bar area was blaring last time we were there, so we moved into the restaurant and had an enjoyable time. Our waitress was very pleasant and informative."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time tonight. The atmosphere seemed very nice. I sat in the bar area for 10 minutes before getting handed a menu, and then sat for another 30 minutes with no other contact. I decided to leave and go somewhere else, and it wasn't a very busy night. Heard good things but was disappointed."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food quality. I had the calamari to start & it taste like eating rubber. The breading used for the calamari seem like a generic brand & I don't even know if I was eating real calamari because all I can taste is a rubbery tasteless string. Then I had the California citrus salad & it seem like I was eating salad from Olive Garden. It was very mediocre & the worst I ever had. The customer service though is excellent. The gentleman server was very attentive & friendly. I'm sorry for this poor review 
:("}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late dinner didn't remember this being here. Had a burger and fries.....FANTASTIC! The staff was extremely attentive and polite also found out this is their first day open here! Would not have guessed that one as smoothly as everything was."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would. The experience I had tonight at this Claim Jumper was without a doubt the best restaurant experience I have ever had. I'll spare everyone the details, but the food was amazing, the staff welcoming and friendly and management was beyond top notch. Thank you to everyone working tonight for making mine and my family's experience so wonderful!"}
{"text":"I used to love claim jumper. I came in on my hour lunch today. Wanting a cheese burger. Waited to be seated for what seemed like a long while. Watched 3 separate employees look at me and didn't even acknowledge me. Finally the hostess came out and just said hello. Do I have to say can you seat me? I guess I do. One for here. 

I was seated in the one server's area it seemed. 3 other tables right there. My server Melissa said I'll be right with you. 5 minutes later she came back. I explained to her that I'm on my lunch and just want my check when the food comes. I ordered the classic cheese burger plain, French fries with ranch, iced tea extra lemon, pretzel sticks. 

She brought me my tea and a fast 5 minutes my food was ready. The tea no extra lemon. The burger everything on it, no ranch. The only thing right was the pretzel sticks!!! 

I hate when my service is so bad and my order is 90% wrong!!! And I had to ask for my check twice! 

It's clear this location needs training for its hostess and server positions."}
{"text":"Man!!! this place service is so sucks... When we getting inside the hostess was not even care about us and, we were long time staring at her to get a smile from her face. when we get inside there are few people inside and i believe they didn't have enough waitress on the floor to cover them. they were so hurry to take our order and the waiter dude was taking few breaks from us to come back after while. Food was A-ok.. and we wont go back again this place and never recommend to anyone. One at the town  square is way better service."}
{"text":"We do happy hour and Claim Jumpers' is a solid choice. The happy-hour menu is good and reasonable, but the wait service is stellar! Thank you Daniel for your attentiveness,  and thank you Dominick for running a fabulous food and drink experience...

We will continue to eat and drink here. BTW, the bar area is ENORMOUS!"}
{"text":"Claim Jumpers is summarized best as quantity over quality. If you enjoy hilariously large portion sizes of bland food then this is the place you want to eat."}
{"text":"I am so pleased with my dining experience I received at Claim Jumpers this afternoon . My boyfriend and I went in to get their delicious barbecue salads. My boyfriend opted for grilled chicken on his ...I was able to get my chicken like crispy chicken strips but cut into small pieces on my salad . It was sooo good !!! The cheesy Parmesan bread they give you while waiting for your food is addicting. We ate a lot of it -The salads were huge we actually could have just shared one salad . It's family size portions ... We managed to save room for dessert we chose the salted caramel mud pie ...It was recommended by our waiter. We were torn between that and the brownie but went with the pie. It was enormous we couldn't even finish it. They really gave us a huge slice. We will definitely be back . You get your money's worth come (come hungry) and be prepared to pig out and take left overs home. Our waiters were super friendly and helpful . We didn't have to ask for water or extra silverware they were on it. I love The ambiance really nice and the booth was nice and roomy big small we could have fit another couple in the booth with us that's how big it is."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and was surprised to see they were having a Veteran Special since it already passed. Had to show proof and was given the limited menu. 

Our waitress was very friendly, attentive, suggested flavorful items. She even offered a toddler plate for our one year old. 

Lunch was amazing, great priced and I remembered our rewards card so double bonus. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Nice meal, really clean place and great servers! I am a real happy camper tonight. I've lived in Vegas for almost three years and there is almost always an issue when dining out. Not tonight! Only had the sirloin and salad with baked potato but everything was tasty and prepared perfectly. no A-1 sauce needed! No salad drowned in dressing! Garlic/ cheese bread was out of this world. Our waiter was Eddie and he was \"spot on\"!
Will definitely return. Thanks CJ!   As a note, I watched the clean up guy clean after each customer left and was very impressed with how much effort he put in to cleaning the tables booths and especially the floor. Good job \"cleanup guy\"!"}
{"text":"The service was sub par.  We arrived around 2:00pm after a long flight.  The restaurant was half filled yet no host/hostess in sight.  We wandered into the bar but all of the booths were dirty (not bussed).  We went back out to the main entrance and stood there for another 10 minutes.  I observed what appeared to be a spilled salad near the front of the restaurant.  Finally a waitress walked by and we asked to be seated.  We then had to wait another 10 minutes for a hostess to appear.  The service throughout the meal was friendly but very slow.  We asked for some additional dipping sauce with our meal and it didn't arrive until we were already done with the entire meal.  The food itself was decent chain restaurant fare but the service was absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Came here late night and was hoping they had the all day menu.  When we were going to leave and pay for the drinks, the wonderful server brought out the all day menu to satisfy my pasta craving.  Such wonderful service and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST experience I have ever had dining a this Claim Jumper.  FIRST the service was atrocious.  The severs name was Warren.  He never greeted us, we had to flag another server to get our drinks.  He finally took our order and it came out cold and took forever.  When we spoke with Andrew, the assistant manager, he was rude and basically didn't care and huffed off like we were wasting his time.  Mind you, there were only 3 other tables in the entire restaurant.   I also found that he was interacting with my teenage son very inappropriately.  I am a LSC card member, and since I PAID for this card, I expect the service to be decent and the management to at least ACT like they care.  I am appalled by this experience.  Avoid this Claim Jumper at all costs!!!!  There are to many other places to eat in Vegas to be treated like this.  Shame on them."}
{"text":"Overpriced simple American dishes with a side of poor customer service. There's honestly nothing really special about this place. Not only did our food take forever to come out but when it did came out, it was cold. Also, we weren't even given silverware to eat with, we literally had to flag down some random employee who just so happened to walk pass by to get some forks and spoons. I had no idea where our server was. The sad part was, the server never truly apologized for his lack of service. It was appalling. This place ranks #1 on my list of worst restaurants in Vegas to go to. I've visited this place a few times in the past and was never even a tad bit impressed, but after this time, I'm never going to a Claim Jumper ever again. You want American food? Go to The Cheesecake Factory or Yard House (:"}
{"text":"The soup (bowl) portions are way too small for the price. 
I got a Cobb salad and it was strangely \"blah.\" I split it with someone (She didn't like it either.) and didn't even eat half of my half.  The kids liked their pizzas and burger, and the fries were awesome. Husband's steak was good, and the onion rings and zucchini were great.  
But with so many restaurants choices in this city, we definitely won't be back here.  Sub - par isn't good enough."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the bread pudding  here and it was unbelievable. Not as unbelievable as Charlestons but is definitely making the list for \"Best Bread puddings\" (see list). 

Also tried the tuna sammich with avocado as I wanted something simple. That tomato herb bread that they use is extraordinary! The sammich was great just like everything else I have had here."}
{"text":"We are here for dinner. Good food, good service. Why only 3 stars? The music is so loud we can't even have a normal conversation!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for Mother's Day there were 20 of us 
For lunch we kept asking the waiter to turn down the a/c it was freezing cold. How can you even enjoy the food if you are not comfortable in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I liked the food - and their desserts are great. 

The service, however, could not suck harder. At one point, I think they decided to raise the cow who eventually would give the milk to make the cheese for my dish from a calf - starting the whole process when I ordered. Then, when we got to the dessert course, the waiter straight-up lied to us and said that it was taking a long time because there was a big rush from the happy hour at the bar, when, in reality, they simply didn't have the dessert we'd ordered. Took almost 30 minutes for the manager to come out and TELL us that, by which time, we were already late for our evening plans. 

I so wanted to like this one. Other Claim Jumpers to which I've gone don't have this problem. Front and back of house need a complete overhaul in staffing. When there's a total of 7 tables seated, it should not be 20 minutes between visits from your waiter. One should not have to make a pyramid of empty glasses on the table to make the point that we've run dry. If it didn't physically pain me not to leave a tip, I'd have left the dude a whopping zilch; as it is, what I left was out of pity - clearly, he'd not be able to get a job waiting tables anywhere else."}
{"text":"It is my step father's birthday & we had a reservation (we had 14 people & wanted to make sure they were prepared, instead of just showing up) for 7pm it is now 8pm and we have yet to be seated. However 45 people have walked in & been sat ahead of us. We were patient for 30 minutes, but then decided to ask what was going on. They said just a few more minutes....now  an hour later we are still waiting. If they are short staffed they either should have asked a waiter to come in, since the reservation was made a day in advance, or at least told us over the phone when we made the reservation that they could not handle that capacity. We literally had to go point out tables that they could put together...now we are walking to our table. Thank goodness we did their job for them. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Wow.... The Happy Hour here is a hidden secret.   Great selection of food & drinks.  I has the wedge salad and chicken wings.   Both were yummy.  

My waitress Alanna, was awesome."}
{"text":"Nice people horrible food! Just go for drinks!
I will never go back! First and last time in this establishment!"}
{"text":"Blows.   Tri Tip was tough, shrimp tasted uncooked.  Place has gone downhill wouldn't or will no longer make slight changes to order.  



If your in Town Center don't waste time go to Yard House food is much better

Oh yeah and when I told the server that my tri tip was too tough and to eat he simply said nothing or had no reaction.  Big zero on that on for customer service"}
{"text":"Was ok,had odor when walking in like trying to mask a smell. Bathroom  needs attention  water stains at faucets need to clean up.my motto bathroom 
 Messy kitchen  same.club sandwich  ok bread fried not tasted kinda pricey for lunch. Probably  won't  be back for long while"}
{"text":"This was my dad and my second time eating here.  Both of our first experiences were not favorable.  We thought we'd give it one more try for lunch.  Our mistake!  My dad had the club sandwich and half salad.  He didn't mind the salad, but could barely eat the sandwich.  The bread was far too hard, and the cheese and meat tasted like cheap prepackaged stuff one might get at a cheap grocery store. 

I had the tri-tip sandwich.  It was tolerable but nothing I would ever go out of my way to get again.  There was only a tiny piece of cheese for the large sandwich and hardly any bell peppers.  The meat was just okay.  The shoestring fries didn't have much flavor. 

Our server was nice.  The complimentary bread was decent.  The atmosphere is fine.  But we both agreed we won't be back again.  The food was just not good and certainly not worth the price.  Go to Outback or something."}
{"text":"Over priced food..... for 3 people... personal pan pizza, kids meal, and country fried steak.  $47 .... we had water to drink.  Country fried steak didn't taste like anything  never coming back here again."}
{"text":"The waiters are rude and take forever to order. I was waiting 25 min for my refills and food to come. So annoying."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu with reasonable prices.  We used our 24k card.  They were able to check our points there at the table and breakfast was comped just like that. Service was great and we were there at 8:30 am and beat the crowd.  Long lines after."}
{"text":"Claim jumper did contact me and apologize for the bad night the establishment had and sent me a gift card to make up for it. I thought that this should at least be noted."}
{"text":"June 20th 2011
Ordered:
Fish Tacos
I've been here numerous times just this year... figured it's time to actually review it.  Am I am fan?  Most definitely.. Why else would I keep coming back?

Pros:
  Another familiar chain at the Town Square.  What an awesome location!
  Very good happy Hour.  Cheap Eats doesn't always mean subpar food.
  Friendly staff.  Every time I have came staff always engage in convo.
  Flat Screens throughout the bar.  There isn't a bad seat in the bar.

Cons:
  Chips were stale.  What a disappointment.
  The entire bar area had a popcorn smell.
  
Verdict:
  Okay, so my chips were stale, but overall this is an awesome place to go eat... especially during happy hour.  Even when you are not in the bar and are eating here, it's really good.  If you've never been to a Claim Jumpers, make sure to check it out!  The portions are gigantic and the quality of the food is pretty impressive in my opinion.  I haven't had anything that I didn't care for (aside from the stale chips).  I'd definitely come again.

Tips:
  Looking for cheap eats and a place to catch sports? Look no more !
  Do not eat at the bar early lunch... they make popcorn and the whole bar area smells of its scent.  It was messing with my taste buds.  If I want popcorn I'll go to Rave.
  Come during happy hour.  Everyone often goes to Yard House (which is also good for happy hour, but is extremely crowded).  Claim Jumpers is less crowded.
  Order the Fried Zucchini... Definitely one of my Favorites !!"}
{"text":"So delicious and big portions! My fav was the chicken pot pie!! Also the fish tacos and the BBQ chicken sandwich! So many options great service!! The waiters are very polite and fast!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss most times. Last night I ordered to go and when I got home I was highly disappointed. My bf got a miners combo - baby back ribs and shrimp. Well the ribs were least to be desired. They gave us 2 very small fatty pork ribs and one large beef rib BONE covered in bbq sauce to disguise the big bone no meat. What in the world!!! My meal was missing the bread. For $60 we should have gotten what we asked for and more. Ugh never again."}
{"text":"Dissappointed..
I used to cherish my visits at this restaurant. I craved the Potato soup!
Now that they have switched owners, they have made many changes for the worse. The soup was curdled, lacked flavor and potatoes. The pot pie was extremely dry! 
I will stick to the other places at town square."}
{"text":"I feel like if I would have had the more expensive dinner then I would be more of a fan. But the lunch was not bad. I actually liked the vegetables more than the meat. But overall all a pretty good restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh yeah... my ATF in Phoenix.

Had lunch here today with a customer. As usual, the restaurant is pretty cool, service good, and food ridiculously good. They even have a rather significant GF section of their menu - and suggestions throughout the menu on how to order stuff Gluten Free. Cool.

The Artichoke heart thingamabob appetizer is unreal. It's dipped in love, broiled until awesome, and served with a teaspoon or two of holy shit that's good....

I ordered the Strawberry Something or Other salad with blackened chicken. The chicken breast was sliced paper thin and spread throughout the salad - which is different than I am used to. Now I can't ever order chicken on a salad again because I'll want it \"Claim Jumper style\". DAMN YOU CLAIM JUMPER.....

Huge portions, good food, and good service. It's a fiver..."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper... no one is going to be jumping after eating here. Too much stress on the ankles when landing...
I love Claim Jumper. Asian pear salad, veggie-burger, and most definitely the desserts.
Upon walking in you are immediately pulled toward the massive chocolate cake. Massive. Humongous. I have never actually dared to order it. I am just too intimidated.
Today I went with my parents and had the veggie burger. I am not usually an immitation meat kind of person, but despite the fact that this burger was, in fact, immitation meat, the rest of the goodies on the sandwich made for a delicious lunch. It came with onions, avocado, tomatoes, garlic mayo (it comes very light), and a few other things I can not recall. My mother had the citrus salad with chicken, which she loves, and my father had the Chinese Chicken salad. Both came with big muffins. My favorite is the cornbread muffin.
The only dessert I have actually indulged in is the deep dish berry pie. The pie was tart and a little tangy, which was wonderfull. It was not overly sugary. Perfect for sharing.
Other desserts I have been eyeing for multiple years are the red velvet cupcakes, the flan, the humongoid eclair, the chocolate cake, and the deep dish apple pie. I'm sure there are a few I am forgetting.
The prices are reasonable, especially since you are most likely going to be sharing or taking home half of the meal anyway."}
{"text":"I usually go to Claim Jumper once or twice a year and the food is always amazing after each visit. From their Potato Soup to the Steaks, this place leaves me satisfied. It has a very nice vibe as well. For this visit I got their Sirloin Steak (medium rare), Baked Potato, and the Potato Cheddar Soup. Their bread is also great as well and i'm always looking forward for it. The Steak is really good and has an even amount of seasoning. The flavor from the seasoning just explodes in your mouth after each bite. Whenever I visit, I always get the Potato Cheddar Soup. I never regret getting it after each time. If you dip the bread in the soup, your taste buds will love it. 5/5!"}
{"text":"Just discovered today that this location is closed (while I was planning my next vacation).  Very disappointed.   This was always the first Vegas stop for my wife and I every vacation.  After flying in, we would set up at our hotel, walk the distance to Town Square (yes, even in 110 F heat) and have a great meal.  Sad that our tradition must now change.

Always had great food here.  Thanks to everyone who may have served us."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try Claim Jumper out for a while since we moved into the neighborhood right next to it. When we ended up going I was craving pasta, which is usually a hit or miss at these kind of places.

The pasta was pretty dry, but we got it at the lunch menu price so I was not too disappointed. Lace got the rotisserie chicken with potatoes and loved it.

The service was decent. The host mumbled us to our seat, and the waitress was nice but pretty quiet and was not around much.

I would definitely try this place again and get something else. The interior kind was decent, kind of log cabin style and would be great for big groups."}
{"text":"We had Thanksgiving dinner here this past holiday.  It's the only time we'd eaten here, so we can only comment on the special Thanksgiving menu, but they actually did a very nice job with that.  There was a choice of turkey or prime rib. We had one of each. They came with all the appropriate \"fixins\" and all were pretty well-executed. It was much less \"cafeteria\" or mass-produced than I expected, and that was a pleasant surprise. The meal concluded with some pretty tasty pie. We chose one slice of apple and one piece of pumpkin.  We were in town for work, and he waitress was super friendly, with a touch of sympathy for us being away from family for the holiday."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant in the middle of Town Square.  Had burger, wife had black tie pasta.  All were solid.  Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We had a friend from out of town and had dinner here tonight; it was really quite good. The cashew chicken salad sandwich was tasty with an excellent bread. One of us had the hickory chicken breast which was excellent. The meatloaf with mashed potatoes was off the chart good with a wonderful savory gravy. The service was great and there wasn't much of a wait for a Friday night. Overall great experience, highly recommended! The portion sizes are way too big but we took the extra food home."}
{"text":"I am haunted by guilt for looking the gift horse of a generous work party in the mouth, but Claim Jumper earned the dental exam. First, our party of 40 was relegated to a chilly patio room where the tables were bolted to the floor, thus stranding groups of four on secluded little islands. I know the tables have to be sturdy to handle the hefty dessert plates, but the steel reinforcement is overkill. One expects slower service with a party this size, but I guess we were out of sight and mind. The appetizers and desserts were especially slow in coming, and adding insult to injury, those who ordered their desserts to go were served a good 10 minutes before those who wanted theirs served. The entrees arrived in such a haphazard fashion that one out of each table wasn't served for a good 5 minutes after everyone else, resulting in a few uncomfortable minutes while we politely waited as our plates cooled and our mates drooled. Injuring the insult with ickiness, the lobster was a rubber-bandy glop of shellfish gone wrong, and the petit filet, not much bigger than a petit four, was tough as cowhide. The sweet potato cakes on the side were dense and delicious with a creamy salsa topping. Had there been more salsa, I would have soaked my entree as well in some sort of liquid as it was painfully desiccated.
Speaking of overkill, the desserts will easily serve three average-sized diners. The red velvet cake with buttercream frosting was outstanding. It lasted four days in the freezer. Claim Jumper is just the place for chain lovers who find oversized portions and dizzying prices patriotic and who require steel bolts to rest their elbows safely on the table."}
{"text":"Food was good as well as the service.  Pretty slow inside the mall today being it was so damn hot outside.  Had the cup of clam chowder and split the buffalo wings.  Chowder was a plus, the entree I chose was the shrimp skewers which were quite good.  Little brother got his usual chicken fingers & fries which I thought were excellent.  No dessert, however, the 3,000 calories chocolate cake of death or whatever looks amazing and I will be back to ensure quality of that cake soon :)"}
{"text":"4* for their food- large portions, home cooking feel. They have a large selection ranging from calzones, pot pie, meatloaf, sandwiches, salads and more....


Unfortunately 2* for carry out. They just recently started charging for carry out orders. This isn't a tip for the carry out servers, it's a service tax. It's not very high but everytime I call ahead they give me an approximate 20 minute wait. I always give them 30 minutes and my food is never ready. Make sure you double check everything before you leave too! I feel like there's always something missing from my order. 

I love their food I only wish their service matched. I do keep coming back hoping carry out will change but I'll just have to deal with it."}
{"text":"Food is great although we had ordered medium burgers and one came in our to-go a bit raw.  Definitely would have went back to the kitchen if we had ordered in.  Fish and chips are also awesome if you're seeking a bit of greasy goodness.

We were also confused about the whole point system but the manager cleared it up as far as what happened when we paid originally.  Basically the $25 that you pay into the system is deducted from each item instead of zeroing out the bill for $25.  I'm willing to bet this was an accounting piece that drove this which causes the wait staff tremendous pains.   The online ordering system isn't ready yet either which stinks.

Overall it's good American food, somewhat like Cracker Barrel.  Still a chain restaurant but not something you see everywhere."}
{"text":"Thanksgivings dinner was quite disappointing this year at Claim Jumpers. The meat was processed turkey that looked more like ham.  The mash potatoes were dry and just poorly presented on the overall.  We were here a couple years ago and it was much better!  I don't think we'll come back next year!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was so hot and humid inside.  We live in Arizona, why does it feel like it's 90 in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Two weeks ago we called to make a reservation for 11:30am today, they were having an Easter Sunday brunch buffet.  We confirmed the buffet and time, we figured buffet would be best for a group of 9.  

Today we show up for our reservation...no buffet and we are told brunch ended 30min earlier.  Our waitress had to ask the manager for us to order brunch, we got the ok.  The waitress had several excuses about the buffet, from we ran out to every location is different.  The buffet was only being offered at two locations (Town Square and one in Sacramento).  Then it's time to get out food, which took a while.  Two of us didn't get our food with the rest.  After several moments my mother got her food, I was told my food would be out in two minutes.  As everyone was starting to finish I still hadn't gotten my food and our waitress was MIA.  I found a manager to ask him to take it off the bill...it miraculously appeared.  I refused it.  Then it's time for dessert, we were given the menu.  We ordered and several moments later we were told that some of what we ordered had run out.  It's noon, how do you run out?  And more importantly why weren't we told before ordering.

After working in restaurants for years, front of the house and back of the house, I can tell you this place is pathetic.  I am amazed they haven't failed.  They broke so many rules of the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"Pros: Open 24 hours and a short walk from the room, not too packed at 1am. Food was hot and pasta sauce was tasty.

Cons: Meatballs were microwaved...no bread with my food...no refills unless you ask and even then no. Service 

This place is like pizza at a drive in...its ok since it is hot and a short walk to the snack bar. It is good only because of the situation but at end of the day, the food is over priced junk that you would pay 1/2 the price normally or find awesome food for same price. Way better locations elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was great and serving size ample -- although I noticed it's not nearly as large as it used to be. I've been here several times before but have never \"checked in\" on Yelp. With our meal today, we had a Long Island Iced Tea."}
{"text":"It was my 2nd time coming here. The food was amazing. I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich....it hit the spot. I highly recommend it for bbq fanatics. I was really surprised on their chips and salsa. Normally you just expect the usual \"chips and salsa\" but the chips were delicious. Our server was really friendly.  This place is better than Applebee's. Yes it's a little higher price but the food taste good."}
{"text":"My experience here wasn't terrible, but honestly I was expecting so much more from this place. I had heard all about Claim Jumper since my days in Phoenix, but had never been to any of their restaurants until now.

We arrived on a surprisingly busy Monday afternoon, around 3 pm-ish and were seated by the hostess right away. We had already looked at the menu online and done our homework and knew what we wanted, so when the waiter took our drink order, we ordered our meals as well. We both ordered the Top Sirloin 9 ounces. ($20.99, 7 oz. is available for $19.99). For the side I chose mashed potatoes, while my friend chose the baked potato. 

First, the positive..

- the steak was good. Obviously, the most important part of the meal and I'm glad that they got this right. 

- drink refills were taken care of in a timely fashion.

Now, the rest...

- the mashed potatoes tasted like crappy EDR, instant mashed potatoes. Seriously, something was off about them. Actually, the mashed potatoes at my EDR taste much better than this slop, so I take that back. 

- Had to ask for straws for our drinks, ketchup, and A1 Sauce repeatedly. The straws and A1 were delivered in adequate time, but had to ask 3 different people for the ketchup and was almost finished eating when it finally arrived/.

- After leaving, we read on the website that we should have received a choice of soup or salad as well. That simply never happened. 

For all the good things I had heard about Claim Jumper, this was certainly an underwhelming experience. I can honestly say, with so many good dining options in town, that I will not be back.

2 stars.

Meh is right. I have definitely experienced better!"}
{"text":"Ever since I met my husband he has never shut up about how he used to work at a claim jumper in Seattle and the food was super amazing. I was reluctant to right a negative review and seeing it has only 3 stars already doesnt surprise me. First off our server was AMAZING. Secondly I guess the coveted cornbread, muffins, honey butter, and biscuits are no longer a thing here. Which was a little sad. We did it big and ordered some drinks, kids meal, and 2 dinner plates. I hate hate hate sending stuff back but my veggies were absolutely soaked in whatever greasy oil it was cooked in. Since the manager wad near he was really quick to replace it with steamed veggies. But the real reason for the poor review is over battered and SUPER CHEWY country fried steak. He tried so hard to like it but I even had a bite to see what the fuss was about and I dont know if it was over cooked or just a horrible cut of meat but that got sent back too. TOTAL BUST. All this talk about how great Claim Jumpers is and we both had to be \"that guy\" and send things back. He ended up getting the jambalaya to go. The country fried steak was taken off but had to pay for the replacement which I guess it was fair. But still a total let down. Not going back."}
{"text":"I must admit I haven't been to a Claim Jumper in 20 years or more but I heard they had Happy Hour all day Sunday and so...
they had a great Happy Hour menu of drinks and eats.  I had the Patron Margarita which was delish! Along with some great onion rings and clam chowder which was ordinary and not even hot
The other items on the HH menu were varied and interesting but I chose the filet with a side of asparagus and crab
meat and mac and cheese.  The crab meat was real lump crab and tasty. The filet was a perfect medium rare and moist.  The mac and cheese was to die for but could have been better with a bread crumb crust.
Since it was my birthday they gave me a piece of red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. It was good but I am not a fan.
Service was slow as they had few servers but friendly and competent. There were few patrons there at 530 pm."}
{"text":"Portions are really big and there happy hour is awesome. I have never had bad service here. Good job claim jumper!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good food, and plenty of it.          But soulless.     You get the feeling that the recipes are all carefully tuned to be as inoffensive as possible to the widest possible range of palates so it's like elevator music,    nobody is offended by it but nobody really loves it either.    

Well, there you go."}
{"text":"Got our food quick and it was delicious. They have everything on the menu. Little speedy but otherwise a good place to go with a lot of variety."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Claim Jumper is great, small menu but yummy food at good prices.  My main complaint about CJ?  food can be really really slow.  Other than that I love CJ HH food and drinks. Just don't eat here if you are in a hurry or trying to catch a movie."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour since Brio was so packed and we were in a rush!

The bar was empty, which can sometimes be a bad thing, but in this case it was good. I ordered the margherita pizza, my bf ordered the chicken wings and fried zucchini, and my brother ordered the bbq chicken pizza. The pizzas were $4 each, the wings were $5, and the zucchini was $3. We all just ordered water since we had to drive to the Venetian shortly after. 

The food came pretty quickly and it looked tasty. I tried the zucchini first and it was yummy. Even my brother liked it and he hates veggies! I tried my pizza and it was decent. It was pretty small, but it hit the spot. The wings looked good, not too saucy or anything. My brother's bbq chicken pizza must've been good because I only saw it when the waiter brought it over and the next time I looked the whole thing was devoured! 

All in all 4 stars, for their quickness, good food, and cheap prices."}
{"text":"I have now been to the Claim Jumper twice in my life. The first time was several years ago and I don't remember much except that I felt it was over priced.  Nothing spectacular for the price, it was no Ruth Chris's.  Then for my sons 17th birthday we decided to go, per my fathers suggestion. When we go there it took several minutes to seat our group of 7, despite there being a lot of seats.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant.  We ordered drinks, those took 15 minutes. Then appetizers and dinner.  We got our appetizers, then less than five minutes later our salads. Then as if there was no though to it our dinner.  This was a problem because there was no room left on the table. AS if that was not bad enough we had asked the waitress to put a rush on the kids pizzas because they were hungry.  So to recap the adults had received their appetizers, salad and dinner and still not pizzas.  Finally since our waitress was no where to be found my husband had to go and track down the manager to find out about the pizza. My kids were starving and unfortunately they did not like the shrimp and pasta dishes that the rest of us had, so my husband gave up most of his steak and fries to our kids.  After another 10 minutes the pizza arrived. The manager threw the waitress under the bus and said it was because she did not do something and that the pizza and hot foods are two different kitchens. That may be the case but how long would we have waited for the pizza if my husband had not gone and complained. I was almost done before the pizza showed up.  Wow, I am completely venting, guess t was because it was my sons birthday and it was bugging me that everything was going terrible at dinner. We won't be giving this place a try again. Next time we will go to Chili's!"}
{"text":"I wouldnt eat here again if someone paid me to. Over priced, uninterested wait staff, poor quality food.

There was a time when Claim Jumper did a good job but either that managememt team is gone or those days have just passed.

Normally I add details to support my case but to be honest, I couldnt care less so not going to waste the time. 

Two stars for cleanliness."}
{"text":"The Manager \"Danny\" was awesome. Took care of every little concern we had. Jessica the waitress was awesome, even when we weren't seated in her area. I will return because of the Manager and his ability to value us as customers. Foot was very good."}
{"text":"Have been here before and service was ok. The service today is ok. Had to wait 510 min even to get a water. Seems like service has gone down hill here. ducks Cause this was a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"My out of town guests love this place. I have learned when I come here to keep my ordering on the small side. This is super friendly and great food. I love just being in the place you feel like you travelled back in time."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Claim Jumper. Someone called it Cracker Barrel on steroids and I laughed so hard because that's exactly what you will experience.

Their food is amazing. That isn't an argument at all. Be prepared to have leftovers that will last you until the next rainy season, seriously. The prices are really expensive because you're not buying a meal, you're investing in a series of meals. 

My problem the last time I came here was the service. The waitress was kind of rude and kept giving us dirty looks. Then when the food came out my mashed potatoes had gravy on them. The menu didn't say they came with gravy and she never asked me if I wanted gravy. I am physically incapable of eating gravy. Is it just me or is gravy the kind of thing you're supposed to ask if someone wants before just assuming? If it had been on the menu I would have asked for none. I was really sad about this because I love their mashed potatoes. 

My mom ordered a piece of chocolate cake the size of a whale. I was both terrified and astounded by this beast. I don't eat chocolate but they all said it was great. I'll have to believe them.

I wish I could pick 3.5 but whatever."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a lunch and was great to see a Saturday happy hour in the bar area. Ordered a few different appetizers which were all priced very well and tasted even better. Opted to have the Potato Cheddar soup after being given a sample of that and the chili. 

Service was great, was continuously checked on but not bothered."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST ONLY!!!

Not a huge chain food fan, and especially Claim Jumper with their massive portions and high sodium content though for breakfast I would make an exception.  

We were staying in the Golden Nugget so obviously this location is extremely convenient.  We ended up having breakfast here all four days.  Bacon/Eggs/Hash browns, Oatmeal w/ fruit (Enough for two people), Egg Benedict, and Chicken Fried Steak.  Seriously, every friggen dish was delicious, and it wasn't because I was hungover and anything would be amazing.  I actually hardly drank this trip, so the food really was good.  I was impressed with the chicken fried steak, it was friggen killer. 

Service was fantastic, we had the same waiter the first two times and after that my mom made sure to request him by name and he would serve us even if we were out of his area.  He did a fantastic job on very busy shifts.  We were sure to tip him out accordingly :)

Definitely would recommend this location, and bonus they are open 24/7 and you can also order in for room service (Bonus).

Enjoy & Good Luck in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been twice, both time the food was better than I expected.
It is a perfect place for giant portions of comfort food! Not a good place for a diet, but sometimes I just want a big plate of tasty \"I Don't give a F\" dinner. Hopefully fried!

The interior feels like you are in Tahoe to me.
It has that rustic, expansive feel to it. The service has been completely fine both times.
Very efficient, and on point. Not necessarily that friendly, but that is OK. I am not there to make friends. 

Would I go back, probably. The fact that I can walk to it from my house is part of that probability. Would I drive across town for it...doubtful."}
{"text":"So, I moved back to the Bay Area 6 years ago this week. Last week, I was in Phoenix and met with some friends from high school who I haven't seen in 9 and 11 years respectively. Our 20 year HS reunion is next month and since I am not going, decided we should have our own mini type reunion and this was a place easy enough for all of us to meet up. Yes this is a chain, and yes when in Phoenix I play the chain game. 

When this restaurant was built, it was all the rage. I used to work for a company close by and this was the place we would go to for recognition type lunches, etc. The portions were huge, there was a salad bar (yep this seems eons ago) and service was great. There was always a line and if you showed up at dinner time, you had to be prepared for a 1+ hour wait. We all met at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. No line outside, no one waiting inside and we were seated immediately. This told me right away that either the economy has taken a real toll or that the Claim Jumper isn't jumping anymore. 

We were seated and all just started gabbing away. We all had non alcoholic beverages and warned the waitress we would be there for the long haul with gabbing, etc. so if she needed us to leave so she could get more tables to let us know. Heads up folks visiting AZ from CA-any wait staff in AZ DOES NOT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE. They make around $4.25 an hour now (used to be $2.12) and have to depend on tips. This is why I find service in AZ to typically be stellar compared to service here. 

They have a smaller menu than they used to and also offer smaller plates. We all had something different-me a spinach salad and a big ass baked potato. My friends had a chicken sandwich of sorts and the meatloaf with mashed potatoes. We were all satisfied and my friends each took part of their meal home. We also all shared a coffee ice cream mud pie. It didn't taste as good as I remembered it, but it was a nice end to the meal. The desserts are still larger than life and even with 3 women gabbing and noshing, we left about a third of it. 

The waitress was great-the restaurant still never got busy and we ended up closing the place down (that would be 10pm)! The three of us then ended up sitting outside in front of the restaurant and gabbed and gabbed until well after midnight. It was a great evening and a nice place to have played catch up with old friends (none of us are 40 yet so they wouldn't like me calling them \"old\"). 

I drove back to my mom's and parked the car, took off my shoes and walked through the house on my tip toes. Kind of like how I used to come home in high school but I wasn't drunk or stoned..."}
{"text":"Nice place in town square with typical American food. The food was OK, service was OK. The best thing we had was the salted caramel mud pie, it was to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating my breakfast here this morning and what way to start off my day the food was over the top service was great the claim chowder moght have to go back and get that later..."}
{"text":"I took my mom here on Mother's Day since she has never been here, and our meal was out standing! She got the meal loaf and i had the loaded potato! The service was excellent and the restaurant is out standing to dine in. Pricey but very much worth it if you are trying to have a nice fancy night out! Even on Mother's Day I can understand it being even more busy then normal but our server was great! She always checked on us to see if everything was to our satisfaction and always was there to refill my water. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to go to if I am feeling to get my money's worth! It's hard to get 5 stars out of me but they definitely deserve it. If you want the loaded potato it is currently not on the menu for this location but if you just ask your waiter for it they can serve it. Outstanding all around. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good old comport food at a reasonable price, family friendly. Very large portions."}
{"text":"Chicken Bow Tie pasta with spinach  tortellini. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Changed the shoe string french fries, took spaghetti and bread bowls off the menu. Prices are getting steeper.... to say I'm disappointed with the menu changes is an understatement. One star for bringing back a variation of my old favorite dessert from many years ago... the cookie sandwich. And another star for adding the bread in the beginning. Yum."}
{"text":"We live near the Claim Jumper in Buena Park. No matter when you go during their business hours, there's a waiting line. Could be 'cause they're located across the street from Knott's Berry Farm.

What a treat to visit Avondale's Claim Jumper and get seated immediately!

Log cabin ambiance. Spacious. Clean. Great service. Thank you, Jacqueline, for endorsing the wonderful BBQ Chicken Salad. We totally enjoyed the salad, surf and turf. 

We never order dessert. Too full, but we couldn't resist the Carrot Cake, which was absolutely delicious. Moist cake made with carrots, raisins, pineapple and walnuts frosted with delicate, fluffy cream cheese. Yum!"}
{"text":"ate here our final night in town after a small sports bet win. Overall the food was very hit and miss. The waiter suggested the chicken strips to me and my brother had the full rack of ribs. The ribs were tender and delicious and the bbq sauce wasn't overwhelming. My chicken tenders, while very tender and crunchy were devoid of flavor. Had to dip in bbq sauce just to have some flavor to it. Also the waiter was a bit pretentious when we ordered drinks. I ordered a white Zinfindel (fully aware it was a sweet wine) and he kept saying if I was sure I wanted the drink. Then he forgot to put in the order and I didn't get the drink till after finishing my meal. Probably should have sent it back but it is what it is. Overall a decent meal but if I return I would get the ribs...and avoid randy the waiter unless you want your drink choices questioned."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and both visits have been great! The hosts have been ok, not very friendly. Our server tonight was Rob and he was beyond awesome. He was kind and attentive to our needs as well as sincere and patient. We would come here again just to see him because rarely do you find a server that can make your dining experience extraordinary. The food was delicious, i ordered the Chinese chicken salad which was every bit perfect and my boyfriend ordered the fried steak and he loved it as well. The restaurant was very clean organized can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night. We enjoyed the ambiance. It was a big dining space but at least half full. The service was also good. But the food was just OK. We ordered a white sangria, pretty tasty and very little alcohol -- just the way we like it. We also got a side salad that was fine, but not memorable. The shrimp fresca pasta was extremely buttery but not very salty, and the shrimp were overbreaded. The tenderloin tips were also OK with the beef being a bit chewy. We would probably go to Cheesecake Factory next time we're in the mood for big portions of classic American fare."}
{"text":"Great food , looking for something a bit more healthy.. vegetarian option as well , which is hard to find . Prices are reasonable , big portion , 
. Right From  the start staff friendly  , clean , . Bread is brought to your table to eat while waiting for your food . 
When ordering Rob the server was so nice knew how to make things vegetarian friendly for me .. that's s added plus , will be back for sure next time we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"My mom was in town from Arkansas, and we wanted good food. So we went to Claim Jumper knowing that our options are huge, and everyone would be sastisfied. Sure enough, our expectations were met. We started off with a creamy tortilla soup, fire roasted artichoke, and greens salad with in house made blue cheese dressing. All great, no complaints. 
Our dishes included tri tip, chicken pot pie, chicken wings, and the small (but no so small) portion of the chicken fried steak. Again, everything was pretty awesome. I did not like the fact that the pot pie came with fruit. Those 2 things don't go together. 
For dessert we had an apple crumble, an italian lemon cake, and a red velvet cupcake.
Nothing stood out like OMG I CAN NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS. But was everything delish? Yep. Will I return for great food next time someone is in town? Yep. 
Also, all that food, $102. 
Truly not bad at all. 
Service was also great, and our waiter mentioned he'd only been there for 4 days. I never would have know had he not told us. Looking forward to my next time here."}
{"text":"Had their renowned chicken pot pie yesterday and it was delectable - and easily shared by two. 
Also had the tortilla soup (great) and a 1/2 club sandwich that was made with a killer Garlic Aioli - fantastic!

We took 1/2 home!"}
{"text":"I. Have to give this restaurant a bad review for the service alone and the food was not much better. First we are black and the waitress sat us way in the back, where we were the only patrons.  We ask to be moved one of the many tables we past in the front.  The service was slow.  I ordered a stuffed baked potato.  It was huge, but the vega tables were underdone and the potato was very dry.  Obviously we won't be going back."}
{"text":"4 stars. Only because of a wonderful bartender named Richie!!!! He's very nice and accommodating. So much unlike the hostess who sat us and when we told her we are ordering from the happy hour menu she just pointed for us to go to the bar and turned her back on us. Like find your way I don't care. Food was ok. Our food came and the waitress who was putting the food on the bar counter didn't care that the food was falling off the plate. It happened twice and when the whole zucchini stick fell she just grabbed it with her bare hands and put it back in the plate without apologies.   Ewwwwww"}
{"text":"Fancy place located on the south end of the town square mall. In my opinion, this place is a little too fancy to be in a mall but maybe people who shop here like expensive food too. 

Their price is fair since their food is delicious and portioned ! I ordered the sirloin steak, medium rare with baked potato as a side. My friend ordered the same but with saut√©ed onions and mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Highly recommended. We both couldn't finish our foods with how big their portions were. 

Ambiance of this place is fancy, like I mentioned above. Packed with a mixture of elegantly dressed people and those just in casual clothes. 

Variety of dishes on their menu including tasty dessert. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, although a bit busy for a Saturday, nothing you shouldn't be able to handle. Server/bartender didn't acknowledge us for 5 minutes, to which I had to clean my own place and remove the trash from the previous guest. We then ordered our beer, appetizer and entrees.... To which was ALL served at the same time (odd.... I didn't really want to eat all this food at the same time, but okay).  I ordered the Calamari to start with Coconut Shrimp Entree to follow. Calamari wasn't bad, sauce needed some help, but the squid was breaded nicely. Coconut shrimp was horrible.... Obviously frozen and neglected, the shrimp looked beat up and flat thin... Just a major turn off when the product is obviously frozen and stuck together via the fry cycle.... Not a good experience... I completely felt neglected during the meal as we were only recognized during the ordering and check closing."}
{"text":"Claim Jumpers was a very good franchise back in the day! And they still have a few items on their menu loved very much in our family. But overall Claim Jumpers has lost their IT factor!!! They are no longer the place to go. They have very large portions, but you do have to pay for it!!! I would like to say, Claim Jumpers is the restaurant that started the large portion craze!! The only differences now, is other franchise do not over charge you for the large portions. Anyway, again! I have written a review for this location before! Again it has been lost in the YELP ZONE!!! But I would love to write another review!!! Family and I stopped of here when we were here looking for a house. There was nothing different about this place then any other Claim Jumper! Service was decent, food was good, never had any problem. I have always enjoyed their chicken fried steak! And their chocolate eclairs! Each person does not need to order their own food! If you have anyone that would like to share that would be you best choice. That includes dessert! Yes I would come back here, but no I would not make this an occasional thing. Cost to much, and there are better choices!"}
{"text":"We came in starving. It was so busy even late at night. We were seated with in 10 minutes. We were all hungry. Awesome wait staff! Took all our orders quickly with our drink order. Food arrived nice and hot! We were amazed with the quality and huge portions they serve. We were excited to have leftovers for lunch. Worth the price and quality of food! Excellent customer serves!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this claim jumper. Had earned a reward on my Landry's Club and took my wife out. One of the nice things is the varied menu. Almost too many choices. Even a vegetarian menu. I had their cake and steak which comes with asparagus but also included a salad and another side. I had the grilled veggies which were great. The steak and cake were good also. Not a huge serving but very filling. My wife had the filet which was good also. One caution is their desserts. They are huge. You should plan on sharing one so choose something you will both like. If you choose the 3 pound chocolate cake, it can feed 4. Leave room the desserts are all yummy. Most are kinda of sweet. So a few extra calories to burn off. 
Great place for families or a date. Enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is just LAME!! It's lucky I gave it 2 stars. The service is good and no waiting for a table. The food sucks!! It's extremely over priced for what it is and I'm sorry but that chocolate cake tasted like a box mix to me. The food was nothing over average. I had a shrimp over pasta with a \"light butter sauce\" that was thick and tasted like heavy margarine yuck!! I paid 100 bucks for two people and left feeling like I had been robbed because I could have made the meal at home and for a fraction of the cost. Also it would have tasted sooo much better!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but this review is mainly for our service. Service from Andrew was awesome! He was very attentive and knowledgeable. His food recommendations were on point. I definitely recommend their happy hour! I could see why others had left mixed reviews on service because I noticed guest with other servers weren't really being attended to as much but thank goodness we were seated with him. Food came out at a good time. I had a great overall experience!"}
{"text":"This review is on the bar side only. 

Why would you buy 8 wide screen hi def TV's and only be able to tune them all to same channel? Why would those same TV's be individually numbered? 

I believe the reason this happened is either the bartender has no idea that the TV's can be individually tuned or she doesn't care. I suspect the former. 

Order a 10 dollar Cadillac Margarita. A Cadillac Margarita is a super premium cocktail and should be made accordingly. This one was WAY too sweet. Like, way too much sweet and sour. 
 
That being said, the bartender was super nice - hence, the 3 stars. She could use some training and she would be fine."}
{"text":"We have not been in this restaurant and couple of years we went back in and ordered a full rack of beef ribs they changed it to one rib their prices are extremely high they took away all the sides off of your dinners and charge extra for everything Claim Jumpers is no longer a good restaurant to go to"}
{"text":"We went here for a corporate holiday lunch and I was very disappointed.

Our food wasn't good, but I have to say our waitress was amazing.  My main concern is the woman that organized our tables was so rude.  We got there five minutes early with all the secret santa items and wanted to be shown to our reserved table so that we could place the gifts.

The blonde woman with glasses that was dressed in a different attire than the other wait staff asked if our entire party had gotten there and when we told her they hadn't, she responded (in a very rude tone) that she would seat us momentarily, moreso when EVERYBODY showed up.  By this time, we had already reached our reserve time and still had to wait several minutes.  She alone, is the reason I will not be going back, ever.  

Customer service people...I'm not leaving the comfort of home or the break room to be treated horribly."}
{"text":"I tried really hard to like this place. I can honestly say the waiter was the only redeeming aspect of our meal.

We ordered the shrimp brioche - don't bother. They are drowning in BBQ sauce so everything else is pointless.  You could be eating packing styrofoam.

Atmosphere - the management let children run crazy through the restaurant and when  I asked the waiter, I was told there was nothing they could do for fear of being fired.  So instead, they poison the experience rather than ask the family to exert control over their children.  Appalling.

I ordered the salmon and it was very disappointing.  It was supposed to be cooked in lemon butter and the fish is old. All I tasted was the char on the grill.

My colleague ordered the jerk chicken on sweet potato.  Thankfully he asked for the honey on the side.  The chicken was peppered not jerked and peppered to the point of inedibility.

The restaurant is a 70's reject in desperate need of updating starting with the nasty menus and the ancient carpeting."}
{"text":"Appetizer was garlic toast.  It was overlooked and dried out. The Cobb salad was ordinary and tasteless. Tasted as if it had been made a couple days ago.  The waitress was nice and attentive.  As many restaurants as there are here, there must be a COUPLE better!"}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Service! Stopped in Phoenix to See family at Claim Jumper. Amazing!  A bit pricey"}
{"text":"Claim Jumpers used to be one of our favorites. But this is and will be our last time. 

Gluten free pasta? No more muffins? No more cheese bread? Cold chicken wings? Soggy salad? They might as well shut the doors now, most of the favorites are no longer available, not even on the \"secret menu\" the waitress said. 

Truly a shame. Only 7:30pm and the place was empty. I guess our waitress was so bored, she was yawning as she took our order. The kitchen staffing have been falling asleep too..one of the entr√©es was cold as were the appetizer chicken wings."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and both experience was pretty good.  The serving of the food was pretty big which is great because it fit the price. The service has always been quite stellar, our server was always pretty great. The food, I would have to say is very good EVERY TIME.  Always up to a high standard.  

Today, however, was a whole 'nother experience. We came in with a party of 8 (technically we asked for a table for 7, plus a high chair for my baby nephew) and we asked if their happy hour was still going on.  We were informed that it was and it was a self-serve area by the bar.  So we just put two tables together and no biggie.  When we walked in the waitress, Olivia, assisted in putting together the tables.  Keep in mind, we only came in here because Cheesecake Factory had a long wait time and we wanted some desserts ONLY. Also, we came in a whole HOUR before the place closed.

Nevertheless, we sat down and we became interested in their happy hour menu which was advertised, not only in their website,  but also all over their tables.  So we decided to add some appetizers to our order.  After ordering, we were informed that the Happy Hour prices are no longer valid, despite the fact that it's clearly stated on ALL their tables and we got a happy hour menu.  She said they just changed the policy that day.  And that the advertised Happy Hour is only valid during the REGULAR Football Season.  Is she stupid?  The REGULAR season is not over until the SUPER BOWL!!!! Uhm, OKAY.  So we placed our orders still and I went to check with the hostess, she got the manager and I spoke to her and she informed us that she will honor the happy hour prices.  

Once we got our order, my sister accidentally spilled a bit of blue cheese in her coffee.  When I asked the waitress for a new cup, she ignored me.  When I asked for an extra bread for my nephew, who wanted more bread, she looked at me with an incredulous expression and paused to say, \"uhm, yeah...okay.\"  She comes back to refill my coffee (without any spoons distributed to us, AT ALL) and proceeded to refill my sister's drink SEEING that there's white stuff floating all over it.  This whole time, she would go back forth to the bar and whisper with the bartender and they would roll their eyes.  

As she poured that coffee, I was astounded at her stupidity and her laziness.  I was just staring at her hoping she would notice and it would click that she should get a new cup.  NOTHING! She avoided eye contact with me and had this stupid smirk on her face like she's mocking us.  WHAT THE HELL!? I understand that she may be having a bad day, but proper customer service should still be practiced to keep professionalism intact.  Unfortunately, she had neither professionalism nor proper customer service etiquette.  I once again asked for the Manager and she could not even do anything but serve us the remainder of our order, in which time, my sister walked out because she couldn't take it anymore.  I have seen a lot of bad customer service in my time, but this has got to be the worst I have ever seen.  She should not be a waitress if she does not like having to wait on others.  It's absurd! It's insulting! And most importantly, it's unacceptable!! This will definitely not be the end of it.  We're great tippers as people who has worked previously in the service industry.  We know the value of a good service and we pay good money when we receive it.  But that service that we received did not even warrant a single penny.  They're lucky my brother in law is still very generous and still left a tip.  I cannot  believe that experience.  

For a company that is under Landry's Inc., who claim that they are the leader in Dining and Hospitality, this kind of service is truly unacceptable.  It's abhorrent and just plain idiocy to have those kinds of servers employed at such a facility.  I will not go back to this location EVER.  Lastly, the hostess, provided better customer service and professionalism that the manager and the two servers we came across during this visit.  WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! They totally ruined my sister's 17 years anniversary with her husband!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I have zero complaints about the quality and portions. It was delicious and filling. We had a pretty big problem with our server Luis. He didn't take the time to listen to anyone and was walking away from the tables while customers were still talking. He didn't refill our drinks and at one point took a carafe of water off of our table to give to another table. Because he wasn't listening my order was wrong, but was quickly fixed and was delicious when it came back to me. I do think these problems were isolated to this server. I looked around the rest of the restaurant and everyone else seemed to be getting good service. There was a manager who was assisting in making sure that everything was going smoothly. When we had a problem he took care of it right away. He took it seriously, but was friendly to us and extremely professional. He probably deserves a raise. I've never seen anyone working in a restaurant -manager or not- who has been so quick to fix problems in a way that makes everyone feel comfortable and confident. His name is Justin and he seriously deserves a raise."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. Went with my sister and parents. We all had excellent food and I really enjoyed the local beer flight. Would have received a 5 had we not had to wait for 15 minutes past our reservation for no apparent reason...lots of open tables, but not enough staff? IDK, but our waiter was good, so overall, it was a good experience with very good food in a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"I had the Atlantic Salmon for $22 and it was horrible. It didn't taste like salmon because it had this pungent fish-y flavor unlike any other salmon I've tried or cooked. It was dry and the BBQ glaze was just BBQ, I was expecting an actual glaze with multiple ingredients. The shrimp tasted good, I just don't recommend ordering the Atlantic Salmon. Pretty expensive for something simple yet bad."}
{"text":"We became Landry's members through rainforest cafe and came to claim jumpers because they are an affiliate of theirs. We absolutely loved our experience there and have become return guests. The place is very clean and smells amazing. Very friendly staff. We met the general manager, Austin on our most recent trip and he was very welcoming and friendly. We highly recommend this place and plan on returning again soon. The bread they send out is amazing, and our waitress, Desiree, made great recommendations to order that tasted amazing. Five stars!"}
{"text":"We ran into this place while walking Fremont Street. I was there with 3 friends.  My dinner tasted like airline microwave food.  My buddy took 2 bites of his burger, which looked horrible.   I don't think one of us finished her food or liked it.  You're in Vegas there's a hundred of good restaurants to eat at, i would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Nice place. Huge plates. Variety of food choices. The servers were nice. And they validated our parking."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 5 stars because the food was amazing as always this is our 3rd time at a claim jumper all different locations the food is always great the service is always mediocre  hopefully if I give claim jumper another chance it's a better experience"}
{"text":"The ambiance is a bit strange, just seems like you're in a cave. Lot of rocks for decorations and it was rather empty and dark. Went with a couple friends and the service was great. I got the rotisserie chicken and it's enough to share with someone else. It was so juicy and had flavor but could have used more. The vegetables were amazing, grilled zucchini and carrots came with it and they were well seasoned and not overly cooked. Forgot to mention the wings, strange they only have a hot option but they aren't that hot at all. They are meaty, flavorful and juicy! They are tender and I was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Enjoy Going here for Happy Hour Menu And Pricing Decent Choices at Decent Prices Nice Having a Place to go Before or After Movies ( Not in Food Court) Service is Friendly and Competent.  Nice that Happy Hour is All Night."}
{"text":"We were all happy with our meals and the portions were huge so we ended up with doggie bags.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  First time at Claim Jumpers and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"We had the jalapeno, shrimp and cheese appetizer. 
I had the Widow burger which was huge and delicious with fries. 
Hubby had the seafood platter with fries. 
We took a couple of Red Velvet cup cakes and the Cream cheese pie to go and everything was good. 

Prices were what you would expect at this type of Restaurant. 

Can't remember our waiters name but he was tall, big (not fat) white guy  and had the best sounding deep voice. He was very attentive and kept our glasses full. He was awesome!

That restaurant has a great ambiance. Classy but not over the top. 

Go here and eat something."}
{"text":"You need to be as hungry as a bear to eat here. \"Side Salads\" are as big as your head and that's why they're $12 each. Bring tupperware. 

The drink menu is the size of a small novella. You'll have difficulty picking just one. I recommend the Mexican Coffee. 

I only downgraded because it does take awhile to get seated and they could cut the portions in half and charge half as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary we were seated right away food was great Deanna are waitress was great Thank you Claim Jumpier."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night.  Quite a crowd.  Only had to wait 5 minutes.  Tried the new artichoke appetizer.  WOW!  Nice and tender.  Juicy.  Nice dip to go with.  Although I have eaten here for many years, I never save room for dessert.  I have to try harder because the chocolate chip cheesecake looks irresistable.

Good service as usual."}
{"text":"We love eating here for happy hour. Our waitress Monica wasn't all there!! Even tho she repeated our orders to us she still didn't get it right!! We asked for plane chicken wings and we got with sauce!! We asked for carrots and we got celery instead!! Our order didn't come right away nor did our orders come in at the same time we also ordered calamari but it came about 18 min after our chicken wings! It  was a terrible experience for us. She even told us that she dropped our chicken but never replaced it!!! We usually go to the one in GV but we wanted to try Town Square out.. how sad that she had to spoil it for us. Claim Jumper manager I hope you fix this.. She had a man walk out of the place while we waited for our food. He was not a happy camper either. The food was delicious but the service stank!!!! Sorry, Monica but next time please listen to your customers order. It wasn't even a big order!! So what's the excuse?? I give 3 stars for good chicken wings!!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot on Friday night for a couple drinks and 9 oz filet. Last trip we found out they no longer have the 9 oz filet and my \"medium rare\" filet came out very well done.  Looking for a new steak house now."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the only thing is, it smells like poop outside the restaurant and after a nice meal it stinks to walk outside after. Literally. The food is good. I like that you get bread and salad with most meals. It is pricy. 15 to 25 for most meals, but like I said, bread and salad come with it. The alcoholic drinks need some work.  I got a Margarita that was way to sour to drink. And the mint they put in there drinks is way to fine. I swallowed more mint the alcohol.gross. service is good, but slow. So be prepared to sit there for more then an hour for the whole service."}
{"text":"Service and food was good. No real complaints. Ordered a Filet and was satisfied."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Went in just to have fun with my family and have appetizers and dessert to celebrate my birthday. Server came and acknowledged us once. Someone else brought our drinks and took our order. No one came to check on us or give us refills. By the time the original server came around we just wanted the check. Very disappointed. This type of service has never happened in the past. Nonetheless, we're not going back. 

*A manager called us back regarding our experience and offered a free appetizer and dessert. Like I said before this type of service hasn't happened before. I do appreciate their follow up. I will update once more when we go in!"}
{"text":"We dined here with a group of 10 friends on a Friday night.  The Manager was very accommodating to the member of our group who set up  our special birthday decorations on our table and put a banner on the wall behind our table prior to us being seated..  We were ordering one of their cakes and they also added on our special themed decoration cake topper.  John was our waiter and was extremely nice.  We received all our food in a timely fashion.  He recommended one of their chicken dishes to me and it was excellent.  Yes, this is not the old Claim Jumper with huge portions and has not been for years.  However we found the food to be very good and plentiful.  Really, who needs to take home food in a bag like the old days.  We were so happy to find Claim Jumper in the Golden Nugget,  as our local Claim Jumper has closed down.  If you're having a special occasion, call the Manager in advance."}
{"text":"Just BAD. I ordered beef ribs. They were almost burned and dry. Like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all night. Daughter had $30 salmon. It was very average. I expected it to be a premium dish for $30 in a place one level above coffee shop.  Other daughter had parmesan crusted chicken with pasta - very bland. Top sirloin was so average for $20. I could have cooked it better at home on a bad day. This place is pathetic. Wish I had read the reviews. Shut it down."}
{"text":"Clean Peaceful bar relaxing I had the Widow maker burger don't be scared by the name it is great.
Bartender is super nice and super fast."}
{"text":"Good food. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. Chicken fried steak was pretty good. Do yourself a favor if you're here at the Nugget. Skip the buffet that sucks and just come here."}
{"text":"Had I written this review between 2009 and 2015, it would have been a 4 star minimum, however in about that least year it hasn't been going well. I'm a Landry's member for years and signed up at this location, but will doubtfully ever go back. Service and food is so hit or miss...more so miss recently. Came in recently with family from out of town and was embarrassed to have taken them there. It was a weekday evening and not busy at all. We were seated fairly quickly but some sandwiches, burgers, kid's meal, and jambalaya took nearly an hour to arrive after ordering. Our waiter was nice, but seemed too busy. When the food finally arrived the burger was cold (and came 10 mins after all other dishes), a sandwich was burnt and another just tastes bad, and the jambalaya was just a bowl of butter, a sign of a rescue attempt of food sitting too long. Talked to the manager and was offered 50% off, however when my cousin that attempted to stomach the jambalaya had to run to the restroom to vomit, I refused to pay. The last 4 visits have had poor service with mediocre food and the place seems short staffed. I love the franchise and still go to the Tempe one when I'm in the area, but I believe this one will soon close its doors at this rate."}
{"text":"Convenient restaurant with a large menu in Golden Nugget. A little overpriced for what you get, as is to be expected in a hotel. The clam chowder wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Claim  Jumpers. And when I travel west, I really hope there's one by. Was in Vegas two weeks ago for business.  Nine of us went to this location.  Service started off a little slow but we had a great waiter.  SO MUCH FOOD.  Everyone seemed to enjoy what the ordered.   I had Tri Tip for the very first time.  I asked for Med Rare and it came Medium.  I decided not to send it back.   It was still very good and very tender.  We all left very full, very happy and very pleased.  I do hear that the pot pie is wonderful !"}
{"text":"Go to their website and it doesn't say anything about not taking gift cards.  Drive an hour to come here and use my gift card and they say they don't take them anymore, event though they can verify the amount.  Worst service and lost a customer!"}
{"text":"I've been to another Claim Jumper in Las Vegas (On West Charleston) and I like that one better.  Seems cramped in the Town Center location.

Parking is annoying at Town Center if you want to go to any place in the middle of the square.

We went here because we looked up the gluten free menu online and we were close because we picked up a visiting relative who was staying on the strip.
The online and store menu says the buffalo wings are gluten free but when we asked at the restaurant, we were told they were cooked in the same oil as the french fries, which are NOT gluten free.
My daughter was disappointed because she was looking forward to trying them.
She got the potato skins instead.

The calzone was HUGE but only because the bread had risen up with hot air.  Once I stabbed into it and let the air out there wasn't much to it except bread.  Taste was good though.
Gluten free hamburger bun was very good...better than some other buns we've tried.
Chicken Wrap, very good.
Pork wings, very good
Grits, very good

Recommend removing the buffalo wings from the gluten free section.  Celiac is a very sensitive disease and my daughter is very, very allergic to wheat (gluten).  I'm glad we asked about the wings before we ordered them.  I know there is a disclaimer on the menu that says it's not a gluten free restaurant, which is fine, but if something is listed as gluten free, there are ways in the kitchen to eliminate cross contamination of gluten.  I am happy there is an attempt at Claim Jumper to accommodate those with food allergies and I thank you for that."}
{"text":"I've been to claim jumper a few times but never this location downtown. I had the 9oz steak medium well with grilled shrimp. I was very pleased with my meal the service was very fast. I had a Mai tai with my meal which was stronger than I remembered but no complaints. With an all day breakfast menu it's never a bad idea to stop by this location."}
{"text":"Vegans - We were staying nearby with omni friends and after looking at the menu, I figured we could make it work.  SORT of wrong - we presumed they would have a salad bar (they don't - only in CA we were told) but ok, it was 8:30 PM and we were tired.. they were short-staffed so service was SLOW, however, the one waitress who was running her butt off to keep up was  very personable and friendly, and that made the long wait tolerable.  We said we weren't leaving until they fed us, anyway.  Friends were all happy with their selections, and us vegans  - I got a HUGE salad which hit the spot, and hubby had a pizza with veggies and no cheese.. he said it was great.  Not a lot of choices.. but hey, we knew that going in.  TOO BAD they don't have a salad bar! Or more healthy options.."}
{"text":"Jazmin the host was very rude. My boyfriend and I waited over an hour while another people got their food before us. Never eating here again. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"The Lady craved the Whiskey Glazed Chicken as we drove away from the house and still hadn't decided where we were going to eat. So she say's \"Miller Ale House, or Claim Jumper?\" I hate picking, because she's pregnant and I don't want to pick the wrong one, and I'll find something to eat pretty much anywhere so it's her choice. We decide on Claim Jumper, and I was happy to oblige her craving.

We walk in on Saturday night at about 815 and go into the bar and sit at one of the booths.  A plus that we pulled up and a car pulled out of one of the spots right in front of the entrance, so we pulled in and noticed there was still 15 minutes left in the meter.  +1.  A cute server promptly brought us waters and a couple menus and asked how we were doing this Saturday night. so +1 for friendliness.

We scoured the menus and she had already decided what she was getting, so it took me just a minute to find my country fried steak which is almost always what I get at a place like this. (Mimi's, Applebee's, Chili's, etc). We ordered and asked her opinions of the two items we got and she said they are both excellent, the chicken was bone-in and the country fried steak was GINORMOUS and that it's the size of the plate. (there is a light version of you don't want to eat the plate size portion).  If you've been to Claim Jumper you might know how big the plates are here. 

The food was spot on for me. The lady was disappointed in the chicken, it used to be 3 or 4 chicken breasts with the glaze and apples all over the meat, now it's a big breast/thigh piece with a million bones and by the time she was done she had a pile of bones and skin bigger than the actual amount of chicken she consumed, it was a pain in the a** picking all the chicken off and it's wasted pounds by serving it bone-in. But knowing about the restaurant industry a little, we understand with the economy slowish, it's cheaper for restaurants to buy bulk whole pieces like this instead of pre-made breasts ready to serve. Each came with a choice of side, I got the bacon mac n cheese and she got the baked potato. Both were really good, it's pretty tough to mess up a baked potato and the mac was nice, nothing amazing, but good. The steak was huge, she wasn't kidding, I can eat and I barely finished half of it, but it's nice cause now I have leftovers and leftover country fried steak is delicious.  She said the chicken had a good taste and the apples hit the spot.
I had a beer and we split a cup of french onion soup. Bill was $44 + tip which isn't bad considering we both brought food home. Soup was a little ridiculous priced, $5 for a little cup no matter how good it is is stupid, and the beer was $4.75 for a domestic bottle so that's a little high too.  All in all we had a nice dinner out. The place wasn't loud and annoying, the service was spot on and she did a great job so we tipped her well, and the food was very solid.

4 solid stars! thanks CJ!"}
{"text":"I love the for here, it is always amazing. The portions are beyond huge the price is decent I mean for the amount you get it's fitting. My husband and I came for a rare date night and had a great time. We were seated in the back alone on a busy Saturday night, it was private which was nice. We had great consistent service. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it and Christopher was the best waiter ever! He made us laugh and my birthday extra special! 
We all loved him and he was definitely a highlight in a really great trip. Thank you Christopher! We wish you ,your husband, your son and all your animals you may the best!"}
{"text":"For starters, it took the hostess 2-3 min to greet us even after she saw us. We were sat at a dirty booth, so we switched to a new one. It took 15 min to have our order taken, and 20 min for me to receive my weak $9 cocktail. My food came out disgusting. How can you mess up chicken strips? Well, don't cook them for long enough and don't drain the oil off of them whatsoever, and that's exactly how. I told the waitress I didn't want them. She took them and said she'd show the manager. The manager never came over to apologize, and neither did the waitress. She even acted like I was being unreasonable. And she expected us to order dessert! Don't waste your money there...."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money. The twenty minute wait I was quoted turned into 45 minutes. When we were eventually seated, we were told they were out of forks! It took an hour to get our food! I am not sure why everything took so long considering the place was half empty! Their food was average at best and they were over priced! When I asked the server about a menu item, his response was \"it's ok, it's something you can make at home.\"  WTF!!!!"}
{"text":"Super-friendly staff and manager. Cozy , quiet, not crowded, so good for dining. Of course very few desserts and they not very tempting, so you not gonna break your diet plan, some food very good like clam chowder and salad and some is not so well like meatloaf."}
{"text":"This is probably the last time I'm eating at a claim jumper, they really have gone down hill. Food is not like it was a couple years ago, smaller portions, not good quality. Dinner tonight was not up to par, food came out not even hot, salad was a joke, small and full of brown pieces, ribs barley any meat on them, I can buy betters ones at Costco and get more for the same price. Service was ok. Next time I want a good dinner for $80, I will try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite resturaunt! My boyfriend and I come here all the time and it's always absolutely amazing. Service is great and food is seriously out of this world! I always get the steak salad and it's delicious. My boyfriend always gets the sliders and fries and loves it. They have great Arnold palmers and appetizers. This place is worth the try you'll love it!"}
{"text":"i normally dont write reviews because i just dont have the patience for doing so but the last time i came to this claim jumper location was great. the service was great and so was the food.
it started out with myself and my boyfriend going out to eat off the happy hour menu with our friend, she shows up about 25 min. after we did so while we're waiting for her we had our drinks served and an appetizer, our server was Monica and she only came by a few times to offer us a refill and bring our appetizer but she didnt bother us until our friend finally showed up and it may not seem like a big deal but i loved that! i hate waiting for other people to show up when we set a specific time to meet but i hate when the server(s) come by multipule times just for me to give them the same answer, which is \"we're waiting for our friend\" or something along the lines of that. when our friend finally showed up Monica was very attentive and very on the ball.
i had been to other claim jumper's in the past and the food is almost always bleh. the food at this location was spectacular! i ordered mozzarella sticks and you'd think the people making them know how to put cheese in them but this location is the only one who knows to acually put cheese in their mozzarella sticks!
overall i would recommend this location 10/10 times and if you ever come ask for Monica"}
{"text":"I like the tuna sandwich and they have a great happy hour.  The service is alittle corporate pushy but overall a fun happy hour spot. The portions are big n the sliders are well made."}
{"text":"#1 - I don't like many chains

#2 - This one wasn't too bad

Ok - so the cobb salad's were only so-so.  The Chicken pot pie was fair.  But the sample they gave me of the Thai salad was very good.  If I ever go back, this is what I'll have.  Couple of wines and I'll be all set!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Claim Jumper in years. I'm going to guess it was at least 15 years since I have visited this restaurant at any location. 

A large group of went to lunch to celebrate my retirement. We arrived a bit early and they rushed to set up. The menu is pretty big and I opted for the grilled fish tacos. They were really, really good and I was surprised. I don't recall that the food was this good, but then again, it's been awhile. 

The corn tortillas were substantial. What I mean by that is that they were thicker and they didn't fall apart and crumble as I ate. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce delicious. I was surprised to see french fries with my order and let me tell you they were delicious. Our server was on it and my ice tea was filled quickly without my asking. 

The restaurant was clean, we got good service. The hostess even came outside and took a group photo. 

I'm taking my husband here and will try something new. Yup, it was that good."}
{"text":"Our first trip to a \"Claim Jumpers\" was a very pleasant experience for my wife and me. We went there on Thursday January 5 at about 5pm. We were taken to a table immediately as they were not busy. About one hour later when we left they were much busier.

Our server brought us a very interesting and tasty garlic pretzel roll. This was followed by two salads with some delicious corn bread croutons.

For dinner my wife had the Black tie Chicken Pasta and I had the blackened Atlantic Salmon. Both entrees were tasty and well presented. A glass of the Mark West Pinot Noir topped off a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"We walked in with a party of eight and they quickly found a table for us.  The server came right over with menus and ask if we wanted drinks. It took two trips to get all the drinks and she asked about appetizers and took our orders. Each of us picked something different and she handled each order and special request perfectly.

When the food arrived, each order was correct. That shouldn't be surprising but we had eight orders and many of them included substitutions and special requests. The server refreshed our drinks as needed and checked on us throughout the meal.

The food was very good. Comments from around the table: The pasta was firm with the right amount of sauce. The steak was cooked to order and delicious. The salad was fresh and not swimming in dressing. The chicken pot pie was huge.  The Three Cheese Potatocakes are worth a special trip!

The manager stopped by to check on us and we raved about the server. This may be a chain restaurant but you would never know it. Good food, great service."}
{"text":"They have unbelievable Ribeye. I have ordered it eat in and to-go on several occasions and it's always been cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I always had high expectations when it comes to Claim jumpers because I love the big portions, the delicious food & the outstanding customer service.  This was my first time at this location.  We had a big party of 11. Our server was very attentive & kind even though we kept asking for stuff. I love how my niece only ate the shredded carrots out of my sisters salad so our server brought her a good amount of shredded carrots she could eat off her own plate. Everyone enjoyed their meals.  I'm very picky when it comes to salt so I gave my food back & they replaced it with no problem. The manager came to apologize which was considerate. It wasn't bad I'm just not used to salt in my food."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and his dad share the same Birthday, and every year we all go out to dinner to celebrate together.  This year we decided on Claim Jumper. It has been years since we have ate Claim Jumper so we were excited to go.  

It started off ok. We had a lady greet us saying she was helping our server out.  Being a server myself, I totally understand that sometimes it gets busy and we all need help at times.  When our server came to our table by the name of a Phil, he was a little pushy and wanted to take our order right away. We asked for a couple more minuets


We ordered our appetizer and all of our meals.  After waiting nearly 45 minuets and still not receiving our appetizer  in a not so busy restaurant our server Phil came out with our food. 


We  asked Phil why our appetizer had not shown up. The confused look on his face made us believe he never put the order in, and told us he was going to go ask the Chef.  After about 10 minutes he finally came back with our appetizer, and walked away really quick. Before my fianc√© could say ANYTHING about his steak being  Extremely undercooked he was gone  we waited several more minutes for him to come. Meanwhile the three of us had already gone through half of our meals and my fianc√© sitting there waiting. 

He took the steak back to the kitchen and the chefs literally put the same steak that had already been cut back on the grill, including the pieces that had been cut off. Major health code violation.  


When the steak finally arrived back it STILL wasn't cooked enough.  but we couldn't tell Phil because we literally never saw him again. 

After 20 or so minutes he came back and asked us if we were ready for desert or the check. He never refilled any of our drinks, never asked if we needed anything else, never came back to check if we were ok.   

We ended up asking for the check. He was quick to drop it off.  But then had the lady who originally greeted us run the card. I have to say this was probably the worse dining experience we have had in a long time.  And it being their Birthday dinner really made it that much worse. 

I HATE writing reviews like this, but when we only get together a couple times a year for a nice dinner it's disappointing when the experience is terrible"}
{"text":"For a place that brags about portion sizes yet charges $9.00 for small bowl of chicken tortilla soup that looks like a it came froma can is ridiculous!! I complained to the manager and he made no effort to make things right.  I then went online to send a complaint and no response.
My girlfriend and I had both ordered a bowl and neither of us plan on ever returning, nor all the people we told the incident about ."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I don't know what's been wrong. I went for lunch last week, around 11am with my boyfriend. We are both tall, and not petite. The restaurant was almost empty, and it's a huge place, so you can imagine why I rolled my eyes and requested a bigger booth when we were seated at the tiny two seater booth. What on earth makes someone think that anyone wants to sit there ever, unless it's a full house and it's the difference between sitting immediately or waiting 30 minutes? I like to  be comfortable, and I don't have short arms. Anyway, my bf ordered a $5 tiny cup of french onion soup, with almost as much cheese as soup, gross. I got an uneventful lunch combo of half caesar salad and half sandwich, but to be honest, I dont remember the sandwich. I know it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't awesome, like I used to think of the tri tip dip, or the cashew chicken salad. The time before that  we went there, I got the chicken pot pie, and the chicken was rubbery and unedible. Our server was good that time, and he did rectify the situation to be clear. I miss the old quality, the old feeling that you were at someplace really nice, and the more generous portions. What happened?  I see to the left that I am not the only one who thinks this way, Please do something!!"}
{"text":"Four adults and two children today for lunch.  Have nothing to complain about, as service was great and our food just about perfect for what we ordered.  Kids meals of corn dogs, and macaroni & cheese.  YUM!  Two chicken pot pies (one had the chicken a little too well done which left it sort of tough), the other one, perfect.  I had a cup of French Onion Soup and an artichoke.  Seems I can't get past their grilled artichokes whenever we eat here.  Delicious!  In fact that is one of the main reasons I love to eat here.  As stated before, service was very good with everyone being so attentive and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this claim jumpers several times and each time the service was terrible!  This last time I went for a late lunch. I asked the server if the soup I wanted to order had a chicken or beef base as I have been a vegetarian for 29 years. I was told that it did not have any meat in it so I ordered it. When it was delivered to my table by another service person I again asked if the soup had a chicken or beef base. Guess what? It did. I ordered the soup and salad off the lunch menu. I got the salad and guess what?  They told me it was the same size as just ordering the salad alone.  I talked with the manager who told us it was a \"teachable\" moment for the employee. And that was it. I wound up paying more for my salad than the soup and salad. The manager did not offer a substitute. No discount nothing. If I had ate the soup I would have gotten horrible stomach pains as meat is like poison to my body. Don't go to this claim jumpers. The one in Henderson is great. Hopefully this one will close up soon. Either way I will never go back."}
{"text":"I live near here and it's a great place to go with friends if you  want to get some good food  with  sizable portions and have a good time. The atmosphere is relaxed and   especially during the week, it's not hard to get a table.  I recommend the house salad. It has cornbread croutons and I promise you, if you are making a face right now, try this salad I bet  you'll want to have it again. This place is great to just kick back and relax.   They have a full bar. The staff is friendly, the lighting is low, and you really  don't feel like you spent a bunch of money when you have left.   
 There is something for everyone here. From sliders ( YUM) to a full rack of ribs, to a steak even . You name it, they probably have it! I hope you enjoy. This location is great and its  just  a nice down- home kind of place.  You can bring the kids too!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was great there were no issues at all with the food. My issue was entirely with the server. 
He was extremely slow. We saw him a total of four times the entire dinner. On top of that when we received the check it was wrong. We waited 20 min to try and get him to fix the check. Finally got tired of waiting and went and told the manager about the issue with the check. He fixed it in a matter of a couple of minutes. Like I said my only issue was with the server. I will return as the food is great and the menu has a wide array to choose from."}
{"text":"For some odd reason, I always thought Claim Jumper was Clam Jumper and a seafood restaurant until recently.  But I digress with my stupidity.  This was my first time at CJ, and not my idea.  But when it was suggested to me, all I could think of was the words of Donald S resonating in my mind... \"big eclair.\"  So off we went.

I had the tri-tip dip with slaw.  The sandwich is basically a french dip with the addition of caramelized onions, green chiles, and smoked gouda.  It was tasty, but a little wet as the meat is simmered in broth.  The slaw was surprisingly good, however.

Our party of 3 wanted two different desserts, so we ordered both the eclair and the chocolate cake in spite of the server's attempts to warn us that these desserts were big.  Big is probably an understatement.  The eclair was about the size of a football once you factored in the bed of vanilla ice cream it sits on and the whipped cream that encases the whole thing.  Was it the best eclair?  No, the pastry was a little tough, perhaps because it was so gigantic, and a little more custard to whipped cream ratio might have been nice, but it was just fine for $9.95.  I ate all I could, my dining companions had some, and I still took home enough to serve a small country.

Will I return?  Hmmm.  Maybe when I suggest to my husband we just go out for a little dessert, knowing what's in store."}
{"text":"Great service and the Chicken Pot Pie is the best. This is a great place to have a client/business meeting or just a family night."}
{"text":"7 Days ago one of my employees got a bug the size of a dime in a salad. Yesterday for some crazy reason I went back to eat there, and I got a large black hair inside of my fish taco. I will never eat  at this restaurant again, I will never recommend this restaurant, and the manager came over and argued with me as well about it. I've reported them to the health department"}
{"text":"Great service. Got table immediately. Staff super friendly. Mgmt staff top notch!! Patti and her night crew have their stuff together! Totally would recommend for a late dinner or snack. Wedge salad and bbq grilled pizza great choices."}
{"text":"So, you know, Claim Jumper is a chain and stuff. I never go here of my own volition but occasionally when a group of work people want to go, I tag along. The food has always been just okay. But THEN. Today, on a lark, I tried the veggie burger, and WOW, it was just amazing. I mean, amazing. It was a Boca burger topped with tomato, avocado, caramelized red onions, garlic mayo, and gouda, which I switched out for goat cheese. Seriously, this thing was heaven. My one complaint is that it was served on very heavily toasted toast, which I don't think the menu indicated, and I HATE sandwiches on toast. This one was delicious enough to make up for the toast thing, but next time I'll ask for it on a roll instead. 

I could only eat half of this deliciousness and took the rest home in a box -  it came with a fairly large side salad for $9, which I considered to be a steal. I never thought I'd say this, but I can't wait to go back to Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"I had the \"Chicken Fried Chicken\" it was great and so big that I was unable to finish. Server was very good and friendly. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible Service!!! Went in at about 1 pm today for lunch, we had a party of 12 they told us it would be about a 30 minute wait so we said that's fine. They said they had the room but not enough servers  but anyways we waited. Our table was ready so we went and sat, took about 10 minutes to get our drink orders and drinks. The waitress was very slow, she finally took our order at about 1:30ish, to make a long story short we finally received our food at 3:14!!!  Yes it took that long to get our food and when we finally got it, it was freakin COLD!!!! Out of the party of 12 only 2 had decent temperature food!! So we complained and the manager finally came and took our plates, to top it off one of the kids meals had a hair in it!! It took about another 30 mins to get our replacement meals. The waitress finally came at the end to tell us the manager was taking care of all the meals! And she had the balls to say \"I've never known a manager to cover all the meals!\" Really?! After waiting all that time and then getting cold food? Then she had the balls to say I brought the desert menu if you are interested?!? Needless to say we will not be returning to this place AGAIN!!!! They don't even deserve 1 STAR!!!"}
{"text":"I joined a few of my co-wrokers here lastnight for a Happy Hour and everything was actually pretty good. 

I am usually not a fan of Claim Jumpers, as I have always thought their food was overcooked, over fried, over done, over yuck. But lastnight, I had a Stella, relaxed and enjoyed some Calamari and their street tacos. They were great. The salsa for the chips and salsa was dull and tasteless, but it looked and tasted fresh. Not bottled. 

It looks like they have changed up their menu a bit since the last time I visited and thats a good thing trust me. More healthy ventures are offered and that will attract more people I think. Not that they have a problem with that to begin with. The place is always jamming packed. As it was this time, but the service was good and the atmosphere fun and that is what Happy Hours are supposed to be. 

Good Job Claim Jumpers."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is great! Their menu has a large selection and their desserts are wonderful. Tonight, I enjoyed the Hill Country Salad--lettuce with bacon, diced egg whites, cheese, and lightly breaded chicken. The service is always good and they offer Diet Sprite--a plus for me since I try to limit sugar and caffeine."}
{"text":"Atrocious. Consider the price point. Dollar for dollar, dining out just can't get any worse than this. Grease laden, obscenely over salted franchise food for twice the amount of money of your standard franchise restaurant.  The service? Poorly trained staff that has no idea what to do if a customer can't stomach the glop that just came out of the kitchen. Why are bread plates on the table if you don't serve bread with the meal. How on earth do you get off charging $7.50 for a short shot of Jack, $6.25 for fake Guinness, and $8.50 for diluted Citron. This place offers nothing to get me back in there again. It is awful and expensive. 

Oh, and one last suggestion to our server last night. If any part of a dinner entree is categorically inedible, take the WHOLE plate back to the kitchen and let the cook try to repair it. Don't break up the dish onto those little unusable bread plates and don't return with the same crap that you left with."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  It wasn't busy at all for a Saturday night.  Our waiter was cool.  Food was great but no sense of urgency.  I asked for a plastic spoon for our toddler to enjoy for her applesauce but never received one and by the time our waiter came back to check on us, we were done eating.  Lame.  But everything else was ok."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of claim jumper but after last night, not sure I'll be back. My gf and I went in for dinner. As soon as we sat down we ordered two drinks. Mind you it was not busy at all in the dining area. The waitress came back 3 times and I asked about our drinks. It took over 40 minutes to get three drinks. The salad and soup came out way before the drinks and my soup was cold. Our meals were decent, my fries, again came out cold. It was a sad excuse for service nonetheless and was very displeased."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a guy cashing out a customer, took several minutes, he needed to call the manager over, several staff walked by, made eye contact but said nothing.  Finally we were sat, server took forever to come over for drink order.  After that he walked back and forth past our table several times, never with our drinks though.  Had to remind him, had to ask for complimentary garlic bread which arrived after our apps.  We had the pretzel and cheese sauce which lacked the pretzel salt.  
General food timing and service was slow, all the tables were looking around for their server for something or another.
Club sandwich was yummy and widow maker burger was juicy and delicious, fries however were cold.
Have never had good service at any of the claim jumpers."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but nothing too exciting.  My wife had their try-tip sandwich which she would a 3 out of 5 score.  I had the meatloaf dinner, which I would rate slightly better than a 3.  On the side, the mashed potatoes were very good however the grilled veggies were overdone."}
{"text":"The first and last time i went to this place they gave us cold food. I was so excited to try this- by the time i went here they still had 4 stars. Now writing this revirw its down to 3. Makes sense to me. Heres the thing i found not quiet good abiut the place.

Cons:
1. Cold food.
2. No flavor.
3. Expensive.
4. Very rude server
5. The cake- is very bland- too dry- like dry as a bread.
6. Vegestable not fresh

Just avoid the place. We went to another restaruant that day to finish the day."}
{"text":"First time ever trying claim jumpers (heard great things about the food). Walked through the door, where two ladies were in the middle of something. No biggie. Couple minutes later we finally got seated. We sat down for at least 6-7mins with no greeting from a server/waiter. The Manager walked by after seating another couple behind us, and stopped to ask if we needed beverages. We said yes we have been waiting for at least 5mins. Manager responds \"okay, that's it?\". When you're very hungry and parched, that's not what you want to be told. Got up and walked out.. 
Piss poor service"}
{"text":"Great food and sub par service. I felt like I was on a deserted island with no one in sight."}
{"text":"Service was good. I ordered the rostterie chicken with mac and cheese, but there was no cheese in their mac and cheese. Complimentary bread was awesome."}
{"text":"I have a major problem.  When I'm standing there with a Togo menu in hand, no hostesses at their station.  Then two hostesses show up don't acknowledge me in business attire.  And then a group walks in they totally ignore me and attend to the group of 12.  Both hostesses apparently needed to Seat the group of 12. They disappear.  Upon returning they are laughing and talking about the bad service the waiter/waitresses are providing to customers.  My instant thought was- well I think the hostesses are equally as bad as they still did not address me or ask to take my order.   If I was not in a hurry to provide a quick snack to a diabetic that was waiting at the Apple Store.  I would have definitely went elsewhere.   I was stuck in a predicament and ordered with the bar tender who did provide great service.   If I was the owner of the establishment, I would fire the two cows in the hostess positions date 4/17/2015 at noon.  I'll do whatever I can to discourage others from going here.  If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"So you went to happy hour on Sunday. Ordered pretzel Wings spinach artichoke dip sliders. The waitress that helped us forgot to get us the calamari that we did Place into order. The rest of the food was okay. The spinach dip was a little dry. The pretzels were much better before the change they made recently they seem to have integrated salt into the dough and tasted better in its previous form. The wings and Sliders were fine. Very quiet environment which was nice. Look forward to attending happy hour in future."}
{"text":"I am still in a daze and full from the meal I had here a few days ago.  Don't ask me what I had, it's all a fog now.  I just remember my terror at the enormous plate of delicious food that was placed in front of me.

I tried to escape, but I was caught in its gravitational pull.

Once I was able to consume enough to break away, then box the remainder... my terror was refreshed when my lunch date ordered an eclair for dessert.

I'm going to have nightmares about chocolate, whipped cream, custard and ice cream for a week.

Delicious nightmares.

Excuse me while I roll away from the computer."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Excellent place for a business dinner or date night. Unique menu with a well balanced selection."}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie is awesome. This is always ordered for our table when we visit. Portions are generous and we've always had good service. I love the ambiance of this restaurant. I like this location more than the one at Town Square. Family friendly and lots of parking. Expect to take home leftovers."}
{"text":"I just love their Southwestern egg rolls and their appetizer sampler is always a good thing to try if you want to variety of appetizers which could also turn into a meal for three people if you so chose! I know my sister and I with my niece could not finish this platter without eating even a main entr√©e! It's around 27$ and well worth it for fried food which I only eat every now and again, and their fried food is the best!!"}
{"text":"Where to start?  Went here for dinner with some friends.  There were 14 of us total, so we did get to sit in a private room, which was nice.  The server was okay, but must say, was keener on the men then the women, first mistake.  Ordered our dinners when everyone arrived, and the dinners did all come at the same time, which was a plus.  I ordered the chopped steak.  Chopped steak=giant hamburger patty.  Just need to clear that part up before I go on.  A well used NHL hockey puck would have been cooked less than the piece of meat I received.  I did send it back, asked for medium, and it was still verging on hockey puck.  I ate it any way. The burger I had at Red Robin a few days later was much better!) Second and third mistake.  My husband got the fish tacos, which he really enjoyed, so that is one good thing.  

Since we had a large party,  each couple paid their bill,  Claim Jumper felt the need to tax on what they felt the gratuity should be.  On the receipt, the word, \"If agreeable\", appear.  We did not agree with the 18% gratuity, and paid less, but Claim Jumper charged our card with the suggested gratuity plus what my husband and I agreed upon.  Had to set this straight with my bank.  Not a happy camper with that one, and I somehow knew there was going to be an issue with the tab.  

Not a good experience, and I don't think I will return any time soon.  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen and The Cheesecake Factory come to mind when dining at this restaurant chain.  It was a spot we had to try since we do not have one in Hawaii.  Excellent service.  Decent food.  Conveniently located at Town Square Mall."}
{"text":"The food was no more than average at best in my opinion. I ordered the pasta with the friend shrimp in it and it's was soooooo oily and greasy that I couldn't really enjoy it. My bf described his mini sliders as dry and flavorless. However I must say that the service was excellent. The waitress was friendly, happy, helpful, and checked in on us at the perfect times. The hostess was friendly and the drinks were great while we were sitting at the bar waiting for our table."}
{"text":"I have no clue why this place has pretty poor reviews. I came here on a Friday with my boyfriend and was greeted almost immediately. We were seated within the first 5 minutes of walking in. 

The server attended to us right away. Took our drink orders and almost instantly served our drinks. She came back in 10 minutes because we were deciding what we wanted to eat. (I'm indecisive, but she was so patient!) She recommended a few dishes to help me with deciding what I should order. 

Again, came back with some complimentary cheese bread and refills on our drinks. It took about 45 minutes for our food to come out. To me, that's not a long wait. During the time she kept refilling our drinks and bread. So I didn't even notice. Shoot! For quality, well-cooked food... I'll wait. I wouldn't want them to rush my food. 

The food was hot and super delicious! You can tell the dishes were well prepared. 

I would definitely come back! Great service, even better food!"}
{"text":"Hmmmmm, today's lunch....hubby was satisfied with his tri tip dip...mine, fish tacos, opt for grilled fish. I love fish tacos but this was my first here and let me just say, I've never ever had grilled tacos with a \" light batter\" per waitress. Fish was so tough and rubbery. I gave 2 stars because the garlic cheese bread was good and the waitress knew my fish looked recooked so she comp my order"}
{"text":"We come here often for happy hour and today we ordered potato skins which were cold in the middle.  We told them this and they took them away and a few minutes later they bring the SAME ones back as the half eaten one was still there.

My friend immediately went to the manager as this was unacceptable and there was cheese dripping out of the one which could have touched anything.. VERY unsanitary!  The manager then stated she would get fresh ones out right away.

When we asked for the check we asked if they are taking the skins off for us and the new bartender said \"I'll get the manager to come talk to you about this.\"  As a manager myself that is the worst thing a guest can hear.  After having to send our food back twice I think the last thing they can do is remove the charge for this item.  The manager finally came over and said \"oh yes I was going to take these off I was just going to tell you\".

Probably won't be back.."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Made a reservation for 4, when my friends arrived they were told that the restaurant does not take reservations. Which is a lie. When we were seated I requested to our server that we would like separate checks. I ordered a CA citrus salad with no cheese or croutons and add grilled shrimp. Order came with no shrimp but with cheese. They made a new salad with boiled shrimp of which I refused. Needless to say I didn't have dinner that night. Then when the check came it was all on one. This restaurant is a joke. Maybe they need to train the wait and restaurant staff, it's not rocket science to get an order right. Also very over priced!"}
{"text":"Claim jumper is alright, their healthy options are not that great.  The chicken pot pie is pretty good if you want your calorie intake in one meal.  Atmosphere is nothing great but and the staff are a little slow although friendly.  They do have happy hour which is a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"A once fine restaurant has been sold and the new bean counting owners have degraded this formerly wonderful, highly rated, dining establishment. I'm done with Claim Jumper. The penny pinching new owners don't deserve my business and I don't want their food."}
{"text":"Claim Jumpers is overpriced and overrated. The fried zucchini from Carls Jr. is better than Claim Jumpers. Their portions are large and filling but the lack of taste leaves you with no motivation to finish."}
{"text":"Well I let my wife talk me into trying this \"DUMP\" one more time. ( not my decision )  This place still \"SUCKS\" and always will in now, both our books!!!  Thank god!!! Now, she finally See's what i was talking about this whole time. OK, she had the Roasted tri-tip and I had the country fried steak. OMG.......GROSS!!!!!   what a lump of sh**.  I'll post a pic of what I scrapped off it. ( Pic. is next to my profile pic. ) To start the waiter was da da duh....we asked for ( No lemon ) in our water and yep...you guessed it lemon. He said: i couldn't remember if you wanted lemon or not so i put it on there for you. I said: we told you 30 seconds ago, glad we are not allergic to it!!  First nose dive...Appetizer was good had the roasted artichoke ( bout the only thing they know how to make ).  Then the dreaded  so-called food came.  Waiter forgot her bread that comes with it, and no gravy poured on the tri-tip.  Mine looked like it came from a cow patty field in Jasper Oklahoma!!!  I really didn't want to even eat it.  I think a two year old could have done a better job at making it rather than them.  What makes me wonder is how this place stays in business!  No disrespect to other people but, I think they don't know what \"GOOD FOOD IS\".  If I was the health department I would shut this place down in a heartbeat for awful tasting wanna be food.    Overall rating:  - F -F -F -F -F   five minus F's!!!!!!   ( i wish they had a food sucks rating )  To sum it up...We will NEVER step foot in there ever again!!!!     (   THANK GOD!!!!  )"}
{"text":"Has this place changed? We have dined in this restaurant several times a while back and had good meals and even wrote excellent reviews about our experience. But this time we ordered takeout. Takeout service was fast. The takeout packaging was good. We went there to get the tenderloin tips with mashed potatoes but its not on the menu anymore. So I ordered rotisserie chicken ($17.99) which was very bland. I had much better rotisserie chicken from supermarket! The mashed potatoes were thick like concrete and flavorless, the gravy was very strong and unique tasting, vegetables were different too. I didn't even like the potato cheddar soup....had huge round pieces of carrots in it eww. Husband had clam chowder soup he said was okay. He had the meatloaf ($15.99) which was the weirdest meatloaf I've ever seen and he said it was terrible. The chocolate cake ($11.99, not a typo!) was huge and packaged in a nice box but hubby said it was terrible. Total was $52.25 (LOL!)....we got ripped off."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to describe this place other than \"fine\". The food, the service, the ambiance. There wasn't anything special about it. It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't great either."}
{"text":"What a great find! My partner and I were hungry and new in town. I used yelp to find places nearby and this came up. After reading the reviews we gave it a try. Once we arrived, we were told there would be a fifteen minute wait as the kitchen was very busy. This was OK and we sat down to wait. Once we got seated, our waiter (Sam I think) came to get our orders. He was really knowledgeable about the menu and had a friendly smile.

We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and a calzone and meatloaf as the entrees. He brought our drinks and some bread. The bread is a really great cheesy bread that is pretty good size. The calzone was HUGE, and really tasty. My partner said the meatloaf was great. I had ordered mushrooms with the calzone and they forgot them. The manager came over and personally apologized for the mistake and gave us a price break.
That was really a good move. We will surely go back for the great food and good service."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary glass was filled to the top with ice. 2 sips and it was over. Too bad cuz it was good. $8. Didn't get a second one. Cant remember what I had so it must've been average"}
{"text":"Disappointing
Got there early plenty of tables but hostess seats us at a table with blinding sun.  She tried to lower the shade & found there wasn't one so she just gives up & seats us there anyway.  Server blew by the table so fast there was no chance to ask for more bread or anything else.  Citrus chicken salad made with what appeared to be lunchmeat with a total of 1 orange slice.  So not worth the prices for either the service or the food."}
{"text":"This location needs to go to the Henderson location for a refresher course.  I like their Hill Country and Cobb Salads, so whenever I'm in the mood for one, normally I come here.  I've been to this location in the past, and it was ok.  The last time I was here, the iced tea was murky.  However, this time was much worse.  I order the Cobb Salad.  And the chicken, bacon, eggs, and blue cheese were fine, but the lettuce was completely frozen.  It was transparent and was freezing.  I don't know who prepared it, but it had to be their first day.  Any trained restaurant person knows what frozen lettuce looks and feels like.  Not to mention, the menu needed to be cleaned.  it was very sticky.  Wasn't a fan of the limited beer selection.  The bartender was nice.  Luckily, they did not charge me for the salad, just the beer.  Based on this experience, it will be awhile before I return to Claim Jumper.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas.  I know it's a chain, but the quality of the food doesn't taste like a chain.  The menu is huge!  Everything I've ever had there is terrific.  Normally I sit at the bar, and the bartenders are friendly and very attentive.  Also, the food is very reasonable.  Disappointed they close so early.  They have a great bar.  I'm sure they could do really nicely with a late night crowd.  It's also great for big groups for the variety and it's a big place."}
{"text":"first time at this location they told me it would be 5-10 minutes for a table at 430pm with over half the place open. Then they proceeded to sit the next two couples that walked right in and each time looked over at me. I left thinking what terrible service and I refused to eat here.

Two weeks later came back, even though I shouldn't have, sat at the bar, got the ore platter and honestly it wasn't very good. The Mac and cheese was good. The Asian bbq wings were also, but the tri tip, rotisserie chicken and shrimp were all just decent. I expected better. Same girl at the front was working as well and she completely pushed the bar again so I don't understand why they don't want people in the dining area. It's what I prefer but regardless, they will have their way as I won't be returning."}
{"text":"If they say a picture is worth a thousand words, then these pictures should speak volumes.  I haven't been to a Claim Jumper in a couple of years.  I don't know why I stopped.  Maybe because I thought the food was just okay.  

Upon my husband's insistence, we took my mother in law for dinner here since she has never been to one.  She absolutely loves The Cheesecake Factory so this was new to her. 

Our server was really attentive.  The bread was good and the water was plentiful but pretty much ended at that unless you count the cake we took home which was okay.  

I don't mind paying good $$$ for a good meal.  I work in the food industry. I have shelled out some decent money at The French Laundry.   But at least have some decency to have some ounce of truth in your advertising.  Or at least attempt to make the dishes you advertise look as advertised.  The salmon oscar was $29.99.  I asked for it to be medium rare and what came out was a 4-5 oz fish portion with a smattering of crab.  What a sad dish.  

I have become more vocal of not accepting half the dish I ordered since I am certainly paying full price for it.  So I told the server my disappointment.  She sent the manager and he came over to ask if I would like anything else.  Mind you my companions are halfway through their meals already.  So I ordered the shrimp fresca.  I should have known from the previous event that it will absolutely NOT look like the picture but I took a chance.  Disappointment once again seized the chance to show me he was king!  

You would think that the server would realize that I was disappointed in my dish since I refused to take the rest of it home.   But I guess we no longer train our service employees to read disappointment in the faces of our guests.  

It will probably be another couple of years before I would ever go back to a Claim Jumper.  Probably NEVER.  I should have been more insistent on The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Decent Chain food... nuf said."}
{"text":"Love to eat at Claim Jumper as a general rule, but this location is the best in Las Vegas.  Love the atmosphere at Town Square.  After you gorge on their huge portions, you can walk it off shopping and browsing the shops at Town Square.

Claim Jumper is open daily for lunch and dinner, and offers a selection of freshly prepared items. My favorites are: rotisserie chicken, baby back pork ribs, pot pie, chicken fried steak and fried calamari.   Claim Jumper's baked goods and desserts are divine!  Got to try the Six-Layer Chocolate Motherlode Cake, I Declair,  and the Mud Pie. Their claim to fame is the huge portions.  Thankfully, they now offer smaller portions for those of us who are watching our waistlines.

When we go to Vegas, this is on our list of \"to eat at\" places!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere Good food Great service! a little noisy but for the most part okay. my shrimp I had today was a little crunchy'er than normal but it worked. happy hour is the best, come for happy hour it is the best value."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Claim Jumper before and everytime we drove past this place we said we needed to try it some time. Well, yesterday was the day. I don't know why we waited so long. Everything about the place exceeded our expectations. The service and the food were outstanding. I wish I could remember our server's name but he was one of the best anywhere. The fried calamari was the best I have ever had. Large pieces, served hot right from the fryer, cooked perfectly and tender. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner with the hubby tonight!! We enjoyed there amazing appetizer platter and the Baja chicken!! There was so much food we came home with left overs for the kids!!! The ambience was quiet and enjoyable. Great service too which is always a plus! Join there club and get a $25 gift card once a year!!!"}
{"text":"The worst experience here. Got a hot source spilled all over a friend. On his face, arm, shirt, pants and all over his new shoes. It was all over the booth and floor. The waiter was told and said we are very busy, here is your check. Got home later to see it a lot worst and sent a picture to the their office and GM. My name is Dennis and he called me a PRINCESS. I was also told to take a shower and wash the cloth. He told me to get over it. Claim Jumpers has not got back to me but was this bashing or hate issue. Was this the correct way for a GM to treat one. The worst was when he called me a PRINCESS AND TO SHOWER? Unhappy and what is my next step. Help Thanks"}
{"text":"I love that a higher priced place can be eaten at on a very tight budget! 
Great food! Great service!"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday, with a friend of mine. Service was ok, the server just checked on us a minimal amount. Ordered beef tips, and was very pleased with my choice, but needed a to-go box. Packed up my leftovers, left the packed box of food on the table, and headed to the ladies room and my friend came with me, came out and our table was cleaned off, including my to-go box. Found my waiter who had apologized and offered to make a new smaller portion. Did not have time to wait, so declined. Just irritated that they couldn't wait a few moments to be sure the guests had left before they pitched my stuff. I did appreciate the quick way to resolve the issue though."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were at the Town Square Mall for an annual Cadillac show and our plan was to find a good place to eat once we got hungry.  We usually would eat at I Love Burgers but decided to try Claim Jumper as we had never been.  There were a couple of hostesses at the desk that told us there was a 10 minute wait.  While it was a Sunday afternoon we were not surprised with the wait---until we got seated and saw more empty tables than full ones...?   So we figured they must've been short staffed.  One girl took our drink orders.  About 5 minutes later, a different girl came to take our drink orders too!   Thanked her but told her we already ordered our drinks  The strawberry lemonade was very good.  It seemed like we waited forever for someone to take our orders.    There was one nice waitress who was running around like a chicken without a head! It was good that we weren't in a real hurry because there was no feeling we were any kind of a priority to anyone.. A loaf of warm bread was brought out with a huge knife stuck in it and no butter to be found...  My husband's burger was ok, and my roast turkey sandwich with side order of melon-- was supposed to be \"mixed fruit\"--but only  had honeydew melon and cantaloupe with 1 red grape.  No strawberries, apples, or anything else and pretty dry as was the bread on my sandwich.   We kind of lost our interest in dessert after this mediocre dining experience and just asked for the check.  When we left nobody thanked us for coming or wished us a nice day.   We should've stuck to tradition and went to the burger place. No rush to go back there for sure."}
{"text":"I got the Giant Stuffed Baker. 

It was pretty good, but nothing special. The potato was overcooked and the chicken was dry.

That said, the three-cheese potato cakes were incredible. This appetizer/side was one of the best items on their menu and won't leave you disappointed.

Don't pass up the rotisserie chicken, either. It's succulent and flavorful."}
{"text":"Went there on 10/25/14 and great service. There cheese bread was very tasty. I had the BBQ chicken salad. Very good. The right size. My friend had the chicken pot pie and only said good things about it. The fried zucchini was delicious."}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict (I always sub avocado for the ham) is my favorite all nighter/hangover meal. Healthy? Hell no. Greasy? Yes. Claim Jumper is like Perkins, just more expensive. No surprises here and the chicken pot pie is equally fattening and great comfort food."}
{"text":"While house sitting in Avondale, I decided to hit Yelp for a recommendation on a good dinner spot for my best friend and I and we ended up at Claim Jumper.  (What kind of a name is Claim Jumper anyway?) I had never heard of it but I guess she had been to the one in Chicago and loved it.  

We went for a late dinner on a Saturday night and had absolutely no problem getting a table.  Great service and nice atmosphere made for a great evening!  We started with the artichoke appetizer which I absolutely loved and found very different.  The artichoke was grilled and sliced and served with a delicious tomato topping.  For dinner I had the seared scallop salad and Ashley M. had the slider trio.  At the end of the meal we were both satisfied as we drooled over the desert menu but decided we were simply too stuffed.  Based on the review of Kym S., we may have missed out on glory but that just means I will have to return!

Next to the hostess stand there is a big barrel of apples.  Is it stealing if I took an apple on my way out?  woops..."}
{"text":"Within the past year sometime Claim Jumper has changed their menu up... and not for the better in my opinion. It seemed like a lot of their dinner items were gone and the prices seemed to be a little more expensive. I was really craving their chopped bleu cheese salad and now it's gone! When I asked if they had anything comparable to it our waitress abruptly said, \"No\". Uhh okay, sorry for asking. Also, their little drink menu in the bar is gone! That was a little disappointing, but despite it all the food I ordered was good. I'd come back if I was down this way, but it wouldn't be on the top of my places to go...anymore."}
{"text":"THANKSGIVING DINNER REVIEW 2017 - This was the 5th year in a row we ordered Thanksgiving Dinner from this Claim Jumper.  Each and every year, we and our guests have commented how close to home cooking the meals were, that was up until this year...  We ordered the hot turkey meal for 6-8 guests.  When the box was brought home with the food, as I started opening everything, I gave each item a quick taste to discover that not one food item had been seasoned, no salt and no pepper at the very least.  Everything was bland like hospital food.  The stuffing was over cooked and crunchy all over the outside to the point of not being edible. The gravy was a yellowish color, nothing I have ever seen before color wise and tasted like chicken broth with some flour mixed in there was no way I'd serve this to anyone, it was awful!  Thank goodness I had some turkey gravy I bought as extra from the store, we always need more gravy at Thanksgiving.  Little did I know, this would be the ONLY gravy we'd have to serve.  I came to realize that we were missing almost half of the food we ordered.  We had one tiny container (about 5 oz) of cranberry relish and 3 rolls - for 6- 8 people???  Clearly they forgot to give us half of our order, we were short on turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes too.  I then discovered that there was no sweet potatoes which comes with the order, well it was supposed to.  Called the restaurant, asked for a Manager.  We were informed that the sweet potatoes were \"not good\" so they did not include them with any of the orders and that we should have been told that at the time the dinner was picked up.  Are you kidding me???!!!  So you pay over $100.00 for a meal and then they just opt not to put something in and NOT tell you about it AND not give you anything to compensate for missing part of your order?  The manager did apologize for ALL OF the errors and agreed it sounded as though we were shorted on our food order and then said they would have a new order ready for us of course, minus any sweet potatoes.  We were offered a pie or salad to make up for the inconvenience of having to drive back another 15 miles round trip to get our food AGAIN!  We already had homemade pies so that was a big NO and we don't eat salad on Thanksgiving, if we did, we would have paid more and ordered the meal that came with the pie and salad but we thought for an extra $35.00 it was not worth it to pay that much for salad and pie.  Little did we know, we were getting ripped off with what we did pay for and NOT GET.  Super disappointed Claim Jumper and no thanks to you, our holiday meal was not worth the price and a complete BUST!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible and they brought out our soups cold.  Our appetizers came 2 minutes before we got our main dish.  I asked the waitress who brought us our food for ketchup.... We never got ketchup."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this establishment many times but this my first time reviewing it on Yelp. 

CJ has an extensive menu. Steaks, burgers, seafood, etc. I got a cheeseburger but I must say I have had better. It's a pretty big patty but taste wise, ehhh. I think my burger was like $9.50. My daughter had the junior jumper Fish and Chips. Her meal was actually more expensive then my burger. My wife had the clam chowder. She hasn't liked it in the past but did like it this go around. 

All in all, I think the food is average. Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp fresca pasta here, and it is consistently good. The service, however, is often lackluster. On a visit in October, our waiter failed to reappear and our drinks were often left empty. In November, our friend's salad was forgotten and our check was brought before we were given the option to order dessert. Our drinks were often empty on this visit as well, and the pumpkin cheesecake was lacking in flavor. I think it is a good choice for a meal, but don't expect the service to blow you out of the water. I ordered the sliders once and they were extremely dry and the fries were overcooked."}
{"text":"Awful!! Party of six and never even was acknowledged. Wow!  This place is for sure a place to avoid. I can't comment on the food because we never had a chance to order. We stood in the bar area for 10 minutes and had to initiate contact with the bar tender before even being welcomed. At this point, we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Not sure exactly, but it seems to lack quality or pride and that's been reflected in the food.. We just weren't impressed."}
{"text":"Two words for you \"Happy Hour\"...now while i don't drink...there are great deals for food and drink during happy hour. This location is right across the street from the American Express building that i work in. Alot of people go there from lunch from the building because it is in walking distance in a nice strip mall with a huge AMC  Theatre. Great locale for dinner and a movie. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!"}
{"text":"They have an amazing Porterhouse here, great cut of meat and prepared just right. I think they fully understand the idea of med-well done. I don't like my steak still having a heart beat and they got it right. This is a really classy restaurant and their sides were delicious. Stuffed baked potato....yummy!"}
{"text":"A chain that I must admit is pretty dog gone good.  I like the BBQ turkey burger with the salt and pepper matchstick fries (nothing better than crispy thin fries that are super crunchy!).  The dessert is also ridiculously good and even better when you get a free slice of cake at your b-day lunch!  Due to all the fattening things on the menu that I love so dearly, Claim Jumper gets four stars."}
{"text":"AYE YAH!

I wanted to try this place because I had heard so much about it.  It's like the Cheesecake Factory, but the portions are bigger.  So gross.

I knew I wouldn't come back so I ordered the chocolate motherload cake for the \"full Claim Jumper experience\".  The slice is enough for a family of ten.  I can't judge the taste because I was so put off by the sheer size of it.  

If you're obese, you'll love it here.  HUGE GINORMOUS portions, big booths, friendly staff...Bring your moto-scooter that you just used at the Red Rock to navigate the lunch buffet.  I'm sure CJ staff already knows how to accommodate."}
{"text":"We have been staying at the GN Rush Tower Suite for the week as a \"Staycation\", we have had mediocre experiences at Claim Jumper across the valley but we're on vacation and figured we had a pretty good chance at this one might be good considering the great experiences we've had at ALL the other other restaurants here... Boy were we wrong. The service was good but the food was awful. How do you mess up a Cobb salad?! The veggies didn't taste very fresh and the bacon tastes like it was still sitting in its grease in the salad... My boyfriend ordered chicken fried steak and he said the gravy was disgusting and was scraping it off the the chicken... Needless to say we are done with Claim Jumper as an establishment and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came for all day Sunday happy hour! The prices are amazing! The food hot, fresh, and delicious! Bartender/server was so sweet and helpful! I forever love Claim Jumper!!  PS - pretzel sticks yum"}
{"text":"its been years since I came to a Claim Jumper. I know why. I ask for Medium Well. What I got was well done  instead.. Salad was old (lettuce).  My son ordered the Pasta which tasted like chalk. the bottom line... if you can make it at home don't order it here, stick to the ice-cream."}
{"text":"Lunch was good and thet gave me a lot.  Service was great and Server was wonderful.  I coukd tell they show the games here.  That's awesome that they do thatm. Not sure about dinner but higher chance of coming backing here."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. Manager was super nice and waiter was great. They dont have the hige salad bar like in california, but evwrything was awesome. Thanks for a great brunch. Better than a lot of typical vegas buffets. Eggs benedict are my favorite."}
{"text":"Food and service are both just \"ok\". 

Nothing memorable aside from the chocolate motherload cake in the case in the front. I did not order it, it just looked obnoxious. 

My favorite item on the menu is their red velvet cupcake."}
{"text":"0 Stars - TERRIBLE FOOD! I don't know what is wrong at this Claim Jumper. It used to be OK, but now it was just BAD.  We had the Spinach Artichoke dish ($11.99 which we had before and it was good), but now it just tasted really bad and weird.  I'm not sure if it was the sauce or what -- but it was not edible. I tried their Potato Skins ($10.99) which was just 1 whole Potato and 1/2 each half was cut into 4 small pieces and put around a large dip saucer in the middle (see pic) so that it would look like more.  It was so boring and bland (no taste except for some bacon bits), that it had to be drowned in the sauce / dip (now I knew why the saucer was so big) to have any flavor!  
RESULTS: A really bad tummy ache and upset stomach that didn't digest the food!  
WARNING:  Don't go here! Don't eat here! Something is wrong in the kitchen - and your tummy will pay the price, aside from you over- spending on disgusting and terrible tasting food!"}
{"text":"1.5 hours for Atlantic Salmon and an appetizer. ...the kitchen service is awful in every location I've been to...that includes Reno and Fremont. I am at the Tempe location for Spring Training...will be my one and only visit to this location or any other location for that matter."}
{"text":"Came in recently with some friends at like 3am after gambling & we were starving. Their \"late night \" menu was pretty big actually.  Tami was our server and she suggested the tri tip dip with au jus sauce and fries. Delicious! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I came in for Happy Hour drink. It was pricey but I didn't inquire about the price before ordering. 2 days later realized my credit card was missing. Called and they had it. The manager locked it in his office and asked to see my ID before he gave it to me. I stayed and had dinner. Same bartender was there, she recognized me and said when I left she immediately gave it to her manager. I appreciate the honesty."}
{"text":"We were kid Free last night an decided to have a little date night. I figure if I spend more then $50 she will....well you know. LOL 

We decided on dinner and a movie. Dinner was here at the Claim Jumper. This place has been here since the complex was built but still looks new inside and out. 

The staff was friendly and helpful. 

The food was large and delicious. We each had a burger. Mine was a little over cooked as I asked for Med rare but it was still juicy so I was okay with that. They cook a nice hunk of 1/2 Lb beef grilled not flat fried and add a ton of toppings if you wish. I had the bbq sauce cheese let tom 1000 island and Angie had the onion rings avocado cheese let and tom. They were darn good. 

We each had a salad for the side. The Blue cheese and 1000 are both homemade and were really good. Angie had the Ranch but seemed to like the blue better. 

The bar has a decent happy hour menu, might check it out. 

PS we saw Get him to the Greek and thought it was funny but neither of us pee'd ourselves. LOL"}
{"text":"They make a great burger, pot pie and omelette! I actually like everything I've tried here. Fun fact I discovered, the desserts are hand made on property and are the perfect way to end...or heck take place of your meal. What a treat. :)"}
{"text":"We purchased onion rings and flat bread for appetizers. For the entrees, we got a traditional calzone and the fish and chips dish. The portions are huge and all the meals were delicious. Great prices and service."}
{"text":"another great standby - large menu, HUGE portions, typically not crazy crowded.  more of a family feel.  they give kids the cutests pre-meal plate, with a few different snacks on it."}
{"text":"First off.. Helen at the front of the house is MY FAVORITE!! She remembered me from prior trips & is a delight!! 

When were too tired to grab something else this is a great option. My husband LOVES their country fried steak. I love their blue cheese salad dressing and potato cakes.

It's not 5 star dining but the service has been great & the food good.  If you want basic American food and don't want to wait... Go here!! (And be kind to Helen. She's the BEST!!)"}
{"text":"Great food specially for us locals that likes rice!  Very friendly atmosphere and we played Keno while eating our meal!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend.  Had a delicious bloody mary and we shared the BBQ Chicken pizza.  Very good.  Service was great.  Sat in the bar area.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have to commend any restaurant that honors military and vets (around) Veterans Day. Claim Jumpers is one of several that do. Aside from doing this kind deed, my server was a funny and friendly guy, and I did enjoy the blackened chicken pasta, served with a tiny little American flag to show their patriotism. Kudos Claim Jumpers."}
{"text":"I waited too long for my meal. That's the only thing that is not good enough. As for other things, I did not have a chance to experience 'cause I had to leave for my movie"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is great if you know what to get.  Try this order out for size:

Salad
Garlic cheese toast
Ribeye with baked potato
M M M..."}
{"text":"I've gone to Claim Jumper since I was in HS in Cypress, CA & the original. Very disappointed with my visit tonight. The baked potato was dry, no butter or sour cream brought with the plate, service was extremely slow. We waited over 40 minutes for the meal. Probably won't be back. Very sad because I had good memories here."}
{"text":"I always love Claim Jumper as a great place for comfort food.  However, I typically go with my standby meal of the Hill Country Salad with buffalo chicken."}
{"text":"Nothing special really. You get a kick out of their monstrous deserts upon entry. That motherlode cake is a diabetes attack on a pedestal.

The clam chowder was good. Full of clam meat and not too salty. The chicken quesadilla was good and the portion was large enough to feed two people.

The pumpkin cheese pie was DELISH. Fed three of us in our party.

Nothing really knocked my socks off. The food and service was good but it didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"1  star, 1/2 for friendly but forgettable service, and 1/2 for the skinny fries. Unfortunately the rest was not so good.  The meal, cheeseburger, fries and a diet coke.  Can it be any simpler? This was a late lunch for me, there was Hardly anyone in the place, the cook had plenty of time to get it right.  The fries were tasty and crispy and just the right a out of salt.  At first look, the burger looked like something you get off of a value meal at a fast food joint.  There 2 tiny slices of tomatoes, and I mean pickle slice size tiny,  1 leaf of lettuce that looked limp and paper thin. The beef patty was black in color, with the texture of a charcoal.  Being a late lunch I was so hungry, I wasn't about to send food back, which you never how it would come back. I crunched my way through the burger, paid my 16.00 dollars for a burger I'm sure would have been better right across the street at Carl's Jr., and left not hungry anymore, but not satisfied for sure."}
{"text":"We have been to a few other claim jumpers in other cities, this one is by far one of the best in terms of service, fresh food and service. It is a great place to eat on Fremont street."}
{"text":"went for the early bird special and it made  both me and my husband sick. Actually vomited and had diarrhea,called and spoke with the mgr. Craig  acted like it was no big deal  said he would pass it on to his general mgr. and he would contact us but no one did. We went there with a gift card and before that we don't usually go to chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was not great. I had a French dip and the meat was very tough. Burger was not good and service was mediocre."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the Claim Jumper chain, but it can often be hit or miss when it comes to service and/or food quality. Well we were in the area tonight and decided to stop in for a bite to eat, and wow were we blown away!!! Our server Kelsey was on point, from the moment we sat down to the moment we walked out the door...she anticipated our every need and served us with the warmest demeanor. Her menu knowledge was superb and you could tell she genuinely enjoys her job. They are lucky to have her on staff and should consider moving her to management if it's not already in the works. 

Now onto the food. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs but that didn't stop us from clearing every single plate. The soup, ribs, coconut shrimp, potato cakes, mini butter cake, everything was TO DIE FOR! We are leaving so fat and happy that I felt compelled to write this review from the passenger seat on the way home. Keep up the great work, we will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"How I wish I could give this place a 5 star review for their happy hour!  More on that later!

Our grade level team decided to venture to CJ for our holiday happy hour. (Prices are from $2.00-$7.00) Super glad we did!  Their Happy Hour menu is phenomenal!  Choices ranging from the typical happy hour fare of wings and things...but Irish Nachos?  Yes...shoestring fries topped with cheese and bacon! Mouthwatering and finger-licking good! Their calamari is superb!  It is not your typical tentacle and ring type cuts, this is cut from the true meat of the calamari (steak similar to the calamari steak sandwich at Hula's!)  

Now...(Please stay seated until the entirety of this review is read because I have a feeling some of you may run to CJ after this)  Fried.  Mac. And.  Cheese.  Yes. I said Fried.  Mac.  And.  Cheese.  It's like a wedge of mac and cheese dipped into this super crispy crust like wrapping and deep fried served with this tangy spicy sauce thing.  I refuse to learn the nutritional facts of this decadence in a wedge, because I probably wouldn't ever eat it again...but it's DELICIOUS!  I also had the shrimp ceviche and they give you WAY more chips than you need...and not enough of the shrimp ceviche.  It's very tasty and very meaty...they don't skimp on that, but the portion could have been a bit more as I was craving it still. 

As for the drinks...great prices on beer and cocktails...again ranging from $3-$6

Now for the reason I won't give 5 stars...they don't have seating inside the bar for a party greater than 4.  We had to sit at 2 separate tables which ended up being okay.  

Here it is.  Our server.  She complained to the hostess that she wasn't even supposed to be our server right off the bat...and in front of us.  THEN...we are a funny bunch, I mean we are in a room with 20-30 9 and 10 yr olds all day so get us around adults and we let loose.  However, she wasn't amused...at all.  She wouldn't crack a smile.  She just stood there impatiently trying to force us to order.  Don't get me wrong, we weren't being rude to her, we were just being funny and it wasn't anything abnormal or inappropriate.  She just wasn't having it.  When we mentioned we needed separate checks, of course she mumbled and we could tell she wasn't happy.  We asked nicely.  

Anywhooo...the food is great, the prices are perfect for Happy Hour...but next time, I hope our server is as goofy and as fun as we are...or at least is tolerant of us!  ;-)"}
{"text":"When it's 4 AM, you've had a long night and you're starving it's nice to find a gem like this in downtown. Portions are huge and food is delicious. We met the nicest most sincere server the other night, Tammy... it's nice to be waited on by someone who actually CARES if you are enjoying your food, And having a good experience. The selection of restaurants inside the Golden Nugget is great as well. From sushi, Italian, the buffet, fine dining steakhouse, and Asian cuisine! We plan on coming back."}
{"text":"We came into the claim jumper tonight and our server was the grumpiest guy ever. His name was frank and it was one of the worst server experiences I've ever had. I work in a restaurant and I would NEVER want him to work in my place. It honestly ruined our claim jumper experience, sadly enough. We were all super excited to eat here and it was ruined, thanks frank :("}
{"text":"Service was horrific.... Wait staff was acting like they are walking through a field of quick sand.... Took almost 15 min once we were seated to get a waiter... The room itself was like sitting in a fish bowl.... Almost like they opened a room and as an afterthought said let's put a marginal restaurant here where the food is overdone and the wait staff suffers from narcolepsy.... With all the great food choices in Vegas.....I would highly recommend you save your dollars and pass on this one...."}
{"text":"Service was the real issue.... Our server had stated he forgot us after a 45 min wait... Orders were incorrect .... Experience was poor... Will probably not visit again... Need an upgrade on their menu"}
{"text":"So sad. Our cocktail hour at claim jumper is ending. My gfs and I made weekly trips to this location for drinks and dinners. You HAD the best bar side staff. They are now all gone and your fabulous menu has changed. My final visit to cj I was sat next to piles of dirty dishes. My waitress was absolutely wonderful minus the fact that she was bar tending and bussing tables. Surprising a product can go from wonderful to not tolerable so quickly. My parents are also huge fans of claim jumper. Sheree and rand, they have been coming since you first opened. Unfortunately my mom was with me on our last trip. Good luck and I hope my review is seen by someone that can make some changes. Jessica"}
{"text":"Beware when you visit any Claim Jumper - the drinks are an absolute rip-off!! I ordered a drink & not only was the glass small, but it was only half-full! And for $9.00 a pop - not worth it. We brought it to the bartender's attention (a young guy, didn't get his name) & he got all defensive & said \"I measured it like I'm supposed to\". We then spoke to the mgr. Sara, who was very condescending & absolutely no help at all.  Yes, their portions are large, but full of fat, calories, sugar, etc.! All of the employees have an attitude, even after we've gone there several times - we are not treated like \"regulars\". Poor management - terrible experience - last time......."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing salad! I have a habit of sticking to my familiars but today I tried something different. BBQ CHICKEN SALAD!!!!!   AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was here last night for a launch event. We had appetizers (spinach dip, quesadillas, nachos and flatbread pizza). All were yummy. Most of the apps were slathered with cheese so if you're into that kind of food, Claim Jumper is your place to be. I enjoy such indulgences once in a while. 

I've been here once before with friends for dessert. Their English Toffee Cake (with vanilla ice cream) has to be hands down the best cake I have ever had. I'm not exaggerating. I've had lots of cakes. 

The service here is also impeccable. Wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. They also have a vegetarian menu. 

All in all, this is not a place I would frequent as I am partial to local establishments that serve slightly healthy fare but having said that, these guys do have tasty food and a great cake."}
{"text":"In the area for work and craving some comfort food. Just my luck there is a Claim Jumper down the street from my hotel.
On a monday night, I decide to sit in the bar area so that I can watch the tv, mostly because I am dining alone.
Service was on point and was friendly. gave me the tip to try the happy hour mozzarella sticks, and I was not let down. So tasty and crispy. Only thing to improve would be to have more dipping sauce.
For my main meal I opted for the country fried steak. I know that this is going to be big but I don't care.  As per usual for any claim jumper it did come out filling half the plate. tasty and easy to cut and eat as it should be. Though once again, it would have been better to have more gravy to go along with it. didn't they used to put gravy under and over top of it back in the day???

Overall, I had a very pleasant evening, and will likely return should I be in the area."}
{"text":"If I could give this Claim Jumper's negative stars, I definitely would. 

Since, my family and I had never been to a Claim Jumper's we decided to give it a try. The food looked and sounded amazing.  However, our experience was something out of a movie. 

We ordered the following;
-Chicken Fried Steak
-Porterhouse Steak

We happen to be seated in a booth across from longer booth (which accommodates roughly a party of six to eight people).  My family and I were watching their food being delivered.  Not surprisingly, I saw a plate of Chicken Fried Steak being served to that party.  The plate of Chicken Fried Steak was passed down through that entire party of eight. However, no one in that party ordered Chicken Fried Steak. My family and I decided to watch the particular plate and see where it ends up.  Since one of our orders was Chicken Fried Steak.  The server at that table brought the plate back to the kitchen, where the manager asks the chef to re-plate the Chicken Fried Steak.  

You know where this is going...

Our server put the 're-plated' Chicken Fried Steak on the serving tray along with our Porterhouse Steak. Before the server was able to take the plate off the tray, we asked him not to since we saw everything in the kitchen take place.  

The manager, Fred, came over to talk to us and about the situation. He offered to re-make the dish, but at this point we didn't trust him, since he asked the chef to re-plate the Chicken Fried Steak. We decided to just share the Porterhouse. 

The server was brave enough to come back and apologize for what happen.  He said, if he had known about the 're-plate' he wouldn't have brought it out. 

The manager, Fred, came back over and said he reported the incident to the regional office (on a early Sunday evening).  Which, doesn't really do anything for the customer. Needless to say, Fred asked what he could do for us, 'Do you want a piece of cake?' We then responded with 'We want our checked cleared.' 

He finally came back a for the last time and cleared our check.  

The worse service I have ever experienced and we are all in the service industry."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice but forgot to bring my toast. They had the game playing but you had to be in the bar to see it. I normally like when your food comes in order not all at once. It wasn't as busy so I was hoping she would pay more attention. At least she let us still order brunch. Btw they have a military discount."}
{"text":"It's been 3 years since that rib night I had at claim jumper and I still have not gone back. Maybe I'm due for another go if they even still offer the ribs."}
{"text":"Went Way downhill in last few yrs I guess.  Crappy server...mediocre food and beverages for too much money.   Too bad...we need more decent restaurants on the west side"}
{"text":"Ordered the window Maker Burger (As a wrap) it was colo. Sent it back, 2nd one was only a little bit better, but they forgot the onion rings.  Complained and was comped!"}
{"text":"My experience here today I rate as 5 star. Friendly and accommodating server. Calamari served hot, tender, and lightly dusted with breading. Iced tea refreshing. Fish and shrimp platter ginormous and perfectly prepared. They have a huge menu with an array of selections. I recommend Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the Claim Jumper of Old has died! To pay over $30 for a triple sampler meal used to mean left overs for later! Not now, not even close. As the manager stated, we do everything by measurement and weight. That doesn't really bring in what they used to measure. You always seemed to walk away stuffed and with a bag in hand.  That's what first impressed me 15 years ago.  What a let down and they've gone way down the list now in the food chain. Sorry Claim Jumper, you need to rethink what made you popular! Of course it was good and the service was adequate."}
{"text":"Great service and always great food and atmosphere! We just finished our Thanksgiving dinner here and the food was wonderful (EXCEPT FOR THE TRI-TIP), don't do \"The Feast\", meat is chewy.  Turkey is awesome, ham is awesome, clam chowder is awesome ... great day to eat and sleep! Enjoy yours as we did ours! Plus Desert, but we're taking that home! Too much food! Whew!"}
{"text":"$3 blue moon on happy hour, Jamaican jerk chicken on top of a sweet potato and a huge corn bread muffin? Score!!!! I was here for my niece's graduation dinner and it was busy as all get out. We even had a reservation and still had to wait as it seemed like everyone wanted to come here after graduation. It took a minute to get drinks or even a server, but once we got that squared away, everything else was pretty decent.  If I am in the area, I may stop in for a happy hour but the chances of me driving all away to Avondale are to visit this place are slim."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have had in a long time.
Our server Renee.. even while the place was empty couldn't get anything to our table right.  My wife's drink was wrong her mother's Coffee absolutely never came. My beer was brought over 15 minutes after I ordered it. My wife's mothers soup order was never sent to the kitchen when it did come .. Hella salty..  It was the wrong size brought to the table. Then brought over a velvet cake withe the frosting on the bottom side.. Smh...
Safe to say I won't be going there again.. 
Thanks but.. No thanks claim jumpers"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice. The potato soup was yummy. Decent service. After that everything else stinks. Over priced bland food."}
{"text":"We've come to this claim jumper quite a few times now with amazing experiences each time. We've sat in the bar section each time and have had the same server. Told I decided to write a review because I was impressed once again. Our server was Jamie she came over quickly, brought our drinks fast, and our food was out even quicker. Very personable, friendly, happy and overall good energy. We had the bbw burger and the Chinese chicken salad. Appreciated the hard work she did today and the other times we've had her as well. She makes this place worth coming to."}
{"text":"It was a good burger as was my guests lunch.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go. $67

I ordered loaded potato skins- only thing that came out as expected 
2 Bowles of tortilla soup- they put the tortilla strips on the soup instead of on the side and they got all soggy and gross 
One chicken wrap- asked for ranch on the side, the insides of the wrap were tossed in ranch
One plate of chicken tenders- included no dipping.. said it came with bbq
One side baked potato- no nothing , no butter, sour cream .. just plane potato"}
{"text":"This place is located inside the Golden Nugget where the cafe used to be. After remodeling this place is smaller than the cafe. They combined CJ and a bar in this space. Service was good food was good large portions like CJ are known for. I got the black tie chicken pasta it was yummy from the first bite. 
There was a line but it went pretty fast. Will probably eat there again."}
{"text":"JOHN R. was an amazing waiter. Like honestly to came into the restaurant at first we ended up sitting on the wrong side. And the manager Brent was amazing as well and guided us to sit on the correct side. At first I was worried about staying because the first girl wasn't that friendly and seemed to be a little mad and our food took a very long time. I then saw that they are scratch kitchen and took forever because my food was cooked from scratch and everything was hot and fresh. My Dish was the fresh cut carrots and the hot wings. I honestly have nothing bad to say and I hope Brent gets a promotion and John R. Because if it wasn't for the two of them I honestly would have never came back. Thanks guys!!! As a flight attendant I am always traveling and I have many friends that travel and I definitely will be back to visit and I'll be sure to bring more friends with me next time!!! :) I'll be looking for those two, so keep them around!!!!"}
{"text":"Took the family here for a late lunch on Monday.  Got there at about 3:30 and were one of only a handful of people in the restaurant.

David was our waiter and gave us great service, very pleasant and very attentive to our needs, making recommendations from their extensive menu.

We decided on a Widow Maker burger, a Veggie Pizza and a BBQ burger.  All of us were very happy with our food, and really want to compliment David on his superb service.  Unfortunately, they don't have my favorite tea, Raspberry, so I have to take a point off for that. (Haha)

If you've never seen their humungus chocolate cake, you have to stop by if for no other reason.  This was not our first time at Claim Jumper, so my daughter, a real chocolate fan, knew what it was.  To my surprise, she didn't order a piece this time, maybe because it took her nearly a week to finish it last time.  Too funny!

Great place to eat, and the only thing I didn't care for was the music which was more than a bit loud for the number of guests.  It made conversation a little difficult.  But the food gets a 5 out of 5.

Defenately recommend the Claim Jumper"}
{"text":"I was less than impressed with the hostess up front. It was very apparent that she did not like her job. The waiter, \"Fish\" was great. He was attentive and on the ball. Clam chowder was great but the Range Rattlers (jalape√±o pepper stuffed with shrimp and cheese) were truly lack luster. My wife couldn't say enough good things about the sweet potato she ate. My tenderloin pieces were not the usual monster size I'm used to at Claim Jumpers.

Overall, I would have to say I am not impressed with this, Town Square, location. I will continue to go to the Green Valley location."}
{"text":"Our server Edward was absolutely excellent. Good attitude, efficient, and tentative. Our food as always was outstanding. Great service and meal for a party of 7! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Service was great, steaks are not edible, a lot off of fat and sinew, manager looked at it and said well you ate 1/5 so he would not take it off the bill. 4/5 of steak was not edible, waitress apologize and agreed steak was of poor quality. Never eat there again."}
{"text":"Was alright... Could've gone to Marie Calenders for the same food made better.

My husband and I took his parent's (visiting) here.

We had the following entr√©es:
¬∫Chopped Steak - Went a little overboard with the mushrooms, more mushrooms than steak.
¬∫Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes - Meatloaf was over-glazed with \"tomato sauce.\" (Tasted more like sweet ketchup)
¬∫Shrimp Fresca Pasta - was good.
¬∫Porterhouse steak -  was good.

We had the following beverages: Arnold Palmer (great), Strawberry-banana smoothie (delish), and 4 waters. The water was obviously tap water and had a funky smell/taste to it.

Side dish recommendation: Three Cheese Potatocakes (the only \"excellent\" food at our table)


Also, I'm sensitive to MSG in foods... I'm definitely feeling it setting in."}
{"text":"We ordered the lemon pepper zucchini appetizer, chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies, and the BBQ chicken salad. Everything was shared amongst three and was more than enough food. It was all delicious too. The staff was friendly and service was quick. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The \"Grilled Cobb Sandwich\" is to die for and so gooooood! This sandwich is priced at $10.99 and the \"Shoe String Fries\" it comes with are good as well. If you like Cobb Salad and you haven't tried this sandwich you really really should!

Sometimes there can be a wait to get a table but well worth the wait! You can phone your order in for pick up too. The staff is always friendly. They have a rewards program you will for sure want to talk to your server about. It is free and rewards you for how much you spend and you can use it at multiple restaurants! I saw a thing on the table while I was eating mentioning that they offer catering even for breakfast. I hadn't thought of catering anything for the office but donuts so this was nice to find out haha."}
{"text":"We went to Claim Jumper in the middle of the week for their happy hour.  The bar area was nice but had a strange sewer smell.  This happens sometimes, so we weren't going to let this ruin our night.  Our server was OK but it was apparent that she was overwhelmed when the host slammed her section with at least 7 tables.  
The happy hour prices are good but there were a lot of children seated in the bar area.  They should probably open up happy hour to the entire restaurant to avoid this uncomfortable issue."}
{"text":"This is not a high end, 5 star restaurant but I have to give it 5 stars because I want to encourage them to continue doing what they are doing! In fact I really appreciate how affordable it is and the portions seem just right to me. The service was great, Its clean: we never had to wait in line. Everything was tasty and well done. Great place for good variety, and to get away from pricey buffets and fast food options! Give it a try, LMK what you think, hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. New York steak came out wonderful. Great food. I would recommend the New York Steak if you like a lot of meat this is for you."}
{"text":"Very good happy hour!! I will def go back. I am head over heels their onion rings.... Mmmmm. Just thinking of them mmmmmm lol. I love that they have cocktails on their happy hour menu. Maybe because I usually go to PTs so beer is what I get."}
{"text":"We waited at the front door until the hostess could pull herself away from the waiters to seat us. We asked for tropical tea and got regular with no ice. I was served raw chicken with no apologies from management while we watched our waiter drop beer glasses all over the floor next to us. Worst dinner and claim jumper I have ever been to and town square deserves a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Came here by chance since the other restaurants we wanted were packed. LOVE the atmosphere, Eli was THE BEST server we've had in our life! The food was excellent, huge portions, prices great, and served quickly.
We had the tri-tip dip and andouille sausage as our main course...after the free cheesy butter loaf, and finished it all with the absolutely mouth watering pecan butter dessert. 
We were blown away by the service and the food, especially considering that Claim Jumper was a last resort. It's just been bumped up the top of our favorites list."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good!!  We got an appitizer of the grilled artichoke, I would go back just for that!  It was stupendous!!
The tri-tip was good, everyone elses was great, chicken pot pie, chicken wings, chicken fried steak, everyone was happy, happy happy!!  Over all it was a good experience! 
Staff was attentive, place was clean..."}
{"text":"Merry GIFT CARD Christmas!!!  I hadn't been to a Claim Jumper since I last worked there in 2005.  I suppose that after nearly three years of employment there and eating for a wonderfully discounted price, which in fact allowed me to try just about EVERYTHING on the menu, a five year hiatus makes sense......right?!?!?
Given the relatively higher price point of their entire menu, the four of us decided the best way to dine there was for HAPPY HOUR!  Who doesn't LOVE happy hour?!?!?
=)
Here's why I like it:
~App prices range from $2-6 and there is about a 20 item variety.  Even the happy hour portions are LARGE!!!
~Drinks are CHEAP and plentiful!
~Faster service in the saloon area (in my ever so humble opinion).  Plus plenty of seating and televisions for your Monday night viewing pleasure!
~Though not on the happy hour menu and outside of Cheesecake Factory, Claim Jumper has a FABULOUS DESSERT MENU!  I recommend the Red Velvet Cupcake, CHOCOLATE CHIP CALZONE (effing heaven in my mouth), bread pudding, and the mother load chocolate cake with a glass of cold milk, of course!!!

Make a point to give them a shot if you haven't....they pride themselves on service!  They're obviously doing something right........some of the same 'ole faces still working there.  Whats that say?!?!?"}
{"text":"So, it's late and we wanted to eat. This location closes at 10pm and we arrived at 9:30. We did not want to be jerks so we ask if they are ok with seating us as we can go elsewhere if they are closing down the kitchen. They assure us they are good and seat us. We wait 10 min with no server coming by and realize they probably don't want to serve this late. As we get up to leave, a server that has been standing at the front chatting looks at us as says \"I was going to be right over\" we politely excused ourselves. 

It was disappointing. My wife was so excited to go here as she had not been to claim jumper in a long time, 

Please don't seat people if you really don't want to serve them."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am not a fan of Claim Jumper, and I only eat here if someone invites me to. This location is very spacious and they have tons of seating available. The service was always fantastic the few times I have visited. Last time, I ordered a personal pizza (tomato & basil).. the flavor left a lot to be desired. I had asked if they could put mushrooms onto the pizza, which they did. However, these weren't your standard portobello. I actually don't know what it was and I didn't like the flavor so I picked them off. I can never find anything on their menu that I would love to try so I tend to settle for something :p"}
{"text":"We ordered for our property Christmas dinner.  The appetizer's were good, except for the artichoke, it was just a roasted artichoke, lol  I was expecting a dip, but what ever.  The egg rolls, the fried zucchini, and fried cheese was good.   My steak.....I got the Rib eye, I was very disappointed in it, it just came with mashed potatoes, and some cheese bread!   I understand we were talking it to go, and all of it might not have been hot......But just down right cold!   Yea, we were pretty disappointed in the take out.  Not sure If I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Food was good server Matt was nice. But he was slow or busy. I'll always rate my meal on the drink service and having to ask for a refill is a guarantee that your tip isn't gonna be the best! Sorry Matt you fell a little short. The meal would have been **** 4 stars if you would have gotten help or been a bit more attentive.

Won't be back to the bar area anytime soon!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a group lunch with some of my coworkers and was pleasantly surprised with the food and service. 

We were greeted promptly, had fresh bread put on our table within 5 minutes and were able to order and receive our food in a timely manner. 

They have a nice selection of lunch items all for reasonable prices and large portions. I ordered a lunch portion chinese chicken salad and it was huge. Full of sliced chicken breast, wontons, cabbage and lettuce and a great dressing. It tasted fresh and was full of flavor. My coworkers ordered everything from a huge topping filled baked potato to fish tacos and pasta. They all enjoyed their food as well. 

I think Claim Jumper must be under new ownership because this place has improved since the last time I was here. The food tastes better and the service is good."}
{"text":"Over cooked vegetables. Salty food. Weak French fries. Enjoyed green valley location better."}
{"text":"Shrimp cocktail, can you go wrong? They were oddly butterflied or deformed to begin with but I'm still gonna eat em... the cesar dressing on the otherhand? Bleck. Too much anchovies made for fishy fishy dressing bleck. It was open late night though so that was a plus."}
{"text":"They get 2 stars for being able to put salad and pasta together alright (my 9-year old might be able to do better, just sayin).

We ordered delivery through Grub Hub. My husband always seems to get the shaft when we go out of our comfort zone of Thai Food and Pizza delivery-this time was no exception.

His meatloaf looked like a charred Salisbury steak from a Hungry Man frozen dinner. The taste was just as bad. Worst part? They neglected to serve it with the accompanying mashed potatoes and the \"steamed vegetables\" were nothing other than soggy zucchini and onions. Literally. Husband was NOT happy. It's like they delivered food that was rejected from the dining room customers. 

My pasta was edible, after hearing it up, and the side salads were just fine. 

Sad to see big \"reliable\" seeming chain restaurants miss the mark so badly you wonder how they became a chain to begin with. My guess? They won't be doing any great expansions anytime soon unless they pick up their game.

Thanks for crediting us the $5 for the missing mashed potatoes. While we would've preferred our full order, we appreciate the courtesy. Unfortunately there won't be a next time."}
{"text":"The etymology of the phrase Claim Jumper suggests that you shouldn't trust this place - right? I mean would you really want a ride from a guy named Demolition Derby? I get this mental image of two guys sitting at a coffee shop at 4 in the morning, worn and tired from an all-night debate about whether to name their new restaurant Claim to Fame or Puddle Jumper - and then just giving up.

Every time I enter a new restaurant for the first time I half expect to get that sensation of walking into a casino for the first time, fascinated with all that's new and different and shiny, but unfortunately the reality is always dreadfully familiar when you walk into a chain restaurant.

Once again, as you open the menu you're hoping (beyond all hope) for something new, something exciting, something you didn't even know you wanted until just now. Then once again you find yourself disappointed by a menu that you're not even sure you haven't seen before. Sure sometimes they offer something that sounds different, but you've probably seen it at least somewhere else before. 

After a few words from the server you would swear that this time that same-ole dish is going to be something really different, really unique, something revolutionary. A really great server at a chain restaurant has to be very convincing in their sales approach, and some of them are so good at painting a picture of uniqueness that, while you sit waiting for your food to arrive, you start imagining yourself as a regular here, a Norm so-to-speak - you almost want to walk around the room and introduce yourself so they can greet you as you walk through the door from now on.

Eventually, however, your food arrives and all hopes of becoming a local legend are dashed against the rocks of a bland pile of mashed potatoes and limp veggies. Oh sure it's not bad food, it has flavor, it has spice, maybe it even has a presentation that astounds. But when it comes down to it, all chain restaurants are pretty much alike.

Maybe you could even make an argument that some chain restaurants are better than others, but when it comes down to it they just don't compare. So if you find yourself inclined to rate chains against each other rather than \"real\" restaurants, you may think the Claim Jumper to be a rather good place with some rather good food and a decent offering of some non-standard fare...

...that is, if you are so inclined."}
{"text":"This was my second trip here. I waited to review in hopes of a better experience but that didn't happen. Service was excellent as our server was quick to deliverer both food and drinks. I'm just not a fan of the food here. A few of our shrimp appetizer were over done. They put the dark side facing down but it was obvious. The calamari are the long cuts that look like chicken fries and there are not tentacle pieces, just blah on the flavor. We kept it to just appetizers and left, never to return!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Good cocktails, better sandwiches. The Claim Jumper in Deer  Valley  is a slightly more expensive Applebees with more selection and cooler decor. Try sitting in the bar section to watch a game. We really enjoyed the Tri-tip sandwich and Southwest egg rolls."}
{"text":"Chocolate cake is impressively large and sweetly decadent.  Everything is Texas-sized here, but pretty average.  Never felt like I was a \"regular\" here even when I was.  I think they would get more repeat customers if they were a bit more attentive to them.  Location is primo.  Try the calamari and other appetizers.  Happy hour is the most sensible, even if you do not drink."}
{"text":"Craving comfort food? We were and glad we came here as we had limited choices in our hotel. We ordered the Buffalo Wings and the zucchini appetizers. Large portions and very good."}
{"text":"I Love the California pizza here!   The only drawback is that it's another DARK place where you can't read the menu clearly."}
{"text":"California Works Pizza is my favorite! Our server was extremely friendly and attentive! I Love the atmosphere there and of course, the food is always good! The portions are reasonable with their pricing too! Highly recommended and also at this particular location too!"}
{"text":"Four star for being open 24 hours, good food selection & nice service. I went there just once for a midnight snack while my husband was in the casino. Although it was passed 11 when I went there, I understand that some of the items on the menu were not available anymore. But the server worked on it. Although the food took a little bit longer to arrive, it was good."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! Food is delicious and dessert even better. Service is ok and prices ok for the value. 
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you like to eat and can handle large portions then Claim Jumpers is your spot.

The desserts are flavorly and probably large enough to feed three people. My favorite dish here is the Pot Pie. The vegetables mixed with that creamy sauce is like no other. Combine it with that tasty, toasty crust and WOW what a great comfort food.

Service was average at best, but that's ok because the food more then made up for it. If I recall right our drinks never ran flat and we stayed topped off. I have eaten at many Claim Jumpers and this one can hang with the best of them."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had one of the best dinners, we've had in a long time! I was a little worried when I saw some of the reviews for this place, but our experience was wonderful! Elvis was our server and he was fast, personable and right on time with everything! This is the first time I have eaten a steak without A1, but it didnt need it, it was tender juicy and flavorful! My husband's ribs melted off the bone!! I wish I lived in Las Vegas so I could keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Had the spinach salad. Pretty filling. The calamari is the thick cut kind but way too much breading. No flavor! Good service. Party Of eight with 2 kids. Plenty of room."}
{"text":"A really good beef dip. (Tri tip dip). Nice soft yet substantial bun. Good meaty beef without fat and gristle. The au jus is among the best available. (Beep dip is one of my staples). And the cheese was a good compliment - not too sharp, but not bland. 

The chicken fried chicken - really good chicken dish. 

Also, the atmosphere is nice. Consistent mining theme that is well done. The music was a bit loud when we were they, but they mentioned they just got it fixed so might be some startup kinks. 

The negative - the price seems a bit on the high side but the food is good."}
{"text":"Clam Jumper was really delicious. It's a great place to have a birthday! But only if everyone's pockets are a little bit padded. They give you a ginormous pice of cake! So delicious! Also the booth we sat in could have seated 12 people!"}
{"text":"Renee was a great server. She talked to us like if we were there everyday. We ordered a Sirloin Steak with Tortilla soup and a Clubhouse sandwich. Our drinks were a strawberry lemonade which my boyfriend loved and mine was an Arnold Palmer. Most places can't get an Arnold Palmer but Renee got it just right. My sirloin was a perfect medium rare and nothing was left on my boyfriend's plate because it was great too. The only thing I didn't like was while our server was busy another server came by to bring out plates and said she was going to bring me another drink because mine was empty. Half way through my plate still no drink. Renee noticed and rushed it right over."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on Friday May 13th.   I am (was) a member of the Landry's Select Club and was seated immediately.   Our waitress took our drink order and we proceeded to drink four glasses of ice tea and two orders of bread waiting for our dinner order.  The waitress apologized twice saying there were some large parties and the kitchen was backed up.   After one hour and 18 minutes we walked out.  To that point we weren't even served our salad !
I threw a $20 on the table for our ice tea and bread and let them keep my Landry's Select Card.   I definitely do not want to be a member of any club that treats its members like that.   There are WAYYYY too many food choices in Towne Square and in Las Vegas to put up with that.   I do not blame the waitress, but the management who would not have the kitchen properly staffed on a Friday night !"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight and things started off well, walked in and was immediately seated...we were seated in the bar area with my underage daughter in a nearly empty restaurant but it was early so it didn't matter. At first service was good and appetizers and drinks came fast...again it was early. The problem started when my daughter got her cheeseburger that she ordered well-done. 1 bite and she tasted the charcoal of the burnt bun...she tried to eat it but couldn't do it and it was sent back.  The waiter and the manager were apologetic and they said they were going to take care of it right away. Meanwhile my wife and I had our food and it was acceptable. Not anything great but at least it was edible. Nearly 30 mins later, still no burger and we had finished. My daughter wanted to wait as she was hungry. It was her idea to eat there after all....the burger finally came and she inspected the bun and it looked good. She took a bite and bright red blood squirted done both cheeks and she nearly vomited as the thought of raw hamburger make her nauseous. She left the table for the bathroom as she thought she was going to vomit. When the waiter came back to the table, he agreed it was not cooked and took it stating the manager would come to the table, once again, but we never saw him. Soon after the check came sans cheeseburger...I guess we were done??? The manager was no where to be had but I am not sure I would be man enough to be able to face guests either and try to explain how you screw up a cheeseburger, TWICE.  A word to Claim Jumper, its un-safe to serve raw burger to customers (I really don't think they know this)...I guess we should have said, Well done, not burnt, cooked and not raw. Just like other negative reviews here, save yourself the time and aggravation and go somewhere else. We sure wont be back...just like the spineless manager."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast every. You could tell he forgot my food under the heat lamps. Only harder than the pancakes was the toast. Seriously how do you fuck toast up. For dollars for a shot of OJ. Cold eggs. The thing that was most aggrivating was he gave me my check halfway through meal. Really. Don't eat at this place."}
{"text":"I normally hold off on writing reviews for chain places but I met up with some girlfriends for lunch on a Sunday that wanted to hear about my trip and they said let's do lunch at Claim Jumpers, so off I went.

We were seated right away by the manager, who was very friendly & nice and our server for the meal was Vanessa, and let me tell you Vanessa loves her job she was superb job, she is what inspired me to write this review. From the start of the meal to the end of the meal she was present thoughtful and helpful even offered us some tea to go when we left. 

I was in the mood for a salad so I went with bbq chicken salad it was perfectly prepared but it visually it looked amazing, the greens, the red of the tomato so vivid in color, and the best part it tasted great too!

I can honestly say that I haven't been to a Claim Jumpers in a few years and I am happy that I did that Sunday afternoon! Great company, great food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Went for lunch at Claim Jumper, let me tell you, service was fast and friendly, food was quick, I was in and out in 25 mins! WOW, I didn't wait for a table, I just went to the bar area where it was open seating, if you are in a hurry for lunch, try eating the bar! Ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad, which is my fav dish, it's had almonds, sesame seeds, green onions and cilantro and spicy peanut dressing! So dang delish!

Oh yea I tried something new this trip too, dinning solo!! Wasn't so bad, but next time I will bring a book so I won't look so alone LOL  

Great place for a good lunch!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good , he was very attentive and brought us everything we needed but the food was lacking.  I have always been a huge fan of claim jumper and the quality and portions of food and was disappointed after this trip.  

-Quality of the soup was not the same as it used to be.  Portions were smaller and it simply didn't taste like it used to.  Also, they don't have that awesome cheese bread anymore, bummer !

-Chicken fried steak was a much smaller portion than it used to be and it was 1/3 just batter, bleh!  Also little to no gravy on the whole dish, had to ask for a side of it.

-Tri-tip was a little cold and the presentation was awful.  We weren't asked how we wanted it cooked as well.  

Not sure if they need new management or a new cook, or maybe the whole chain is just going down hill.  Disappointed because this used to be my families \"go to \" restaurant for birthdays and special occasions and now I dont think we will be back .  The food is certainly overpriced and going down hill ."}
{"text":"My wife was here with friends three times in the last 12 months, each time getting the same rude waitress as Jay P mentioned in review 25/3/12. This time the service was just as bad and the group finally complained to the manager over the past and present service. They could not believe the waitress was still there. 35 minutes to get drinks, and the waitress was rude and talked back to the group."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after looking around old Las Vegas. The place was clean and it had the atmosphere of a pricey restaurant. After we sat down to order we noticed that the prices were about average. WE ordered a club sandwich and a cheese burger. The club sandwich was very big and came with a side, the cheeseburger was very large also with a side of fries. both meals were well worth the cost. The place was quite and the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"The awkward hostess greets my date I with \"have you been helped? Well what do you need\"  Undaunted I request a table for two. As she leads us to the equally awkward two top near the door we politely ask for a booth. At an off-puttingly slow pace she walks us to a nice booth by the bar. 

I eyeball the ahi tuna and spinach salad, it sounds so good I can almost taste it. My mouth watering, I start to eyeball all of the wait staff because we are approaching the 10 min mark without being acknowledged. As we start to get up to try one of the numerous other restaurants in town square, the bartender says \"I was just coming over!\"  

We'll we were just leaving! She goes back to the conversation she had been having since we walked in the door with what appeared to be a coworker. 

In a town with thousands of restaurants and thousands of people looking for jobs it blows my mind that bad service is still an issue!

*The names have been change to protect the pathetic."}
{"text":"Widow maker burger is good.  bring your appetite, very large portions.  save room for mother load cake, it is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Claim Jumper in CA.  They have been great!  The one in Avondale is just ok, I have been coming back a few times and it still has not changed my mind.  The service has been just so-so.  One time my chicken was served under cooked.  I do not know if I will return.  I still love in Claim Jumper in Deer Valley."}
{"text":"Their lunch menu is not bad.  I had the 1/2 soup and 1/2 sandwich.  The creamy chicken tortilla soup was not bad at all.  For the sandwich, I picked turkey.  The bread was ok and that for me made the whole sandwich ok.  The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Went there today with my hubby for his bday dinner. We dont get out much alone without the toddler. We paid a bbsitter 15$ an hour to celebrate. Anyway, all in all it was a lousy atmosphere, terrible service & average food. Wont go again."}
{"text":"Myself and 2 girlfriends went to Claim Jumper last night for happy hour as the menu looked like a great value. I ordered a raspberry martini which tasted like nothing but syrup. Probably the weakest martini I have ever had. When we ordered our drinks we also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa. After the drinks came we ordered the meal. For our meal we ordered 3 plates of street tacos. 1 with fish, 1 with pork and 1 with half fish/half pork. 

The waitress always seemed in a hurry. She would come to the table and as soon as one person made a request she would try to run off without asking anyone else. She got away a couple times so we had to wait to see her again and flag her down. 

The tacos came out from the kitchen. It was not the waitress who brought them. They simply asked, who has the fish...who has the pork. So our other friend who ordered half/half didn't get a plate yet. And still no chips and salsa that we ordered initially. We have already been here 20-30 minutes. I also ordered the caesar salad which I assume should have come out first with the chips. We did flag down another person from the kitchen and asked about the additional plate of tacos, the chips and salsa, and my salad. He let us know that they put the other plate of tacos on the plates already served. No extra plate or info to this regard. Served in a way that sushi is where they put all the same type of roll on one plate. Did not expect this at Claim Jumper. They finally brought the chips and salsa. And I had 2 people bring me a salad. I obviously turned down the 2nd. Now we're up to 4 people trying to serve our table. Our waitress went MIA many times and it took another 15 minutes for my friend to order another drink. 

The funniest part was the chips and salsa. There is a huge plate of chips and one tiny condiment sized bowl of salsa. No problem, we request more salsa. It's bottomless. So we ask for more salsa and ask for a larger bowl or multiple tiny cups. We finally get a bowl that has the optical illusion of being larger. But it doesn't look like much more salsa. So we test it out. Yes, the amount of salsa in the wide, shallow bowl fills the condiment sized tiny cup perfectly. Sooo...we see another kitchen person and flag them down and ask for a large/full bowl of salsa. So she finally brings that out. 5th person to help our table. Later on we still had chips left and could have used more salsa but it wasn't worth the effort to flag down another staff member.

In the end, the reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is that the food was actually pretty good. The fish tacos were very tasty, the salsa was good and fresh, and I was impressed with the $2 happy hour mini caesar salad that was served on a large plate and bigger than some lunch portion salads at other restaurants. It was the service that was lacking and it wasn't just the one waitress. It was the system they have in place where kitchen help, cooks, and wait staff are all running around a full dining room and you never know who is serving you and your main waitress isn't around much to check on the table."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Came for lunch and ordered salad with added chicken in addition to their pot pie. Everything was very tasty."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive about dining here after I read some of the reviews but I decided to eat there anyway ... I was highly satisfied . The food was delicious. The service was excellent . I even had my 3 kids with me and we all felt really comfortable dining there . I would most definitely eat there again ."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite happy hour spot.

It's pretty centrally located near and still far from The Strip. Easy for friends to come from work all over Vegas valley.
Happy hour menu is varied from $1 salads to $4 sliders to $3 wines. All of $20 is enough to leave your tummy satisfied and/or drown you worries after a long day at work.

I've eaten here for lunch a few times and their portions are pretty big. Their blacken chicken pasta is my favorite there."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel on steroids!!! That's how I would describe this place. I was in town for work and a group of us moseyed across the street to try Claim Jumper upon recommendation from some local colleagues. It did not disappoint. 
Although we had to wait, the wait was well worth it. I ordered the meatloaf, which was OUTSTANDING. The portions at this place are HUGE, which is right up my alley. My meatloaf came with a butter biscuit, and I shared a giant blueberry muffin and the tortilla soup with one of my coworkers. Everything was good. The blueberry muffin was moist and dusted in a brown sugar like substance that was decadent. 
Oh, the potatoes. The mashed potatoes melted in your mouth. The meatloaf was doused in gravy, just the way I like it. I couldn't finish the giant two slices that was included. The grilled zucchini added a nice touch to the dish. 
I can't write this without mentioning the beef ribs. One of my coworkers got them, and it was literally like a plate of food straight out of the Flintstones. They were bigger than my head! Huge bones, all beef ribs. I tried on and they were good. Real good. 
Unfortunately, after gorging ourselves, we didn't have room for the 3 foot tall slice of chocolate cake, but it looked really good. Maybe next time. Definitely recommend Claim Jumper to anyone who loves good down home cooking."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

I have only been here twice, and both times were great... 

Server came up immediately after we were seated asking for our drink order and if we would like any appetizers. I love a quick and attentive server, we then ordered our drinks and said we needed a little more time to decide on appetizers. 

She brought our drinks and we ordered the Southwest egg rolls which were very delicious and filling! My main course was chicken fried steak. 

Wow,the Country Fried Steak is very large and very juicy and delicious mmm and their gravy is heavenly! It also comes with mashed potatoes which are just as good. I could not even finish the whole meal because their portions are VERY generous! 

Even though I was stuffed I still had to order dessert because I always have a sweet tooth after eating dinner. I ordered their Chocolate Mother lode Cake OH WOOOW this thing was huge!!! This was the Mother load of a chocolate paradise and very scrumptious! 

I will definitely be returning to this Claim Jumpers great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Never again!

We went last Saturday and it took the waitress 20 minutes just to come and take our drink order, we were ready to order our food so we ordered that as well. After about 45 minutes from when our order was taken I asked the waitress how long would it be for our food to come she said \"maybe 10 minutes\" so I said \"still?\" Then she asked if we were on a time crunch or something which I responded no but we were hungry and we had been waiting forever. So she said she would go check on it. 

She came back saying it would only be a few more minutes and that she apologized because she was really busy and she did put the order in late. Let me just mentioned the restaurant was NOT busy which I thought was weird being A Saturday but by this time we were already starving and we didn't want to go somewhere else and wait again. Other people that got there after us got their food before us! Anyhow, our food finally came out about 15 minutes later, then the waitress came back and apologized again and said she had checked the time and it was literally an hour for the food to come out from when we ordered and offer if we wanted a cupcake or a cookie, there were kids at out party so we said fine and asked for a box and our check. Well another 30 minutes passed by and the cupcake and cookie, box and check never came so I asked the manager to check on our check and cancel the deserts because even though we were not on a time crunch we did not plan to be there for +3 hours. The manager did not care at all about our experience which shows why the service is so awful.

Our check finally came 15 minutes later and we never got our to go box. 

The food was just average which would not justify such a long wait. We would have been better off going to Yard House."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving Dinner was very disappointing! We watched two \"couples\" sit down, order, eat and leave, in the time we ordered and got our food. We all had the turkey, but yet, they told us, the had to cook more. We waited an extra half hour for our food, our total was over $75, and they gave us a \"sorry card\" for $10 off our NEXT meal. Thanks, that doesn't help our wait and full priced meal!"}
{"text":"Judging from the reviews, I was almost reluctant to come here again after reading some of the comments. I decided to take another chance because I really like this restaurant. I've been here about three times. As far as I know, the food has always been great and fresh during the day. It could be different at night. But I probably only been here once at night and still I had a great experience. Today, my server Dana, blonde, was a great server. We were sitting at the bar area so we can get a happy hour. She was very attentive and smiled. Her energy was just great. It was refreshing to know that Customer Service like that, still existed. Because the Las Vegas that I know, it lacks in that department all together. I look forward to going back there and dining again. I recommend this place and sitting in Dana's section."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars because there BBQ Chicken Salad was really good but the appetizer platter (which was $19) was disgusting! It arrived at our table, COLD! It was supposed to be hot spinach and artichoke dip, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks and potato skins. What we got was cold dip, hard mozzarella sticks, soggy zucchini and petrified potato skins. The manager offered us a free dessert but we didn't want to risk it, since we were already feeling sick. He decided to take $14 off the bill... so we still ended up paying $5 for a partially eaten appetizer which ended up making us all sick! Don't think we'll be back!"}
{"text":"came by for some happy hour and watch the game. this place is perfect . the place is spacious and friendly staff to serve you. at the bar there is a flat screen to watch the game on. when we arrive and greeted and  sat our self at the bar and right a way a server came and introduce himself and got our drinks and food ready . i got the blonde ale . they brew their own beer. i also had a classic beef sliders and spicy wings . both dish was delicious. i really haven't have anything bad from this place. the happy hour price was nice. it ranges from $2-$8. make sure to check this location out!"}
{"text":"I must say my first experience at your establishment was excellent. The server  Blake was on top of everything.Made sure we had everything we needed and continously check up on us.The food is great .The mozzarella cheese sticks and the sauce was awesome .It's the  best I have eaten as  its my favorite appetizers. Will recommended to family and friends.Thanks again Blake for make our experience a great one."}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously just because we were looking for somewhere to sit and dine indoors, it was our 2nd time there. Dan was our server and he is great. Overall experience was just ok, just a few irritating things that I've noticed. The party of 5 was seated aftet us, in the next booth, but they got their meal before us, 2 adults and a child. Also, the GM came by and ask how they were doing and not us. Are we not good enough for the GM to come by and say hi? That really made me feel unwanted in a restaurant that was 1/4 full.
On a good note, every restaurant I dine at, I always ask for a milk shake. If they do have it, I tell them im not allergic to any thing so go ahead and be creative and surprise me. When I got my milkshake, it was delicious. Not sure was it was but I'm guessing it was a strawberry with chocolate chips. 
So overall, the good outweighed the bad. Not really a \"go to\" restaurant when hungry but probably will dine there again."}
{"text":"When it comes to great service, delicious food and in a hurry Claim Jumper has nailed it.  Trevor was our server & host; he was fantastic.  I asked before actually ordering if he could have us in & out within 30min. for lunch and he certainly did.  The food for both my husband and myself was delicious!  I had a stuffed baker and my husband had the chicken potpie; both were very fresh and piping hot!  Also, I always order iced tea when eating out and their tropical tea garnished with an orange was perfect!  It was our 1st time here and we'll definitely be back!  The manager even stopped by to see if everything was up to our liking and of course it was.  So, we mentioned it was 10x more enjoyable because of Trevor!  Good people doing a little extra make a huge difference, especially in the food and service industry."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE FOR THANKSGIVING!!! My family made reservations about 6-8 weeks in advance to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner for 10 of us. When we arrived it was absolute CHAOS! We still had to wait 45 minutes for our table and THEY RAN OUT OF TURKEY DINNERS! The poor servers were trying their hardest not to absolutely loose their minds but the panic was very evident. The manager was literally RUNNING from tables to the kitchen and back. Absolutely nothing was offered to compensate us for running out of turkey. (Note to the chef- make extra next year based on the number of reservations and tons of walkins and if you end up with extra run a turkey sandwich special for a few days after.) It took another 45 minutes to get our drinks and while the food we were able tasted ok it was apparent the entire restaurant was going down in flames. Some of our dishes had vegetables on it & some didn't (same dish ordered) & some of our dishes had mashed potatoes and some didn't (same dish ordered). The absolute worst part was right after we got our drinks they sat a table that was at least 25-30 people in the private dining room next to us. The night was an absolute disaster & I would NEVER recommend going there on a special occasion ever again. Corporate should really train the managers how to maintain their reservations and communicate those numbers with the chef to order enough food. Wouldn't you rather serve 500 happy guests than 1000 pissed off people?! Never again."}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome I had the house salad, ribeye and baked potato. Service was excellent. I felt like I was in a fine dining restaurant, I wasn't expecting that level of service for such a casual place. Tami our waitress said things like, \"Can I offer you a glass of Cabernet with your ribeye? She checked on us often. She also listed every ingredient in butter cake before she offered it to us and of course I said yes lol it was delicious :)"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday, made a reservation, didn't need to for good reason. Ordered, soups and salads were served except our 9 year old, hers took another 5-10 minutes, meals delivered - shock major mistakes on a family members order, this caused a lively debate in front of our table by the three stoogies serving us, reading the ticket, discussion, etc. Restuarant 101 GM of this store --- take the mistake to the kitchen and make it right, don't debate in front of the guests. The GM was there as well, walking around and rearranging some chairs for guests that never came, she never even said hello. Happy Easter !!!!!     Landry's I hope you can take this seriously."}
{"text":"One word.... HUGE!!!   Don't bring a doggie bag....  Bring a doggie cart!  So this is just you typical steak chain food place which probably deserves 2 stars for the food but the mountain sized portions just make me laugh as the go by.   The only slice if chocolate cake I can't finish off !

Seriously,   They don't do it with the same pizazz as Hash House A GoGo but if you are a big steak ester and like a spud the size of a football..,  it just might be the place for you !"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything bad! Service is always great. So far I've had chicken tender platter, chicken Caesar salad, black tie pasta,  chicken pot pie...ALL DELISH!"}
{"text":"Come Hungry! 

Portions Are large, and you get bread on the house to start your meal.

The cocktails are a bit weak so don't expect a buzz, the Ginger, in the Ginger Peach Lemonade bites harder than the vodka. 

The tri-tip and rotisserie chicken are above average, while the mash potatoes lack that wow factor.

BUT WAIT!! The Service is magnificent Fabian is an all star! Friendly and knowledgeable he spiced up a otherwise average lunch.

Oh and one more thing the Raspberry and White Chocolate Cheese Cake, if you have room, is a must!"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper's is fine for what it is. It's a chain restaurant that serves up hearty comfort food. We had a CJ gift card burning a hole in our pocket and suggested this spot for our family get-together. 

Their menu is ginormous. In fact, it reminds me of a slightly smaller version of the Cheesecake Factory menu. It's loaded with options that range from salads, burgers, pastas, steaks-- think American pub style entrees. 

Here's how it went down... 

Chicken Pot Pie
An iconic and delicious calorie bomb. 3 out of 5 of us ordered this, It had a perfectly flaky and buttery crust filled with creamy sauce and chunks of chicken, carrots, peas, potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. They serve it with a cup of mixed fruit (honeydew, grapes, and cantaloupe).  Yum.

Pasta
My brother-in-law always orders the Jambalaya pasta. This dish is made with a creole sauce and pepper, onions, sausage, chicken and shrimp. It's creamy, spicy, and filling---everything you want from comfort food. However, I really think you'd be safe ordering any pasta dish here.

Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sweet Potato
A giant sweet potato topped with jerk chicken, chives, and papaya relish. My potato and chicken were a little cold. I didn't send it back and just ate it the way it was. My overall feeling for this dish- Meh. I should've stuck with what I know and ordered the pot pie.

Again, I feel this spot is A-Ok for what it is. The family loves their Chicken Pot Pie - I'm sure we'll be back just for that. Their portions are extremely generous. Make sure you come here hungry."}
{"text":"I really liked this simply themed restaurant. Muted colors with beautiful stonework, large themed pictures (I.e. prospectors) that look hand-painted, even pix axes on the wall.  A very relaxed atmosphere.

Everyone at our table ordered something different, and everyone just raved about the food.  I loved that the fish tacos that came with tinfoil wrapped around them to look like a fish tail. :) The meatloaf tasted homemade and came with mashed potatoes, of course. The jambalaya came with lots of shrimp as did the shrimp Fresca pasta. Even the side of grilled veggies was delicious. 

The portions were very generous, without being large enough to be wasteful.

Everyone at my table agreed that we would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times in the past and I was not a huge fan. They have huge portions but i didn't think anything had much flavor really. I have changed my mind about this place for sure. The Cesar salad and potato soup were good. I had the Chicken Fried Steak and it was great. The steak was tender and crispy, the country gravy on top was delicious. This took me by sup rise. I will say the green beans were over cooked, and had just been sitting for a while cause they were wrinkled and cold. My girlfriend got the prime rib and she liked it but it was fatty for sure. Her grandma got the Norwegian Salmon and she loved it. Salmon was cooked perfectly. The kiddo got the pizza and she loved it. We went on mothers day and everyone from the hostess to the servers were very attentive. We had a great lunch and were very happy. This place was on there game for mothers day for sure!"}
{"text":"Claim jumpers Is the nicest and has the best service than all the other chain restraurants I've been to. It also has less screaming children than CPK, and by less I mean NO screaming children... Claim jumpers has a GREAT happy hour from 3pm to 7pm Mon-Fri... good sized drinks, try the sliders and the irish nachos."}
{"text":"Shrimp pasta was meh. Service was really good, but the cleanliness was sketchy. Sticky tables and filthy menus. The two we had were very grimy."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!! I didn't want to even waste my time with this review but I felt the need to. Our waitress was completely clueless and acted like she didn't give a F. 
The whole experience was dreadful. What a waste of time and money. Our large family will never return."}
{"text":"So I decided on claim jumper for thanksgiving dinner. 

I had no idea the golden nugget had a claim jumper in it, and it's 24 hrs!!!

Same claim jumper menu that I've seen in california. 

I had the turkey dinner special and as anticipated, it was delicious.

Tender, sliced, juicy turkey breast on top of flavorful stuffing and creamy, buttery mashed potatoes topped with pan gravy. The dish was served with roasted vegetables. 

Service was on point. Staff was helpful and in good spirits. 

I left with a piece of lemon cake to go. Excited to try it. :-) 

The only thing I want a fan of was the decor. It wasn't like you're typical claim jumper log cabin theme. I feel as if i pay for atmosphere when I am going to spend around $40'on myself to have food and a drink. Atmosphere was dark, keno everywhere, felt like it should be the hotels cafe.

Everything else A+ I will be back."}
{"text":"Ate at Claim Jumper and for a solo table wait was a bit long for service. The salad was wilted iceberg lettuce with soggy stale croutons. 

I ordered the tri tip $17.99 which the top 2slices were a very nice medium rare, however the other slices were overlooked well done meat. Cooks must have an issue with blending veggies also because I had raw crunchy carrots and over cooked completely mushy squash.

The tri tip also came seasoned in a very distinct Rosemary, not everyone is partial to the strong taste of Rosemary. 

Nice size portions, good cheesy bread, a bit pricey at $40 for one entree and a glAss of wine. Probably not return."}
{"text":"I ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer. Just ok. The main course ribs. Ribs were pretty good although I like fall off the bone tender.  Service was pretty lame. I asked for bread twice and never got it. Very slow. When in Vegas there are just too many great places to eat. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Deserves no stars... The wait was terrible, the service half a**, the food wait was more than an hour... The food was dried and played burning hot from being left there. The place needs to be run better. I don't think it's the servers fault but the way the floor is run is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"The server got three out of four orders wrong. We received two plates of pork ribs instead of beef ribs and had to wait 15 minutes for the correct order. The fish tacos were missing the side of fries, which we had to remind the server twice. The server was slow and seemed out of it. I heard several rounds of misty sounding sneezes from the kitchen----glad we all got our food before then. I don't think we'd like to return to this location."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare from a somewhat limited breakfast menu. Though, it is very well made and presented in a nice atmosphere and honestly, how many breakfast options does one actually need. Although, a rather pricey option for some eggs and toast, you can't seem to get breakfast for less than $15 per person anywhere in Vegas unless your a \"morning coffee and donut only\" kind of person. Either way not bad place to eat if your staying in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with my two children, got seated right when I walked in which was good, service was a train wreak from the start, first we never got our bread at all, the server even said she would get it for us, our meals came out and she still never did, I had to ask for it at the end and just got it to go. Next we got our meals but then never received our sides and our server was nowhere to be found for about 20 min of me looking around for her, the hostess noticed me getting angry and came over and asked if I needed anything, so I told her my children never received any of their sides and we never received any bread so I would like it to go, at this point I would of thought they would of done ANYTHING to right the wrong but nothing. I will not be back to Claim Jumpers. Servers name was Lauren."}

{"text":"Obviously there were no employees on staff today. The manager served our party of eight, and after waiting well over an hour after we ordered our food, we finally left.
Water and tea glasses went unfilled.  
A big bomb. Will NEVER be back to this location."}
{"text":"We went here for Easter dinner. The staff was very friendly and the food was great. Lots of food for the price."}
{"text":"This was my first time to go to Claim Jumper, and after hearing all the hype from my friends and girlfriend, I decided to finally go. 

They seated is promptly, it was 10 at night so not busy. For the appetizer we got spinach artichoke dip, which was amazing! The chips were warm and it tasted awesome! 

For main course our server recommended the tenderloin tips. So we ordered that and the baby back beef ribs. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly and it was on a bed of mashed potatoes! That was awesome! The vegies that came with it were covers in butter, so I liked them! The ribs had a great sauce with them and tasted good, but would try their chicken instead next time. 

All in all, great food, service and atmosphere! Will be back soon an want to try a desert next time!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute opposite of an enjoyable family dining experience!


The music is so loud you cannot hear your family conversation. Mgmt declines that they can fix the issue. 

The temperature is freezing constantly and again mgmt. says they cannot resolve. 

Service is slow and food mediocre. 

Very disappointed with the service and food"}
{"text":"Always good service and food here. I work nearby and like coming here for a nice sit down lunch. I've tried a couple different salads and their French Dip, all of which were great. Years ago I tried their famous cake, omg that was the best. Resturant is always clean and the staff are friendly. Food is fast and fresh. Can't go wrong with this place. I've only been here for lunches, so I can't rate a dinner experience, but I bet it's 4 to 5 stars as well."}
{"text":"Love the food here. We went yesterday and the food was great. Too bad the service was terrible. I guess our waitress decided that all her other tables were more important than us. She greeted the table next to us first, even though we came in before them. She never asked if we wanted apps when we ordered drinks or when she brought them, and left quickly. Ten minutes later she finally came to take our order. The table next to us got bread with their drinks. We got ours when we ordered our food. Someone else brought our appetizer, which came after the salad. One good thing, our server did refill our water with the salad and the meal. After she brought our dinners, she forgot about us. She checked her other tables 4 times, while she ignored us. Finally 15-20 minutes after our entrees came she checked on us. Also when she brought my steak, she went to leave without asking me to check the doneness. I had to call her back to check the doneness. The steak was great. The kitchen did a great job. She never asked if we wanted dessert. We had to flag her for togo boxes. Finally she brought the check, after we had been packed up a while. Need less to say her tip was minimal. I normally tip very well, but she did not earn it. I would have complained, but the manager disappeared halfway through service. We love the food, but will not be back, because of the service."}
{"text":"Great GF menu included in regular menu. THEY HAVE GF PASTA. I had the portobello pasta and it was fabulous! Staff is very knowledgable about their GF options and confirm they are GF when delivered! I will be back"}
{"text":"During my check-in, I found that they have their wireless networks named Deadwood (my hometown) and Badlands (another South Dakota mainstay). I'm sold.

I had a soup and salad lunch deal, and my dad had some kind of beef tips-mashed-potatoes-vegetable thing. Those veggies were intensely good. Yep, covered in butter, but that's probably why they were so intensely good. 

It was fast, which is what we needed, but man oh man, corporate Landry's has their stamp all over this place. Our server had the script down pat, and we heard her repeat it to several other tables, as well as another server repeat it to his tables. Nobody wants to join the dining club, okay? Corporations drive me crazy with their policy and upselling. That's the only reason I'm giving it less than 5 stars because we did have a good meal and a good experience here."}
{"text":"Appetizers was good but food average for the price then we kept getting bothered to join something I wasn't interested in. Service was good other than the bothering. Food did take a while to come out though."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Claim Jumpers for several years. It was my moms birthday and she decided to give it a shot again bc we hadn't visited in such a long time. We had a fairly large party (8 plus 2 kids). We made reservations for 5:45 and didn't get seated until 6:15. The food wasn't anything to brag about either. I got the \"infamous\" pot pie. The frozen Marie Calendar pot pies you buy at the grocery store are way better. My sister got the tenderloin tips. She had 3 pieces of meat and LOTS of mashed potatoes and onions. And those 3 pieces of meat she had weren't even good :/. It was very expensive too. I would have given this place 0 stars if I could have. I won't ever be returning."}
{"text":"We tried this place as we did not want to go out after a long day at a trade show. To my surprise it was very pleasant we ordered and were treated to a very good fresh cheese bread and then another one after we gobbled it up. I had the tri-tip with coconut shrimp I have to say the shrimp were not the best I've had but ok but the tri-tip was fantastic tender moist and very flavorful our waiter was very attentive and not overbearing we had a great experience would go back again big surprise for hotel food and not expensive good value."}
{"text":"Be ready to eat! Huge portions on most plates.  Try the strawberry lemonade for sure! Service tends to be alright ..nothing to brag about. Its a place to feel comfortable at with a nice quiet atmosphere for being a big place."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the service. Drinks are good. Might come back. I'll just ask for a different server. We felt rushed by her. And she explained the menu in such an uneasy manner, like she felt obligated. Went to BRIO instead. SO YUMMY."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've dined at a Claim Jumper restaurant.  We picked this place because it was half way between us and where a friend was visiting and it's just off the 101.  We were disappointed to learn that some of our favorite dishes are no longer on the menu.  We loved the Crispy Asian Chicken Salad....gone.  What about the Salad Bar?  Gone.  Dammit.  Instead we settled on the following items:

Sliders, $10.99
Potato Skins, $9.99
Baby Back Ribs, $23.99

The Potato Skins were very good and so were the Sliders.  However, the Baby Back Ribs were terrible.  They were too dry and didn't \"slide\" off the bone like you'd expect them to.  Next time, we'll pass on those.

Our server was very friendly and entertaining.  She also never rushed us.  Since we were meeting friends on this visit, we had a long dinner and stayed for drinks and Dessert much later than most diners.  She was super cool about it and stopped by to check in on us from time to time.

Too bad about our deleted favorite menu items.

{"text":"My food was horrible. Prices was extremely high. I ordered a cheese burger and it was so burnt, charcoal was coming off. I informed the manager and was offered something else, which I refused. Everyone knows you don't have something go back to the kitchen and they don't do something to your food. We had a large party, the waiter could not keep the tickets correct. He kept stating, I'll remember. It took 1 hour just to get the bills out and another 30 minutes after we paid. Totally unacceptable. I had 2 drinks, they were great. That's all I can say. My children's food was not good, but I have taught them not to complain so they did not tell me their pizza was overcooked. I will never be back. The checks should have included tip, as it was a large party, but it wasnt. I have not heard of that. Bad business and bad food!"}
{"text":"Always like Claim Jumper. Steak very good. Nice variety of food. Yummy bread to start your meal. One of my absolute favorite clam chowder soup. I had the Citrus salad this time. Yummy."}
{"text":"Opened about a year ago. The cheesy bread comes out first and is excellent especially when hot. Our server, Roxanne, could not have been better! The turkey dinner special was good; particularly the orange-cranberry relish. The best however was the freshly baked pot pie. It was outstanding with plenty of chicken and vegetables. The light, flaky pie crust is to die for. Easily enough to feed two people! The citrus tea was a nice change from the more common peach tea or raspberry tea. Located inside the Golden Nuggett Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"My favorite Claim Jumper in town. Had their 21 oz  bone in ribeye called \"The Sheriff\" it is one of my favorites. I killed the sheriff..."}
{"text":"I tried chicken pasta and it was very tasty.  Also the quantity was sufficient for two people. They also gave salad and bread which was awesome. A must visit for everyone."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8pm, we ordered our drinks. I ordered water with lemon and had to wait 30 mins after I got the water for the lemon. We waited an hour after we were seated before anyone took our FOOD order. It was 9:42pm (one hour 42 mins after we arrived) before I got my food. At this point I wasn't hungry anymore so I asked for a to-go box and the check...I didn't get that until 10:20pm....that's just me! That's not the other people at my table. One ordered fries and got mash potatoes, another ordered tortilla soup and got clam chowder, one asked for ranch and got blue cheese. my brother got so tired of waiting he ordered his dessert the same time as his food and asked for it right away. He ate his food, asked the cake again and waited an additional 20 mins for a cake they said was ready. Before anyone asked it wasn't busy nor where they under staffed. Unacceptable! Our party of 14 won't be returning!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I came here for happy hour appetizers, we were honestly expecting great service because about a year ago we went to the Claim Jumper in Tempe and everything was A-MA-ZING! Our experience here was quite the opposite. We ordered caesar salads, sliders, and the cookie dessert. There was entirely to much dressing on the salad I could hardly find the lettuce. The sliders were actually quite flavorful but the cookie dessert was beyond disappointing. If i'm going to use Weight Watchers points for dessert I want it to be worth it and this as not! I would have given more stars if the service was on par but that was quite disappointing as well, and the thing about it was it wasn't even busy. 
We will not be back!"}
{"text":"We were originally seated in the main dining area and after a while decided we wanted the happy hour menu. The server was very accommodating and helped us transition over to the bar. Our waitress was beyond FABULOUS! The food came out hot and full of flavor. We even ordered the cookie dessert and that was delicious as well. When back in town we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been to a Claim Jumper, aka \"CJ\". We don't have any in Hawaii.  It seems to be a chain restaurant.  This one is located inside of the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino. It's open 24/7. 

The interior is dim with muted, earthy tones. The music is soft rock/pop. It seemed clean and well maintained. 

We had to order breakfast only because we arrived before 11am. I ordered the Full House: eggs, choice of meat, pancakes, and hash browns. My \"crispy bacon\" came out as good as it could since it was a thicker cut.  The hash browns were seasoned well - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The pancakes were filling and fluffy. The eggs were fine. 

Service was quite good,  especially since we had a large group of 8. We had to ask for a few minor things,  but overall, the staff had teamwork! 

I'd go back again for the convenient location and hours of operation. Maybe I'd go back and try dinner or lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered a brownie finale and it came out frozen!!  I sent it back to get it warmed up and it came back rock-hard and absolutely inedible! Not to mention that half the ingredients that a \"brownie finale\" usually have were missing (no shaved almonds, no whipped cream)! I thought this was a chain restaurant and expected consistency but unfortunately that is not what I got. 

What was even more disappointing was the manager's reaction to all of this. She simply offered a refund but completely denied that the brownie was terrible and frozen and claimed that it was \"made fresh to order\"....!

There are plenty of good restaurants in the area, don't even bother coming here..."}
{"text":"ravioli=yum
chicken fried steak=yum
strawberry lemonade=yum
claim jumper=love in my book!

wow, i wish i had discovered this place sooner!  i shared the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy, along with an order of their seasonal butternut squash ravioli, with my bff.  it was fantastic!  i stuffed myself silly!  and the prices, although not dirt cheap, were reasonable and the portions big.  with some entrees they do a regular sized portion (which is big) and for a few dollars more you can get a bigger portion (which in my chicken fried steak case turned out to be double!).  it was all very filling and tasty and totally up my alley.  their strawberry lemonade was good too!  the only downer was that we were so stuffed we couldn't order a piece of that monster sized chocolate cake (which is the equivalent of three huge slices!).  on top of everything we had the most super friendly helpful waiter who made out meal that much better!  kudos to claim jumper!  they made a fan outta me!"}
{"text":"I used to love Claim Jumper but now I have a bad taste in my mouth that will never go away. I got to the restaurant before the big rush during the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. There was barely anyone there so it was nice to be seated right away. 

The food was terrible. I ordered the chicken tenders with fries and it came with soup or salad. I asked for the ceasar salad and it looked and tasted soggy like it was left out all day then served to me. The lettuce itself was welted and definitely not good. The chicken tenders used to be so good but now they taste bland, no flavor just quickly thrown into flour then fried. My husbands sandwich had avocados that were extremely mushy and over ripe. The quality of food is the worst I've experienced at a Claim Jumper and it's obvious no one in the kitchen cares about what they put out. 

It wasn't worth the 50+ dollar tab then to make it EVEN WORSE, THEY CHARGED MY CARD TWICE!! mind you, it wasn't busy when we got there and yet we had terrible food and our card was charged twice. I can only imagine how much worse it got after the rush that came in after we left. I'm very disappointed and will never be going here again.

I'm obviously not the only one. Seeing all the 1 stars within the last few weeks alone would have stopped me from going here. So many other great places to choose from at town square yet I went to these clowns. Obviously not even management cares."}
{"text":"Nothing much seems place is going down on service. Prices were raised and they removed the free popcorn..WTH?"}
{"text":"I have to tell you that I have never been very impressed with Claim Jumper locations before. They have always been known to have large portions, but the service and the food has just been average. Starving after a flight and getting settled into our resorts, we ended up here for dinner. The 5 of us all got a huge booth. Our waiter was quick to get our drink orders. We ordered steaks, a pot roast and a spinach chicken salad. Two of us shared to meals and the waiter was gracious enough to have the chef split both plates so that we didnt have to. Again, our waiter was great. It turns out he is from Marin and grew up in the bay area. It figures. He made sure we always had our teas and waters refreshed and was there for us when we needed anything. Everyone was more than satisfied with their steaks. The salad and pot roast were great. I think the veggies in the pot roast could have used a few more minutes, though. If you are having trouble deciding where to eat, are really hungry, want to make several different people happy, and are near here, I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Things have changed since Landry's bought them. The portions are not as large as they used to be. With that being said, this is still a great place to go. Staff is friendly and attentive. Food is still good and portions are generous, just not as large as they used to be. Food comes out fairly quick. I remember when people meandered outside waiting for a table, now, after Landry's, I can take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Food was hot and tasty.   Will return.  Like the variety on the menu"}
{"text":"Dinner with the fam. Parents, kids, and the wifey. Seven of us were sat in a horse-shoe booth. Not too bad. Waitress was nice. Food seemed like it took forever. Got the BBQ chicken sandwich with fries and a side of spicy thai slaw. Slaw was best part. Fries were shoestring variety, thin and not very filling. They get cold fast and chewy. Sandwich was ok. Not enough chicken for the bun size. Everyone else was satisfied, but not blown away. Overall very average."}
{"text":"This Claim Jumper is very convenient if you're in Town Square and is located right next to the kids park.  It is a huge restaurant with tons of seating and a massive menu (and portion sizes).  The food quality is what I would expect from a chain restaurant, but better than say, Applebee's.  Our service was also what I'd expect from a chain; decent, but no one is going out of their way.

We ordered a kid's Pinapple-Coconut Slushie, but when our server came back with our waters we found out that they were out of both the Pinapple and strawberry flavors, so we could not order any of the three slushies they offer.  Seems that would be something they would inform servers about...  Not a huge deal, but when you tell a 4 year old they are getting something, then can't produce, it's not the most fun conversation.

We started with the \"Soft\" Pretzel Sticks $5.99.  Soft in quotes because they were hard as a rock.  Not sure what went wrong here, but I would not order these again.

We ordered the Roasted Tri-tip & Chicken combo to share $24.99.  Sliced Tri-tip, 1/2 a rotisserie chicken, 2 sides and a side salad.  You cannot order a specific doneness on the meat, it comes medium rare to medium, and you get what you get.  Our order included some that was med. rare and some that was well done.  The meat was pretty good, not tough, and the peppercorn demi-glace added a nice demension.  A little more consistently to the cooking would have been nice though.  The chicken was moist.  Nothing special, but decent.  Broccoli: over cooked and dry.  Zucchini, carrot, onion mix: fine, but a bit bland.

We also got the children's rib dinner.  It came with 3 ribs, fries, and a side from the kid's menu.  We ordered the mandarin oranges.  The ribs and oranges went over very well.  The fries were cold and went uneaten.

I wavered between 2 and 3 stars.  2.5 would probably be accurate, but I'm feeling generous."}
{"text":"We showed up on Christmas 30 min before they opened. Once inside they said they had some reservations to seat and it would be about 30 min. 1 hour later over 100 tables were sat and not one walk in was seated. We were told 5 more min after 30 min!!! So 1 1/2 hrs wait, one kid asleep on a bench one crying because she was hungry and we ended up at McDonalds.  THANK YOU CLAIM JUMPERS. .."}
{"text":"We ate Saturday around 4 and were seated immediately, service was very good and he waitress was awesome, even teaching my wife how to eat an artichoke.
The restaurant was clean and presentable and the hostesses greeted us entering and leaving.
A little on the expensive side, but they did have reasonable dishes as long as you stay away from steak/lobster menu.  We had gift cards for $90 and still spent another $60 with Tip(20% $25)......this included:
3 ($9) drinks, tri-tip slider appetizer ($6.99), artichoke appetizer ($9), Ribeye and Lobster meal ($50) with mushrooms ($2.99)  and Tri-Tip and Shrimp Meal (21.99).  


I didn't find any of the dishes overly greasy or salty. The tri-tip was very good and the sliders had a hint of Poblano that was great.  My rib eye was one of the best I've had, but the Lobster I added on for $21.99 was tough and had no flavor.  we didn't send it back, I shouldn't have to for a $50 meal.  A great dinner, but not one I would pay for out of my own account...thank god for gift cards:)"}
{"text":"Why can you only get Happy Hour at the bar?  Just because I want to eat I don't deserve a special drink price????  Your food is not that great anyways, deserts are very good. Sorry, no interest in going back.  Should have let me order a cheap whiskey to kill the taste of your taco's."}

Great Time and Great friends along with great service and food!!"}

Ambiance was very nice and new, I wish we had opted for the outdoor seating since it was a nice day out. Service was good, food was decent. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Wow, worst service ever! We sat in the bar area and our waiter was overwhelmed to say the least. We sat there for about 5 minutes before our drink order was taken. Another 10 to order appetizer. He waited for the appetizer to come out before taking our dinner order.
My Mom's dinner came out first. About 5 minutes later my husband's came out. Then they brought out mine. I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo. What arrived was chicken pot pie. 
Our waiter was MIA at this point.
We never had our drinks refilled or asked if everything was ok. 
Horrible experience."}
{"text":"We thought we would go out for Thanksgiving for a change and this is usually a decent place. I thought a homey style food restaurant like this would do a holiday dinner well. So, I made a reservation, it took 30 minutes to be seated, but on a holiday, I could accept that.  We had heard rumors in the entryway that they were out of turkey, so we asked our waiter, who checked with the kitchen, came back and assured us there was turkey. He took our our order, then came back 30 minutes later to tell us that no, the turkey was indeed all gone. One of our party just decided not to eat at all as he had his heart set on a traditional dinner. It took another hour for us to get our food. 3 hours for the whole experience.  I had the ham, it was so so, the stuffing was inedible, very unsatisfying except for the company.  DO NOT GO HERE ON HOLIDAYS! I have had good experiences during regular business hours at this location
. Restaurants need to refrain from offering holiday service unless they are prepared."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, love the chicken caesar and the cheese sticks. Managers don't seem to care about the customers but some of the servers are excellent! Jessica a young girl from St. Louis area is amazing. She talks just enough and gets it all done.  She remembers what you like and smiles all the time.  You would never know if she was having a bad day.  We go there mainly for Jessica or Brandon."}

{"text":"Food was excellent (except for cold baked potato which was replaced by mashed potatoes) and service slow...asked for catsup three times and bread three times...mgr finally told us that they ran of bread and, as we were ready to leave, they told me that the bread was baking and wouldn't be ready for 30 minutes. Always loved Claim Jumper but had bad service at Golden Nugget Claim Jumper, Las Vegas, and reported it on a follow up survey. No one acknowledged my issues--so much for consumer surveys. Claim Jumper, regretfully, has changed."}

{"text":"I find claim jumpers happens to be one of my favorite restaurants that are exceptionally not stingy into giving large portions of food.  They have a wide variety of foods and the taste on all of them are excellent, which is why they deserve a five star review.

I started off with a pomegranate sangria that was just the right mix to get the buzz going, but not enough to make me insanely drunk.  My server was Mitchell and he was very attentive to our large party of 8.  We ordered pretzel and cheese appetizer and it tasted better than Auntie Anne's in the mall.

I got a house salad with ranch and the croutons they put on the salads are so damn good!  It's a cornbread type crouton that is sweet yet crunchy with every bite.

My main entree was the ribs and shrimp. Ribs are my number one favorite food and this place always hits the jackpot with me.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp with cheese and I swear I was going to have a heart attack, but as least I'd die happen.   Again all portions are very generous and they don't miss a beat for taste.  Will be frequenting them more often!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. Claim Jumper use to be so good. It was like fresh home cooked food. I haven't eaten at a Claim Jumper in a couple years and now all the food is just bland. Taste like everything was frozen and processed. No where near the quality that it was the last time I was there. We couldn't even finish half the food b/c the entrees to 30 minutes to come out after we had already finished the appetizers and they seemed as if they were sitting under the heat lamp for a while to. Everything was all soggy and luke warm.  Definitely never going back there again. Save yourself time and money. Go to CPK or Brio right around the corner."}
{"text":"I like this place. It was good not great. Went with a group an hour before closing and they were so polite! (surprisingly). Service was excellent and food was good. We had the ribeye, breaded shrimp, pizza, chicken fried steak, caesar salad, and spinach dip. They bring out bread with your drinks with marinara sauce which was good...... 

Spinach dip however didn't really have any flavor. I think it is a little pricey for the quality of the food. They do have a huge selection on the menu and the kids menu had a good selection as well."}

{"text":"The four of us each had something different, and we were all pleased with our choices. Perhaps the most wonderful surprise was the Chicken Pot Pie that my husband ordered. It was the size of a salad plate, at least 3\" tall, and very filling."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is usually good and the service is always great!
This is a great location in the city and is near so many other shopping places. 
Although I do agree with another reviewer who states that the food has shrank a little bit its still way huge and you will most likely leave with a doggy bag! 
There were a couple times Ive had to send my food back because it wasnt hot which is a big no-no for me. The plate wasnt even hot on one occasion so that should let them know that the food most definitely isnt warm. One suggestion I would make is that they learn to season their food a little better. While their pot pie is tasty and one of their most popular dishes I always need salt.. and Im not a huge salt adder .. Im always perplexed by this.."}
{"text":"Abstract: Worst service within a twenty kilometer radius. Quite possibly the worst service -- dollar for dollar -- in the whole fucking town! 

As a rule I start disliking chains before I even step foot in them. Just a rule I maintain; maybe I am a hipster. 

Anyway, I have always felt that CJ sucked (probably because they do). And this particular location takes the cake. 

Be prepared for the slowest, most uninspired/lackadaisical 'service' known to humankind. This is almost so bad that one starts imagining that it is a hidden camera-'reality tv' show that one is an unknown party to. I am waiting to sign a fucking waiver at the end of my meal over here.

One starts to ask oneself: \"Is this going to be on TruTV or something? Hidden Camera-Secret Diner-Bad Bar-Restaurant Rescue-Storage crossover?\" 

I mean: for fucks sake. Get your shit together!

We have all been to hole-in-the-walls where you know you ain't getting crumbs brushed off the fucking table service. But this place ... this Claim Jumper is worse than any hole-in-the-wall I have ever been to. And I have been to Mejico (real Mejico, not Cancun or whatever the fuck). I said Mejico!

Food sucks; service sucks; and I feel I am surrounded by so-called Yuppies on every occasion I go there. (Could be more of a Town Square problem.)

{"text":"The food is great, but the slice of chocolate cake is AMAZING!!  We went there late one night just for a piece of that cake and 2 glasses of milk!!"}
{"text":"What can you say about Claim Jumper? Well, for starters, the obvious. The portions are huge. Like seriously obnoxiously huge. If someone from a different country came here they would immediately brand us as the most wasteful, gluttonous culture that has ever littered this earth with our people. Not to be dramatic, but that is actually what I heard this woman from El Salvador saying once who was visiting the U.S. for the first time as she was leaving the restaurant. 

The food itself is pretty good, and the service is their strongest player. The staff is super friendly and accommodating to even the most obnoxious of patrons. 

I'd recommend the fish and chips and a to-go bag, and you should be set for atleast a day or two."}
{"text":"Place was dead & took 15 min for our drinks (3 of us, so 3 drinks). 55 minutes for our lunch food to come out. Waiter was never to be found. I asked a manager about our food & he said he would check & never came back. The salad I ordered was delicious, but we never were asked if we wanted refills as we sat with empty glasses."}
{"text":"Depends who you are these days. So me and the bf went and played checkers while we waited, which was only five minutes.
Our sever, Stephanie was excellent. She was friendly. We ordered the flat bread with cheese and peppers, and it's sooooooo good and not that expensive for an appetizer. 
I had the tri tip, they've done better but still the potato with skin and shoe string fries make up for it.
The desert some ice cream chocolate and marshmallow creation is to die for except you might die eating it. We asked for wheel barrels so we could get wheeled out. :) 
Also for cocktail drinkers a tip: try the black opal. SOoo. Sooo. SOoo. Good and two of em can make me a happy drunk."}
{"text":"The hostesses didn't say a word to me until I had been staring at them and tapping my foot for seven minutes while they talked with each other. Later on getting the check and then processing it each took ages. It wasn't even a full section. The food was okay..."}
{"text":"$18 under cooked omelette, sausage was low quality.   On a positive note the service was good.   I will pass on this place in the future"}
{"text":"We totally forgot about this place.  AND there's a reason why.  The service is terrible and the manager was really rude when we complained about having to wait 45 minutes for two salads.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"Not the waiters fault. Felicia. She tried but restaurant got super busy around 3:30ish. Fish tacos were cold and wedge salad came after the tacos. Really..!? Super dirty knifes and forks. Will not be back ...Dirty Dining. Channel 13..!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a large group for work.  We got a private room.  The staff was friendly and did a great job serving during our meeting, not too distracting.

I live out of town and would love to go back again.  They have a large menu and everyone loved their food.  I did the citrus salad and subbed blackened salmon for chicken. It was wonderful and fresh.

I saw many other menu items that I would have like to try. I'd say that it has something for everyone. They roast their own chicken in house and also have a tempting dessert display."}
{"text":"Now that I have eaten there 3 times, for dinner, breakfast and lunch, I can say it: there is just nothing that they eff up. The service is phenomenal, and everything tastes great. Yes, it is a chain, but it is also in casino land where you don't usually  service like this. 
The cafe that used to be here was alright. Everyone was nice enough. The food was good enough, but I always felt like I was settling for convenience over taste, when I walked in. 
Here are the things I have tried: lemon zucchini stick appetizer (SO good), Pot Pie (actually better than my recipe, dang it. It is their historic signature dish. I see why.) Eggs Benedict (with perfectly poached eggs. That never happens in a casino!!!) and Caesar Salad (heavy on the dressing, which I love. If you are not into that, just ask for it light.) They serve warm bread and marinara on the side with entrees. Yum!

I did debate about the 5 stars. This is no Nobu. But it is awesome for this location, they know how to poach an egg & It will fuel me through another awesome Punk Rock Bowling weekend!"}
{"text":"Its been ok the past 2 times I have been. I feel like something has changed. I noticed they had gotten rid of their steak fries and that is sad as they were so much better than the limp shoestring ones they serve.

I had the fried chicken salad last time and the pot pie the time before. Both just ok. The waiter was nice and attentive, but he tried to up sell us a lot. I know it isn't there fault but it feels so patronizing.

My grandfather got the chicken fried steak and you could feed a small planet with the size of that thing! I do like the side choices for kids, lot of healthy options for my little one."}
{"text":"Grabbed my favorite girl in the world from the airport and headed straight to Claim Jumpers for dinner. Since they don't have one in Miami (although they have plenty of other great food in Miami) I figured I'd let my sweetie check it out. 

Although we were kinda lame soup and salad for her and California chicken salad for me she was digging the vibe and we really enjoyed the Claim Jumper Mai Tai. Word to the wise it is meant for sharing because it is huge. 

We had a new server in training who did an awesome job! I really enjoy the claim jumper experience and I give them a lot of credit for the training they give their staff!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Arizona and deiced to try out the local Claim Jumper for our first dinner in AZ. Came in about 8pm and it was totally dead. There were about 5 workers standing at the hostess area talking among themselves and not 1 of them looked up at us or said anything. We stood there waiting and it became a bit awkward because of how long it took them to acknowledge us. Once we were finally seated, we were promptly greeted by our server, Cohl.  We ordered our drinks and food and after that we didn't see our server until it was time for our check!  Our drinks remained empty during our entire meal. NOT 1 REFILL! Our server disappeared. To make it even worse,  the food was not good, it was dry and had a microwaved meat taste to it (probably because it was left under a heat lamp while our server was missing).  After our meal, we waved down our server and asked for the check, didn't bother asking for refills since our entire meal was over and it would take him FOR-EV-ER.  Of course it still took him at least another 15 minutes to get our check (keep in mind, there is only 1 other table with people at it in the entire restaurant!).  Once he brings our check my husband immediately gives him our card so we don't have to wait around for him to come back, but of course he takes another 20 minutes to cash us out and bring our card back.  Will never be back.  Terrible service and bad food."}
{"text":"Been going to Claim Jumper restaurants for 30 years.  Always in my top ten but tonight ordered Jambalayla Pasta.  Could not eat it.  Bread was not served until requested. Server was just not into it!  Called the manager later to give him a heads up but me thinks it fell on deaf ears!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm, hmmm, Good!
Although the wait was a little longer than expected.... all agree that the food at this restaurant is absolutely amazing. I'm here with six friends no course we are all ordered something different however instead of the traditional breakfast I decided to order the fish tacos with a side of Asian slaw and a side salad. The side salad is absolutely amazing. The greens are very fresh and the house dressing was an unbelievable balsalmic vinaigrette. The dressing was so good that we asked for some  to take home.  I eat a lot of fish and can honestly say that these are absolutely the  best fish tacos I've ever had. And most importantly the presentation was on point.  My friends were disappointed that they did not follow my lead and order the fish tacos.
I cannot wait  to  return to Las Vegas and will make this restaurant a daily stop. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp were perfect and TEN of them. Chicken broccoli Alfredo very good. Service very good."}
{"text":"Excellent meals for all four of us. The service was friendly and prompt. Salads were fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"I had this around 4pm and wow I love food and I'm the last to ever complain but this was absolutely terrible. The food was nasty I  definitely got food poisoning off of it from what I just went through.. I do not recommend anyone to go there worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Not crowded for a Friday night (which is good to me..lol). I had the BBQ burger and my fianc√© had the Frisco burger. Both were good, but we didn't know the French fries would be shoestring style. They were extra crispy and seemed more like chips than fries. Also it felt like McDonalds bec the ketchup was provided so sparingly (It's as if the server thinks his grandfather owns the place!)"}
{"text":"Terrible meals.  From the dinner salad to the roasted chicken the food was not good. The kids mac n cheese was flavorless and the bbq chicken salad was tasteless and the chicken was very dry. Very disappointing. This used to be one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Awful! Brunch took over an hour to get our food. Server was not attentive. Food was cold. The restaurant was empty too. Just a really poor experience."}
{"text":"Came here to feed my starving children on a lazy evening. First time we'd been there in a year or two and when we walked it, the smell of hickory hit us and we were drooling. To start, my kids wanted spinach dip and Arnold Palmers ( I'm a mean mom who rarely lets them drink soda). Arnold Palmers werent mixed well and had no ice.Too much dip and not enough chips. 
Ugh...
Maybe main course will make up for a rough start?
Wrong.
My chicken had no flavor other than it \"smelling\" like apples. Roasted veggies were greasy and all tasted the same. mashed potatoes had no flavor either. 
My husband had flavorless tri-tip, but it was cooked medium like he asked, so maybe that's a plus?!
My daughter asked for Mandarin oranges and the server forgot...twice. 
My son had Alfredo. He loves mine better he says ::awwww ,blushing::
Overall, food greasy and flavorless, unless you order from the kids menu.
Maybe, I'm just used to eating better, or maybe I was wrong to expect so much from a chain restaurant,but the food just didn't amaze me."}
{"text":"This is my first time at the Las Vegas Claim Jumper, and my second time at one of their restaurants.  The food at Claim Jumpers is typical American flare cooked to appease the masses instead of standing out. 

The atmosphere was nice and the waitress provided nice service for our party of 7 which can be a lot of work I am sure.  The challenge is that the food is really unremarkable.  It feels like they are trying to do to much, and in the process they create mediocrity for the masses.  The other thing that stands out is that portion size seems to matter more than quality.

I got the Shrimp Fresca Pasta which was priced at $19.99.  There were 6 butterflied shrimp that had been breaded and deep fried with a bed of noodles and a lemon cream sauce.  The pasta was ok, but the shrimp were inconsistent with some being slightly dried out.

It was not a culinary disaster, but I will certainly fight harder if I am with a group that is selecting a restaurant again to try something else."}
{"text":"HUGE.  FRIGGIN'.  PORTIONS.  Holy cow, does Paul Bunyan eat here?  I've been to this place a couple times now, and man...do they know how to deal in excess.  Just about everything here is huge, drinks, food, even half the people that visit here are huge.  That's not to make fun of them, but you know where there's big people, there must be big food.  I'm a big boy myself.

The appetizers here themselves can almost be full fledged meals.  Try the Nacho Platter ($8.25) and add some chicken ($2.00).  This plate comes out gigantic.  It's like almost a pile of nachos like 6 inches high.  It's got your standards, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, diced tomatoes and black beans with salsa on the side.  They use Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese, and a lot of it.  It's pretty good.  That's not much coming from me though, I even like plain nacho chips with cheese from Taco Bell!  Just make sure you share it (with like 3-4 people) because you definitely got more than enough to spread the wealth.

If you really wanna kill yourself though before your entree arrives, get the Appetizer Combo($19.95).  This this will topple over your table!  It's got Artichoke, Buffalo Wings, Zucchini, Mozzarella Sticks, Parmesan Garlic Rings, Loaded Skins, Cheese Potatocakes, and Southwest Eggrolls.  You also get some sauces like Ranch, and Marinara for dipping.  It does look like most of the stuff on this platter is frozen then fried....but oh well.  At least you get to enjoy looking at ALL of it, it's not for faint of heart.  This platter alone will feed 5 easily.

I usually end up ordering an appetizer for the table, so I almost always try to pick a smaller entree for dinner.  I usually end up with pizza or a sandwich.  I like the Clubhouse Sandwich ($12.95), well, because I like club sandwiches.  This one's got Fresh Turkey, Sweet Ham, Bacon, Gouda, Muenster, Garlic Mayo, Tomato and Greens all on white or wheat bread.  This sandwich comes out stacked!  I usually only manage to finish half of it before I ask for a doggie bag.  It also comes with seasoned fries which are light and crispy when they are fresh.

They also have a lot of home cooked favorites and specialties.  Anything from rotisserie chicken, aged steaks,  meatloaf, Country Fried Steak, pot roast, chicken pot pie, even liver & onions.  They make a killer turkey supper as well.  And all your entree's are HUGE, you could probably feed 2 people off one plate.  

You can't leave here without trying the desserts!  Your heart will pitter-patter before it drops dead of a heart attack from your appetizer and entree.  But you just might be able to fit in a monster dessert before you keel over!  They have a dessert called the Chocolate Motherlode Cake ($9.95).  It IS the motherlode!  It's 6 (yes 6) layers of chocolate cake with chocolate chips, walnuts, and chocolate fudge frosting!  This cake is so tall from the layers, you have to lie the slice down to avoid it from falling!  Leaning Tower of Cake!  The night we had it, it was moist and decadent.  But the leftovers the next day were kinda dry (I should've covered it with a lightly damp paper towel).  But still good with some vanilla ice cream.  I heard their Mud Pie is exceptional and HUGE as well.

This is a family-type restaurant so it's pretty kid friendly.  Their service is ok most times, but if it gets busy (like on weekends) your server might take a little long to get back to your table.  But the servers I've had were always nice.  But if you're looking for a romantic evening you probably don't want to go here.  Go to Roy's down the street or something if you want some alone time with your sweetie.  But try Claim Jumper, you will like it!  Just don't overdo it, because you're gonna have one hell of a tummy ache and extra miles on your treadmill if you eat too much.  Oh well, you gotta work out anyway because you may be lugging a BIG bag of leftovers home."}
{"text":"I've been to Claim Jumper a few years ago, but I don't remember the food having such mediocre quality. 

The complimentary tomato bread was just plain bread with tomato sauce. The bread was nothing out of the ordinary and the sauce was just way too watery. It lacked a lot of flavor and taste.

The fish and chips breading was soggy but the fries were great. 

The hostess was a little less than friendly. She was wearing a headset and not speaking to anyone. When we asked a question, she raised her hand in a stopping motion and made us wait. That's not really professional! No greeting once we came in; just silence."}
{"text":"This evening we had reservations for two, we're seated in good time. Ordered the spinach and artichoke dip other was delicious. My hubby had the widow maker he loved it, I ordered the ultimate fish and shrimp, hmm well the fried shrimp and grilled shrimp were really good but as for the fried fish it was mushy and the blackened tilapia had a weird seasoning to it. Waitress forgot my black cherry hurricane and charged me for it."}
{"text":"We have eaten at several Claim Jumper locations. This one is average. 

Service was ok, another waiter kept helping us because our waitress, Amanda, was busy in the back... Break?? 

So when the waiter, still not Amanda, brought out our food he marveled at how excessively large our portions were, compared to the normally excessively large portions, tonight's portion seemed obscenely excessively large, and truly worthy of pointing out. 

HOWEVER, the portions were not really obscenely excessively large... We ordered the Country Fried Steak as we always do. In reality these were thinnest steaks I have ever seen served as a steak. These could've been on a steak sandwich they were so thin. In fact if you added together the top an bottom breading, the breading was thicker than the meat inside. 

The portion of the potatoes was not as large as they normally are. 

All in all we would go back to Claim Jumper. But we were disappointed with this meal."}
{"text":"The food was great. Portions are huge. Prices were not bad for portion size. They have a lunch menu monday thru friday. We were seated right away on a saturday afternoon. Waitress was super nice and attentive. I would definately recommend and will return. Located near shopping great for happy hour or girls day."}
{"text":"Visit 8/5/12- Our last few visits at other Claim Jumpers have been less than adequate.  It seemed like the ingredients were being skimped on because the overall taste was nowhere close to the quality of their food 5 years ago.  Although this location was better then the one in Henderson and for sure the one in Summerlin, I doubt we'll be back unless I hear about some raving reviews.  

Started off with the Lemon Pepper Zucchini.  Pretty good even though the batter would not stay on.  The ranch dressing was excellent though!  My husband ordered the Widow Maker burger which he said was good.  He ordered it with a side of the green beans-also good.  I ordered the Cobb sandwich which was a disappointment.  They no longer use a whole chicken breast-instead it was shaved cooked chicken, the avocado was skimpy and I did not taste the bite of blue cheese AT ALL!  The shoestring fries were good and the portion was large.  

My niece ordered off the kid menu which had a great selection. She had pasta with an alfredo sauce, apples with caramel, and mandarin orange slices.  She liked her meal.  

Service was great though.  The servers were very attentive and our orders came quickly.  I would give CJ 4 stars based on service alone but the quality of food has definitely regressed gradually the last few years..."}
{"text":"I understand that Claim Jumpers is a chain, but this is the only one I've ever been too. The portions are huge, the food is great and while I have always called in my orders and picked them up on the way home I'm fine with paying $40 for dinner and leftovers for lunch the next day for my wife and I.

I did try eating at their bar one day for lunch, but the service inside was a bit slow. I also tried eating with a group of friends once, but we ended up leaving after filling up on nachos, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Ugh! 

I'm so upset I gave Claim Jumpers my business!! 
I held a rehearsal dinner here and had a party of 40, I get its a lot, but it was also planned in advance. I called a month prior to make reservations and then picked a menu from the catering menu. The communication up until the time of my event was great! That being said I thought service would be amazing.. *rolling my eyes*

My party & I arrived at the time which was discussed, we sat in the patio area. I was told the table would be all together. There were several 4 top tables through out the room facing different directions (not what I discussed but its fine)
2 waiters were assigned to my party to assist us.. slow slow slow!
1 person would order, they would go back and get it, another would order so on and so forth.
The whole night lasted like this, example 1 person at the table would be getting their salad while the other one already ate theirs, and was half way through dinner.
I got up spoke to a manger who assured me she would be able to steer the boat around and take control...

Long story short, slow service (both servers and at bar), cold food, poor customer service.

Only reason I would go back is to walk by when I'm in town square"}
{"text":"It was unplanned for us to go here for lunch on a football Sunday.  We approached the hostess to let her know that there are 12 of us including 3 highchairs.  I wish I knew her name, but from there she gave an attitude to where we were inconveniencing her.  Honestly, it didn't even look that busy except for the bar for those watching the game.

Our table was huge!! I loved how we had a lot of room for our food and drinks without having to worry about getting rid of unnecessary things or the babies knocking things over.  It was also spacious, so it didn't feel like it was congested.

Our server was Angie and was an amazing waitress.  She was patient, kept a smile on her face, and would hold a conversation with us.  With having 3 babies fussing and making a mess, she offered a free baby dish for each so they can stay occupied.

I couldn't believe it, they offer a Baby Dish... for FREE!!  It comes with soft turkey, cheese, apple sauce, and mandarin orange.  I ordered Parmesan Chicken with tomato sauce and spinach with spaghetti noodles.  It was good, but I can't say that I will go back and get it again.  My husband got the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was pretty good.  It was any ordinary salad but with chicken and shredded cheese.

I gave an overall 4 stars because of the waitress and how comfortable I was there.  The food was decent, but didn't wow me.  And finally, I wasn't a fan of the hostess' attitude."}
{"text":"For two dishes and 2 lemonades I ended up paying 74(salmon oscar and filet mignon). The lady sat us in a booth and we waited a couple minutes for service. I understand they were busy, so I was patient. The salmon oscar runs about $30.00 wtf!?!?!? It said salmon with chunks of crab and my facial expression was . Unfortunately once I got it the salmon was so small, slim, and there was NO chunks of crab. I could of gone to smiths and bought 3 times what they gave me for what they charged me. I was starving so I finished my plate in a minute max. The 3 toothpicks, oh wait I mean dried asparagus, they gave me were so unappealing I didn't eat them. This is the second time I come to this location and honestly it'll be the last time I come here. I'd assume better food quality especially for the area. I'll post a picture of the gigantic salmon and chunks of crab I got for a steal of $30 big bucks."}
{"text":"Now Ive been to this particular location a handful of times and every experience Ive had has been less than desirible.

One time we were seated in the bar area, and it wasn't on a game night or a holiday. I dont know if they were just incredibly understaffed or their servers were just extremely undertrained but after we got our food and drink orders we never got talked to again. We waited probably thirty minutes trying to flag someone down to get a refil on our beers before we just gave up and walked to the front to ask for our check.

Next time we came with two of our close friends (one of which used to work for a Claim Jumper in San Diego for over a year) and we got seated, and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Now twenty minutes has gone by and our server hasnt even been over to our table to greet us...? Everyone around us is getting greeted and helped and even parties who have been seated after us are getting taken care of and were just sitting there still with no service not even a hello or a water. Finally one of us got up and asked a server if they could help us. We had to ask to be helped so we could spend money in their establishment. That really blows my mind.

We just came a few days ago with our family and our experince was completely mediocre, but compared to the way weve been treated here in the past it was a huge step up. 

I like Claim Jumpers as a chain but I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I had never heard about this place before. We were looking for a place to eat and ended up asking one of the security guys for a recommendation. He recommended Claim Jumper for the best price - value deal. 

We opted for the bar area, because we didn't want to wait. There was only one server responsible for the entire bar area and so the service was a little slow. She was still very friendly but you could notice that she was a little stressed. 

I also tried one of their darker drafts. It had really good strong flavors, which I love in a beer. But unfortunately I cannot remember the name anymore. 

I had the Original Tri-Tip Dip, which is according to their menu description \"Slow-roasted and simmered in French onion broth with caramelized onions, roasted pasilla peppers and smoked gouda on a French roll with au jus or sweet BBQ sauce\" - O.K. I think this says it all. This sandwich was delicious. My husband ended up eating more of mine than his own food, which was one of the burgers. 

There is no Claim Jumper close to where we live, but if we were in that area again, I'm sure I will consider going back there."}
{"text":"Location 5/5:

This location is ideal. Located at Town Square right beside the Children's park/play area. Not much for parking in front of the restaurant, but there are plenty of parking in the garages and parking lots, which aren't too far of a walk.  

Food 4/5:

Come if you are hungry and have a big appetite. Their portions are huge!! Too much for one person to have on their own. I normally just ordered off the appetizer menu. Which in my opinion seemed like a normal size at any other restaurant. At least you know you're getting your money's worth. 

They always start you off with bread, which is tasty. Mine have always been fresh and warm.  For some reason, I thought the first time I came here, that they also gave you butter with your bread, but I guess not. Sometimes the waitress/waiter forgets to bring it to you, so you have to ask for it if you want it. 

One of my favorite things to get here are their wings. They have several flavors to choose from, my favorite being the Asian Spicy BBQ. All their wings come with carrots and celery and your choice of ranch or blue cheese. Price is $14.99 or $8.99 for a smaller portion. 

Another favorite is their chicken pot pie. This thing is huge!! Easily can be shared between two people. Comes with a small green or Caesar salad or cup of soup for $16.99.

Their salads are also very good. House and Chinese Chicken salads are my favorite. They do a good job at making sure they're isn't too much of any one thing in the salads. If you want extra of something, just ask. I can't recall if they charge more for extra though. Salads range in price from $8.99 for the basic salads up to $17.99 for their most expensive one. 

One more item on their menu I'd like to mention. They have some really good fish tacos. Not the best I've ever had, but still good enough to mention. The Fish tacos are drizzled in a Chipotle sauce topped with Pico de Gallo and served with rice. Cost of this is $13.99

Service 3/5:

Service here is just average. You will be seated right away, as long as it isn't the weekend, but once seated you may have to wait awhile before someone comes and takes your order. Any time that I've been here, they always seem short staffed. There's one person for a whole bunch of tables, which makes it hard for them to be efficient and tend to their tables in a timely manner. The staff are nice, just too busy to really seem like they care. I'd just suggest to hire more staff members. 

Depending on time of day and how many people they have, you can wait on your food from 15-45 minutes. I tried to come during non rush hours, but I still waited at times for nearly an hour for a simple dish. 

Overall, I really like this spot and wouldn't mind coming back again when I'm back in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Just found out this place is open 24 hours.  That deserves 5 stars just for that .  ELVIS was an amazing server.    Super friendly.  Recommended the pot pie and it was great.   Cheesy bread too.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"Going to go 50/50 with this one.  We always try a place twice if it shows potential.  We didn't like the food the first time we went... super large portions of tasteless stuff on a plate.   The 2nd time around... the food was much better and the service was great.  We will go back for a 3rd trip in the near future....to split a meal... the portions are way over the top.

Nice clean environment... not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"While our meal was served backwards, Gabriel, did a great job of staying upbeat and kept a positive attitude that more than made up for the error of how our meal was served. 

Bonus, salads for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Landry's purchased Claim Jumpers in 2010. That was the end of my love affair with Claim Jumpers. The menu, quality and portion size all decreased. Landry's has ruined a once awesome restaurant. I have been back twice, hoping they would revert back to the pre-purchase glory. The place is terrible. There are many locally owned and ran restaurants that easily outshine this chain."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is a fairly generic hotel restaurant located conveniently near the lobby in the Golden Nugget.

We arrived after midnight and this place was our only food option, but the service was quick and the food was apparently tasty. (I was exhausted and far from hungry, so I didn't sample anything on that particular trip.)

We came back a few days later for a quick snack and ordered: French Fries, Battered Onion Rings (\"Topped with Parmesan garlic and served with ranch dipping sauce\"), and Lemon Pepper Zucchini (\"Lightly fried and piled high, then topped with lemon pepper Parmesan and served with ranch dipping sauce\").

All three items arrived to the table relatively promptly and quite hot, and the accompanying ranch dipping sauce is quite good. The Battered Onion Rings were especially tasty, while the Lemon Pepper Zucchini contained a generous portion of battered zucchini (with the zucchini still impressively crispy)."}
{"text":"Tasty food, big helpings and great service (Thanks Phillip!)

We have frequented Claim Jumper numerous times and usually have a good meal there.  There was a time where the menu tweaking got outta hand but we think they have all of our favorites back on there.  

Ambience is good - like an old mining lodge and seating is roomy.  We had an exceptionally good visit with great service tonight (again, thanks Phillip).   

A little pricey, but you really get sent home with another meal due to the larger portion size

We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Been a couple of years since we've been here , greeted right away , our waiter April very friendly and on point , started with the zucchini app , huge portion and good , had the potato soup very good with chunks of potatoes and carrots the wife had the tomato basil said it was OK , we shared the chicken fried chicken , the chicken was awesome but the mashed potatoes could have used more flavor, the wife got an ice tea refill and it was tropical instead of the regular, all in all pretty good just $40 a little step consider ing we split the meal , will come back to give something else a try"}
{"text":"I just love the BBQ Beef Ribs here.  Can't find them anywhere else in 'Vegas. I find pork ribs everywhere....  Large portions, good food.  If it were closer I'd eat here more."}
{"text":"I have had many good meals here. You get large portions but the prices could be a little lower. Service has always been good."}
{"text":"Wonderful service from the minute we walked in the door. We had a wonderful dinner in the bar, the hors d'oeuvres were hot but the meal was just lukewarm. The coffee was hot and fresh! Enjoyed my dinner and will return again"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper, the name reminds me of the mid 1800's and the discovery of silver in Nevada.  It was Friday, so we made reservations.  Good thing, the place was teaming with people.  Promptly seated and immediately greeted by Eric, our waiter.  We ordered the Bonanza Platter and the Salmon Oscar.  Everything was right \"on point\", hot, fresh and tasty.  The service was great and we look forward to a return visit.  I definitely recommend this location in Henderson,NV on Green Valley Parkway."}
{"text":"Waitress was really nice and had a smile every time she approached us. Potato soup was good, fried zucchini appetizer was huge and definitely recommend. I ate the filet medium rare and was served as ordered. Meatloaf was a little dry but had a nice taste to it."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while, because we thought the quality of the food was going down.  But I was presently surprised when I can in for lunch.  The service was very friendly and my widow maker burger came out fast.  It was delicious and I will start coming back with my family."}
{"text":"Decent food but price jacked up for no reason, service was spotty. $15 for breakfast with small portions. Your better off finding a regular location"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar- waitress/bartender greeted me as I walked in. She was very nice :) At the time the wings were on special. I got the buffalo bone in, very good wings. They drenched them  in sauce and the ranch was amazing. I also had a mojito, they make good drinks well. Also this was my first time ever at a claims jumper, have been back a few times."}
{"text":"For lunch on a Sunday I see at the most three servers. Nothing has been timely at our table. The hostess has a low cut top that shows mid drift... Our server is ran ragged and unable to tend to our family of four needs. Our appetizer was southwestern egg rolls which were falling apart served and in a pool of juice :/ we ordered a bowl of clam chowder which was just okay. The clam ratio however was perfect. This location could use some revamp on management and more servers. Less servers does not create more tips. Running servers into the ground doesn't create a positive environment."}
{"text":"What happened to the Claim Jumper's I used to know? Today was not a good experience, customer service lacks and food grade was down! And the manager was not excepting out complaints! He just kept talking faster that I did making excuses for their  down fall instead of just making things right for us. Well it's gonna be a while before I come back."}
{"text":"Great place to grab an early breakfast...tucked away in the Golden Nugget.  Husband can't stop raving about their Eggs Benedict, says it's the best he's ever had.  My breakfast favorite was their egg white ham and cheese scrambler.  It's was also a nice touch that you had your own pot of coffee so you could pour and refill at your own leisure.  Except for the Keno Board, one would never know that you were having breakfast in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I would describe the food here as Modern Comfort food. I had Halibut fish and chips which was delicious. The fish wasn't over or undercooked and had just enough crunch. The BF had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sweet Potato, which was AMAZING. It was a huge sweet potato filled with Jamaican jerk chicken and veggies. Everything was very flavorful. For dessert we had the Chocolate Chip Calzone. OMG, so good! Very filling though, we shared it between 3 people and still couldn't eat it all. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. I suggest going here on a very empty stomach."}
{"text":"I really used to love their Fried Zucchini Sticks but I was so disappointed the last time I was there as the waiter said they changed the way they bread the Zucchini sticks. That appetizer sucks now.....The breading just falls off and the Zucchini sticks also shrank..... BOO HOO!!!!! WHAAAAAA!!
Alright I'm over it - The Lemon Bar Dessert is soooo YUMMY!!!!
The Tortilla soup and chicken salad sandwich I had for lunch was good as well.
I didn't care for the shoestring fries as I'm more of a steak fries type of gal.
I love the atmosphere in here - it's dim and open (spacious) and the bathrooms are always clean - YAY!!!!!  for clean bathrooms.
One star off for changing up and ruining the Zucchini sticks appetizer - Shame on you....."}
{"text":"Husband wanted to go to Claim Jumpers for dinner. It had been a long while since we had been to one. The last one was in Fresno, California and they closed that one down.

He ordered Chicken Fried Steak and mashed potatoes. I had the chopped steak and mashed potatoes with cheesy garlic bread. I had a glass of Apple Cider Beer to wash the food down. The Chicken Fried Steak seemed to have shrunk in size from what my husband remembers. His dinner salad had no taste, he said. I had the Caesar salad it wasn't bad. The chopped steak was good, the bread was good. My husband wasn't thrilled with his dinner. Too much batter not enough meat.

The waiter wasn't very attentive, though he did let me sample the cider before I ordered it. It just seemed the table next to us got more attention from their waitress. Like bringing the pepper mill for their salad and checking on them. Then we had a long wait on getting the bill.
Maybe the Claim Jumper is passed it's time?"}
{"text":"Great happy hours price for beers.  We did not observed any bad service or cold food.  However, the appetizers was a little too greasy and hot.  Our waitress actually from east coast and with great personality.  She made our happy hours even more happy.  I also spot another great location across the street : )"}
{"text":"Food here is horrible and service is lacking.   I eat at Claim Jumpers in Portland, Oregon and food and service great.   First meals tasted like they over salted my entire plate.  Ate there the 2nd night because nothing else was open and service was again lacking and our pasta dish was barely edible."}
{"text":"was there last night with my family and really enjoyed the food and the great service , nice big plate filled with food and fast on refills on the drinks and kids friendly , will be back soon ."}
{"text":"Ordered to go Carrot Cake for a birthday.  \"Absolutely the best\"  Cost $40 but serves 14-16 people.  Guests Loved !!!!!!!!! it so much we gave each slices to take home.  It is really, really moist and the icing is soft and light, not heavy and thick and they don't pile too much on, cake is not too sweet either.  I just can't brag enough about their carrot cake.  Freezes well too!"}
{"text":"They have maintained reliably consistent food over the years. And it is alwats very good in my opinion.  I would have normally given them 4 stars but it is obvious they are making a valiant effort to rekindle their ratings.  In the past the service has been hit and miss never knowing what mood you will get with the server. The servers have often been moody rude or not good. This last visit the server was on task and the manager watched over with a visit and they also added hot bread for free this is fairly new. I would love to see them add more vegan slash healthier choices to the menu but I will continue to be a regular. We usually do fried zucchini sub marinara. Widow maker at happy hour sub veg patty and minus bacon and cheese. Ask for the California citrus salad with all spinach yum."}
{"text":"I used to love Claim Jumper and rarely ever got to go as a kid.  It was too far from home for a regular dinner outting.  Then I moved to Las Vegas and just sort of forgot about them.  Just the other night, though, my family visiting from California recommended we go.  

It was a bit different than I remember.  The food is still, for the most part, enormous.  It is what they are known for.  My step mom ordered fried chicken.  It looked my like a turkey filling up the plate the way it did.  The only food of disappointing size on this occassion was the dinner salad we all ordered.  It was a bit skimpy and sort of soggy even though we all ordered different dressing.  I don't remember the bread with tomato dipping sauce being brought to the table before.  It was alright but sort of forgettable.  It was fluffy which was nice.  But the sauce on top and the sauce on the side were bland.  I had a piece with and a piece without the sauce and could hardly tell the difference.  I'll pass.  There were also some items I don't remember seeing on the menu previously.  And even a few I remember that I did not see anymore.  There was no salad bar and we were told it is because we are in Las Vegas and they cannot compete with the casino buffets when it comes to salad bars.  Interesting.

Service the other night was not bad.  Though it is worth noting my grandma ordered fish and chips with no chips but rather a side of fruit instead.  When her meal came, it had fries and no fruit.  We had to ask again for that.  My aunt had to ask for the sweet potato she ordered because it was not brought out either.  Everything else seemed to go off without a hitch.  

I had a Widow Maker burger that was crazy good.  It was cooked to a perfect medium the way I like it.  It was topped with onion rings, avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato and some sort of relish.  It was difficult to eat because of its size.  But it was also delicious.  I was impressed with that.  What I was disappointed in with my overall meal was my iced tea.  It was weak.  It was more like water with food coloring.  The lemon helped to give at least some contrast to an otherwise tasteless beverage.

I think I have pretty much fallen out of love with Claim Jumper.  It might as well be just another page in my high school year book that I look back on with fond memories.  I am moving on."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I went to Claim Jumper! So, here I am ! And, it reminds me of why I didn't go there any more! Well, it got a nice ambiance, the food looks good, but the taste is not so much! :(("}
{"text":"Nice place in Avondale to grab a bite before an early movie at Harkins across the street.  Came in on a Friday afternoon for happy hour in the lounge.  My white sangria is awesome, but my hubby's long island tasted like coke.  Enjoyed the pork tacos and fried zucchini. Unfortunately, there aren't that many options in the area.  Generally, I find Claim Jumper's menu overwhelming, but the happy hour deals were decent."}
{"text":"The food and service were very good last night. Our group had sirloin tips, cheese burger, salad and kalbi ribs. All were very good. We loved the garlic bread too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Worst Claim Jumper ever!!! First, the waiter was slow and incredibly inattentive; I had to ask for silverware and napkins which given that there was almost no one else there is just absolutely inexcusable. Then, my husband asked for crackers with his soup but never got them. I asked for ice tea with no lemon, but got a lemon and no refill in anything resembling a timely manner. The only good thing about the Widowmaker hamburger I ordered and that was edible were the two onion rings. I had to ask twice for extra mayonnaise and ketchup and it took awhile for those to arrive. Two of the four pieces of bacon were woefully undercooked while the hamburger, which I ordered medium, was so overcooked that I could have used it for a weapon and severely injured my neglectful waiter. The menu said nothing about the hamburger having dill pickles - and really, with avocados, ugh - and when I went to remove the pickle I had to reposition the avocados and it was obvious that removing the pickle wasn't going to help; the entire bottom bun was drenched in dill pickle juice and it covered the taste of the avocados. It even contaminated the string fries next to the hamburger so they tasted like dill pickles. There was so little cheese I almost had to hunt for it and saw only hints around the edges of the hamburger.

I asked for the manager who took about three minutes to arrive and was totally disinterested in the fact that my cheeseburger had no cheese, there was enough dill pickle juice to squeeze into a small jar and whisked the plate away before I could tell him about having to ask for silverware and napkins or that my waiter sucked. He asked if I wanted something else but didn't apologise for the terrible food or, of course, the even worse service. The only time the waiter was prompt was with the bill; he hovered until I got my card out, took it and brought it back in 30 seconds. He brought the bill without asking if we wanted dessert so good thing we didn't want any!

I hadn't been to a Claim Jumper in 15 years and I definitely will not be returning to that one. Unfortunately, it seems my favorite dish there, a fabulous pot roast, has been taken off the menu so I doubt I'll go back to any of them. The portion sizes seem the same: massive. The prices would be reasonable for good food and if quantity over quality is what you want and you don't mind shitty service you'll probably like this place. Otherwise, try Vic & Anthony's, they're both inside the Golden Nugget after all."}
{"text":"GARBAGE! But hey, the portions of it are huge!!! Sorry, I can't testify to any dishes here."}
{"text":"GARBAGE! But hey, the portions of it are huge!!! Sorry, I can't testify to any dishes here."}
{"text":"I took my family here for dinner and it was epic.  The food was great and the service was phenomenal.  I got the Widow Maker and it was truly a work of art.  My kids ordered off the kids menus and their food was equal to what some restaurants serve as their main entrees.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheeseburger to go and found out it was completely uncooked on the inside.  Hostess also had a bad attitude.  I called the next morning to complain.  After being put on hold for 3 minutes, I was told to bring in the food for a refund.  Nah, I'll just take a photo and post it here thanks"}
{"text":"wonderful, delicious, fresh food. at first the menu seems like nothing special - what you'd expect on an applebees menu, except the food is awesome!

Let me tell you about the best steak I've ever had. Aged beef, seared to perfection, and it just melts everywhere in your mouth. No chewing necessary. Found here. 

Anyways, I highly suggest this place if your in the area. It's a great addition to the Nugget and Fremont St."}
{"text":"Serving this much food should be illegal.  Don't go to Claim Jumper if you're not hungry - your stomach will explode!

This is what I miss the most about the West Coast!  Get the Chicken Cobb Sandwich, the potato cakes, the potato cheese soup or the blue cheese wedge you'll be back at least 4x/week!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and hate to give it a rating less than 5. My complaint has nothing to do with the service or the food. I am a regular here and Vanessa is the absolute best server to ever help me. She is attentive and excellent at her job. The food also never disappoints. My complaint regards the General Manager, Jeff. My visit tonight showed me how unprofessional and disrespectful he is. As Vanessa was greeting us, he gave her the death glare because she wasn't attending another table; that death glare was clear for me and my friend to see as well. He approached her with a level of disdain that is exceedingly unprofessional to display in front of customers. I understand his job is to keep employees on task while they are on the clock, however, it should never be apparent to a customer that you have such disgust for another individual. And on top of that, it was very clear that he had chewing tobacco in his mouth. Where is that ever acceptable in a restaurant setting?! I will continue coming here for the service and food, but will not ever respect that man after his actions tonight."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is a Hieronymus Bosch painting come to life."}
{"text":"This place was so quiet after ordering and waiting 25 mins and no one came with food or to say hey sorry for the wait it should be out shortly, we just left! We wont be back! We called and the manager offered to make it up to us with a free meal, we didn't want to come back for that."}
{"text":"Ordered the Black Tie Pasta while my husband ordered the Classic Burger well done. My pasta was over cooked while my husbands burger was burnt!!! My server Jessica was very nice and the manager Lauren was understanding so that was a relief but I think because their menu is so overwhelming it causes issues in the kitchen. But that menu is OVERWHELMING"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. This is my first time at Claim Jumper and I can say I will definitely come back. 
I had the Ore Cart which included Tri-Tip steak, 3 BBQ Ribs and I had some shrimp which was substituted for the chicken. The steak was flavorful and perfectly cooked, the ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious and the grilled shrimp was one of the best shrimps I've had in a long time. 

On top of the excellent food I have to mention our waiter, Luis. It's rare to find a waiter who doesn't say 'no'. I first asked about a substitution for the chicken and he went to 2 different managers. My ice tea was always full (tells me he paid a lot of attention to our table). When I asked him about changing the channel on a TV, he didn't hesitate and went to get me the remote. He really made our dinner very enjoyable. I also wanted to mention that Scott the manager took care of us too...very nice & friendly."}
{"text":"There were 3 of us having dinner in the bar.  We had Eric the bartender as our server and he was great.  He was very attentive as we had drinks, appetizers, a main entree and dessert.
Everything tasted wonderful and served in a timely manner.  We were very happy and will definately be back."}
{"text":"One of the worst places in LV I ate!  Food took a long time to get,  when we got it they made a mistake and gave my soup to another person then brought me the same cup table.  It was cold,  no crackers,  no butter for the bread.  The ice cubes tasted moldy-tried new beverages twice! 
Food took an extremely long time to get husbands ribs were very bony, burnt. My steak was suppose to have a burbon sauce,  nope it had the same bbq sauce the ribs had.  Mashed pot. were cold.  I didn't want to ruin my night out with my husband so I stopped complaining. SERVICE WAS WORSE!"}
{"text":"Well I am here at an odd time late lunch at 1.44pm. I sat at the bar which I normally do not do because of lack luster service at many places. I can say my server is very friendly and seems to be enjoying her job. 

Ice tea. So I am weird because I am from the south but I drink unsweetened tea. Theirs is not so good kinda bitter or old. 

Had grilled chicken with a side salad. The salad is fine but I forgot to ask for dressing on the side so it was a little bit much for my preference. I will say their was no brown lettuce at all. It was very fresh. 

Chicken. Was good. It was nicely grilled and the veggie mix and potatoes were nicely seasoned. It was very nice for lunch. 

I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in during our recent stay at the Golden Nugget to have breakfast. It was a Tuesday morning at 9am. The restaurant appeared to be 3/4 full. The wait for beverage service was 10+ minutes. A quick scrambler breakfast and French toast took almost 20 minutes to receive. Great food just really long wait times, 2nd time eating at this restaurant in 6 months. Will not be back when travelling thru Vegas for business I don't want to wait for food when there are multiple options."}
{"text":"Saturday night and the place was empty, should have been a clue. Haven't been here in six or more months they've changed quite a bit and not in a good way. The food was only decent and some missing ingredients, Chinese chicken salad with no Chinese noodles, deli style dry sliced chicken, a baked potato not fully cooked with one pat of butter, a pasta entree that was missing the broccoli, and service that was horrible, after being seated it took ten to fifteen minutes before we could get service they told us they were trying to find a server for us, mind you there was not even 50% of the seating being used. Then we ordered appetizers and ten or so minutes later our food order. The appetizers were served and not but three minutes later our food was in front of us, our soups and our meals, not giving us any time to enjoy our appetizers... If it was not for the fact that we were with family we haven't seen in forever it would have been a very disappointing evening. What made it worse is the manager couldn't even give a decent apology, we won't be going back. And by the way they changed the lemon cake (which they didn't tell us) and it was absolutely horrible it was dry and tasteless, the chocolate cake was still as good as ever maybe we will order that to go....we were embarrassed we had recommended this place to our company. There are too many places to eat in this town there is NO excuse for bad service and too expensive to have sub par food...off our list."}
{"text":"Yummy! We had great service and great food. The deserts were amazing. I was happy with our whole experience. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but service wise they suck! ! ! I recall my first time in on a busy night, so I brushed off the waiting for a table and waiting on the waitress to make her rounds, but when it was on a slow day in the middle of the week, was a shocker, so once more I brushed off the fact of possibly they are training, so I kept giving the benefit of the doubt, but when I recently tried making a reservation for me and my wife was WOW!!!!

The service needs a huge revamp and better quality! When I called I requested 6:00 pm, the girl on the phone said please hold, I held for 10 minutes, she then comes back on the phone and says \"Thank you for calling Claim Jumpers, how may I help you\", so I am guessing it's a new girl on the phone when I find out later it's the same one, then as she was making the reservation she kept talking to someone in the back not acknowledging me at all on the phone, then she disconnects the call, so again giving the benefit of the doubt of maybe it was my cell, I try calling back and guess what no answer I tried from 12:30 pm to 2:00 pm and no answer, so I decided to take my business else where."}
{"text":"I will keep this short and too the point. Tri-tip came out looking like a real fatty prime rib, chips came out with entree, wasn't asked for a refill on my Long Island until it had been empty a good 5-10min. Everyone has a bad day, this bad day however cost them customers. Sorry but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I can't say much for the food ...my little boys had their pizzas burned twice . I had the ultimate fish and shrimp dinner and it was super salty . My big boy had a chicken pot pie which he really didn't eat and hubby and my 13 year old had the steak and shrimp dinner which they ate but said it wasn't as good as other locations . I'm sorry to say that this chain of claim jumpers isn't very good . Our server I think his name was James was very good . He kept checking on us comped the burned pizzas . I mentioned it was my hubbys bday and he brought out a red velvet cupcake . Although at this location the staff doesn't sing happy bday . But the stars are for James."}
{"text":"Nice place,good food, great atmosphere, good service!  Love this place, always a good atmosphere , great service and love the menu. nothing beats good home cooking!"}
{"text":"The staff here are some of the most Outstanding people. Without friendly service any type of food is just bleh. They make you feel extremely welcone and at home. Came in on busy Sunday night headed straight to the bar. Got our Long Islands right away and out food also. Me and mt girlfroend are so happy to find an establishment like this so closw to our home."}
{"text":"This is for their thanksgiving meal only. We ordered to go and for 130 bucks we got some turkey breast, sweet potatoes , mashed potatoes, veggies, stuffing, gravy, Texas toast and pumpkin pie. I felt like the meal was decent enough to feed 4-6 people. We actually had other items that we made ourselves so this meal wasn't demolished. Overall it was easy to pick up, heat up and serve. Everything was labeled so there was no mistaking that. The turkey was moist and still tasty! The ordering process was easy and it helped us not spend as much time in the kitchen!  Overall I believe that it was worth it especially if you have tiny kids and rather spend that time playing with them or watching football. Everyone was pleased with the sides and I will definitely think about using them again for another big holiday meal."}
{"text":"Wow! To start off with the food was amazing. Last time I was here was about 10 years ago and it wasn't memorable. This time was great. The only reason I didn't score this as a five was our 1st server forgot us and blamed it on another girl. The second server was the bomb! I feel bad as I can't remember her name. Will make a point to find out next time I'm there.
My boyfriend and I decided on Claim Jumper for date night and it was a hit. He had chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad. I had the tri-tip with the BBQ stuffed shrimp, mashed potatoes and a green salad. We ordered the spinach dip to start off with and they brought some bread. Everything was cooked perfectly and tested great. But the shrimp stole the show. It was grilled stuffed with a sliver of jalape√±o, cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and lightly brushed with BBQ sauce. Nothing came close to being that good. I fully recommend it to anyone.
Will be back again."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant for thanksgiving yesterday. We had reservations at 5, wasn't seated until 545. Once we were ready to order, the server informed us that they were out of turkey.... on thanksgiving...... 
we ordered prime rib, when they all came out 8/10 dishes were RAW, and full of fat.The meat was purple and the plates were covered in blood. The vegetables weren't cooked, and covered in olive oil. Bad experience for thanksgiving, definitely won't be coming back to this restaurant for a long time."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how bad this one was. Had some of the worst service ever. Were there for lunch on a Sunday, it was not busy, but we waited a super long time for everything: to take our drink order, to get our drinks, to get silverware after our food had already come. They got our kids order completely wrong (she ordered Mac n cheese), I ordered a grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't even melted (how do you mess up a grilled cheese and Mac n cheese???) , didn't get our drinks refilled, and then we waited a half hour to get our bill and pay. I've been to decent claim jumper restaurants before, but unfortunately this was not one of them."}
{"text":"We got there around 4pm before busy time.  The service was lousy the waiter was very busy and other waiters were just standing around.  We sat there for a good while before we were asked our drink order and it took forever.  I ordered the fried shrimp and fries the shrimp was so over cooked it was curled up and it was tuff. Also tastes like they haven't changed the grease in the fryer in months. And they are very expensive and NOT worth it. NEVER again"}
{"text":"Ever step into an eatery where you feel a peculiar sense of unease?  This massive eatery seemed to suggest a disquieting atmosphere when we found it almost empty on arrival!  With its high ceilings, expansive open areas, disconsolate surroundings and unending stone bulwarks for walls created a dungeon-like presence.  We were determined in spite of this sentiment, to try a meal, it being our first visit here!  My wife and I were in awe of the size of their menu.  Questioning ourselves how an eatery could support the number of items on their mammoth menu!  Also dumbfounding, is there lack of pricing in their menu, especially in regards to libations.  We decided to keep our order simple - first-timer trial and error as it were.  Starting with a simple Lemonade and Iced Tea.  For appetizers we went with their Mozzarella Sticks.  Our entrees consisted of my wife's Stuffed Veggie Baker (baked potato) with mixed vegetables, presaged by her selection of a Caesar Salad - she was satisfied overall.   I had their Tenderloin Tips in herb peppercorn demi-glace, over saut√©ed mushrooms and very densely grilled onions on mashed potatoes, which was presaged by a choice of soup or salad, I chose the Tortilla Soup.  Although my meal was okay, the serving was not much to write home about.  The tips were tender and somewhat tasty, but were over-covered with demi-glace whereby both the onions and mushrooms got lost in the gravy! By the way, we were served our soup and salad, not having delivered on the appetizer, which we had to advise our server to remove from the order.  Although the manager approached and very nicely offered free dessert for the inconvenience, we rejected it.  Later, the manager returned and told us that for the inconvenience we experienced, he would be comping my portion of the meal.  This amazed me, as most restaurants of this caliber will not go that far to make the customer happy, thus enticing them to come back.  This attention to customer satisfaction surprised us both.  Now, despite the fact that overall the meal, ambience and service was not completely to our satisfaction, as well as the initial uneasiness and disquieting atmosphere experienced during our visit - Claim Jumper deserves our returning to try more of what that incredibly large menu has to offer!  We shall return.  Bon app√©tit!"}
{"text":"Very limited gluten-free menu, unless you eat cow. Ugh!!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time we have been in the last few months...3rd time will NOT be the charm for us. Far better places with better food and service in Las Vegas! We waited too long for the appetizers...then soups/salads along with the entree showed up and we were still trying to eat APPETIZERS! NOT COOL! I ordered Chicken Fried steak...had no flavor and the breading was so hard/overcooked I chipped 2 front teeth...NO JOKE!!"}
{"text":"Drive by this place constantly so decided to finally come in.  Let me start off by saying that I love Mozzarella sticks.  And Claim Jumper might have some of the biggest and best around.  I truly enjoyed them.  Too bad I didn't feel the same about the pizza I ordered. 

I was in fact on my way to a pizza place, but we came here instead.  Need less to say I was in the mood for pizza.  I ordered the pepperoni and sausage and it wasn't good.  The biggest problem I had with it was the that the sausage was chopped into what I could only describe as bacon bits.  I wasn't too thrilled by it.  For me the appetizer was the highlight.  I will be back though, because I hear great things about the chocolate cake, and for the Mozzarella sticks.  Also considering there portions it wasn't pricey at all which is great."}
{"text":"Nice, clean location. Sunday lunch time 80% empty. Courteous friendly service. Average sized portion s. Shrimp Fresca pasta was great. Chinese chicken salad was soaked in dressing (will not order again if I happen to be at Claim Jumper again). We enjoyed a great kids playground next door much more than the restaurant"}
{"text":"About three weeks back. Chicken salad 3 pieces with uncooked areas.  The rest is kinda detail. The Main office got back to us re the tweeted picture of raw chicken,the local one didn't even address it. Looked up their ratings re health and safety and it appears to be a more institutional problem  than this oversight."}
{"text":"Initially lost on entry. CJ = hearth on the way in, it's absence made me wonder just how much damage the noon sun had wraught but nope It's just not there. 

The first  server didn't know about the drinks available, no asian beers present, but specifically  was unable to get a pear cider in bottles until we'd proved it, would have been easier to have asked the bar person, oh hell she was the bar tender but I like a game of search the menu when parched. Makes the prize so much more rewarding. 

Server change:)

Sabrina was great, a non corporate personality in a chain ( tis a good thing) even during my head-addled minds attempt to get through the appearance of an item on the menu being claimed to be \"happy hour only\" Sorry I wanted  6 wings, not 12,  hard enough to lose weight, yeah why go to Claim Jumpers then,  damn you caught me. ( I was cheating ok?)   We had a light, for CJ, meal and it all came out well cooked and on time. Drinks stayed filled.  I stopped going to these a while back because the self control  didn't match their offer I'm happy to say that they are making it a bit easier ( though not by much ) to leave without two bags of food under your arm while your spouse wheels you out to the car."}
{"text":"Good food. Ok service. Expected a little better for the price but I will go back sometime. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Good Eats at this popular chain restaurant! Everything's really good here.

Definitely one of my favorite places to have Chinese Chicken Salad ($10.95 lighter portion/ $13.75 full size portion)- it's so good, I probably order that the most. I've had other dishes here too, like the turkey sandwich, a side of thai slaw (yum!), the starter salad/soup lunch combo (satisfying) for $7.95, comes with garlic cheese toast. My husband likes the meatloaf and mashed potatoes at $13.95. The chocolate cake is legendary (this coming from someone who is not even a chocolate fan- my hubby's the chocoholic). The serving sizes are really big, BTW. If I could compare it to another chain restaurant, maybe it comes close/similar to the Cheesecake Factory. 

Happy Hour: monday- friday, from 3-7, in the saloon only.

The decor is dark, rich woods- kind of feels like an upscale rustic cabin. The service is really good, too. More locations in town like the one at Town Square and the one at 215 & Green Valley Parkway."}
{"text":"Friday night last minute we decide not to cook and just wanted soup and salad.  Haven't been to Claim Jumper in years and now I know why....we ordered 2 soups and 2 salads.  The first soup is delivered to another table next to our table and only after questioning where our soup was did our server notice it went to the wrong table. The person in our party ate his soup and 30 minutes later the 2 house salads are delivered.  I also ordered soup which came after I questioned where my soup was.  The garlic bread which was suppose to be served with the soups and salad, it came after we had received our salads and were 1/2 eaten.  I questioned a server about the time it took since 2 tables arriving well after we had ordered had their food which was not soup and salad and I was given a flip answer \"it's coming.\"  The manager was asked to talk to us but honestly he made matters even worse.  Craig the acting manager proceeded to argue about the time in which we had been waiting for soup and salad and asked \"what do you want.\"  Had Craig showed any understanding for our dining expierence it could have been a whole different conversation and I would not be writing this now.  This is not a 5 star restaurant and from reading the reviews I question if Claim Jumper is aware of customer service, but then again maybe they have too much busines and don't care which certainly was the attitude of the acting manager tonight.  Why have a manager if he escalates the negative expierence which he most certainly did."}
{"text":"Our Christmas Luncheon on friday was held here. I chose this place for our family of companies, for a few good reasons (plus they didn't want to to go on the Strip): excellent food (everything is good), large generous portions, reasonable prices, and dependable restaurant chain with upscale rustic cabin decor/theme. And the multi-layered chocolate cake is delish (I'm not a chocoholic but I can still appreciate it)- but everyone was full, so we didn't get dessert (unsmiley face). I'm very familiar (appetizers, turkey sandwich, soup bowl, salads, etc.) with this restaurant chain (my old boss would take me here a lot). There are three locations (summerlin, henderson), and I've been to all three, now. 

There were less than ten of us in our party. We shared the appetizer combo- onion rings (dusted with parmesan cheese- nice surprice, very yummy), chicken wings, artichoke, mozzarella sticks (huge, very good, one stick was enough!) on top of carrot and celery sticks accompanied with three sauces. Most of us chose entree from the Lunch Menu. I had the lunch size chinese chicken salad- came with a garlic cheese toast (my favorite thing here). I don't get this salad much because there are only two places that do this salad any justice, and this is my favorite place to get it! Even though, it's the lunch size, it's still pretty generous! It had the right amount of cilantro, and dressing- the chicken was on top, and the salad was mixed very well, too. It was yummy, but I couldn't finish it. Two people got the beef tips, that came with a generous amount of steamed vegetables. One person got the fish and chips- large plate! It looked enticing- I haven't had that in such a long time too (hmm, debating on getting this on christmas eve. One person got the rotisserie chicken with sweet potatoes. Funny story, one person in our party never had artichoke, so we ordered another one. Some people needed boxes for the rest of their food. 

We had a huge table (could barely pass things to people on the other side of the table), and it was in the center of the room- it wasn't crowded for lunch, but maybe because this is a large restaurant, it just looked like that to me. The service was excellent. We all got refills without asking. We all enjoyed the luncheon very much. Some of us parked in front of Whole Foods, and some of us parked in back of H & M- either way, it was nice to get some walking in (even in the wind), with all the calories we took in!  

Also, a bonus is that I'm a Landry's restaurant member, and I can rack up points at all the restaurants (Bubba Gump, Rain Forest Cafe, Claim Jumper, Chart House), but no, did not use my card at this time. But will definitely be back again here again, and yes, to rack up more points too."}
{"text":"Our reservation was for 6 pm on Christmas Eve. No wait. There were a lot more cars in the parking lot, so it looked like it was crowded (it filled up later on as the night progressed). In our party was my father-in-law, his wife, my husband's Grandma and her husband (came from Pahrump), and my husband and me (three generations).

Our server told us that there were a few changes made to the menu, since Landry's bought the chain out several months ago (which applied to two dinner entrees in our party- more detail later).

Our starter was two orders of the Calamari (thick cuts of calamari, not small rings), served with Asian Slaw (love this!), and cocktail sauce. We were waiting for the marinara sauce, too, but the cocktail sauce worked. The calamari was not the usual type, and was delicious (I want to order this next time!). 

I was having a hard time deciding between three entrees (I've had many dishes and appetizers here; really miss the jambalaya), but I settled on the stuffed baked potato with veggies (carrots, zucchini, squash)- chicken- I chose blackened. Mine was huge! I knew that I would not finish this. My husband had his favorite dish here, meatloaf, which was not the same (smaller, he was disappointed). My father-in-law had the chicken fried steak (this was one of the changes that the server mentioned; my FIL said that there was a lot more breading this time around). His wife had the fish and chips (my co-worker had this at the company luncheon a couple weeks ago) and she shared (the fish was really good, good sized, meaty, not fishy or anything- I would order this, but would share it, too). My husband's Grandma and her husband had the sirloin tips (two of my co-workers had this as is) but substituted/opted the potato cakes- 2 (phenomenal!!!). We also had a drink (merlot, pina colada, white zinfandel) with dinner, too BTW. So, for the most part, four out of the six in our party, really enjoyed Christmas Eve dinner here. 

The manager was sent over to explain that we could not use a partial credit (from $25 birthday reward) on my member card (this was not explained to us at our last visit to Rain Forest Cafe @ Downtown Disney) but he approved it anyway, and the tab was a little over $141.00. My overall rating of four stars is is still pretty good, what I had was really good, and the service was excellent. (One table didn't get their food, because it was mistakenly given to another table!) We would come here again (but for Christmas Eve dinner, it's always a different place every year)."}
{"text":"When all the tables around us are complaining about the air in the restaurant, you'd think that they would've turned down the heat! It was pretty uncomfortable, eek. But other than that, the food was good. I split a chicken Parmesan with my son. The portions were big enough for us to get full off of. 

Service was great, unfortunately I cannot remember her name! Gah, I hate when I forget because she really was awesome. 

Return visits, yep!"}
{"text":"We went in Friday evening to celebrate Mother's Day a bit early as I work Sunday. The service was slow and inattentive and the food was mediocre, especially considering the price point. Our server was nice, it seemed like the rest of her section was somewhere we couldn't see from where we were sitting because the only time we saw her was when she popped her head around the corner. I just didn't get a warm fuzzy from this place and probably won't be back. The good thing? The siracha honey sauce for the coconut shrimp was amazing."}
{"text":"if you want to have a quiet happy hour to get away and relax, Claim
jumper is the place to be. love the service, food and ambience. nice place to chill. good parking area too and location."}
{"text":"Their potato cheddar soup is probably the best soup I have ever had. I have eaten in the restaurant which is nicely designed and I have also ordered their food togo. Every time it is delicious! Highly recommend the Jerk Chicken Stuffed Baked Sweet Potato; its sooooo yummy. Service is just as good as the food!"}
{"text":"Me and my family love to come here every now and then. My kids love the pizza here and its a pretty big pizza for them. I usually just order one for the three of them and they get full. The shoestring fries are really good must try. The service here can vary. Sometime we get really good servers and other times not so good. We tip accordingly though ;) . The stuffed shrimp they had here were really good but I haven't seen them on the menu in a while :( . We have a Landrys card so we are usually seated promptly upon arriving. Also the Red Velvet Cupcakes are awesome for dessert! Definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"I came in with my family and was expecting some complimentary bread, or cheese knots as someone stated in another review, but never received any. I ordered the Absolut Tortellini and it came out pretty quickly. I had it before and I loved it, but it seemed like this time they let the salt pour and pour onto the dish. I told the waitress about it and she said she could replace it. The manager came to our table and let us sample the sauce again, which tasted a lot better. I think it was the massive amount of bacon that they put into it. Long story short, they made me a new one with the bacon on the side and took my dish off the bill. Great staff, cook may have just gotten a little excited with the bacon."}
{"text":"Nice place, great location, awesome salads and a good service. What more do a hungry person need? ;)"}
{"text":"I was hungry, so my friend drove to a big mall and we decided to stop here.  We don't have this place back at home, that's for sure.  It immediately caught my attention because their happy hour is from 3:00 PM until it closes.  We went inside, sat at the bar and were taken care of immediately by Peter.  We ordered drinks, and then food soon after.  There is quite a variety of drinks for happy hour.  I decided to get the honey badger shot and the long island.  The shot I got  was delicious, and the long island was surprisingly good!  I've had a lot of super strong LIs recently, so having one that tasted good was a relief... and it managed to not be too weak.  

For food, I got BBQ pizza, my friend got a rather hefty looking burger with fries, and we shared coconut shrimp.  I loved the salad / slaw that came with the shrimp, and the crust on the pizza was done to perfection.  Just the right amount of BBQ sauce was applied... I have had many where there was either too much or too little.   My friend demolished his fries, but he saved the burger for later... I'm sure it's as delicious as it looks.  Everything was reasonably priced, shout out to the extensive happy hour!  I hope to go to the location with brunch before I leave the area!"}
{"text":"Wish that I could put less then a star. I had never been here before but I had gotten a gift card from my work so me and my fianc√© thought we would use that tonight. And let me tell you we will just throw the gift card away... I wouldn't even give it to someone I care about. Worst service ever received from the moment we walked into the restaurant. It is 9:19pm we walk in and sit down at a table (it was open seating I'm guessing? Not sign or waitress stand). A waiter comes over and says they are already closed and that the door was locked. We walked right in the door was not locked obviously otherwise we wouldn't have been able to walk in. So I pull up yelp to see when they close and it says 9:30pm so I call him out and he says, \"well I did lock the door and we are short staffed so I closed up early but I'll get you guys started with some waters and tell the kitchen that more people have just come in and to stay open\". He made it seem as if we were the only people in there... there was three tables of people around where we decided to sit and they had food. So if they want more food that can't have it either?? We looked at each other and stood up before he could come back with the waters. Save your time and money and go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"General manager was a complete prick, have to reverse transaction on bill that I was FORCED to pay that was not my bill!!!

DONT EAT HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I came here for the second time the other day and were thoroughly impressed by both the excellent food (at a very reasonable price point) and the very friendly and efficient service of our waiter Fernando, who we actually happened to have both times coincidentally!
      In a very convenient location at the center of the Town Square Mall is this Claim Jumper which really does have as the sign outside advertises the Best Happy Hour Period! A must try are the Sliders, Pretzel, and Pizzas along with just about ALL of their amazing desserts! The food has both times been consistent, fresh and good quality. A new favorite for us as locals, we will definitely be back to enjoy the food and smooth/prompt service from our waiter Fernando!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Claim Jumper in Tempe at least a couple of times a month if not more. Over the last couple of months the quality of the food, the portion sizes, and the cooking itself have all deteriorated. But the prices have not gone down.

Tonight was it. I went with a family member to dinner. We ordered chicken tenderloins for an appetizer, which were barely done. I ordered a tri-tip dinner cooked medium (menu stated that only medium rare and medium were available). When I got my dinner it was rare, and I am being generous with that description. The waitress did not return until my family member, who said their food was good, completely finished their meal. Finally when the waitress came back I stated that the food was obviously undercooked. She stated \"I thought so, but I did put 'medium' down for your order.\" She asked if I wanted a manager, I just said that I will pay the check. Billed me for the entire dinner. When she came back after running my credit card she said, \"Hopefully you're experience next time will be better. Next time please let me know early and I will fix the problem.\" Kind of hard to do when you disappear for a long time after bringing the food. Still debating with myself whether or not I should have tipped, which I did.

As far as my \"experience next time\", won't happen."}
{"text":"Service was friendly. Had the best Ahi Tuna salad there hands down! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with quality and cleanliness.  I'm a landry's member and use my card a lot.  Wrong food brought out,steak not cooked to order and glasses and carafe where dirty."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and their food is consistently good! I always get the club sandwich with a side of potato cakes which are a must try! I will say their sandwich is now made one buttered bread so it is SUPER greasy and not in a good way. The restaurant look could also use an upgrade but those are the only flaws I've seen."}
{"text":"This place may be a chain, not where I'm from. Very much comfort food, that doesn't break the bank. The meatloaf mashed potatoes, vegetable medley was the winner. That garlic bread they give you it might be the best garlic bread I've ever had. Image of your whole craft of water and soda, I wish all restaurants did that. I wish we had these in Michigan."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this Claim Jumper and it was awesome. The restaurant is the nicest CJ I've ever seen. We went in the afternoon on a Saturday around 4 pm and it wasn't busy at all and quiet. Our server Edward was very polite and attentive. We ordered the spinach dip for an appetizer which tasted great. Our main entrees, the Tri Tip Dip and country fried steak were also great and the temps were just right, not too hot or cold. For our first outing here, I don't think it could have gotten any better unless the food was free. Two thumbs up CJ, you did it right."}
{"text":"Ended up here for dinner when we were looking for a night away from the Strip.  About a 25 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 7:30 which seemed to be driven more by staffing limits than empty tables.  But that was OK, I'm from the D and was loving standing outside in shorts and a polo in March without turning blue.  Very extensive menu and fair pricing, so if you are looking for value, this is your place.  However, it was my experience, and certainly that of my colleagues that if you are looking for good food and decent service, this may not be the best choice.  OK, full disclosure, I was dying for something with some heat so I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken Pizza, so go ahead and factor that into my rating.  I mean. it's the Claim Jumper right, not Ruby Foos.  Even so, I've got a (large) iron gut and this made for some questionable moments throughout the night and the next morning.  My buddy had the meatlovers pizza and the same experience so there you have it.  Limited sample set, but you rate what you experience.  Waiter seemed to have a difficulty time keeping up, keeping orders straight and drinks were depleted well before he returned for refills (we had to flag him down).

I am sure they do somethings better, and I would guess they d based on other reviews, but my experience here was less than optimal, even at the price."}
{"text":"Out of town came to mall to have dinner. Shauna was a great server to bad I can't say the same about the manager on duty David Who said my burnt meatloaf was caramelized. I'm sorry but burnt is burnt!!! Shauna tried to make me happy with a cookie dessert that was amazing! She needs a raise went out of her way for me and my family. She is great! 5 stars for her only!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Claim Jumper on December 2. The food was great. Evelyn did a great job. She was very friendly and professional. Great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"love the clam chowder soup in a sour dough bread bowl yummy"}
{"text":"came with my bff and hubby...stingey on the wine but the food was good. we were ALL stuffed!"}
{"text":"WOW! We come here roughly every few months especially to show off Town Square to people that are not from Las Vegas. We usually get excellent service with excellent food. Tonight was just BAD! Not only did the manager feel he needed to argue with us and embarrass us in front of our guest, he had the audacity to say that everything was fine and that we should not have been complaining. Our main course took the better of 20 MINUTES TO COME OUT. When it did, my food was luke warm, and my guests meal was not appropriately cooked (raw steak vs well done). So I return my meal and they said they normally don't do this, but they will take my meal off my ticket. WTF?!?!? And that's about all they offered! We spend at least $100 plus dollars when we go here, each and every time. At least offer to kiss me before screwing me! Bad form Claim Jumper's!"}
{"text":"Well, my faith in Claim Jumpers has restored! We had a group function today, serving our local support team. Our appetizers came out before our meal and we were given adequate time to eat then before the arrival of our entrees. We were served fresh baked bread along with our entrees, which as a very pleasant surprise!
We pretty all ordered the chicken pot pie which came very recommended by colleagues...and it was well deserved. It was very large and extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow, there were a lot of negative reviews but I had a fine experience here.  Service was very good.  Food was good - though I'll emphasize that portions, especially on the combos, are huge!   Easily enough for 2 meals and I'm a pretty big eater.

It seemed busy & popular for a weekday though it was not full - it's quite large, really.

There is a little sewer gas smell in the parking lot.  Someone else had mentioned that but I only noticed it on the way out and it wasn't a big deal. And if I was being really picky, I might say that some of the items were overdone a little for my taste, but everything was decent and I was happy with my meal here."}
{"text":"I'm giving Claim Jumper a 4 out of 5 stars because their food and service is amazing but their Bar is lacking severely. I can't even describe the awful drinks they serve. I think they got their bartender from the local bible college. (joking) But their food is great, and the service is excellent.  Just don't go there expecting to get a good drink with your meal.  It's not going to happen."}
{"text":"So brought my mom here for lunch. The host was outstanding,  it was down hill from there.

My mom had a dinner salad with potato skins. The salad was half mushrooms and the ranch dressing had no flavor at all. I tried it and surely someone could go across the street and buy some Hidden Valley? Her Dr. Pepper didn't even taste like a flat Mr. Pibb so no idea what the drink was.

I had the shrimp Fresca. Which I thought meant fresh? Not so much. The spinach for having been cooked and looking dreadful, was very chewy. The \"parmesan\" crusted shrimp tasted more like shaken 'n bake.

At least the bread was edible. So I don't see us returning anytime soon, next time we're in the area we will just go to The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"It's a Claim Jumper... decent food and good portions. i'd go back"}
{"text":"After visiting last night & finding out corporate had removed so many things from the menu I was really bummed.  But I went ahead & ordered my favorite thing on the menu...the Cashew Chicken Salad Sandwich.  When it arrived, it was HALF the size it normally is.  I soon discovered why!  The wonderful slaw/lettuce mix they had always used & added so much to the sandwich, was now changed to crappy & plain ole lettuce.  I was NOT happy in the least.

Fast forward to lunch today when I took my other half of the sandwich for left overs.  Imagine my shock when I bit down on a chicken BONE!!!  It freakin broke my molar tooth.  Then I found 2 more hard white bone grisle pieces that had been mixed into the Chicken Salad Mixture.  I just sent the Corporate office a nasty gram via email.  I had BETTER hear back from someone.

I do have to say, the waiter (cant remember his name) was really great & explained that corporate just made all these changes to bring Claim Jumper out of the 1980's.  Apparently, Claim Jumper was just purchased by some other corporation & decided to change things.  I will NOT return to the Green Valley Parkway location ever again.  I normally go to the Summerlin location.  I may never return at all.  It is such a shame because Claim Jumper has always been one of my favorite places to eat.

I do have to say, the new onion rings were delicious.  I guess they had been previously frozen like the fried zucchini.  Now they are hand battered & made fresh.  That was the only good change corporate has made.

If it wasn't broke, why fix it???"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Breakfast was delicious and fast service. The muffins were so amazing. Great staff and very clean."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had Thanksgiving dinner here with a friend and then caught a movie at the AMC Theater.  They had a wonderful Thanksgiving menu.  I started with a green salad with Balsamic dressing and the croutons were ridiculous-so good!  Then I had the Turkey with mashed potatoes, stuffing and vegetables and it was too die for.  The desserts were typical apple and pumpkin pie and not that great, but by then I was full anyway!  The apple pie might have been better warm.  I had a glass of Merlot and my bill was 30.00 - well worth it!  It was really nice to walk around Town Center afterwards and look at the lights and the Christmas tree.  I will definitely make a point to come back!"}
{"text":"This was a really good experience. We've always loved CJ's. It was my son's birthday and we had a few friends with us to help us celebrate. They quickly accommodated our large party. Our waitress was very attentive ( no empty cups). Food delay was as expected for our sized group. Everyone enjoyed their dinner. Only talk was how good everything was. My son got his birthday cake. I couldn't ask for a better evening. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Claim Jumper for a long time but this was my first time to this one. Used to live in Seattle and the only complaint I have ever had was that food portions were huge.

This was no different, but my first time for a late Breakfast on New Years Eve . I had the eggs benedict and my husband had pancakes. He got 5 huge fluffy cakes and had to request extra syrup as there wasnt enough for the stack he got. I ate one of his and it was great. 

My benedict was perfect and hash browns were just crispy enough.  I took away a star as I had a side of fruit and was a little disappointed that it was just melon and grapes. Would have liked a little more assortment. 

The service was great and this would be my choice for 24 hour breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"Located across the street from Green Valley Ranch, sort of. OK so you know what you're getting. Fun food served in a gigantic portions. Hey thats what they make those little Styrofoam boxes for, right? So go hungry, leave full and don't count the calories. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"The last time we went to this Claim Jumper, we were interrupted during an intimate conversation by the server, who went into an annoying and lengthy sales pitch about CJ gift cards. Who wants to have to sit through that while trying to have a nice quiet meal?

We overlooked that today and went back, and guess what? The server balked when I ordered fish tacos and asked for the seasoned fries as one of the choices for side. She told us that even though the tacos are listed on the menu under the Sandwiches category, which lists several choices of side dishes that automatically come with the order, the fish tacos aren't included in that option. What? There is NO disclaimer on the menu that says \"...except for the fish tacos.\" Then when I insisted (because the menu specifically SAYS side dishes come with the items on the list, DUH!) she pointed out that rice pilaf comes with the tacos, so would I like to omit the pilaf in favor of the fries? What is she, the Carbohydrate Police? No, I would not like to substitute fries for the pilaf. I want both of them just like the menu indicates. I like both rice and fries, thankyouverymuch. Then she said she'd send the manager over to talk to me. Fine, send him. He arrived, squatted down next to our booth, and proceeded to examine the menu for errors. Nope. The menu is clearly misleading, and I was clearly entitled to the fries with my tacos if I so desired. He left and twenty minutes later our meal was served. Strike number three, the corn tortillas on the fish tacos were so tough that my husband could only eat one of his tacos and I had to discard the tortillas and eat the fish filling with a fork. We brought home leftovers for the dog and cats, meanwhile vowing to NEVER EVER go back to Claim Jumper again. 

Why go to Claim Jumper anyway, when you can just go to the freezer section of your local supermarket and buy CJ products, and save both money and aggravation?"}
{"text":"Portions were massive, the food was great. What made this restaurant experience stand out was Eric, our server. He was fantastic! Really friendly, helpful, funny, and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"All food was food except the Mac and cheese was really watery. Manager came over and apologized but didn't remove from our bill. We took one bite each. Not cool!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here ever since they opened. At the beginning quite a bit, now less and less. The food is getting more and more bland and uninspired. Yesterday we decided to give them another try so we arrive at the hostess booth. She tells us there will be a 20 minute wait. I don't mind waiting if the place is busy but you can clearly see from the entrance that there is almost nobody in there and plenty of empty tables. So I inquired and was told by the hostess that they do not have enough servers. 
I don't think that I should spent my evening waiting for a table because management does not know how to schedule, so we left.
This was the final straw for me and we will avoid this Claim Jumper location entirely from here on out."}
{"text":"I love claim jumper!  This location is set in nice area at town square.  The food was good as usual.  They give free baby plates so my 1 year old had apple sauce, cheese, turkey and tangerine pieces.  I'll try a steak next time and update the review.  All about the steak!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it sux. If you want to stuff your face with HUGE amounts of food without much care this is for you. But you care even a lil' you might want to scoot clear of it."}
{"text":"My review is mostly based on the service we got from Drew. 

We called ahead to let them know we had a large party and would have 13 guests.

Well we were in town for the Automatic Body homecoming so word got out that Claim Jumpers was the place for dinner.

Our dinner party ending up growing to not only need the large table setup for our group but other booths in the surrounding area.

Drew was very attentive and was able to get drinks and food out in a timely manner. 

You wouldn't have known we were in a large party.

Almost everyone was pleased with their food.

We had one steak that wasn't cooked correctly. As soon as Drew came around and saw the steak he says that isn't right and immediately had the cook prepare another one. 

They had a replacement steak out in about 12 minutes. Was told it was amazing.

Overall Claim Jumpers pulled off a great dinner for such a large group.

Drew did a great job giving out separate tabs and getting them all accurate."}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Chicken Cobb sandwich and it was amazing! Did it was no blue cheese, got ranch instead and it was great substitute. Service was super quick and friendly! 

Great place for larger parties and tons of food selection for everyone!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for 5 star service, ask for \"Eric\" who also tends bar.  While all the staff do good service, Eric is the best of the bunch.    It you can, it's worth waiting for a table served by \"Eric\".

Also, the best value is the Tri-Tip roast.  For the price ($15) you get a great value with lots of meat and veggies.  You can get a small \"Micro\" salad on the side.

Want to save a few $$$ on an appetizer?  Grab some free popcorn from the Bar's popcorn machine.  Get a basket or two at no cost and it's a great starter.  If they are out of popcorn, tell \"TY\" the manger and he should make you a fresh batch.

So remember kits, Eric is your best server choice.  Get some free popcorn and hit up the Tri-Tip roast for a great value."}
{"text":"We usually go to a different location and we love the food. We were on this side of town and thought we would try it. There were 2 hosts. One was on the phone and the other was on the computer doing something more important than seating us. After waiting almost 45 minutes for our food we had to take it to go, I did not plan to be there 3 hours. Bummer!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and really liked it. it was much better then I thought it was going to be. I had the chicken pot pie and it was to nice and creamy teased as if my grandma just took it out of her over. the piece of chicken were big. Good veritedy of vegys. good place I'm looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Recently rebuilt.  Nice comfortable layout, great service, excellent food, good prices.  Really nice addition to the Nugget."}
{"text":"What in the heck happened to Claim Jumper???  I haven't been there in a couple of years but I remember it being very good.  Went there on Saturday and ordered the 12 oz ribeye for $23.00.  It was so small and thin that It resembled more of a sausage patty.  It tasted ok, but my God!!!  $23.00 for that!!!   And my friend sent back her Chinese Chicken salad because the chicken was so dry you could choke on it and the dressing was pure sugar.  The only saving grace were the appetizers.  I will only go back for the southwest eggrolls, nothing else."}
{"text":"One of the best places in all of las vegas to eat. a little pr icy for everyday eating but well worth it. There is always a 15-30 minute wait to get in BUT it's worth it. The place is very stylish & comfy with LOTS of HIGH back booths. The Bread they bring is delicious. When you read over the MENU you will notice everything is offered in 1/2 and full sizes. The reason is 1/2 is ENOUGH for any grown man. FULL is just ridiculous. You can feed 3! We started with the bread & ordered some Taquito Shrimp since the table ext to us had & they looked great. They were very tasty-a little like a shrimp Rumaki w/soft crispy shell!! Yummy!

For dinner we had the Chicken Fried Steak-FULL which was thin & crispy with smooth & creamy gravy,the RED mashed potatoes were very garlicky, the veggies were crisp & fresh-cooked al dente.

The Ribs were so tender when you picked it up it ALL fell off the bone. VERY smoky & Rich in BBQ flavor. The beans & cornbread were perfect TOO.

The spaghetti & Meatballs was HUGE. The Meatballs were the size of an apple and very tender & seasoned perfectly. The marinara would be good on anything.

After we packed our to-go boxes we decided we had to try the MOTHER LODE-we have been buying this item in the freezer section for years now & it's $9.99 FRESH TOO!!

You could feel your ass fatten & your teeth start to ROT as you savored every sweet HOT chocolaty bite!

If you are looking to treat someone to an UNFORGETTABLE meal. Go to Claim Jumper's in Henderson or Summerlin. stay \"OFF the STRIP\""}
{"text":"I was gonna give it a 2 star because of our waiter! \"Lexi\" we get a chance to get out enjoy lunch with our oldest to treat her- we are full time caregivers and was just looking to enjoy a nice meal before clients and our other 2 girls come home from school. Our waitress must of been very distracted so we didn't get a refill on WATER and we specified \"NO LEMON\" - yet to our surprise \"we got Lemons\"we ordered our food and asked that we also have our dessert at the same time! Yup didn't happened then our waiter took so long to come back that I had to ask another waiter who was very nice and was able to get the attention of our waitress and let her know \"all they want is their check, no dessert\" the Manager is really nice he did take the dessert off our bill! And apologized! Which was really nice of him and along with packaging our dessert to go really nice to take home and enjoy

-Food was awesome!!! Restraraunt was nice and everyone else was very helpful! Thank you so much!!!

-if you eat here hope you get a better waitress then we did, and if you get \"LEXI\" order everything ahead so you won't have to wait over 10 minutes for dessert! And if your running low on water ask for a pitcher so you can refill your own water!

-Manager was really nice
-waiter who helped us(sorry i should of gotten her name)"}
{"text":"Not impressed with their food at all. Lunch menu was worded awkwardly. Service was ok but won't pay to go here again."}
{"text":"The first time we ate a Claim Jumpers we loved it. Great food and service in the dinning room was awesome, however it's been down hill ever since. We use to go about 2-3 time a week for happy hour but stopped because the service was so horrible. The bartenders are so unfriendly and the staff in the bar area are rude. It's been about a month since we have been back and we decided to give it another chance today. Walk into the bar area for happy hour and there is a bartender and a server and only 2 people sitting in the whole area .... And it still took them over 5 minutes to come over and give us menus. When the server (Taylor) finally did come over all she said is what do you want to drink..... I'm in the service industry, if my manager EVER heard me great a table like that I would be written up immediately not to mention it's just rude. We got a couple of drinks and appetizers. Once she brought out the food the was the last time we saw her for over 15 minutes, we needed boxes and we're ready to go and her and the bartender were just standing there on their phones talking. I had to get up from the table and walk over to ask her to come to the table because we needed to leave. I love the food here, and we have always had pretty good service in the dining area but the girls that work at the bar are HORRIBLE and insanely rude. Don't think we will be going to CJ ever again."}
{"text":"Three words: Lemon Bar Brulee

A few more words: Red Velvet Cupcake with Bourbon Chocolate Sauce

For the most part, if you've been to one CJ, you've been to them all.  The only exception I know is the ones in the Seattle area have a \"Produce Bar\" for about $10-$12 which is the mother of all salad bars as far as regular non-buffet restaurants go.

The portions are gargantuan and I often find solace in the half portions where available and the appetizer salad and soup combo which is still a big portion but is a little easier on the purse.  The food is always good, home-style fare and I've never had a problem with service.  The bar area is nice and has many TVs strategically placed for the avid sports fan.  You really have to stake it out when it's busy and be prepared to steal tables from people.  They don't seat you in the bar, so every spot is up for the taking.

The desserts are really where it is at for me.  They smartened up and now have two dessert sections: individual desserts and desserts to share.  This is a plus b/c so many of their menu items could feed a small family, so now you can order appropriately.  My soon-to-be mother-in-law ordered the eclair once and luckily the waitress told her it was big enough for everyone at the table.  That would have been a very big eclair for a very little lady.  Anyway...  The red velvet cupcake with chocolate bourbon sauce is a fantastic individual dessert.  My all-time favorite is the lemon bar brulee which consists of a shortbread crust, layer of cheesecake, layer of lemon bar, bruleed on the top and served with whipped cream and raspberry sauce.  It's on the desserts to share list, but I get it for myself and enjoy it for a day or two.  I encourage you to do the same."}
{"text":"Review update....food still is a good solid decent but i have to give them an extra star for the service. one member of our party had food allergies. our server was very patient to work through a selection. he made a couple trips to the kitchen to confirm with the chef(s) what they could do. dont get me wrong he was very knowledgable of the menu but with food allergies you cant be too careful. a very important thing he did was to not make us feel like a burden because our order process was a little more involved. thanks brandon, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a change from the usually fast food family pit-stop.  

Pleasantly surprised by the service, our waiter was very attentive but not annoying.  He also tried to help out another waiter's table (a particularly difficult customer at another table was flagging down anyone who walked by).  

It's a chain, but the menu is good and there's a kid's menu that will accomodate a picky eater."}
{"text":"If you come to claim jumper you must ask for Robert, he was the nicest server I think I've ever had. Not only was he so friendly but so attentive, helpful and just pleasant."}
{"text":"This place came to my rescue twice while visiting Town Square. While I had planned to dine at Brio before a movie the wait time was about 75 minutes. That was beyond ridiculous for a quick dinner before a movie so my date and I ventured over to Claim Jumper (twice in one week). 

Service was great. Amber was eager to assist us and made sure we were taken care of before we could make any request.

My date and I were craving something warm on a chilly evening. She got a Sourdough Clam Chowder bowl (8.99) and I got a Chicken Pot Pie (12.99). The servings were huge. They were so huge we ended up missing our movie because we were so stuffed! After the bread bowls, a CJ Punch, and a Coke we walked out with our wallets $31.21 lighter and so full from dinner we couldn't fathom sitting through a two hour movie."}
{"text":"I went to Claim Jumper for the first time last night after work. My girlfriends were finishing up at happy hour (I missed it by 10 min!) and I stopped by for a drink and a small bite to eat.  

We had a female bartender who was VERY friendly! She had a unique name which I wish I remembered... 5 stars for her. I got a chicken quesadilla and a glass of the house Chardonnay. The quesadilla came out quickly which was awesome but the taste was below average. My bill for the quesadilla and Chardonnay ended up being $20. I think for $20 I can go elsewhere and get a more satisfying dish and drink. 

If I come back, I'd like to come back for happy hour where drinks and food are most likely cheaper. I'd also try a different item on their menu."}
{"text":"While in Vegas I was surprised to come across a Claim Jumper's while looking for some grub.  They pretty much closed the majority in SoCal except a few.

The menu has changed.  They used to have quite an extensive menu but it's now been trimmed down although they still have the usual favorites (meatloaf, the motherload).  I went with a sirloin steak during my visit, nothing spectacular but good none the less.  

Service was good and the outdoor mall is a very nice location."}
{"text":"My favorite Happy Hour by far!!! Their $2-$7 from 3p-7p EVERYDAY is to die for & there are so many options it's easy to switch it up each time I come here. This has become a place for me & my mother to enjoy time together while she is in town. My personal faves are the Tri-Tip Sliders, Fried Zucchini sticks & the BBQ chicken Pizza. You can definitely come here with $20 & get full real easily. This is a place I definitely plan on coming back to & spreading the word about their awesome food deals"}
{"text":"The food was good.

My husband had the Jumbalaya Pasta and he said it was really good. The sausage could have been more spicy but my husband really loves his food spicy. There were 5 shrimp, nice sized and not over cooked.  He also had a cup of the Steak Chili as his starter

He enjoyed that chili and told me that the next time he wants to have the stuffed baked potato with the Steak Chili.  So it must have been good!

My mother and I had both had a cup of their Clam Chowder, which is still yummy as on our previous visits

We had the Club House Sandwich.  I really liked that garlic aioli, however my mother thought it was strong.  Keep in mind that my mother is 82 yrs young and her taste buds have been changing as she's gotten a little older.

We both loved those shoe string fries

The only time we get to eat at Claim Jumpers is when we're on vacation in Las Vegas.  We normally go to the one located on Charleston, on our way back from Redrock but since we were at the Golden Nugget we decided to eat at this Claim Jumper

We had a late lunch so it was not crowded at all.

This is were my biggest complaint comes in:  The service was horrible!!!

My husband asked for iced tea, the server said that they only had Tropical Iced Tea.  My husband asked what was in it.
The response:  I don't know, just order it

I was about to say something but my husband squeezed my hand to signal me to bite my tongue. 

He did go ahead and order it and he said it was ok.

We got our soup and our server advised us that we would have a different server going forward.

Our food came but we were still eating the soup.  So the new server had to move things around to put the plates on the table.

My mother had hot tea and she had asked for more hot water.  

My husband asked for hot sauce

Server said he would bring it right over.  

He was helping other tables, going back and forth, so we waited.  

I noticed a bottle of hot sauce on an empty table nearby so I got it for my husband

We had finished eating and there was still no hot water

So I got up and walked all the way in the back and asked for the hot water

They acted so offended that I came to get the hot water.  I told them just give me the hot water.  A different server refused to give it to me and insisted that the hot water would be brought to us.  

I didn't think it was a problem to go get it but they made it seemed like I committed a felony.  So this really made me irritated.

Our server brought over the hot water a few minutes later

He then had the nerve to grumble to my mother about the food left on her plate.  I told my mom to ignore him because I could tell by her expression that she felt bad.  She ate half of her food and for us that is a good thing.

At this point, my husband got upset so he left only a $3.00 on $69.00 tab

Having worked in food service my husband normally tips 20% but this guy was just straight up rude.

We will eat at Claim Jumper again but not at the one in Golden Nugget

We will go back to the one on Charleston since we've always had great service from them!

Food = 5 Stars

Service = 1 Star

Average 3 Star"}
{"text":"Ok Claim Jumper is my new favorite restaurant!! They just comped our whole anniversary dinner (like $81 bucks) because we had a couple of issues. Tasha ordered a Hawaii Tai and it had a piece of Glass (we think it came from the rum bottle so they told us) in it (she did not cut herself). Then we thought ok free drinks, discount on food maybe? We weren't mad, we just didn't want anything else with ice in it. So they brought out this bomb red wine with a slightly obscene French name (menage a something) 

Then when Tasha's Surf and Turf came out my mashed potatoes were ice cold because Tasha's meal took longer to cook. They apologized profusely, brought me new sides, a red velvet happy anniversary cupcakes, and a huge slice of six layer chocolate cake and extra garlic Texas cheese toast comped the whole meal gave Happy Anniversary wishes and begged us to come back again so they can make things perfect. Best service & recovery I have experienced in years (like 7). I was not expecting all of that! 

All and all when they fixed our issues the food was amazing and the service and the recovery more than made up for our two, \"Uhhh what's this?\" moments. I will be back again. Thanks guys for making our 9 year anniversary memorable in an awesome way because this could have played out very, very differently. Not the perfect experience, but the absolute perfect effort."}
{"text":"Reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the host/hostess didnt even acknowledge we were there I was literally standing in front of them at their podium and said hi about 3 times until a waiter walked by and asked if anyone has helped us and all four all of sudden noticed we were there and we were the only one at the entrance... but our service with our waiter Rita was Amazing she was so kind and helped us pick the best they had one the menu!!! Food was great they serve BIG portions so be careful our apps filled us right up we got fried zucchini and it fed 3 of us then they bring your side dish next and last we could barely finish our main course!!!!"}
{"text":"In the years past, my family has given my husband and I gift cards to Claim Jumper for anniversary gifts, Christmas, birthdays, etc. They knew how much we LOVED this restaurant. (Notice the past tense for 'love.') We went to eat there tonight to celebrate our anniversary, and it was a complete shock. CJ used to be one of our favorite restaurants. Tonight, we experienced mediocre, overpriced food and SLOOOW service. Don't get me wrong, our waitress was really nice...just probably very busy with the other 2 tables she had in her area. The restaurant was barely full (there usually was a gaggle of people on a waiting list eager to eat there), and there was a lot of staff members standing around idle. I don't know if they are under new management, but the menu has changed, and quality of food is sub-par, and the service was slow. Needless to say, the word has been spread amongst my family NOT to get us anymore giftcards to CJ."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant because the location is convenient for me. The food is really good and comes in big portions. They also have a catering menu. They manager, Ed, is very helpful and friendly. My last visit, however, I was disappointed.  The young lady who helped me with my catering order, was not very helpful. She said that they ran out of paper plates and when I asked her how will my guests eat the salad, she just shrugged and said that they don't have paper plates.  I had to ask for to go boxes as an option.  When I got back to the office with our lunch, she did not put the dressing for the salad.  The service was very disappointing but the food as always is delish. I'll probably go there again but will request for a different server and not that lady. Total disappointment this time around!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in with friends to enjoy a meal... hadn't been to a Claim Jumpers in about 15 years and really wanted to try it again.  What I recall from way back were the amazing way they prepared and plated their food, especially the salads.  This visit fell short of that, but was still decent.  The salad was boring, as it was a small portion 'tossed' onto a larger plate and the dressing wasn't too exciting.  But the garlic cheese bread was tasty, as were the beef ribs and the mac & cheese was really nice.

The restroom needed to be cleaned and was in somewhat disrepair.  Seemed they might have been having an issue with their AC as well as the had hi-powered squirrel fans in the bar area blowing air around.

Service was very friendly and good.  Seems almost like this place has gone the same route as many other \"casual chain\" restaurants."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with some business associates and it was pretty good. I had a bowl of clam chowder and my colleagues had sandwiches. All of us like them. 

The place was very clean and the staff was cheery. 

It is a typical corporate restaraunt menu, but had a lot of choices. 

It was pretty inexpensive as three of us are on $40 with tip. It's a good place to take the family, but won't break the bank."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We were having dinner before a show at the Golden Nugget.  I decided to have their \"roasted tri-tip.\"  What a mistake that was.  The meat was so awful and \"chewy\" that I was unable to swallow it and had to (literally) spit it out of my mouth to prevent choking on it.  The waitstaff did remove the plate and brought me something else.  But, of course, by the time I received my food my companion was finished with his entree.  They did take the tri-tip off the bill and charged me for my  replacement dinner.  We thought that it would have been more thoughtful and more professional for a manager to acknowledge what happened.  In fact, it would have been nice to have been offered a salad or appetizer while we waited or, perhaps, a complimentary dessert.  But this is Las Vegas.  Perhaps the thought is that there are always new customers.  We are locals and frequent many eateries in town, but we will never again go to the Claim Jumper.  Bad food--bad experience."}
{"text":"We used to come to Claim Jumper a lot, but stopped because most of the food is just too rich.  But this time I was here with a group of friends for Happy Hour, and it was a great experience.  The bar is a really cozy and rustic spot, and our table was right in front of the fireplace, which kept me nice and toasty.  Contrast that with all the other restaurants in town that blast the air conditioning when the temp is 45 degrees outside and you have to sit bundled up while you eat.  Kudos for that!

None of us was very hungry, so the HH menu fit the bill perfectly.  I ordered a Long Island Iced tea, and when the waiter brought it, I thought \"uh-oh.\"  It was as pale as could be and looked like a glass of water.  But when I tasted it I was shocked at how strong - and good - it was, and for 4 bucks!

I shared chicken Street Tacos with one friend.  They were really small; the chicken was a bit dry, but with the stuff they put on top of it, it was really fine, and for $3, I really can't complain.  I tasted my friend's ceviche, and it was delicious.  I also shared Calamari with another friend.  They were really good, and not drowning in breading, but they were so tender I wonder if they were really calamari?  A very small portion, but again, HH prices.  Also shared a black bean hummus with chips for $2, and that was the only thing that was absolutely skipable.  Too bad it wasn't just ordinary hummus.

One of our group ordered just a drink and didn't eat anything, so our bill was very small.  Despite that, the server was terrific, and never once hinted that we weren't worth his time.  I think his name was Niles, and he was a gem.  We left a very nice tip to make up for our paltry bill.  And we vowed that our next Happy Hour will be right back at Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza and after 30 minutes they said they gave the pizza to someone accidentally. Then another 20 minutes and they brought a mooshy pizza which was disgusting. I couldnt eat any part of it.

Terrible food and terrible service.
All other options my friends ordered was all greasy and poor taste. No one was happy."}
{"text":"Have a huge appetite? Well my friend I have found you the holy grail. 
Claim Jumper is a varied menu, and from what I can tell everything is yummy and ginormous! Why are the portions all big enough to share? I really don't know! But if you or someone you know tends to leave restaurants hungry bring them here!

I would recommend:
Appetizer: Big Soft Pretzel
Entree: Meatball Sub
Dessert: Chocolate Cake

Keep in mind I never ate these at the same time, that would be physically impossible for my stomach!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to dinner a week ago and I accidentally left my wallet at the restaurant. I'm not really sure what happen but never notice it when we left the restaurant and after we hangout at Town Square by the park area until around 1:00 am. When we are ready to go home, that's when I noticed that my wallet is missing. We try to look around our area but it's not there so all of us are convinced that it must at the restaurant since that's the only place we went aside from the park and that's the last time I saw my wallet. We went back to the restaurant but it's already close. As we walking toward our car, I noticed that I have a message on my phone. I retrieved the message and there it is, the message are from Claim Jumper saying that they found my wallet and they put it on the safe and to call them. What a relief!!!! At this time all I care is my ID and credit cards. I don't really care about the cash (around $190.00). I guess having their reward program pays off, that's the reason why they found my contact information easily. Since they already close that night so I went the following day and what a surprise! Everything is there, including the cash and not even a penny missing.  The people in this restaurant are very honest and we actually have a good time that night because our waiter, Peter, is so nice and very attentive to our needs. He recommends a drinks and dishes for us to try and we love everything he did recommends.  I love this place and all their other restaurants (that's why I have their rewards program) and for what happen, I'll be their customer for life. Thank you Claim Jumper at Town Square Las Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other night with my husband and some of his colleagues. While I was looking over the menu I noticed some of the ladies at the table were only going to order dessert. I already knew what their plan was..order a humongous dessert take three bites and say they are too full to finish. This is just what some girls do...but not me. I didn't want the table to think I was pig. I mulled it over in my mind for about a second... than I thought.. who was I fooling my husband already knows I like to eat. It's no secret even when we were dating I didn't hide that fact ..he may think something is wrong with me if I don't eat! I then placed my order for my appetizer a cup of Potato Cheese Soup and my main entree The Whiskey Apple Glazed Chicken. The soup was nice and creamy with bits of potatoes in it and tiny bacon strips on the top. It was really hearty and oh so good! The Whiskey Chicken was served with this sweet whiskey apple sauce and served over apple sourdough herb stuffing, with red-skin mashed potatoes, and roasted vegetables on the side. The melody of flavors went really well together. It reminded me of a dish you would have for Thanksgiving or Christmas. This entree also comes with the Cheesy Garlic Toast which is my favorite. They are usually served with marinara sauce if you get it as an appetizer. Since this came with my meal there was no sauce but the taste could definitely stand by itself. The portions here are really big..I got the lighter portion for 11.95 and still could not finish it. I had to take the other half home!"}
{"text":"I ordered a combo which included tri tips and baby bacb ribs. The homemade bread was good but the tri tips were not even chewable and had a bad flavor. Ribs were okay. Cold baked potatoe."}
{"text":"First time here. Last time here. My son received a coupon for this place from his elementary school for achieving honor roll (free kids meal with purchase of entree). After receiving our drinks and before ordering our food I presented the coupon to the server. Not three minutes after ordering our food my entree was brought out. Before the salads. After about 15 minutes and several times of the server passing by and saying that my husband's food and my 2 kids' food is on it's way out as well, my husband asked her if my food had maybe been from someone else's order, to which she denied. I called bullshit. My husband called bullshit. There is no way that my salmon entree could have been cooked in that short amount of time. We decided to leave, canceled the food, and requested the check for our drinks. Beyond gross trying to reserve food. I should call the health department."}
{"text":"Super sized offerings (and prices) does not a good restaurant make!

My daughter, Kathy, and her beau Keith took me out yesterday to Claim Jumper on Apache Road... I had never been to one of these, even though I had lived in Las Vegas and the Phoenix area the last decade or so.

What we had...
I had the Grilled Liver, Bacon and Onions - A huge plate of Liver with an equally ungodly amount of Onions with a side Biscuit that was the consistency of a BRICK! If you closed your eyes... the Bacon tasted like NOTHING!

Keith had Sliders (Mini Cheeseburgers)... I got to try a couple of these little guys... and no flavor whatsoever despite the warnings of extra-sharp cheese on the menu. Keith also had a bowl of New England Claim Chowder before the meal... he told me not to order it next time.

Kathy had the Snow Crab and Chive Quiche with a Small Green Salad - I got to try the quiche later... again no flavor! It looked as appetizing as heck, though. HUGE dish!

For Dessert... the Brownie Finale... another HUGE dessert! Probably tasted the best... because of all the SUGAR! 

Even their cups of Coffee were HUGE!

In summary... I would not mind the high prices if the food had any kind of flavor... but unfortunately they didn't!

Update from my Chef son, Kevin...
He said to order the Soups... they're especially good from what he said!"}
{"text":"I forget about this place but I came here after a movie with my 2 boys...one of which is allergic to gluten.  They have a great gluten free menu, not to mention just a great kids menu altogether.  My son loves ribs and most places have the 3-5 usual staples for kids menu...but not this place.  Also the food is great here and very filling (all portions are just huge).  I ordered the chicken pot pie and a side salad.  Both of these were just awesome.  The service is fantastic here and the atmosphere is super clean and upscale casual.  It is great for groups since they can handle the business and have many HUGE tables.  The deserts are also HUGE but since I never leave this place hungry it is hard to order a desert here."}
{"text":"You know it's one thing to have just one bad day of service but to come back months later and receive the same issues is beyond what I can stand. Why is it so hard to bring out food that is at temperature? Isn't that what a restaurant does? Is it do much to ask for a table without crumbs and water residue? And just so you know for further reference if a customer asks if a item contains onions it may be a big deal as in they are ALLERGIC! I sincerely did not want to come back to this establishment but was convinced by my significant other the service could not be as bad as our first visit. But low and behold it was worse! You may want to realize you are in a prime part of town with really decent other options for food as for me and my family I assure you that without correspondence from someone trying to remedy these two awful visits I will never waste money here again."}
{"text":"Just had Breakfast, and the food was great. Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar was amazing."}
{"text":"just left there w dad n his friend. Restaurant was not crowded and took an hour for our food. Dad got steak and shrimp and the excuse for taking so long was the baby steak. A steak that small does not take that long to cook. Very disappointed. This location has only been open a couple of weeks. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"so I finally decided to give another whirl at CJ's on Fort Apache after receiving a $25 gift card.  Nope.  Won't be back.  It's such a shame that the food and service has just gone completely downhill."}
{"text":"this review is not for the food as I have never been to this location but it is for Justin, the manager who reached out to me twice re: a not so good review I left for the Summerlin location.  He is top notch grade A.  Great customer service, many apologies for my not so great experience at a completely differently location and I will make sure on my next visit to Fremont I will visit the Golden Nugget location just to say hello.  All managers should be as hospitable as he is.  Thx for all of your help!!!"}
{"text":"Never been here. My fiance ordered me a crispy chicken entree salad to go since he went to dinner here with his family tonight.

He said it was great and his server was really nice.

Unfortunately they get a 2 from me.

The salad I got was $13.00, $16.00 in the end because I added avacado.

Open the box, no chicken.

Paid $16 for lettuce, vegetables, and tomatoes. Really really uncool guys."}
{"text":"First off, server Donny was amazing 5 stars++. The food however, was blah except for the super yummy pub pretzel. If we return it will be Donny's service and apps only."}
{"text":"Experience:  I came with some friends for lunch.  I have always wanted to try this place, because I pass the one on Sahara all the time. Parking sucks...but it is Town Square. LOL! 

Food:  This is one of those places that is very difficult to narrow your order because the menu is big and full of a lot of American favorites. 
The serve this delicious garlicky bread on the table that I had to taste, and regretted as it took up my main entree room. It was good though.  
I settled on the fish tacos with the pico on the side.   I got mine fried...but you can order grilled instead. It was good. They were crispy and on traditional corn tortillas with a good, creamy chipotle sauce on top. They had salsa on the side that I used instead of the pico and it was good. It came with a side of pilaf that was tasty too. 
I ordered a cream cheese pumpkin slice of pie to go, because who can pass up pumpkin this time of year. My friend tasted it and said it was very good...even sinful.  Can't wait to eat it later!

Service:  We had a cutie, young waiter with a very deep voice named Tom. He was friendly and helpful. 

Facility:  this place was nicely decorated and had a warm feel. The chairs we pretty comfortable with cushion on the wood and high backs. 

Overall review:  it was a little pricey, but the lunch menu wasn't too bad. I liked everything about my experience except for the price. So, I would give them a 4 overall."}
{"text":"I had the Fish-N-Chips for dinner. I was very underwhelmed with the flavor of the dish. It was obvious to me that the fish was fried frozen because it taste dry like cardboard, there was no texture to the fish and it was very flavorless. This result happens when you fry frozen product. It is disappointing to pay $16 for frozen fish and fries. 

Two people in my party ordered fish and chips and it was evident that they only had enough fish for one plate but instead they split one portion of fish onto two plates. Right when the waitress delivered the plates to the table, she said \"oh it looks like they forgot the rest of your fish\" as if it was scripted. 10 min later she returned with the rest of our 2 orders of fish. That was cheap!

We went here for a family dinner so several dishes were ordered. I was pleased with the seafood crab cake appetizer. The crabcake taste a little bit like stuffing but the seafood was definitely fresh and the sauces that engulfed the crabcake were tasty.  The appetizer sampler was tasty as well. The eggrolls with their dipping sauces were delicious, the spinach artichoke dip taste like it was made with fresh artichokes which is nice and the fried squash is a fun addition to an appetizer sampler as well.

I don't know if it was because it was the end of the night, and the cook was tired of making food, but two of our items were messed up... well actually shorted. The appetizer sampler did not come out with the items on it that were listed and we had to bring it to their attention. There were no eggrolls on our plate.... That was supposed to be the featured item on the sampler."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the customer service is always great. The food is large portions however, most of the dishes I only love a few of the items including the chicken pot pie, chocolate cake and red velvet cupcake. The happy hour menu during football games it is a pretty good value especially the widow maker burger for five dollars."}
{"text":"Came at 345pm on a Sunday and it took over 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us despite a few hand waves for help only be told our server wasn't here yet... then another 12 minutes to get our drinks (water and soda which they got wrong) and a total of 45 mins to get our food which also was not correct.  The server Luis that helped us out was nice which was the only redeeming quality.  Came here expecting the consistency we expected and definitely didn't get it."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Claim Jumper in close to 10 years!  I've been wanting to go back, but haven't had the opportunity.  I went there Friday for lunch....had the Widow Maker burger.  It was huge!  I opted for the Spicy Thai Peanut Slaw for a side.  Both were delicious.  Our server, Anthony, was great, and we didn't have to ask for anything.  The manager stopped by our table 3 times to ask how things were.  This is the Claim Jumper I remember.  I was only disappointed by one thing......on the dinner menu, I used to get a Ribeye and lobster, and now I don't see lobster on the menu.  I guess I'll live!  I'll just have to get the shrimp.  I'll definitely make it a point to return soon."}
{"text":"A friend has been telling me to come here for years. So I did.
     My wife and I came for Veterans Day. The staff was very friendly and fast.
     My wife and I had a hard time choosing so we opted for the Cheese Burger, since it had been awhile since I'd had one.
It was very, very good with 2 exceptions. They could have drained some of the oil before putting it on the bun. And they need a better bun. They jumped on the Brioche Bun craze and it's wrong. It's a good bun for a sandwich. But every bit was annoying with the burger constantly being push out as we both tried to bit the bun. I like a softer bun that keeps everything in place as you eat.
     The best part of the meal and an item we will ask for again is the Spicy Thia Peanut Slaw. It's fantastic.
     We had a difficult time avoiding the 7 Layer Chocolate Cake. It was huge. Next time.
     If you can, give them a try. I never heard of someone coming away disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Comfortable environment. Ask for Mary to be your server...she is real good. Also, the Manager Austin was very thorough in asking each table how everything was. I eat here often for quick work lunches. I'd only add that the serving sizes are big, so split the plate."}
{"text":"The wait was horrendous and when my husband asked why other parties who came in after us without reservations were being seated, the hostess was rude and said, \"You were quoted 30-45 minutes.  It's been 23, so wait until it's been at least your quoted time.\"

Wow, that was so rude.  It took forever to get a waiter to take our drink order once we were seated.  Then he didn't check on us after delivering our meal.  My lobster was overcooked and I had to get up to find someone to take it back to the kitchen.  Won't go back there again.  EVER."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is always a great go-to place when you aren't sure where to eat. There are many delicious things on the menu and they have a pretty good happy hour. I really enjoy the tri-tip with vegetables. This past time, I ordered the mashed potatoes and gravy with it as well, but it wasn't very good. Every time I am go in, they seem to be busy which is always a good sign!"}
{"text":"We want to thank Michael, manager, and the staff at the Claim Jumper in Green Valley Pkwy for allowing us to host Ted's 70th Birthday Celebration at this location. Your team was awesome and superb!!!

I celebrated my husband's 70th birthday at this Claim Jumper last night and the service was spectacular.  We had a variety of ages: children, young adult middle age and the older folks. The seating arrangement for the kids was superb. There was lots of space for socialization. The placement for the  birthday celebrant was lovely and perfect. 

Michael the manager gave us the best, cordial and service oriented crew. There wasn't anything they couldn't do to accommodate my guests. They allowed me to bring two cakes, they put them it in their refrigerator until serving time, then cut it in even pieces ready to serve.  

We never had to give them any instructions, they knew exactly what to do. 
At the end of 4 hours (which we didn't even feel), Everyone left happy and complimenting us for the awesome party the family had ever had in a while. 

I look forward to eating many more meal there in the future. 
Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a step up from Denny's. 
Nothing interesting or exciting. We dined here for dinner. 13.00 for chicken tenders and shoe string fries. I'm not sure what the draw is here. Comfort food???  My husband ordered a chicken and mushroom dish with mash potatoes and asparagus. The food was very salty. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The audience was good the food was good they have a big menu you can get almost anything that your heart desires from A to B from state to shrimp to salad whatever you want you can get it there and if you ask for it blacken it's even better. You can get any type of drink that you want made whether it's a beer or shot or mixed drink"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour experience. We came on a Thursday at 3pm. There was no wait at all, the bar was pretty much empty. Our food did not take long at all. I suggest the coconut shrimp!! Our server, Alanna took good care of us. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I came in about hour before closing time to Claim Jumper. 
All I truly wanted after a day of mall shopping was good customer service and I received it. 
Artichoke appetizer came out cold, Bam. Server took it back, fixed it. 
Took it off my bill as well. This guy got everything we needed, when we wanted it and I just loved it. 
I highly recommend Danny as the server to request, and yes I left him a close to 50% tip. Excellent service. I called up to tell his manager as I wrote my review."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely surprised... I wasn't expecting much in the food quality, but this went a lot farther.

First. It's freezing in here. My clam chowder was scorching hot when it got to me, and cold a few minutes afterwards. 

They also forgot my friends appetizer, and my other friend entree. We were halfway through our entrees when our friend finally got her appetizer, and by the time we were finished our other friend finally got her entree. In return she got a complimentary cup of what tasted like, canned clam chowder.... yay.

I was surprised at the price of this place based on the quality of the food and service. 

This place is so much nicer as an ambiance than it is of an actual establishment. 

It's too bad that the server is super nice because his personality is much better suited at a better establishment.y"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around..

A bunch of us went and I ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. Thought it might be good.  It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning \"Do you guys want A-1?\"  I said \"No thanks.\"  A good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..

We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.  

Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good. 

Id go back, but Im not the fan i used to be of this place."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, and last night was with a group of 13.  We called RIGHT before we were all going over there, and they were ready with a table as soon as we got there.  Apparently half my group knows the manager Maris, and this lady took great care of us.  The service was very good to handle 13 people; our waiter came by to refill drinks and everyone seemed to need something on the side and he still brought requested items back in a timely fashion.
Here is the clinker...when I was ordering, the waiter told me I ordered one of the healthiest dishes on the menu (not true..haha).  I know these chain restaurants are notorious for bad-for-you food, but until the person next to me found nutritional information on the table, I was in the dark.  
*Bravo to Claim Jumper for publishing the nutritional information for every menu item and putting it on the table.  This is great for diabetics, etc and is actually quite impressive.
*It is my psychological problem that I felt the need to look at it once I knew it was there, and learned that 99% of the menu items had more than any human's (besides sumo wrestlers or Michael Phelps) caloric intake, 600 times the sodium intake, etc.  I was frightened when I saw my order's nutrition so I just ate half and then walked for hours after at the District, and am eating a lean cuisine right now.
*Like everyone else said, the menu is huge with lots of choices, but the food is nothing spectacular.
*The mango iced tea is unsweetened and yummy.
*MAJOR bravo for the vegetarian menu.  Most of my group eats vegetarian out and even as regulars, did not know about this.  You have to ask for it but there are tons of veggie options!
*summary: good service, average food, nice ambiance, kudos for published albeit scary nutritional info, brownie points for veggie menu

UPDATE 11/18/09: Tilapia Veracruz is awesome.  I never usually eat tilapia but this is zesty, rich in flavor, and has avocado! mmm!"}
{"text":"I come here specifically for there filet mignon and also that it is close to my side of town versus the far better tasting claim jumper in townsquare (in my opinion the claim jumper in town square has much better cooked food) why is that? It's probably because townsquare businesses have to pay much more to be established in townsquare brand. Ok now let's get to the food at this location. Sometimes it is hit or miss but great if you have a lundry's reward card and want a quick casual meal to rank up points but save your points to splurge at the town square claim jumper or McCormick & Schmick's
if you want to have a big party and claim your points. The servers at this location are actually really nice and do accommodate your needs as long as you speak up half way with out finishing the whole meal. If you order filet mignon make sure you specify how pink you like the center because there medium tends to overcook the filet and at that point it's pointless to eat. Unless that's your preference. The pretzel sticks as an appetizer are amazing and leave you in carbohydrate bliss. The deserts are large portioned and pre-made. Good family restaurant with good rewards and service if you speak up and specify how you want it cooked rather assume it can all be perfect. To each there own."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for over ten years, but only in the past couple years I think I've only been back one or two times. I love the location and the ambiance is so comforting!

     Tonight, we decided for dinner to order through a third party delivery service. We placed our order for: A Classic cheeseburger (with fries) for $12.95, Country fried steak with mashed potatoes (with extra sauce) and a small caesar salad ($18.89), a side of mashed potatoes ($4.99) with special instructions, three cheese potatocakes ($10.49) with extra sauce, the chicken pot pie with a side of fruit and a cup of claim chowder ($17.84), crab cakes ($16.79), and, finally, a side of cheesy garlic bread ($1.24). Phew, it was a lot of food, but we had an awesome coupon so we were really excited to get a big order.

    Due to adding some extra comments for a few items I called the restaurant about 5 minutes after the order was placed, 8:55 PM, only because in the past (not this restaurant, but others) the comments had been ignored. The guy who answered and was very nice. He noted he had seen the notes for extra sauces and that we wanted to substitute the extra side of mashed potatoes with macaroni and cheese (the third parties website didn't have an option to add an individual macaroni and cheese) and he already was on it! Super cool! I was impressed and we ended the phone call on a positive note saying that the food should be done and ready in about 10 minutes.

    Now, on the third parties site you can track your order. So, around 9:50 PM I checked the track your order option for the third time and the timing on the delivery had changed for the THIRD time to after 10:20 PM. Yikes, so that would mean the food would have been sitting around for over an hour! Since it was past 9:30 PM the restaurant themselves had already closed so I called the third party to inquire. The customer service rep called  the driver and they said they had picked up the food and were about 10 mins away. Super frustrating, but what are you going to do. 

    Our food arrived at 10:15 PM and the driver told the BF that he had to wait a little bit longer for the food because they started making it when he got there. Now, I don't know if he was just saying that because the wait was sooooo long, or that it actually happened. But the food was VERY fresh and I've had food arrive from late third party services and you can absolutely tell it's been sitting around. Regardless, we were really happy with the food and if they remade the food because of the super long wait then high five to Claim Jumper. They definitely have my returning business."}
{"text":"This place just isn't what it used to be. This was our hangout when we graduated high school nearly 10 years ago and the food is part of the good memories we had here. I dont remember who the company was previously owned by, but ever since Landrys took over ownership a couple years ago, this place has declined since then. They not only changed their menu a bit eliminating some items, but their food quality has went down. Somehow I keep thinking this place will be what it once used to be, but last two times Ive went, I am disappointed and feel like I'm wasting money. The \"complimentary\" bread they gave us was awful. Stale and flavorless. Tasted like someone threw it in the microwave and sprinkled some garlic salt on top. Pretzel sticks appetizer, the sticks were burned on the bottom. Cashew chicken sandwich bread was soggy. On another occasion, there was plastic wrapping in the burger. The bloody mary I ordered was just mediocre. I wont be back anymore. Im surprised the other great restaurants in this area haven't run this place out of business."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food, for been a Saturday and vey busy the staff it's been a very good experience so far."}
{"text":"Every time we come here it is absolutely lovely! The ambience is relaxing but has plenty of TVs to watch sporting events, the decor makes you feel cozy, in the cooler months they lite the fireplaces! The food is really tasty. I love the BBQ salad & my boyfriend tears into the stuffed baker. Our server, Courtney is very knowledgable on the menu. I'm vegetarian & she is super helpful. We will continue to come to this place for the fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've eaten at Claim Jumper and had a negative experience. Service is always great but they need to take the beef ribs off of the menu. They are uneatable. Not only are the bones the size of dinosaurs bones.. But there is NO meat on them and the little meat that was on them was so tough I almost broke a tooth. I will be back but please decrease the menu items by one. That is all!!"}
{"text":"Awful  slow service.  country fried steak was RAW!!!!!    My friends needed things from the waitress that forgot us.  We were there for lunch and very slow in getting order and food."}
{"text":"This used to be a place I'd visit frequently and recommend to everyone but after taking my parents for their anniversary Sunday I don't think I'll be visiting anymore. There were only 3 people in the restaurant which I found very odd for a weekend. I had heard several changes took place including smaller portions(which they are normally known for big portions) and price increase. Well both were true. An order of onion rings is now the price of an entree and the Southwest Egg Rolls I love very much compares in price to a steak I can get elsewhere. Last and final visit here."}
{"text":"This place has good food and huge portions. I went for a team lunch and even with 6 of us during lunch, there wasn't a wait. We ordered and the food arrived correctly and quickly.

I ordered the citrus chicken salad - the lunch size portion with the jerk chicken, cranberries, golden raisins, pecans, etc. I couldn't finish it. I am not sure what the entree size would look like, but I am sure it would be a waste. Maybe good to share?

I did not order the desserts, although they all look great and are huge. I saw online that a slice of the chocolate motherlode cake has just over 2000 calories. I think I will pass.

The one down thing for the lunch is that my manager ordered from the a la carte menu. Instead of a meal she ordered just a side of asparagus - and 6 stalks were $5.75. It is brushed with oil and grilled. She claimed it was very good, but at about $1 per piece, I don't know if it could be that good...my entire salad was $8.75...

The service was fast and friendly. She brought the food out correctly and had no problem splitting up those order totals for those with credit cards."}
{"text":"I was hoping for good food. Sorry, didn't happen. My wifes fish tacos had very little fish in them and the taco wrap fell apart before she could even eat them. My club wrap was sort of weak in taste. The couple with us said the steak sandwich(not sure of name) was okay. I give the fries a plus. Our waiter John was very good. We were at a table that crushed us between to others. I'm not that big, but the space to sit in was more for a kid."}
{"text":"Had a family gathering a week ago at the Fort Apache location in Las Vegas. I ordered the fish and chips. Wasn't the best, but it was decent. Wish I would have gotten the Frisco burger like my son ordered. Next time for sure! 
Had carrot cake and some of the cheesecake for dessert, both were delicious! Highly recommend their desserts!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location before.  We live in Southern Scottsdale and drove to this one and you didn't disappoint.  The food and service were awesome!"}
{"text":"We made reservations and got in right away, the waiter was very good and got to us right away. All four of our party ordered steaks and when I order a steak that is nearly $30 I expect one that will fill you up, all of our steaks combined was what I expected, not the tiny steaks we got. I would be embarrassed as a restaurant to serve a steak that small for the price. My wife got the small steak but we could tell the difference, they were both very small! I don't mind paying for a good steak that is of reasonable size, but these were way too small for the price!"}
{"text":"Be very careful when you go to Claim Jumper , I was there in January with my family . My bill came to $64 which include a $8 tip , they gave me there Reward card Never saying they would charge me for it . Claim Jumper took $89 out of my bank account . Spoke to the manager right away about this problem he said I need the rewards card back and said they would refund my money , after calling and going to the restaurant to claim my refund I'm still waiting for my refund . But they made sure that they got there reward card back ."}
{"text":"The last three times I've been here, the service has been horrible. The wait staff is slow and not very friendly. We were done with our appetizer before anyone even came to get our food order. I ordered my steak medium well and it came out medium rare and cold. It took me 15 minutes to get the attention of the bartender (sat up at the bar) and then another 15 to bring my re - grilled steak back, meanwhile my date had finished his steak (which was also undercooked but he didn't say anything). The manager brought the steak back, offering no apology. After we left we realized we didn't get offered the bread selection that comes with the meal, let alone any kind of bread. The time before that, our \"reservation\" was over an hour late in being seated on a random Tuesday night, but at least we were given a bottle of wine for the table of 10.   Won't be back any time soon!"}
{"text":"I would recommend you the potatoes soup or clam chowder they are awesome... services is ok, kind of slow during lunch time"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.   My spinach salad & clam chowder were great.   And I did get some really good bread.   My server was excellent.   It had been over  a year since I had been @ a Claim Jumper so I didn't know what to expect.   Well my lunch was very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place.

I found the service to be great, food was okay.

However, it's VERY overpriced.  A meal for two would likely be $50 without drinks. 

With Ahi-Poke Bowl, Rubios, Tokyo Joes, Blaze Pizza right next door. 
Claim Jumpers just doesn't look all that appealing. 

You will likely have much better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's been a very long time since I visited Claim Jumper, so we were excited to head over on Saturday.  We left disappointed though, the food was par at best and the service was slightly below par.  We had an eclectic dinner for my mom's birthday, I had the Margareta pizza which was alright, but I've certainly had better.  My mom had the macadamia nut mahi mahi and it was alright, the grilled veggies were so soaked in better or oil that they were almost uneatable.  I'm of the belief that if you have quality produce you don't need to soak them in butter after grilling and before serving.  My husband had the whiskey apple glazed chicken which was actually the best of our dinners but not over the top delicious just alright.  Skinny ritas are not to be missed, hands down the best part of our meal, skip the lemon drop though.  Also just a note for the bartender, I had the first cosmo I'd had in a while (just sounded yummy) and it was full of tiny pieces of lime, like lime pulp it was terrible.  At $9 I shouldn't have to strain my own cocktail.  We also order a piece of the huge chocolate cake for dessert (to take home) after a few hours we split it up, it's all sugar and no chocolate it seems.  We honestly threw most of it away.

Personally our money would have been spent better elsewhere and that's where it will be spent next time."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food. But quality is poor and prices are high. This place is overrated and priced too high!!!"}
{"text":"Bartender is awesome but manager obviously didn't feel like helping clean up the bar while they got slammed. Instead he spent 20 + minutes at the bar bragging about himself and flirting with two ladies. She looks happy."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 13/100

Knowing what this restaurant has in store for special occasions, I made a prior reservation here and brought my parents to celebrate my mom's advance birthday after our first movie at the theater. We were quite the hungry Hannahs and contrary to our plan to share a couple of dishes, we picked an order each! 

Papa had the tenderloin tips served medium-well with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables presented in a decent portion for only $9.99. Meanwhile, mommy had the sandwich duo. This is a fun mix and match pickin'; you have a choice at half a sandwich (tuna albacore, cashew chicken, clubhouse, roasted turkey) with a side of either a salad or soup for only $7.99. She ordered the clubhouse with a side of potato cheddar soup (which was the bomb!) and an extra cesar salad which amounted to about $10 as well (not entirely sure about that) I, in turn, got myself the chopped steak. It's ground beef, almost bordering on thick beef patty, with a topping choice of either cheddar & tomato or glazed mushrooms and onions in burgundy sauce (I chose the latter) next to some mashed potato. I admit it was very filling, so much so I wasn't even able to take it all in. 

Before we ended, I buzzed our waiter a quick reminder about my mom's birthday and he came with their signature red velvet cupcake with a candle on top! She made her wish, blew the candle and commented that the service was pleasant and 'full of surprises'"}
{"text":"Perfect time to get here, around 8:30pm, not a soul alive and the service is excellent (they all want to go home). The food was good, the ribs were a bit chewy and dry but my medium-rare 20oz. Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and I love their uber-creamy mac & cheese.  I think they sprinkle their bread with crack, it just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. Claim Jumper used to be a place we would two or three times a month. We even had a favorite server. After a while we started going to places with the same price range and better food. Today we thought we would go on a date and hoped that it would be as amazing as it was. Unfortunately it was not.  They have changed the potato cakes so that they are smaller and in turn you get much less and they aren't as delicious. The calamari is AWFUL. It takes like fish sticks and is served with ketchup.. thats right I said KETCHUP. This would be fine if they were 8 or 9 bucks, but the calamari will set you back 15 dollars. Even Mastros City hall has a more reasonable price than that. 

Dont worry it keeps getting worse. The food is mediocre, but when you look at the prices it is not worth it. A 20 oz porter house will set you back 31.99, get it oscar style thats 40 dollars. At that point you are better off going to Fogo De Chao and having amazing bottomless steak that is much higher quality. The price of Claim Jumper is far too high and the food does not match this steep price tag.

The final and biggest reason that Claim Jumper is only receiving a two from me is because of their service. Today my boyfriend orderer a Porterhouse Oscar style MEDIUM. His steak (we have had a lot of porterhouses and this did not look anywhere close to 10 oz let alone 16 or 20) was rare. It even had a medium rare pick in it after we had specifically asked for medium. We called the server Callie over, and she said she had put it in medium. They brought the steak back up to temp and the floor manager brought it out to us saying \"We got that up to temp for you\" No apology, no recognition of their mistake, nothing. Every other time we have had an entree come out incorrectly at other places we have been comped with something, free desert, free app - something! Of course, we did not expect anything, but we did expect an apology \"hey, sorry for the mess up, we hope this is better\" Literally anything. 

We ended up paying 92.24 BEFORE tip. Honestly people if you want good food, variety and large portions you might as well go to Fogo De Chao. At that price you can also go to Cibos, Postinos, Oreganos, Mortons, etc. Hell even Texas Roadhouse will be a better choice. 

The only reason we are giving this place a two and not a one is because we called in to talk to Jeff the general manager and tell him how poorly the situation was handled. He offered to have us come back in for free desert, but truly he should have come out and apologized to us for the steak being rare. I should not have had to call to inform him of his incompetent staff members.  After four and a half years of going to Claim jumpers we will not be going again, and I honestly dont recommend you go either."}
{"text":"Every time I'm here they sit us in the bar section- which is fine but the poor bartender is usually stretched too thin and can't manage to handle everything. Because of this, usually we sit for a long time waiting to get drinks/order food. I don't blame the bartender, but the section/system sucks. Food is ok but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Ok guys listen up...I know this is one of those chain restaurants but service defines the experience for me at least. Just flew in from Seattle and the wife and I stopped to get dinner...long story short our food server Brandon was not only a great server but a hoot to talk too. Ask him what his name means if you get him...see if he remember."}
{"text":"So Meghan was our server and she is super sweet. (P.S. she is getting the key to LAS VEGAS....) how amazing right?! anywho claim jumpers has been bought out so things are changing. They have different items on the menu and not as many desserts to choose from. 

With that being said service was immpeccable and food was delish. I had ribs and shrimp, My bf had shrimp. The grilled veggies were delctable and shrimp were seasoned to perfection.The biscuit it comes with is so good! Can I buy those by the dozen? 
 
Dessert was fab three of us shared a cheese cake. Best crust ever! I probably left here at least 5 lbs heavier!"}
{"text":"I wasn't wowed by any aspect of my experiences here. But I certainly wasn't disappointed either; hence, the three star review.

The staff is friendly enough but somewhat inattentive at times. Both instances that I've dined here, I self-sat at the bar and the bartenders do just enough to get the job done... no more, no less.

The menu isn't outstanding either. Just your run-of-the-mill American cuisine. Again, nothing I ordered was BAD. Just not worth raving about. The chefs are good about following specific instructions with food orders (I like my burgers extra well-done, a little charred, and they delivered just that.) which is important to a foodie like me.

Casual dining at its most casual. I like it here enough to dine again."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not the best. Had chicken fried steak. Was ok. Nothing special. Shrimp wrapped in bacon with cream cheese was the best."}
{"text":"Best happy hour menu on earth. You can't go wrong with anything on the happy hour menu. My personal favorite are the fried zucchini and fried pickles and peppers. The only thing that outshines the food is the service. Corbin is the best but really all the wait staff is awesome. If they get something wrong on your order they fix it or take it off the bill. But mistakes are rarely made. All around good service good food and awesome prices."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour!  Hardly anyone in there. We had fried zucchini and calamari, a few glasses of wine , it was very good and reasonably priced. Server Jeannie was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"First time customer. Our server was very prompt and extremely sweet. (Also, no one told
Me the portions were gigantic! )So we order an appetizer along with our meals and end up taking 3 to go boxes. The smell taste and appearance and overall quality of the dishes were great. I loved the variety of the menu. I think this is my new favorite place. Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is always great! The service is good and the food is as well.  I have eaten here a number of times and I have always been pleased.  The last time that I had the pleasure of enjoying dinner here I was just a tad bit disappointed only because they had switched to a different type of bread (although it was good too) besides the one that they use to serve with marinara sauce. Other than that, I will always return here!"}
{"text":"We go here every anniversary! Place is always good and busy.. staff is professional and fast at service. And to top it off good food and haven't messed my order up!"}
{"text":"Late night eats, thats about all, this whole casino experience was low class along with this eatery.  Food was just about edible and place was dirty.  Seriously reconsider if you're thinking about eating here, although there are no other options in the casino.  Very poor!"}
{"text":"This is one of our \"go-to\" restaurants when in the Tempe location.  The food is always good and the service just as well.

We like the menu and the location.  This time it was for appetizers during Happy Hour.  They have quite a few good options and their potato soup is to die for.  The sliders are delicious.

Many times we sit in the bar for Happy Hour choices.  As I said, it's one of our favorite places .... check out the desserts too."}
{"text":"After a short trip to the bowling alley, ended by an unexpected fundraiser, my kids were still craving nachos. One kid wanted a burger. So I thought, easy solution, Claim Jumper. 
We headed in on a windy and quiet Saturday night. It was fairly empty, but kids were lured by unspoken promise of two foot tall cakes in display case. We were seated immediately, given menus. To our chagrin, they no longer serve nachos. And then burger kid didn't order a burger. That was lost immediately when the server brought a plate of fruit, cheese and crackers to the 20 month old when he was likely only 8 seconds away from complaining. Then the older two desired to wage war over his Mandarin oranges, and again without my asking server bought a serving yo the older minions. Then after salad, clam chowder, gigantic kids pizza, frozen grapes and cheese sticks, we left without partaking in the aforementioned mile high cake. I was feeling sick. By morning I was able to see my meal again (not pretty) by evening my three kids dropped by the hour. I initially thought it was my salmon, but I didn't share that with the kids. I wonder if it was the produce as we all shared the fruit. And insult to injury, as we get home and out of the car, a wind gust blew away son's pizza. In hindsight, maybe was a provision."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Claim Jumper. I'd say the food is in huge portions but quality is average. (I'm used to more of the gourmet cooking) The fish tacos were decent. The coconut shrimp were a bit sweet but perfectly textured, which seems hard to find here! 
Overall, this is a fine place to happy hour with some friends!"}
{"text":"I love the Tri Tip when I eat here. My networking meeting is here 2 times/month. The service is friendly, food is great and so are the prices. Next time I am going to try the rib eye steak. Can't go wrong at this restaurant.

{"text":"We were immediately greeted by a very friendly young lady who was able to seat us immediately.  Our server Drew was fabulous!  He was knowledgeable about the menu, willing to answer as many questions as we had, and quite friendly.  He checked in with us multiple times without being overbearing and kept our drinks filled.  The food was pretty good.  It's been many years since we've been here and I'm happy to say I think they've gotten better with time.  Portions are still generous and most of our meal was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  Was there last night and nothing about it was appealing.  The service was slow and uneven and the food was way below its usual goodness.  To start, the fried zucchini appetizer was a massive file of about 16 spears of zucchini rolled in fresh parmesan cheese and served with honey mustard or ranch.  Now it was 8 pieces, in a pseudo-tempura batter with ranch.  Not impressive or good.  The California Citrus Chicken Salad was an entree portion.  However, it was served as an appetizer portion, which was ample, but not up to snuff.  The filet mignon was mediocre.  Nothing to write home about.  What killed me was the dessert, that I bragged about to my guests from out of town, which was the I Declair.  This was a luscious dessert of 3 scoops of french vanilla ice cream with a huge eclair built on top with lots of eclair cream, topped with a sauce made of chocolate and some kind of exotic liqueur surrounded by a mountain of whipped cream.  It was the dessert that dreams were made of.  No it was 2 oversized eclairs, dry and not much filling with a sauce that was a mixture of hershey syrup, some fudge and chocolate chips.  There were 3 tiny scoops of ice cream in the middle with a squirt of whipped cream.  We left most of it over.  Terrible!!!

People should be warned when they go to the Claim Jumper that if they were expecting the fabulous, large portions and great food, it no longer exists.  I am beyond sad."}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times this year and always good.  The staff is very accommodating, food is always good, pleasant atmosphere, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: I have not been a big fan of this restaurant for a long time. Primarily because it just never struck me as something special and it really isn't. I always remember the food as being just a shrug. Nothing bad, but nothing great either. However, I have been visiting their restaurants lately per request of family and these recent experiences have changed my view of this brand and their food.

The last time I dined here, I decided to take a different route and go with a steak. I ordered their Ribeye Steak: hand-cut, boneless USDA Choice, 12oz  ($24.29) with Salt & Pepper Shoestring Fries. To my surprise, the meat was delicious. Tender, grilled perfectly to medium rare, and most importantly, tasty. I was floored. I have spent more money on less steak to have it cooked improperly! I was ecstatic. The fries were unbelievably salty though. It was okay though because I was just so happy about my steak. I also tried some of my fiance's Chicken Pot Pie ($13.29) and I couldn't believe it was better than the one I had at Grand Lux Cafe in September!

We also visited this past Thanksgiving with my fiance's parents. I selected the roasted turkey with gravy, stuffing, cranberry relish, baked potato with butter and chives, and roasted vegetables. Again, delicious! The turkey was surprisingly moist, gravy was tasty, the stuffing was also moist, the relish was sweet and added texture to compliment everything else really well, and the carrots, zucchini, red onions, and yellow squash were roasted perfectly! It was truly a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and very, very filling. The apple pie and pumpkin pie offered with the dinner were just okay. Oh, we were also served gigantic dinner rolls were so delicious.

Although Claim Jumper won't be one of my first choices for dining out, I can say that I am truly pleased with the food and wouldn't mind returning. I had a hard time deciding on 3 or 4 stars since the food has definitely been a four-star experience, however, the service and over dining experience would warrant three stars (our server couldn't remember anything - our orders, that there was a child in our party, if we paid our bill, etc - it was odd)."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a group of ladies last week to the Claim Jumper in Henderson. We had a great waiter so I am giving this one star. The food was so bad that half my group could not eat what they ordered. 
I had the chicken pot pie. The inside looked like cottage cheese. I ate the chicken out of it but nothing else. Terrible. Then I became
 ill when I got home for the rest of that day and the next with stomach problems. Wow. Won't go there again. It seemed like that pie had been refrozen several times or just left out too long and spoiled."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Cold as in like it was just taken out of the fridge. Pick up was supposed to be 45 mins after order was placed. Had to wait 15extra minutes for the food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and many choices on the happy hour menu. Can't go wrong stopping by after work for a nice decompression session."}
{"text":"Have been here several times with co-workers for lunch. This place is Meh. Went here last week for a holiday luncheon. I ordered the Mahi plate. The food was fair at best. The fish was over cooked and didn't have much flavor. Being hungry and not in the mood to wait for another meal to be cooked and served, I ate what I had. The side dishes were good, but I don't recall what they were. Not a very memorable meal. It's he second or third meal I have had here that just wasn't great.
The service was okay from the waitress."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a great time eating out at the Claim Jumper.  Our waiter, Ben, was awesome.  I love their house salad and the portion is that of a dinner salad.  I'll also rave that the cornbread is the side option of choice over the cheesey bread that comes standard.  I had a delicious cosmo and their veggie soup was clearly made fresh.   I found out how to order online and ordered out later that same week as well =) Yummy!"}
{"text":"Claim jumper is a unique dining experience. From the rustic decor,  belt driven fans to the large portions. They have huge custom sandwiches which are tasty and definitely have unique flair. The staff has always been attentive every time I've went but it can get crowded during lunch and on Sunday."}
{"text":"Driving I-10 we found ourselves hungry and in the area on a recent Sunday afternoon.  Opted for something \"better\" than the usual fast-food fare and dropped into the Claim Jumper for a late lunch.  Place looked about 1/2 empty inside so we expected to be seated right away.  Hostess told us 15 minute wait - REALLY?? for what?  So before she could pigeon-hole us into dining purgatory, we ducked into the bar and seated ourselves.  Albert was tending the bar and waiting tables.  Seems like he could have used another hand but he was attentive and pleasant.

We ordered a classic cheeseburger w/ fries and a citrus salad.  The cheese burger was nothing to write home about.  Ordered well-done and came out pink but by this time we figured it wasn't worth wasting the time and sending it back. The salad was a miserable combination based of iceberg lettuce and overpowered by onion, all swimming in dressing.  Bleah!

CJ has a really nice setup, rich looking interior, well appointed, and attention to detail and design.  The problem here is clearly the management.  How can you expect to run a business (much less STAY in business) when you can't seat guests and serve in a half-empty restaurant?  I watched several families and couples who went through the same \"15 minute wait\" process the hostess tried to pin on us earlier.   NO management was in sight during our 1+ hour visit.  I noted a sign on the door to the patio that said \"Patio Closed\" - odd since there were several tables with guests dining out there.  Maybe there is no help to serve the patio either? 

So to sum up the experience:  The food was lousy and the management is non-existent.  If this is the norm here, CJ isn't long for this location.  We won't be back.  Fast food in Avondale looks a lot more attractive now."}
{"text":"I had a really nice waiter and the food were great! The waiter helped me choose an entree by describing what was in it. He made it sound really good and I ended up getting it. Taste magnificent!"}
{"text":"Just left with the WORST service. The waitress had an attitude from the start. Friend was able to order a drink, then we were completely ignored for 15mins and finally got up & left. The waitress's seemed to be arguing over the tables and we never received service. Will not be back again."}
{"text":"We were so hungry after a long shopping day in Vegas with anticipation of great comfort food.  Boy, were we disappointed.  The grilled chicken breast was dry and chewy, the mashed potatoes were cold, roasted vegetables greasy and overcooked, and the chicken pot pie was mediocre at best.  We asked for hot mashed potatoes which the server promptly brought but they were cold also. Rotisserie chicken was dry and tasteless as well.  The server Renee was very nice and we didn't have a problem with her service, but I can't recommend this restaurant as there are so many better places to eat in Las Vegas.  Try Grand Lux Cafe or Cheesecake Factory.  Their price ranges are comparable and the food is always consistently delicious."}
{"text":"just got back from an early happy hour - sit in the saloon for the hh specials.  we enjoyed the beef (hamburger) sliders $4 with cheese and grilled onions - yumm!  thought the fish tacos (2 for $4) had good flavor and the calamari was good too.  we also tried the coconut shrimp with a nice slaw.  altogether we had like 6 different sauces on the table - kinda fun.  hubby had rum & coke for $4.  good service in the bar - nice server signed us up for Landry diners club - costs $25 but got $25 gift card so I'll try anything!"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. Could not ask for better.
My wifes omelet looked and tasted amazingly fresh. I had New York steak and eggs. Was a bit disappointed with the qualiity of the steak. To much work to eat because of the gristle. A shame tasted good but... will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Went to the Claim Jumper yesterday to check out their happy hour.  I've dined there before and the food is decent. ***This review is for their happy hour only*** Sat down and waited about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged, menus finally arrive, drink orders are placed (I get a glass of wine, my dining partner gets a coke) we wait another 15 minutes to get our drinks and we still haven't ordered.  At this point I'm getting the hungry cranky pains and the irritability is setting in...Drink the wine, calm down...

Finally the waitress comes back to take our order (bringing another coke and he hasn't even finished half of the first).. We order the shrimp taquitos and crab cakes. After another grueling 15 minutes our order arrives (with another coke). The taquitos are a shrimp (tail intact) wrapped in a corn chip and fried, they serve the 4 with some slimy sweet sauce and a poor excuse for dressed up tartar sauce. The crab cake (not cakes) comes out and it was pretty delicious, but at $10.95 it better have been. Here's the skinny on the crab cakes $12.95 for 2, the happy hour \"special\" takes 2 dollars off any app on the menu, knocking it down to $10.95 - what they don't tell you is they take away the other crab cake! Cheeky rip off!

Still being hungry we order the nachos, I'll post a picture later just to show how gross they were. The guacamole was brown, I think they added it prior to baking. The nachos which consisted of cheese and black beans. They were so soggy, I don't think they drained the beans before piling them on. Also the menu boasted of an array of different salsas, there were 2 jars, they were both the same salsa.

Bill came (with another coke) - $30 bucks, I went home and made a sandwich."}
{"text":"OMG my lady and i visited the green valley location and it was AMAZING! Everything from the service too the food to the drinks WOW we're in love the server name Sonia was excellent!"}
{"text":"We went to Claim Jumper after an IMAX movie with another couple just for dessert.  They got us right in.  I have a nut allergy and could not eat any of the desserts because they contained nuts.  The only thing I could eat was a sunday and it was nasty.  Oh and not impressed with the coffee."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I have to downgrade my ratings of a business. 

Tonight my husband and I went into the restaurant. We were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait, which took well over 20 for us to be called. This is despite the fact that there were MANY tables/booths open at the time.

After we were seated, it took more than 10 minutes for us to even be acknowledged by our server and then almost 10 minutes more for drinks to arrive on our table.

Throughout the meal, he was nice and all that, but still rather inattentive. Especially when it came time to get the check and I tried to give him my gift card, and he wandered off for another 10 minutes, leaving us to sit there awkwardly so we could get out and do the other stuff we wanted to do for the evening. 

The Whiskey Chicken was rather bland. Needed salt to flavor it up, which is bad considering how they advertised it in the menu. My husband's tri-tip steak was supposed to be medium rare, but was actually closer to well done. 

The dessert was ok. English toffee cake. I could make better at home, though. The best part of that sadly, was the ice cream that came with it.

All in all, the experience took over 90 minutes from the time we sat down until we left, and we're not slow eaters at all. I don't think we'll be returning in the future, since half the time we spent there was sitting around waiting to be served.

Update: After speaking with the manager, we received a gift card for ... half the amount we wasted on our meal. She told us to speak to her when we come in next time to ensure the experience is better. I will probably casually mention to her that I'm not happy about the fact that we wasted $50 only to get $25 back. I'll give the place one more try to redeem itself, though."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed coming to this restaurant ever since I was a youngling, my family and I have been patrons here for about 15 years or so. The chicken tenders are so juicy and big, the French fries are absolutely deliciously seasoned and the Apple Crumble Cheesecake is to die for! Large chunks of glazed apple with a graham cracker topping and crust really brings the entire cheesecake together and it's a different interpretation of the traditional Ny Cheesecake. 

The French onion soup is also highly recommended, every time I go I always have to get that soup. 
The service has always been very good and servers have always been kind."}
{"text":"Great well cooked fish dishes. I definitely recommend this place and it's a great place for lunch. 1 of my favorites in vegas."}
{"text":"This is a nice place.  To me, its a comfortable atmosphere.  The service is really good.  Food is good as well. I recommend this place.  You go home stuffed."}
{"text":"That's some great Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes!! I'm so stuffed now!! Naptime is screaming my name that and it's 106 degrees... Aside from melting away..it's so hot!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Claim Jumper experience. If you've never been it's like Cheesecake Factory just not as good. But it's a solid American food experience."}
{"text":"Always love going to claim jumpers! Service is without fail terrific and food always top notch! The portions are huge - I take home enough for another meal every time I go! 

I highly recommend the shrimp fresco pasta, the south western egg roll appetizer, and the seafood platter (can't think of the name) with two kinds of fish and shrimp. My husband swears by their burgers! 

Over all a great experience - they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I can see the appeal of Claim Jumper.. if it were 1989. It's not 1989 anymore, though, and chain restaurants with \"themes\" are just not as relevant as they once were. I had their famed Chicken Fried Steak. The portions were in fact hearty, and it was decent enough, but just about anything tastes good when it's been country fried, and loaded with flavor enhancers. The price was a bit steep. I'd much rather go to TX-AZ Grill for Chicken Fried items. The one great redemption of Claim Jumper - THE GIANT CHOCOLATE CAKE. OH MY STARS. It's really, really amazing, and actually worth the like.. $9.00 or whatever it costs.. it feeds three, with leftovers, and is just stellar. Yay! Chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Just ate the meatloaf & mashed potatoes. The Waitress she was awesome, it didn't seem to be a lot of people, but it took forever to get our food. the food was just good nothing to brag about. It was just alright"}
{"text":"We stopped in the bar here to have a few drinks before we went to the movie theater nearby. It was a Sunday during NFL football and the place was practically empty. The friendly bartender waited on us and explained they were honoring HH prices due to the football which was awesome. The interior is very rustic and impressive. A little annoying that the table kept rocking. Not a bad experience but not good enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"It takes a thousand years to get your food so order clam chowder or something too because you will fall asleep waiting for your meal. Its so tasty though, we always get steak and seafood dishes, always very good."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Ordered a med well burger, got a rare burger. Friend ordered a gluten free burger, he got a regular bun. Terrible!"}
{"text":"First time in 25 years to eat a Claim Jumper Restaurant. I ordered the HUGE chicken pot pie and tortilla soup. Both were very good. The waiter was excellent. Left the place quite full."}
{"text":"Rhiannon  and I went to watch the playoffs.  They put us in the lounge, right in front of the gigantic tv! Immediately served and order taken. Delicious Shrimp Fresco for me and Rhiannon had a club sandwich.  Well, you know it was enough for 2 meals and we ordered Widow Maker for Ryan and pot pie for Brian to take home. We had a great time and what capped it off was the promp, friendly service."}
{"text":"I used to love this branch of claim jumper soecifically. I grew up on this but today was the worst. The quality went down from when i last ate from here. I usually do take out but today for easter me and my family wanted to dine in. 
I ordered what I usually ordered the classic, \"Roasted Tri tip\". The sides I picked was the roasted veggies, mash potato and caesar's salad. First that came was the salad and it looked so bad. i counted less than 20 cabbage and 2 croutons with barely any dressing. It was so shitty. I had to order the croutons and the dressing which i didn't have to do before. Next was the main dish. The tri tips. I liked my meat medium rare but this dish was hard and the slices are paper thin. My mother ordered the same exact order except she chose chowder soup instead of the salad and rice instead of the mash. Her soup was way over cook plus the rice looked like the rice you had for leftovers and was stuck in a fridge and heated in a microwave. This use to be my most favorite steakhouse. Unfortunately today the quality went super low. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Server was great food came out a little cold but overall the service was amazing so me and my family enjoyed the visit"}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good here, although this time mine came out very sloppy all over the plate with my side sauces spilled. We were rushed by our waitress to get through out meal and pay even though the restaurant was nearly empty. We have eaten here several times and although the food is good, we have always had terrible service. For a 50 dollar meal it is not worth the treatment. There are better steakhouses in town with much better staff."}
{"text":"A gathering of friends was the occasion.  Hostess couldn't find our reservation (for six), as the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, she rebounded nicely.  We had the absolute pleasure of being served by Tasha. Her timing and service were impeccable.  Very pleasant young lady. Broccoli cheddar soup was alright. Meatloaf was delicious. Sweetheart had the ahi tuna.  It was delicious as well as everyone was happy with their meals."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and were seated right away.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We both ordered the California Citrus Salad and it was delicious!  We also had the chicken tortilla soup which was good.  ...and very clean bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, sat in the bar, it took forever! Service was so so. He was very flamboyant, but not expedient. It may have been the kitchen slowing him? The place NEEDED DUSTING BADLY! 
Calimari was so limp. Pizza doughy. Zucchini excellent!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and pretty decent food.  The place was packed and we opted to sit at one of the booths surrounding the bar.  We still got very good service, though our server was clearly overmatched by the throngs.  Nonetheless, she was very attentive and probably earned this place its fourth star.  I sampled a couple of pints of their house hefeweizen and really enjoyed it.

We skipped appetizers and I went for a simple house salad and then had an 8 oz. filet entree.  The salad was good and the ranch dressing was mixed in nicely.  The filet was the best part of the meal (real shocker there, eh?), perfectly cooked to medium-rare and topped with an herb butter.  I got the Loaded Baked Potato side and it was not very \"loaded.\"  We took home some tremendously huge piece of chocolate cake and ate it later.  It was ok.

Again, three stars for the food and a bonus star for our server and the overall experience."}
{"text":"WOW, not sure where to start with this one!  My friend and I ate here for lunch today, we explained that we were on our lunch hour and were pressed for time.  The host suggested we eat in bar for faster service.  Since it was such a beautiful day out we decided to eat outside.  

The service was extremely SLOW!! I felt that we were forgotten about, when I finally received my Burger it had paper in it, apparently they did not take the paper off the cheese and I ate part of it.  The server told me it was ok because it was just paper, she grabbed a manager who told me the same thing.  I argued that it was not ok, no one should eat paper!  

The manager told me she would replace it with soup or a salad, I told her forget it I was only on lunch and I would stop somewhere on the way back to work to get a burger at a fast food place, my friend said \"no they can just make you another one\"  and the manager just looked at us....she was not prepared I guess to give us another burger?!  Weird.....she disappeared for about 15 minutes, but we could see her walking around in the bar area, when she came back out she actually lied and said she cooked it herself....kind of difficult to make a burger in the kitchen when you are in the bar!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and decided that I had better write a review as this place really is exceptional. This restaurant has always been great. Portions are big enough to bring half home and I've never had anything here that was poorly made. Service is great, friendly without being overbearing. You can also get a schooner of beer for fifty cents more than a pint, and their home brews are nicely done. I'd recommend their honey blonde ale. Finally, it seems like they're always having contests/rewards of some sort. Recently, we were given scratch off tickets for prize/discounts, and when we turned them in, we again received tickets for discounts on our next visit.

The only minor problem is that this place can get busy on Friday and Saturday nights, but that is understandable concerning it's a great restaurant. I never mind too much, as it seems their bar always has room while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"I normally go to the Claim Jumper in Green Valley but decided on this location for Memorial Day weekend. 

Worst service ever. Server got the order wrong, twice. Waited quite a while for our drinks. Totally aware that the place was busy due to the holiday but once our food came, we never saw him again. The food was mediocre at best. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before but not in about a year.  The place was almost empty at 12:45pm and now I know why.  Took 25 minutes to get food and half was cold.  French fries cold, hamburger cold, fish tacos warm. Sent back the burger and fries and they were returned in about 5 minutes.  Manager brought them and told me the hamburger was not cold.  So I guess when I touched it before I couldn't tell the difference.  Food was all bland and no taste.  Hamburger obviously processed and frozen and then cooked.  Fish tacos cames with a tiny cup of salsa.  We wanted more but the waitress didn't show for a while and we had to hurry and leave.  It was a very disappointing visit. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"The place was medium busy.  We were seated right away and a waitress came and took drink orders.  We ordered Fish and Chips and a pizza.  Food came in a timely manner and the fish and chips was really good.  It was crispy, light, and hot.  The pizza wasn't as successful.  It was a little soggy in the middle but tasted ok and arrived hot.  We knew better than to order pizza but oh well.  Staff was on top of everything and the experience was good.  I would return."}
{"text":"The food at this location used to be some of the best, and I often went there for work lunches as well as dinner with family and friends. 

Sadly, in the last year or two, they've really taken a plunge in both the quality of the food (note the menu change that others have talked about) as well as the quality of the service, in particular the kitchen staff at this location. 

With regards to the menu change, they've eliminated the Schooner Sundae, a favorite of mine that I used to share all the time with my wife. Now we have to order the mini-versions instead and they're not as good or priced as well. 

What's worse, they've also eliminated a couple of the pastas I used to get and replaced them with something less appealing (and, no doubt, healthier). I'm sorry, but I don't go to Claim Jumper for health food and if I want some artery clogging pasta, so be it. 

The worst offense, and why I'm giving a 1-star rating, however, is the manager and the cooking staff. Yes, I'm talking about the bald manager that someone else mentioned in another review. 

We have had our order for a simple club sandwich botched on numerous occasions, sometimes both my own and my wife's sandwich on visits where we ordered the same thing. Each time, the manager came out and made it out as if we were the problem (how dare we request no garlic aeolie or my wife request no cheese?) and never did take the issue to the kitchen staff. There was never a sincere apology either. 

What's worse, is that all they do is take it off the bill and call it a night. The last time my wife and I ate there, we got our entire meal comped because they botched BOTH of our sandwiches for the third or fourth time in about 6 months. I guess the solution to all your problem is to throw money out the window and leave the customer annoyed that you can't make a simple club sandwich properly.

Personally, I would have expected them to correct their problem in the kitchen since those people obviously don't read the tickets properly. It is not a server problem, it is a manager and kitchen problem. 

I have long heard from other colleagues who work in the area that botched orders and free-food fixes are the status quo over at this location and I have seen it myself first hand more and more. 

I refuse to patronize this place anymore until they get their act together and I start hearing good things again. First step out to be firing that horrible manager and about half the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"We were in  Vegas for my husband's birthday weekend and were staying at the Aria. We went to the Golden nugget to gamble one of those days and decided to stop in to CJ for lunch. It was Veteran's Day and there was about a 20 min wait time. We had no problem waiting. 

Once we were seated, we had what I would deem the best waitress ever! She was just so friendly! It really just started the mood off right and put a smile on our face how nice she was. I wish I got her name. I do know she was from Detroit because that's what I remember seeing on her name tag (just don't remember what her name said) Anyways, she took our drink and food order but came back after dropping off our drinks and said she had to go to lunch and would hand us off to Karen who would be taking care of us. We were kinda bummed because we didn't want her to go but told her to have a good lunch and gave her a great tip! 

We also played keno while we were there. One of the ladies seemed pissed she even had to come to work and the other Keno lady was so friendly! 

Someone other than Karen dropped our food off. Food was just OK, nothing to write about. 

Karen walked past our table at least 6 times as if we never even existed. Never once stopped and asked us if we needed anything or if we would like another drink which we did want another but she annoyed us with her lack of customer service that we were like check please! (We had to flag her down for the check) She dropped it off, we paid and left her ZERO tip! If it wasn't for the first waitress this review would've been 1 star."}
{"text":"While I have never particularly been wowed by Claim Jumper's lunch and entree items I have learned to stick with their appetizer and happy hour items. A recent visit here has reaffirmed that sentiment.

I was in the area after driving around the city and doing Christmas shopping and I was hungry. I ordered a mini BBQ chicken pizza and a order of the southwestern egg rolls. 

The egg rolls, one of my favorite items, were very delicious. I could tatse a lot of it's components from the nice chunks of chicken, to all of the corn and black beans. It came with a Asian type slaw that was a nice cool, crunchy, and slightly sweet compliment to the egg rolls. The bbq chicken pizza had a nice soft crust, cooked yet still slightly crisp onions, chunks of chicken, and a nice bbq sauce.

Service was excellent. I was acknowledged almost instantly when I walked through the door, my waiter came and took my order promptly, and everything that I ordered came out correct, hot, and fast.

My only grip was that the pizza, for being a mini, was comparable in price to the egg rolls. I forgot this fact since I normally come during happy hour. But whatever, it was still good."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Very friendly. 
The food is decent. Can't say I loved it. Wasn't bad. My food came out coldish. Felt warm in some spots and cold in others like it had been microwaved. They say it wasn't. But they brought me out a nice hot dish right away. 
The portions are huge. Even the kids meals are big enough for an adult. 
Everyone else I was with enjoyed their meals. 
I would go back. I don't think I will sit around craving their food or would tell people all about it though. Very pricey."}
{"text":"I love the Claim Jumper!  I used to go to the one in Rancho Cucamonga, CA a lot, so the memories are probably one of the reasons I love CJs.  I've been to this location twice--once for dinner and the second time for happy hour.

When we went for dinner a few months ago I ordered the steak salad.  It was good and up to Claim Jumper standards.  This last visit my friend and I went for happy hour (which lasts until they close at 9:30!).  The happy hour menu items are \"small plates\" at various prices.  I had the street tacos and the Caesar salad--both very good.  My friend had the sliders and the fried zucchini sticks.  She liked both.

The thing about CUs is the food is consistent.  That's important to me.  Caution:  servings are HUGE, so come starving or be prepared to take 3/4ths of your meal home!"}
{"text":"Dessert is the best Dulce de Leche it is a good place to eat prices are affordable I had chicken wings and they were delicious drinks are also good. This is the average restaurant were you get what you pay drinks and gather with the family and have a nice chattering is all good !"}
{"text":"Really liked it here, showed up at a pretty busy time, but got a seat near the sports bar. The server was very helpful and attentive making dinner even more enjoyable, I would recommend this place to anyone, great food &  excellent service, zero complaints."}
{"text":"The southwest egg rolls were super greasy...BJ's blows them away in that department. I had a ceasar salad with chicken.I would have preferred the chicken hot off the grill but its ok cold. The service was borderline slow,but my server was pleasant and he was doing his best only one server in a huge section. 
I am always amazed at how much money is put into the decor in these places and they fall so short on what is served on your plate. Food was your average chain fare. Not horrible but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! They always have wonderful food and service.  As soon as we were seated I ordered a kids meal for my son.  By the time our drinks came his meal came out too. If you have a toddler, you know how awesome that is! I actually got to eat most of my meal while at the restaurant.  

Basically,  great food and service.  You can't go wrong going there."}
{"text":"Lot of food!!  

Chicken potpie was great.  Most food is of the \"comfort\" style.-

Nice staff, friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.

You feel like you're in a log cabin when here.  I could have used some more refrigeration, a/c, when i was there, but it was one of the hottest days of summer.

Save room for dessert!!!!  Their take on cheesecake is awesome.  In fact, I could use a slice now."}
{"text":"it was ok.. all i got was a pizza and salad, and it took forever, pizza wasnt that great salad was, ok...overall, get entree menus or nothing.."}
{"text":"Poor waiter was alone and they started getting busy. That resulted in cold soup and empty drinks. He was awesome though."}
{"text":"Good solid choice for everyday dining. I don't recommend the Shrimp Cocktail though, it's a martini glass filled half way with ice, then shredded lettuce, then a spoonful of cocktail sauce and 6 shrimp. Highly disappointing when you're craving a real shrimp cocktail. Everything else is great and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went back to Claim Jumper for the first time in years last night and it was a good experience.  The number of appetizers on the menu has decreased, but the wings, pretzel, and potato skins were very tasty.  The main course sizes were large and everything was cooked to order.  Our waiter, Don, was professional and efficient.  Overall:  Very Good."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. The food was fine but not outstanding for the prices. A bit in the high side  in my opinion. What really disappointed us was the happy hour policy. We didn't know until after we had been seated that happy hour prices are only if you're in the bar area. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"We come here fairly often. The food is good, but since it's comfort food, it's heavy sometimes. The artichoke dip is pretty darn good, I'd recommend that as a starter. The steaks are always really good as well."}
{"text":"We decided we didn't want to cook for Thanksgiving so we all went to Claim Jumper. I have been here several times over the years and it is consistently good. They did not have our reservation however but quickly put a table together for us. We did make the reservation and call to confirm a few days before and add one person so how they didn't have it I don't know. For the holiday they had a special menu and it had a good selection of items. I had the prime rib, it was good but a little dry. Husband had the Turkey and said it was tasty. Service was good especially for how busy it was. My favorite thing here is their Caesar dressing, it is really good."}
{"text":"Upon the recommendation from a friend, we headed here to consume our final calories before the big half-marathon/marathon. Looking at the menu beforehand, I was under the impression that this was another chain restaurant with a large menu. After dining here, my impression is basically the same, although I'd say Claim Jumper is a step above some of those other chains you'd visit.

To fuel myself for the race the following day, I decided to order the lighter portion of the black tie chicken pasta and a small green salad. My friend dined on a steak, mashed potatoes and veggies.

The alfredo sauce on the pasta wasn't all that great, but the blackened chicken mixed in with the pasta was pretty tasty.  My friend enjoyed her steak plate as well.

Looking around at other diners, they definitely seemed to be enjoying the desserts, which I think is more of the appeal of the restaurant, although we didn't partake in any of them. The chocolate cake looked ridiculously good though, as did the eclair.

I'd say, if you're in the area, not a bad option, but not necessarily a meal to search out either, unless you're craving a humongous dessert!"}
{"text":"The Claim Jumper is one of our family favorites. It is well known for its large and oversized portions. I personally like to think of it as Lumberjack food.
Favorite Appetizer is the Lemon Pepper Zucchini wedges.
My favorite is an American Classic the  meatloaf.  The salmon is good and my healthier favorite. 
One of the most decadent deserts:  The Mother Lode chocolate cake. It is enormous! 
It's great comfort food in a refined but casual atmosphere. 
I would recommend this restaurant, and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I called for our Thanksgiving Day to C.J. I had specifically requested the Roasted Turkey 22.99 Slow-roasted with fresh oranges and amber honey served over stuffing with a savory turkey gravy, orange-cranberry relish, roasted vegetables and your choice of mashed potatoes, baked potato or baked sweet potato and also Green Salad for two people. Well to say the least we were both left VERY disappointed with our meal. The turkey was soooooooo dry, the stuffing was sticky and tasteless, Veggies over smothered with onions and they forgot the Salad and Roll. The pie was a bite size, too small. I called to CJ's and spoke with the manager who kept apologizing for the mistake and at the end he agreed to comp my husband and our entire meal. For the most part, we do always enjoy out times in C.J.s but this again left us very disappointed. I can prepare better in the kitchen than who ever made out meals, just fell flat. Next year I am going to my sister's house. Well I would have gone anywhere if someone would have called me, lol."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp had good flavor but they were fried really really hard. Fries were ok. I would probably go back. Others in my group has some tasty looking entrees. The tri-tip looked really good and so did the steak."}
{"text":"Its OK for what it is. Menu is about as Cheesecake factory, which can be a bit overwhelming. Late night service is spotty at best,went for breakfast at 12pm and again at 430 am breakfast was the best service I've had in an while! But the late night not so much. Burger dry and waited 30 minute's for them to for get an item for tofgo"}
{"text":"What a complete disappointment. I ordered the potato soup, it was bland. Ordered the traditional Hawaiian lunch plate, it was lack luster. I would not waste my time or money again. 

The bread however was delicious."}
{"text":"I love Claim Jumper and dislike this location. They're always slow, and although I dislike that, was ready to put up with it. But no one available to seat me. Finally someone showed up. Just as she was ready to show me to a table, the phone rang, and she chose to answer it instead. And then took another call.

It was past 9 pm and I'd had a long day at work. So I asked to be seated in a kid-free area. Like kids, but not children who are up past their bedtime and are cranky and whiny. She said that would not be possible. Asked to speak to the manager. He was on the phone. Waited a little, but decided if they did not want my business, I would take it elsewhere.

Now sitting at Brio in a markedly quieter atmosphere and my chicken has just arrived. Thank you, Claim Jumper, for forcing me out and into a better place."}
{"text":"My favorite menu item is the shrimp and lobster cakes!   I hope this is on the menu for years to come.   Years ago they used to offer California rolls and that was my favorite;  wish that would return.   I love the menu variety,  the service is friendly and they work pretty efficiently and fast.   Once in a while service is slow,  but it's when the restaurant is full and not fully staffed; they do the best they can.  The Landrys  reward club is worth the initial cost,  as you get it back in credit towards food.  The decor is nice and the bar area is set off from the large dining room."}
{"text":"While visiting the shopping center,  we noticed that this location serves brunch! The brunch started with a yummy cheesy bread roll.   The breakfasts were really good.   The hash browns were lightly seasoned and not greasy like typical browns.  Although i saw country gravy listed on one of the menu items,  biscuits were not available.   That was disappointing because I'm a fan of claim jumper biscuits."}
{"text":"I was only here for weekday happy hour drinks, and grabbed a tiny bit of food from one guy who ordered apps for the table. 

The service was very friendly, but verrrrrry slow. It would take 5-10 minutes (not kidding) just to get a beer. One guy ordered bottles, and they brought them still capped, with the guy saying \"I didn't know if they were twist-off or not\"...basically, meaning he brought the bottle and left not knowing if the customer would be able to open it. Not good. The drink specials were decent. 

I had one chicken wing which was quite tasty. There were also \"bottomless\" chips and salsa at the table, but apparently bottomless has a different meaning here because they were never refilled."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this visit since it is one of the places we hit when we are on the West coast.  The I declare is now off the menu so that was a huge disappointment but they still had Tri-tip. Hubs had the meat platter. All great. 
Kids had the tri-tip sandwich. It was juicy, tender with great flavor. Little guy had widow maker burger that was enhanced by the red relish. It was good but not great overall."}
{"text":"A bit blah really.. They USED to have huge portions - not any more... Menu is a bit restricted, especially when compared to somewhere like The Cheesecake Factory. Service was mediocre... All in all, underwhelming and uninspiring."}
{"text":"10/8/2015 2:30p.  We got the salmon and grilled vegetables and it was warm and delicious. It was a little bit too oily for my healthy preference, would've liked to see less but doable. Clean restaurant and our server Matthew was on point. Very friendly. The music however....wow. Brittany spears, Nsync, Backstreet Boys and early 2k hip hop?!?  Uh noooo, ruined the upscale feel of his restaurant. My suggestion is change the old school teeny bopper music.  Horrible."}
{"text":"Go for it!

If you are hanging around Town Square and all the popular bars like Yard House and Cadillac Bar are all busy, then check this place out for sure!

1.  Parking - okay parking at town square is very urban which means a bit of a walk. For you urbanites it is short and sweet. For the suburbanites it is what??? You kidding me I gotta walk?

2.  Food -  Good ole american cuisine. Ribs pasta chicken steak pot pies and meatloaf!


3.  Desserts- huge motherlode chocolate cake it is decadent!

4.  Service -  Excellent and well trained. Personable from host to servers to all the assistants!

5.  This is for-  huge parties !  They have the ability to seat large parties

I really like this place as a casual place for families and big groups!

Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant.  

Huge tables - for those very large parties.
Ginormous Bar - They don't mess around here.
Giant Portions - You will not go hungry.
Hefty Hens - Ever miss turkey with all the fixings?  You can get it here anytime and not just for Thanksgiving.
Largely Patriotic - American Food at its best!

MOTHERLODE - If you haven't tried it, go for the motherlode chocolate cake a la mode. better yet, go order the whole sliced cake.  It is huge and it is worth it, oh so worth it.

GK Says, be sure to go to the Gym the next day and work off this meal. 

Good ole comfort food.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Been going to CJ for several years.  Hadn't been there for a a while then went today.  I was very disappointed.  They changed their menu and eliminated my favorite dish and my son's favorite as well.

The beef rib was good, but the other 4 people in our party was disappointed as their food was very salty and could not finish it.

Sadly, We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Try this place on a labor day weekend, and it is packed, it is inside Golden Nugget casino, order the drink Ruby Red Berry Bellini, which is pretty strong and the presentation is beautiful, ordered the Tri tip Dip sandwich and is goooood..., also try the full rack of pork rib, and the meat is falling off the bone...overall service and food are up to par, will come back..."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was SOOO good. It was hot and fresh when I received it & it was in a pizza type dough bread. Very different. The sandwich was so big I could only eat half and took the rest with me. I highly recommend the sandwich!Yum. Service from waiter was just \"okay\" as he didn't seem to know the sides when I asked him. Although he seemed to know when he was going over them with the other table - not very consistent. I had to ask because I didn't seem to see the types of sides they had. 

As far as decor, it needs updating. Looks kinda old school. Had a decent lunch. However not really impressed with anything."}
{"text":"The best liver and onions in town. I skip the mashed potatoes and get the steamed vegetables instead. I'm diabetic and anemic as well. The servce is great."}
{"text":"What a nice place to enjoy dinner with the family.  It's always super busy, but seating is redily available and the food is amazing!  They also have a great kids menu and options available for the person who isn't fond of this type of food."}
{"text":"General manager what a joke! Austin Walsh get it together!!!! Or don't even be a manager, even better!!! I placed a complaint at the claim jumpers in harbor drive!!! And he called me from Tempe Arizona!!! He is the worst!! Me and my boyfriend ordered fish and chips which both made us sick and you know most waiters would notice if we didn't eat something that was left with 5 pieces of fish!! No accommodation was made!! Called to complain only to get a call from Austin stating claim jumpers is at no fault!!! Such BS to ask me how I'm feeling because you weren't sincere, when I said I'll just review you he simply didn't care!!! Hope this review makes you think twice about coming to claim jumpers! This place sucks and is over priced! Go to a Ruth Chris and spend your money where quality is 100%! Not this joke of a chain restaurant!! Not to mention Austin Walsh is not CORPORATE!! Read the other lovely reviews on this general manager!!

To claim jumpers get a new general manager!! He sucks along with his annoying voice."}
{"text":"This is a good spot in town square to lighten your wallet and eat some okay American food. You will pretty not walk out of here spending less than $15 a person. Once you get there you HAVE got to have the zucchini spears (7 piece?) because those are good, and make you fat."}
{"text":"There is this cool bartender there. I cannot remember her name, but she had short hair and dark complexion (latina?), anyhow she was cool. 
I got the turkey platter, it was awesome, and tasted home cooked and cost like $13. A pint of Guinness is like $5, which was steep, but oh well."}
{"text":"Menu has changed and they no longer have bread bowls. The Ahi Tuna I ordered looked NOTHING like the one on the menu. I was so grossed out, I decided not to eat anything. The server kept asking me if they can remake it without the pesto sauce or I can order something else. He was so annoying and pushy, like a used car salesman! Never gave me my refill, either. It was such a lousy experience. They have definitely changed for the worse."}
{"text":"Nothing special, nothing horrible. Had a club sandwich w fries and a Caesar salad. The margarita we had were decent. Prices were cheaper than the strip, as expected since we were after all downtown. 

Their biggest \" claim\" is the size of their portions."}
{"text":"Nothing like claim jumper to fill you up ...meatloaf yep meatloaf is the best thing to order"}
{"text":"I heard from a Lyft driver in Las Vegas to try Claim Jumper when I asked him about restaurants he likes  here so I decided to check it out with a friend. She mentioned that they serve large portions so we decided to split the Ore Cart. The bread they bring out was sooo good, but it stuck to my teeth a lot. Their chicken and tri tip was really good. The chicken was like almost a whole chicken which was pretty cool and definitely lives up to the large portion remark (the price matches the portions though, $30 for the ore cart). We had tried to get a side of veggies but they were super limited in their options which is why they lost a star. No broccoli?? That is a crime. And no green beans or zucchini. So we got mashed potatoes with country gravy and mac n cheese. The mashed potatoes were really good but the mac n cheese was very plain. The sauce didn't stick to the noodles well (too watery?) and I ended up eating dry noodles most of the time.  Definitely a good place to check out if you love meat!"}
{"text":"Great selections on desserts. Excellent place."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before going to this place, but the friends we were meeting here said it was good. They were wrong.

Does no one have any pride in what they serve these days? 2 of us had the baked potato soup, and we both sent it back. Raw potatoes. Seriously??? We tried the salads instead. Croutons that must have been made the day before. My main meal was nothing special. Fries that were barely warm. And it's not cheap or even reasonably priced.

I would never darken their doorstep again. There are too many other good restaurants to bother going back here.

The only reason I am giving them 2 stars instead of 1 was the brownie dessert. Warm and delicious. But it doesn't make up for the crap meal we endured. 

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We've been to CJ's many time but the one reason to come here is for their Motherlode Chocolate cake. Anyways, we decided to come here again. 

We had to wait a good 30 minutes for our table. Our hostess finally called our name and brought us in the middle of the dining room and just left us there because she forgot what table. We stood there for a good minute waiting. Can you say awkward. Finally got our table and our server was pretty prompt in taking care of us. 

We didn't order any appetizers cause we know the portions are huge. I ordered the chicken fried steak. Like I said it was huge but the only problem is that there wasn't enough gravy. Little dry and lots of breading. I wasn't too impressed. My wife had the fish and chips. The fish was pretty good. Crispy and tender. My son had a salad with his dinner but the salad looked really limp. So overall, the food was very disappointing. To top it off, we were so full and unimpressed that we didn't even order the Motherlode Chocolate cake. Now that's disappointing. 

I would have to say the service was pretty good but the food is what made our experience disappointing. We'll have to see if we come back or not."}
{"text":"We had a huge portion dinner....too much to eat. Lots of food for the money. Server Randy was awesome. Great menu suggestions. Food was cooked perfectly. A lot of bang for your buck with great service, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Called three hours ahead of time for a large party to reserve a table. When we arrived it was empty. They sat us and 20 minutes went by with no waiter in sight. When I approached the front counter and asked for a manager and said we didn't have drinks or a waiter she responded with there really busy.. when there was literally maybe ten other tables in the hole restaurant. The waiter finally came and got our drink orders and again another 10 or so minutes went by with no bread refill or drinks. We explained how unhappy we were with the service and she offered to bring our drinks as she should of done to begin with. With our nearly 40 minute waiting we finally got up and left the restaurant and went to Texas Roadhouse where the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible kitchen service waited for over 1 hour and 45 minutes for our food  and our poor waitress was helpless.  The cooks needs to get a clue the worst service I have ever had at a claim jumper restaurant.  You should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Two friends and I decided last minute to try this place.

We walked in around 7PM and the restaurant was not busy. Even so, we weren't even greeted. After awkwardly standing around for 15 minutes waiting for the hostess, she finally wrote us down on her computer and told us it would be 15 minute wait to be seated.
We sat in the lobby area about 20 minutes.

Finally seated our server seemed a little out of it. He had no energy. 
We ordered two shrimp fresca pastas and tenderloin tips. We were given a plate of plain bread with no butter. So we asked for some butter, the server apparently forgot, and we had to ask a second time for butter. 
After about 35 minutes of waiting our food came out. Unfortunately both dishes were not good.. The shrimp fresca pasta was overly greasy and too salty. The tenderloin tips were too chewy and must not have been prepared correctly because my friend ended up with an upset stomach that night. 

We were not happy with the service we received.
Wait time, service, and taste were all a disappointment. 
It doesn't seem like any of the workers enjoyed working there, nobody smiled.

I will not be dining at Claim Jumpers ever again."}
{"text":"The networking group I belong to meets here every week. The meeting room is private and large enough to accommodate our group which ranges from 25-40 people weekly. The staff is great, services is good and the food is good. The manager has put together a menu for our group that includes a lunch item and drink for one set price, and there are at least 10 items to choose from... What I really appreciate is the privacy, and that we don't have to pay for a room rental.... Thanks for accommodating us, we really appreciate it!"}
{"text":"My sister- in -law's and I wanted to take my mother- in -law out to an early mother's day lunch. Her choice was Claim Jumper! I was excited because I've heard good things about the food. 

We went on a Saturday around noon and surprisingly it was not that busy. They quickly seated us at a table. I loved the chairs, being a larger girl, I appreciate a large chair with no sides.  The decor was like a large dining lodge. I enjoyed the low lighting and decent choice of music. I did not get a chance to visit the bar, but it looked like an excellent place to check out during happy hour.

 Our waiter was on point. He quickly took our drink orders and left us to figure out what we wanted to order off of CJ's HUGE menu! ALL the things sounded good, but I ended up choosing the Original Tri-tip Dip sandwich with a side of seasoned fries. OMG was the sandwich good! There was tons of meat on it, as well as, caramelized onions, roasted peppers and smoked gouda on a French roll with au jus. I would go back just for this sandwich. The meat was tender and the onions were perfectly cooked. Dipping it in the au jus just perfected the bite you got.
My mother- in- law ordered the famous chicken pot pie with fruit on the side. She said it had a flaky crust. The chicken was moist, and the sauce was the perfect texture. Mom said she really liked it and even enjoyed the fruit that came with it.
My one sister-in-law choose the Widow Maker Burger with a side of seasoned fries. Let me tell you this thing was huge! She wasn't sure how she was going to get it in her mouth. It had a thick patty, smoked bacon, hand-battered onion rings, avocado, double-thick cheddar, mayo and red relish. She finished the whole thing! She said she loved it! I could tell she really did.
 My other sister-in-law had the giant stuffed baker. It was a giant baked potato stuffed with charbroiled chicken, roasted vegetables topped with melted cheddar and jack cheese. Also, a cup of alfredo sauce to drizzle on top. She finished the whole thing as well! She said the chicken was not dry at all and the potato was cook perfectly.

To my surprise Claim Jumper was very reasonably priced! The service was excellent. Our waiter even made sure to bring me a cup of the au jus to take home with the other half of my sandwich. I for sure will be coming back and am planning on bringing my husband in for happy hour. Claim Jumper has an amazing variety in their menu that will please everybody from your young child to your grandparents and in between!"}
{"text":"While visiting from out of town, my sisters took me here for my birthday dinner. I had the BBQ Salad (vegetarian - make sure you tell them vegetarian or you'll get chicken). It was delicious! When my sister told our server that it was my birthday, she said they would bring out a Red Velvet cupcake after my meal. She did, with a lit candle. Nice touch. Thanks!"}
{"text":"OMG, they have the BEST chicken pot pie ever!  Big, flavorful, awesome crust, the compliments don't end (until you realize how many calories you've consumed, but let's ignore that for today).  Got soup before the entree (BIG mistake) so was full by the time I finished 1/3 of the pot pie.  Worse, I was way too full to try one of their gigantic desserts.  Next time, I'll know better.  The service was very quick and attentive and the parking ... well, it's typical Town Square parking, so at peak times, plan to walk a ways from your car to the store."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Claim Jumper, you've been to them all, right?  So far for me, yes, that's the case.  In a good way.  Each location I've visited has offered clean facilities, consistent food, and good (but not excellent) service.  The wait staff seem to be stretched a bit thin even when the restaurant isn't all that busy.  So a leisurely meal goes by nicely but when in a rush, maybe pick a different restaurant.  Lots of free parking and decent free wi-fi (ask for the password)."}
{"text":"Nope. So much nope. The manager has no idea how to run a floor properly. Our waitress was sweet but novice, little things missing like after the meal didn't ask the follow up question of, \"how was everything?\" The answer: AWFUL. 
Country fried steak done very sloppy, meat slid around, it was COVERED in grease. Batter was a half cooked mess as if it was thrown in with other items, and not tended to properly. Wasn't battered well to begin with. Salad was a meager handful of finely chopped romaine/iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese, and tomato. That was it. I just spent two hours worth of my work's pay on greasy, measly, garbage. 
To complete this story: our waitress was given a party of 8 and had to take drink orders while we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our check. THE MANAGER CAME TO THE TABLE BEHIND US! Took their drink order, never bothered to get the check from us (it was sticking out on the end of the table), and was later standing at the register just looking around aimlessly as we were leaving. Rather than cause a scene and tell her how bad the experience was, we left. Both of us were quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for dinner a couple weeks ago and wasn't impressed with the food. I'm not a picky person n can eat most everything but this time my food was tasteless. I started off with calamari which looked n tasted more like chicken strips. I ordered a shrimp Fresca pasta n I can tell that was the worse pasta I ever had. I didn't even finish it. It was a little grease n there was was no seasonings at all. Server wasn't that friendly either. Not a great experience. I have eaten at a SF location a couple months and had great food. I wasn't really please this time."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars because of the amazing service. Stephen was awesome! 

My boyfriend dine out at least once a week and try to go to different places. I picked this place because I like the happy hour at another location so I figured it's about time to actually have an entree and not just drinks and appetizers. 

I was a bit picky tonight as to what I wanted. I asked our server, Stephen, what he preferred between the bread bowl and the burgers. He insisted the widow maker was worth it. I almost changed my order after seeing the bread bowl but he reassured me the burger was going to be fantastic. He did not lie! It was huge! I couldn't even take a bite! 

The staff was super friendly. Every time Stephen walked past our table he asked if we needed anything. You just don't find service like that anymore! 

I also really like the decor and feel of the place. 
With great service, great atmosphere, and great food it is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Vegas from South Carolina and were bummed to see that many of the better restaurant chains we were used to were not around in Vegas. A friend suggested to Claim Jumper and see tried it one night. We have been back several times since that visit. Great food, rarely a long wait, and great service. They even have this cool think called a baby plate for young kids to snack on to keep them occupied until their food com. That gives them the fifth star for me."}
{"text":"This place, for the most part, does it right.  The ambiance has a rustic feel.  The antler chandelier, the wood trimmings, the decor.  Tonight, we decided just to get drinks and dessert. 

I got a glass of the Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio for $6.25.  It's a light, crisp dry wine.  Very favorable with dessert, for me.  I also got the cookies and cream mud pie for $7.99.  This dessert was ON POINT!  Chocolate cookie crust, cookies and cream ice cream and fudge chocolate topping.  It was full of flavor and just what I needed at the end of a day.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Our server was nice and attentive and all in all, a great last minute experience.  If you've never tried this place, it's about time you did!"}
{"text":"Mom in law and Grandma wanted to eat here so we took them for dinner. 

There is one upside for Claim Jumper than I liked- their small but fresh salad bar. This location didn't have one! I was so sad since that's usually what I want to get. 

I got a curried cashew chicken sandwich- it was okay....it barely had any curry flavor to really call it curried. The bread had good taste with sundried tomato on it, but they didn't toast the bread so it was just kinda a chewy consistency. Shoe string fries is alright.  I've had this sandwich before. My mom ordered me one to-go a long time ago and it was way  better. I think the California ones are somehow a bit better with the food.

BF got chicken fried steak (small portion)- it was pretty good as fas as CFK goes at a chain or at a bar. I still have yet to find the \"best\" in Vegas. 

Mom and grandma got chopped steak and said they really liked it. I didn't try a bite. 

For dessert I saw they had sticky toffee pudding- they were in the mini bites so we ordered two. Seriously, the one good dessert they have is like a small offering.  Grandma never eats dessert but she ate a whole one herself and the BF and I shared one. Its good as far as sticky toffee goes. 

Service was friendly, but the service wasn't too quick and then the kitchen was very slow. Considering we were coming on old peoples dinner time at 5, it wasn't very busy for them. We waited like 15 minutes to order and maybe 30 for our food and this isn't a place I would say is \"worth the wait\" so I would be cranky without sticky toffee pudding. 

This place is alright.  If the mom and grandma isn't asking to go, I don't see myself really coming to eat dinner here without the salad bar."}
{"text":"We celebrated a birthday here the other night, and celebrate we did...  

The d√©cor at Claim Jumper is big and rustic, but cozy, evocative of a Yukon lumber mill.  Given the name, that can't be a surprise, right?  

The food portions are generously sized to match.  Think food for lumberjacks; delicious, hearty, meaty food for lumberjacks.  

Do you have a lumber-sexual in your life?  Bring him here.  Feed him man sized hunks of meat and mighty forkfuls of mashed potatoes, all washed down with beer.  

He'll thank you later.

{"text":"Inside, the ambiance is very classy. The seats are organized and there is a lot of room between tables, which I love.

Their salads are pretty bomb ass salads! The Ahi Salad and the BBQ Chicken Salad are my favorites. The service was pretty fast and we got our food right away. The strawberry lemonade is just okay--and it's a drink they make fresh everyday! Other than that, it was a really good experience."}
{"text":"The zucchini appetizer, the citrus salad, the first class service ... This place is amazing!  It's our go to for a nice, quiet treat away from the office.  The manager comes to our table every time and asks how or meal is.  Steve is a great waiter!"}
{"text":"3 and a half stars. I guess chain restaurants aren't so bad. I try to stay away from them but after debating where to eat for 15 minutes we just decided to pull over and eat here. The service here was actually very good our server and busboy were very attentive and friendly. We usually avoid appetizers because we always leave so full and that was definitely the case here that night. Our entrees came with choice of soup or salad. I chose chicken tortilla and the babe had clam chowder. The winner was the chowder. Very good. Mine was good too but not equally delicious. The babe had beef ribs and I had beef tips with mushrooms atop mashed potatoes and roasted veggies. Can't remember the name of the dish. The beef ribs were huge. They could have been more tender but we really enjoyed them. I wasn't a fan of my dish too much because it had so much Rosemary in the sauce but the beef was very tender and the veggies were really good. The service was great and I liked the log cabin decor inside. Made it very cozy. I would definitely come back when in the mood for comfort food the ambiance is nice and the service even better. Just Make sure u come hungry because portions are huge. I took home more than half my meal!"}
{"text":"It's the 4th of July in Vegas, it's 200 degrees outside, and we just left the nearby BBQ restaurant Pot Liqours in disgust over slow service and seemingly uncaring employees.

Claim Jumper didn't even appear to be open.  It was 5:45PM and the sun was shining on the windows with full brightness so you couldn't see in.  The door was open, we wandered in, and were greeted by a very friendly bar tender as the hostess wasn't at the front podium.

We were seated right away and our waitress Krissy showed up seconds later to take our drink order.  While the drinks didn't show up lickety split, they did show up in a timely fashion and we placed our dinner orders.  Dinners showed up very quickly however and everything was VERY good.  In particular, the Meat Loaf with mashed was outstanding however the Rib Eye and Baby Back ribs were also very delicious.  

My only complaint would be nobody came by to refill our water glasses.  On the plus side, the General Manager was working and cleared our table of empty plates and asked how everything was going.  Very attentive service at this restaurant!!!!!!

Our dessert was kRaZy good!!!  Brownie Finale!!  FTW.  Outstanding!!  We all  shared it and there was plenty for four.  Great cap to a great evening that started off so poorly at a nearby competing restaurant.

Thank You Claim Jumper!!!!

Side notes:  Great atmosphere.  Great Service but could be more attentive to water glasses.  Great GM.  Great Basic Food.  Very comfortable and large tables to accommodate all the food they give you.  So many restaurants have small tables and there's simply no room for all the bread & appetizer plates along with water glasses, alcoholic drinks, etc... This is not an issue with Claim Jumper.  Get a booth... very comfy :-}

Krissy was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend is staying at the Golden Nugget so we went to the Claim Jumper for lunch. She had the Chinese chicken salad, and I had a stuffed baked potato with veggies. We are giving it a five - star excellent excellent. And great service from Stephanie!"}
{"text":"We went here for Veterans Day.  The military eats free! The wait wasn't that long at all, which was pretty cool.  So we got our table, and ordered, then my husband realized he forgot his ID.  So he decided to run home and get it.  I was trying to find our waitress, to see if she would give him a pass!  By the time I caught up with her she said it was cool!  So I called the hubby, by then he was almost home!  (I could only imagine how fast he was driving without me in the car)  He ordered meatloaf and he loved it! This was his first visit to Claim Jumper.  I ordered the salmon....Mine was dry and boring!  I make better salmon at home!   Our waitress was really cool, the lemonade was really good!  Hubby said he will be back!  I think next time I will just order the pizza!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a nice cozy winter holiday restaurant, there's a huge lovely fire place and the place is gorgeous. I ordered the talapia on top of rice and asparagus...omg! The best damn talapia ive ever eatin, soft, cheesy, and the rice was bomb. I will definitely be back. LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of this place and I'm still now.  My dad enjoys this place and found several things on the menu that he was interested in.  We shared a calamari which was good, and I ordered their korean chicken pizza.  I took 1 bite and didn't like it at all.  To be honest it's not that it was made wrong or anything like that, I just didn't care for it.  The server was nice and took it away and the manager stopped by to inquire and I simply told her I just didn't care for it and it was removed from the check.   Lunch was completely dead in here and it didn't surprise me. 

I also found it dis respectful (since I'm a restaurant manager myself) to have a server LOUDLY say in the middle of an empty dining room \"I can't take that table\""}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Sorry but first we made the mistake of not placing our order when our waiter first arrived.  And we had ice water, no mark up there.  Took 15 minutes to bring our soup.  But the table of young ladies near us he was at their table every 4 or 5 minutes.  We sat down and ordered about 5 till 7, our food came at 7:45.  One more minute and I was leaving. Chicken fried chicken was more way more batter than chicken and the chicken had very little flavor.  The mashed spuds and gravy and ice water were good.  that bread thing was lame as well.  I"}
{"text":"Honestly I couldn't decide between 2 and 3 stars. The only reason it's getting 3 is because my fianc√© liked his food enough (club wrap) and our server was nice. 

I ordered a mini pepperoni pizza and side Caesar salad. The pizza looked like kids menu pizza and tasted worse. The sauce was so sweet and it was all just so soggy that the inside of the dough looked and tasted like it was raw. I could only get through mostly the crust of half of it and that's it. My Caesar salad was good but definitely could do with less cheese and a bit less dressing (and coming from me that's crazy). 

Honestly probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious tortilla soup! Great happy hour with beautiful fireplace in the bar area! The pizza is cheap and amazing on happy hour. Sweet marinara very delicious! Service can be a little slow but tonight it was quite quick ( probably because we were the 1 of the few people in there) moscow mules are great and my husband loves the buffalo boneless chicken!"}
{"text":"Waited for 20 min. for a server. The only one I saw came running by several times helping other tables. Finally realized I was invisible, got up and left."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience.  The food that we got was old and the oil it was cooked in looked old.  This was worse than dog food.  We had a stomach ache the whole next day as a result of bad tasteless food they served.  The steak came out greasy as did the fries. Next time I will avoid this overpriced place and eat some Alpo dog food"}
{"text":"Friends of ours said we haven't had Clam Jumper for a long time, we must go!! Now I remember why we haven't been there for so long. Average food at above average price. Long wait.  Servers who obviously don't like being there. Ordered 3 dishes and looked like over sized KFC items. All party of 4 said \" Can we not come back anytime soon ! \""}
{"text":"Decided to try something new. Excellent service, never had to wait for a thing. Server was very knowledgeable. outstanding food. Amazing surprise."}
{"text":"Waited at our table for 20 minutes before I went to the hostess and asked for some service.

Manager or who ever is in charge comes and takes our order with kind of bad attitude. Sorry to bother you boss!

Thanks to Christopher who at least tried to salvage our meal! 

There are so many other better places to eat in Town Square. If you like being ignored this place is for you!"}
{"text":"Of all the chain restaurants like Cheesecake factory, fridays, ruby tuesday etc,,, claim jumpers is one of my favs...  I had dinner here last night... Order the all you can eat salad and soup, my entree was the chicken pot pie finishing with mother lode cake,,
The salad bar is fairly large with all the fixings usually associated with a salad bar... They have a baked potato section as well and 2 soup options...  I thought the veggies were fresh, the salads were fresh, and the dressings were really good.  The chicken pot pie is one of my faves at this joint, this time as with others, it was good..  The mother lode cake,, huge chocolate cake with 7 layers.  It takes me several sittings to finish it...  They have a fresh bakery onsite that bakes their breads and rolls you know its fresh.  I have tried the ore cart, and the ribs... Both selections are really good and big portioins...  In my opinion, this plays gets it right... They serve good tasting food, the portions are way big, service is good and the prices are reasonable for what you get...  I whole heartedly recommend this location to yelpers.... I like this place and i hope you all do as well... Hope this yelps"}
{"text":"Things have definitely changed at Claim Jumper. Stopped in yesterday for lunch, gone is the huge menu with all our favorites. Gone too is the on point service and attention to detail. My husband's meatloaf plate looked like food dumped on a plate & then covered with French fries. My Pot Pie was lumpy and looked more like oatmeal than gravy. Our drinks were refilled (finally) as we were leaving the table. So sad, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just got back home from a relatively early night downtown. Thank God I'm home. My nephew and his kids (teenaged kids..Yes, I'm even older than before), so we went to Fremont street to see the lights. 
I don't particularly like going downtown on a Saturday night, but what can I do....Tell them, \"No, I don't want to go.\" At my age, I can't afford to alienate more relatives.
They had a Claim Jumpers in their town (I never heard of it before), so they wanted to go.
First of all, it's in a casino, so my night is just getting worse and worse. 
It was a crowded, but not as much as I anticipated (it being 9 PM on a Saturday.) We got seated ahead of a few smaller parties, which was nice (we were a party of 7.)
The menu had breakfast lunch and dinner. It was at this time, that I realized it was open 24 hrs.) \"Open 24 Hours\", are my favorite three words.
I got a bacon cheese burger with fries. That is my go-to meal for a new restaurant. The burger and fries were greasy, but I don't mind grease.
My only gripe, was the poor service. It was crowded, so I expected it to be a little slow, but they were really slow, which meant waiting 20 mins for water or refills. The waitress was nice, but come on...Two hours for a snack..
The service is responsible for losing a star. 
If I go back, and the service is still bad, I'll take off another star. Sorry."}
{"text":"Went there for a drink with friends. We wanted to sit in the bar area but every single table was dirty! We even asked the girl behind the bar if we could sit there when they were cleared but we waited 10 minutes and they still weren't clean!!! We almost walked out but decided to get a regular table. We talked to the hostess and told her that the tables on the bar were never cleaned. She didn't seem to care. Neither did the two gentlemen behind the counter in dress shirts and nice pants which appeared to be management. The regular table was clean and the drinks and appetizers were good. That's the only reason I give two stars."}
{"text":"Wanna know the only time I visit Claim Jumper?  THANKSGIVING.  I love cooking Thanksgiving dinner, but since it's only me and my fianc√©, he has requested that I quit utterly destroying the kitchen with my turkey-cooking antics.  The last two years, we have ordered Thanksgiving meals from Claim Jumper instead.  Boy, am I glad... fewer dishes that way!

I'll let you in on a little secret too... their kid-sized Thanksgiving dinners are MASSIVE.  So big, in fact, that you can order them and still have leftovers for the next day.  And they are only $10.  For poor kids like us, that's a steal.  We always order ahead of time and pick up our plates.  The first year, we tried to dine in.  Never again.  Two-hour wait times are no joke.

Other than Thanksgiving, I cannot think of a plausible reason to eat at Claim Jumper.  Sure, I have eaten here for a regular meal before... it just wasn't anything to write home about.  And the portions are so darn big that it's almost sickening staring at the plate.  It's truly horrific that they offer things that are so high in calories.  If I'm gonna put myself into a food coma from eating something that massive, it had better be worth it... Claim Jumper isn't.

All four stars are for Thanksgiving dinner, which is always delicious.  If I were rating this on a normal day, it would MAYBE get two stars.  But Yelping about the holiday season (especially in April) makes me feel generous, so four stars it is.  Happy holidays, Claim Jumper.  Don't say I never gave you anything."}
{"text":"I have been to this CJ about 3x and the servers are very nice and attentive. Food is always hot and tastes great! I always enjoy my time when I go there. I love the chicken pot pie!!! It's the best!!! Oh and it's HUGE! Can definitely feed two people! I like the pleasant atmosphere. If you're out to have a nice quiet evening it's the place to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice the last 4 years as we live close by but the food isn't worth the price to us.  We're always disappointed the cost and the food was not worth it.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came recommended by close friends and we were not disappointed. Met with a friend we hadn't seen in over 20 years and the staff was attentive, but gave us space as we caught up. The service and food was what one would expect from one of the restaurants in the Landry Select stable. While a chain, it has a local restaurant feel."}
{"text":"For our anniversary, my husband and I received a gift card for Claim Jumper from his parents. After reading the reviews, we were wondering if they could get a refund or something, because we didn't even want to try the place.  We ended up not going on our anniversary, but on a later date with our kids, when we had a \"dinner emergency\"and decided to use the gift card. We went on a weeknight, and we were surprised to see it was pretty busy.  Here was our experience-

Service the entire time was excellent, and prompt.  No issues with service, and we didn't have to wait to be seated,  and we didn't wait a long time for our food.   The restaurant was clean, thankfully, or we would have left.

We ordered the pretzel appetizer, which we devoured.  I think they were our favorite out of everything we ate.  They had good flavor, and were served with hot mustard and a cheese sauce.  My daughter didn't like the cheese sauce, but the rest of us did.

My husband ordered the calzone with pepperoni and mushroom.  It filled the entire plate.  It was cooked well, and he said it was full of pepperoni, and the mushrooms weren't mushy. He said the sauce to dip it in wasn't bad, but he has had better.  Said he still enjoyed the calzone.

I had the grilled fish tacos and rice pilaf.  There was more of the cabbage mixture than fish, but I really liked the flavor.  I would have preferred flour tortillas, rather than corn, but it was still good.   The meal was a normal portion size, so I was able to finish it.

My daughter had the cashew chicken salad- which was HUGE, one half of it was the size of one very large sandwich, so the other half came home with us.  She had fruit on the side.  She liked the sandwich, said the bread was flavorful and chicken salad was good.  She did not like the honeydew and cantaloupe, because she said they weren't ripe.  

My son had the classic cheeseburger and fries.  I tried one of the fries, and it was good.  The fries are cut thin, and have a seasoning blend on them.  He really liked the cheeseburger, and finished the whole thing, and enjoyed some of the fries as well.  We brought some leftover fries home.   I think the meal could have been a dollar or two less in cost though, as $10.29 was a bit steep for the size of the burger. 

All in all, we were pleasantly surprised, and we would go there again."}
{"text":"Decent food, larger portions. Servers are always friendly and attentive. Pretty busy on the weekend."}
{"text":"As long as Claim Jumpers have been around, this is actually my first time trying this place. Our company decided to throw our Xmas party here and  since the check is on them, you know damn well I was gonna order the most expensive plate just for the hell of it.

The service was very good but I can't really judge how different it would have been if I came here individually.  Its already a given that the service would be good since it was a company party willing to spend hundreds that night, so I can't really judge it fairly because of the situation. 

The dish I ordered was the roasted tri-tip. I must say, it was juicy and full of flavor. Came with mash potatoes and fried veggies. Overall, its as good as it gets compared to the other tri-tips I've had in the past.

For dessert, I ordered the brownie finale. It was soft, topped with melted chocolate on top and vanilla ice cream. It was very good  and if I wasn't such a diet freak, I would have finished the whole thing instead of just half of it.  

I recommend this as a good place to eat with the family or a date. Best that you come at night if you dont like crowded restaurants.

Wow my first serious review without joking around."}
{"text":"Started going to CJ years ago in California. It was ALWAYS known for good food and lots of it. You could count on taking some home and... that was always the plan.

I've been to this one in Phoenix three times in the couple months for meetings and have to say... I doubt a return trip is in the works. The menu wasn't as big and exciting, the portions have gotten smaller, the pricing was the same or slightly higher meaning the value wasn't there AND.... sorry but i love my chicken pot pie but NOT when the inside crust is still uncooked. 

Sure, some big pieces of chicken but for the money... I should have gotten a couple whole ones to go. Seasoning was so-so and overall, just another mediocre third visit.

Also, the clam chowder (something that was always on my must have list) was thick and \"chalky\" and tasted more of unincorporated flour or something. Yes, there were clams but... the rest of it wasn't worth the effort. Thank God for the hot sauce.

I should have taken the hint from my other visits and gone to the Macaroni Grill next door. Sorry Landry's..... not what it used to be."}
{"text":"The staff are always suuuuuper nice but the food isn't that great and it's expensive. I always dread whenever my husband insists on coming here. :( I have tried a lot of different dishes here and I always end up disappointed....."}
{"text":"I ordered the Roasted Tri Tip. It was sliced beef, roasted veggies (zucchini, squash, onions & carrots), and your choice of side - I chose the shoe string French fries. The food was pretty darn good. It could've been hotter, but oh well. I would recommend the tri tip meal to a friend. Under the beef was an herb peppercorn demi-glac√© which gave it a nice flavor. 

OH! And the garlicky/cheesy bread they give you when you sit down? Fantastic.

The price was fair - around $18 for the meal, I believe, and it was a rather large portion.

And not to mention, our server was AMAZING. He kept our drinks full and checked in on us nonstop even though it was busy. He was like a ninja. Seriously, that might have been one of the most impressive parts of the meal. 

All in all, my experience here was very nice and it was fun to be able to eat a decently priced meal in the Golden Nugget."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at this restaurant with a good friend. The service was five star and the manager was extremely nice and came over to our table to apologize for the wait and the fact that the food was not hot. This was highly unusual for my families favorite restaurant. We will not let this stop us from going back. The employees really make this place great."}
{"text":"Best 24 hours place to eat in downtown las vegas. It is located inside the Golden Nugget Casino. I love having the buffalo chicken wings st this place as a late night menu. They have a variety of food as pasta, burgers, sandwiches etc"}
{"text":"Overcooked porterhouse steaks the first time, overcooked the second time, no flavor or seasonings used whatsoever.  It's bad when the fries off the kids menu taste better than the steak.  Steak is going to my dogs as overpriced dog treats.  On the plus, server was nice.  We have eaten at a claim jumpers in San Diego for years and this one was extremely disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a late Dinner. This is Golden Nuggets 24 hour cafe. There was no line and we were seated quickly. The menu was very big and breakfast items were available 24 hours. We're started with the sampler appetizer, it was ok (fried mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini, potato skins and artichoke dip) typical appetizers you would find at other restaurants. My husband ordered the country fried steak. It was a big portion but tasted more like ground beef than cube steak. I had chicken Caesar with blackened chicken. I enjoyed my salad. My daughter had the kids cheese burger that comes with 2 sides. The kids meal was a big portion. Overall we thought the food was ok. Our check for the night was approximately $70."}
{"text":"Used to love this place many years ago.  Enjoyed happy hour salad and pizza with drinks.  Today, was disappointed with too sweet BBQ pizza, bland grilled cheese and shoestring fries.  It's just a chain.  I still liked Caesar salad because of the croutons and dressing.  It will please most but not for us."}
{"text":"While another table had a four year old that kept squealing the rest of the restaurant was being held captive to this tiny terror. The others (adults?) at his table ignored him and kept eating and drinking. I guess they are used to it. The general manager said that he could not say anything to them it was against policy. So the rest of us had to suffer or leave. We did not finish our food. We left. The manager additionally told us that if we went online to landrys to submit s complaint  we'd only be shuffled back to him and he'd tell us the same thing again. Now our server Warren was nice and accommodating and this is not a reflection on him at all. The manager evidently can let one table run out numerous tables. We heard others get their check pay and leave.  Great job. I've always thought better of Landry's restaurants"}
{"text":"Came in because my son got a free kids meal at school. Place didn't seem that busy.  But we waited up front for about 10 minutes before we were seated. Now have been waiting at the table for 15 minutes.  Still have not been asked if we want drinks...more to come as I am writing this at the table..five more minutes later.. still waiting...ahh. just another 5 minutes later someone shows up and takes our order. Not sure if he is our waiter though. Hopefully the rest of the service is faster. Not bad. Two minutes for the drinks. Five minutes after that a waitress shows up asking if we are ready to order.  After that she goes away and came back apologizing. Saying that our order is being made. After that shows up with some cheese bread. The bread is good. Though would be better if some butter was offered. Food shows up. Did not take long. Huge portions.  Great fries. Really good food. Overall throughout the rest of the meal the service was good. The wait at the beginning seems to have just been an oversight at the time.  The food and the service later more than made up for it. I would recommend this place. Just have to get a to go box and pay the bill.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the large portions and reasonable prices. My family of 5's bill came out to about $50 and 4 of us ordered regular meals. It's in a nice area (Summerlin) and the service was fantastic. Would definitely come back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Very good for a work lunch

Stopped in for a business and some food with a colleague.  We sat in a booth by the bar and the staff were quick with our orders, checked in with us regularly, and were very polite.  Interior design has a nice, modern look and was very clean.  

I never look to be blown away by the food at these chain places.  However, their chicken pot pie lunch is very tasty and the crust was actually cooked perfectly.  

Had a good meeting and lunch was well above par for a chain.  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and was offered a table in bar area for happy hour specials. Waited 15 min with no server ever coming to table so we left. When we walked out 4 people were behind counter but said nothing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't want to compare but I feel like I need to. I have been to the Claim Jumper's near 1-17 & Union Hills numerous times, they have always given great service and the food is exceptional. So I figured we would get the same kind of service at the McDowell & 99th ave location. Sadly not so, we had a guy server tend to us after waiting 15 mins. who gets the drink order wrong. That's OK though. But then he brings another waiter to us saying he was leaving and she would take care of us. OK. So the girl is nice and we get thru appetizers and getting our orders in. Meanwhile the guy server is still working the other tables. We get our orders and a few things are not right, we got food no one ordered and add-ons were brought out late. Also, the brown gravy tasted like alcohol. But we get thru the meal and literally run out. But not before talking to the manager, Lauren. She was extremely professional and polite and took down our comments. I had to tack a star back on because of her."}
{"text":"Went here last night around 9:30. They weren't especially busy, and we were seated right away. The host took out drink order and said our waitress would be with us shortly. The drinks nor the waitress didn't show up for about 15 minutes, but she didn't bring the right drinks nor take our order. We left about 5 minutes later."}
{"text":"In Mid Jan 2017 We had lunch at this location and the service and food was great.  Today we decided to have lunch at this location again.  The service and food was terrible.  Under baked bread delivered twice started the bad experience.  Continued with a terrible salad, very spicy Crab Cakes and a Medium steak served Rare.  Waitress was so so and not very customer service oriented.  Doubtful if we will return."}
{"text":"I have not been to the Claim Jumper
in a while. Good food and friendly service here. This is actually the largest location I have ever seen. The locations in California are not this big. I have yet to make a meal and desert because the portions are so big. I had a good time with family and friends."}
{"text":"It sucks when people don't care about the customers..I blame the bad experience on the people who work there..the host messed up my sister's birthday by not telling the waiter it was her birthday and I told them like 3 times..and because we went in a big group the food was not great go to the summerlin one it's a lot better..you would expect this place being in town square they would be good but nope

Nice thing was our waiter was very professional that's all"}
{"text":"$$$$$$$$.  Over priced. I can make better at home. Disappointed in the food. Waitress said food was made to order but then said rice dishes are recycled."}
{"text":"First time back in about 5 years as the last experience was horrible. This time was just as bad. Others in my party wanted to go here.  There was no wait at 6p on a Friday evening should have told us something. Not many people here. Seated right away. Server seemed upset that we didn't want to order beer or cocktails. Server took drink order. Came back and immediately wanted to take our order. Salads came fairly quickly. That was the end of the prompt service. Finally all 4 orders came out. Steak was overcooked and dry, ribs undercooked and cold, meatloafs were cold. Server took everything back and manager came over to apologize and said he would bring orders out. This time steak was properly cooked, ribs and meatloaf dinners were microwaved. When the manager came back I told him about microwaving. He said the meal were remade. When I asked him why my meatloaf was missing a bite that I had eat the 1st time. He just turned and walked away. We did the same thing. I left money to cover the drinks. I doubt I'll ever return even if others want to eat here. As we were leaving an employee at the front door told us that they had just revised the menu and recipes a few months ago. That's why it wasn't busy on a Friday evening. I cannot recommend Claim Jumper. There a a lot better places to eat in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I called up and ordered takeout. The phone was answered promptly by a young lady, who was very kind and helpful. I was told it would take 10 to 15 minutes. I arrived after about 10 minutes and the order was just getting put into a bag for me to take. All of the food was delicious! My son really loved the traditional calzone with pepperoni and sausage."}
{"text":"First time at Claim Jumper - mediocre food & service.  Wouldn't choose to come back here on my own accord.

Saturday dinner. Party of 4.  NO WAIT!!  - awesome

Male waiter comes to our table and introduces himself. He does not look enthused or have a cheery attitude. Pretty much just there to do his job. How you gonna get your tips with such a poor attitude?   We had to ask for refills. SERVICE - lame

Foods ordered: 
*medium steak tips - was not cooked medium, more like medium well. As if the food sat on the plate too long waiting to be served.
 *traditional calzone, served with spaghetti sauce?!  cmon guys, no marinara? - wack

This place seems like a nice place...it's really large and spacious. They have a LOT of menu options. If the food quality was better then I'd probably come here more often but this is one of those places that you'll just try once and decide it's not really worth it to go back.  womp womp womppp"}
{"text":"I went here with my family, and everything was just \"ok.\" The service was good, not stellar. She was guessing at her description of some of the menu items, luckily, we still enjoyed them, but they were not in any way they way that she described their taste.

The mudd pie dessert had a piece of wax paper or cardboard in it still, which was discovered after chewing on it... gross. We set it aside to show her, and she didn't have anything more to say, than \"oh sorry!\" and walked away with the plate. I would have expected a visit from the manager, and removal of the dessert from the check. It is not our fault as the customer, that the prep crew did a shoddy job with our dessert.

I wasn't impressed. The wedge salad also is no longer on the menu, which is a favorite. After wards she explained that it was removed because of a \"lettuce shortage\" and was still available by request. HUH??

And by the way... why not make a chicken pot pie without MUSHROOMS?"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Ample and comfortable seating is also available. The food portions are also excellent."}
{"text":"Went here about a month ago. I know I need to be more punctual about posting my reviews in a timely fashion. Had a massive amount of food, it was presented to me and the person I was with said the same thing about there portion. But we both enjoyed everything, Chris was a good server. My first time here, and I can honestly say, \"I'll go back several times more. Lol"}
{"text":"My husband & I ate lunch on a Sat. & should have known better when no one was there! He ordered a pasta & shrimp dish & I ordered a club sandwich. The club was so so. He knows I love shrimp so he offered me one from his dish. Not only did it smell fishy, it tasted fishy & not fresh. He was unable to finish the meal as he said it did not taste right. As soon as we got home he was not feeling well. He spent the rest of the afternoon going back & forth to the bathroom! We will never eat there again."}
{"text":"The good: the food is decent
The bad: the service is maaaaah and they over price everything. Everything at claim jumper used to be great but within the last 2-3 years they changed their way of cooking and their food is still good but not great like it used to be. I have literally been here more than 50 times but not sure why I go back. I guess there is something wrong with me"}
{"text":"We arrived about an hour and half before close on a Saturday evening. The waiter was friendly and attentive. The food was horrible. The steak was supposed to be cooked medium but when I chewed it I felt like I was eating bubble gum. The baked potato wasn't cooked either and the fried shrimp tasted like the way were pulled from the freezer out of the bottom of bag. I let the waiter know. He was cool and got the manager. The manager asked if I was still hungry. I said no. Then he offered me a slice of their chocolate cake. Sure, why not? My appetite was gone so I paid my overpriced horribly cooked meal took my slice of chocolate cake home with me and called it a night. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Nice setting. Love the fireplace in the front. The appetizers were great. We had the calamari and southwest egg rolls. I had the spinach salad with seared ahi . Too much dressing as well as nuts, feta etc.... My son had the grilled cheese sandwich . It was pretty good. The food portions are huge!"}
{"text":"The setting of the restaurant was very nice. The staff was super friendly and very attentive. I ordered the clam chowder (what I always get) it usually comes in a bread bowl, because they no longer offer that option they have a free huge serving of knot bread with whipped butter at no cost. The food portions were big and the prices were very fair. Great food, hospitality and service!"}
{"text":"If you've been to one Claim Jumper, you've been to them all. I prefer this one over the Town Square location because it's a little quieter. The portions are huge, and the food is better than most places. And they have WiFi, which is a plus. 

Only downside is that it gets busy on peak hours, but not much can be done about that."}
{"text":"Grilled Mahi was sauteed and not grilled, and over cooked. Vegetables were not fresh, and salad was limp. Bread was excellent and waiter Nate was awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cobb salad with extra dressing just now. God bless them!! Gave me 1/2 tiny container to go. So I'm screwed unless I want to drive back. No!!  People... Check your to go food!  It's funny I guess it happens a lot when they are not waiting on you for a hour. Feel like I was treated like a fast food chain insuring all was in the bag. $50.00 later it wasn't right at all. Food is good but no attention to condiment details which I believe is important to more people than me especially when you order to go. Gonna go get the Hidden Valley Ranch in my fridge!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. BAD service!

It took them 15 minutes to even recognize that we were there. 35 minutes to be exact from the time we sat down to the time someone took our order. This was just after lunchtime, and the place was only about a third full.

Food was very slow to come out. When it did come out, it was not worth the wait. I had the \"Sliders\", described on the menu as \"Mini burgers topped with double-thick cheddar\". What it actually was, was four small burnt pieces of burger, on lightly toasted buns, with a cheese slice. They were so dry and burnt it was unbelievable.

Had to ask two different people for ketchup, three times. In the end it was easier to go hunting for it myself.

I would not eat here again, shame as the place looks nice."}
{"text":"This is a major shout out to the AMAZING happy hour. You must sit in the ample sized \"saloon\" area to take advantage. Hours are 4-7 weekdays and 9-11 on friday/saturday. Decent drink specials, but food specials are great. Tons of snacks in the $1.50-$5 range. 

Love the $1.50 pretzels with cheese sauce (request this stuff for sure!).. they are incredible and completely worth blowing your diet for. These are normally priced $3.50 and I'd still pay that price for them.. soo much yummier than the ones at the mall or the ballpark or wherever you usually eat pretzels. 

I also recommend the Irish nachos for $2.50, and the pizza rollis for $2.75... if you are looking to get full on deliciously calorific junkfood at bargain basement prices, come here.

I'd mention as for the non-happy hour menu/prices.. I find this place like a better cheesecake factory. Better food, prices, etc."}
{"text":"The food is great. Service however is horrible. Waited for 15 mins to get check. Plus never got check, I went in the back and got another waiter to give us our check and I also got the check for the table next to us because they were waiting also. No refills on drinks. Seen our waiter twice the entire time we was there"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!  Managed very professionally...
Went today for Beef Rib Supper....
DELICIOUS! !!  ASHLIE did an outstanding job!!!
We are regulars, love it!!"}
{"text":"used to be 4-5 stars but now that they are owned by Landry Restaurants-who redid the menu-it just not the same./The vibe and expansive menu has been hacked. Landry Management reevaluated the menu and decided the menu was too diverse and many favorites are gone from the menu.

Also, the care and cutesie-ness are gone and you can tell they have gone corporate. No more fun here and the changes are not for the better, Our meal was good, but not like before. Fresher, hot food made with care versus a production line.

 Sorry, we won't be back because we miss OUR Claim Jumper"}

{"text":"As much as I detest chains, this is not a bad joint to have dinner. The place is absolutely huge, with a log cabin kind of feel to it. The service was above par and the food was good considering they offer about 1000 choices. Beware: everything here is served in monster size portions, I suggest you order a half portion if it is available for the item you desire. This particular location seemed nicer than other Claim Jumpers I had tried in the past, and the service was definitely better.

Overall good quality comfort food."}
{"text":"Dinner was very good, although the chicken was dry. Server was average. Place was very clean and not crowded. I loved that the menu had gluten free and vegetarian sections. Will most likely go back."}
{"text":"Service here is terrible. Part of our food was delivered to the wrong table and the server didn't even notice some of our party had no food. We had to tell him twice. When I finally got my food, the chicken was so dry it felt like sand in my mouth, the pasta was very over cooked, and the dish didn't have enough sauce. I asked for a vinaigrette for my salad, and I was brought a balsamic reduction/glaze. Way too sticky to dress a salad. The manager came by our table and did not offer to fix anything. He also looked very unprofessional. The food is way overpriced for the quality and portion sizes. Everyone had to ask for drink refills. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Staff got off to a slow start. Three courses were served within ten minutes. The quality of the food was  good. The service is keeping them from a fourth star."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the way to go, drinks and food were cheap and HH menu had more options than any other spot. Ask for Felicia if you go, she's awesome!"}
{"text":"Arrived and was seated within 5 minutes.  Waitress was very polite and engaging.  Food was delicious.  Had the chop steak which was moist.  Moscow Mules are the drink to have here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, and fine service.  The food was very tasty! (Thanksgiving dinner plate, and Jambalaya)  If the food options here were a bit healthier I think I'd give it 4 stars, but the menu is very large and I may just not have looked hard enough!  Anyways, overall a very nice dinner"}

{"text":"I've eaten at other Claim Jumpers and at this one before and always had a great meal.  Today was a totally different story.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and had it grilled.  When the plate arrived it looked great.  When I cut it open, it was almost totally raw.  I brought this to the waiter's attention.  They asked if they could bring me a new piece of fish  and I agree.  What arrived the second time was almost predictable.  It was way over cooked but at least it was edible.  The vegetables on the plate were way over spiced to the point that all I could taste was spice. 

My wife ordered a fish and shrimp combo.  While the shrimp and fish were OK, there was way too much breading on the shrimp, the Cod links were way over fried and it was like someone put twice as much salt on the entire plate then was palatable.  

The salads were good and the waiter was very good.  One of the manager's came over to check on us after I had returned the fish and while he was concerned, as a manager of a retail operation, it didn't seem genuine.  

I for one, will not return to this establishment as for the cost of the meal, it certainly wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Contacted by Customer Service saying they want to talk about my experience. Haven't heard from them since I have them my number. About 9 days ago."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple of times. The food is good, but it took 45 min to get our lunch. Today. We had to ask for it to go because we had to pick up our kids. The music is always loud and annoying. You would think you were at a concert, rather than trying to have a nice relaxing lunch. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Have been here before a couple of times for business lunches, but todays was definitely not good.  I ordered the mini pizza with side salad and an iced tea.  The salad was a little gritty like it had been cleaned properly, and the mini pizza veggies were still crunchy with cheese that had not melted entirely.

I was truly disappointed, since this was my FIRST bad experience here.  Hopefully it was a one time occurance, because this place tends to be our company's GO TO restaurant for business lunches."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Claim Jumper for dinner. Had not been here in a long time! I enjoyed the garlic cheese bread. It was warm, soft, and tasty. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans instead of roasted vegetables, as well as the potato cheddar soup. Everything was very flavorful! They do not shy away from seasoning here. The soup was cheesy with chunks of potato and seemed to have a garlic/onion powder flavor. There were also little crunchy french fried potatoes on top. The chicken was tasty, the mashed potatoes were VERY buttery, and the green beans had like a mesquite seasoning. I liked them a lot! And they were well-cooked... not too crunchy. My boyfriend ordered a slice of pumpkin cream cheese pie to go. It was HUGE! But I know most of their desserts are giant... Six-layer chocolate motherlode cake, anyone? We also had good service. Nice meal overall, and I have leftovers for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"After finishing up the New Vista Wine Walk with a friend, we decided we wanted a warm and gooey desert and settled on Claim Jumper. We were seated immediately and greeted by a young friendly lad named Jonathon. Jonathon suggested the Cookie Finale or Chocolate Chip Pizookie. The Cookie Finale won out and was more than enough for two (it comes with two giant cookies the size of my hand). I threw my towel in the ring halfway through my cookie and was infinitely grateful that I didn't try to conquer the Cookie Finale all by myself. To contrast the sweet, we wanted something salty and ordered a side of french fries. They were shoestring style and were just okay.  

My friend and I agreed that the Cookie Finale wasn't anything special. Sure, it was a huge portion and a bargain for $7.99, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the taste. The cookie just wasn't ooey gooey enough for my liking. Our waiter was great - he handled our drunken antics with a smile. The atmosphere was underwhelming. The layout reminded me of a buffet and the decor was rustic (eww). I was curious about Claim Jumper, and now that curiously is sated."}
{"text":"I went to a company dinner here recently. Hadn't been to this chain in years, before the dietary restrictions were a part of my life. I'm always hesitant to try a place like this because most chains don't cater to people with food intolerances. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find they did have a gluten free menu. I ordered the filet mignon with a baked potato, both were pretty tasty. I also got a small salad with no croutons and no cheese, which was probably the only thing that was disappointing as it was just lettuce and diced tomatoes. I didn't eat most of it, it was just not appetizing at all. I had to make my own salad dressing with olive oil and lemon juice as they did not offer a gluten free dressing (according to the server). We had a large group of about 13 and the server was attentive. As for dessert, there was nothing gluten free whatsoever so I was a bit disappointed by that. My coworkers ordered a couple of yummy looking HUGE desserts to split and everyone enjoyed them."}
{"text":"I love to dine at Claim Jumpers; in other cities but the Bay Area. For some apparent reason- the foods and drinks taste a lot better, the service is more professionally efficient and the restaurants are a lot nicer from other CJ's locations than the Fremont and Concord, CA locations. Maybe it's me, I don't know!

This Claim Jumper is located (dead-center) in the outdoor Town Square shopping complex

As a high-volume eater, I love the amount of food offers to us. I also love the lunch items at Claim Jumper including the appetizers and the French Onion Soup. That hearty soup is also a pretty good size too.

For lunch, I had a pair of one of  my personal favorites; the Caesar Salad and Chicken Fingers. The $10.95 poultry dish has five boneless breast battered to a golden brown. I also get a choice of dipping sauce, in which I chose the Bleu Cheese.  And the $6.95 Caesar Salad was tasty with salad dressing and the colorful green color of the Romaine lettuce.

I also had a glass of Arnold Palmer (1/2 Lemonade & 1/2 Iced Tea) with free refills too. What a refreshing way to beat the desert heat!

While my food were being prepared, complimentary dish of buttery popcorn were serve. I can smell even the popcorn popper all over the facility. The popcorn also tasted good in my salad too. You should try that/

I had a great seat in a booth right across from the bar where I can watch ESPN and CNN on the TV at the bar. Also Ernesto, the hustling bartender/waiter, took my order and serving my needs.

The restaurant were also playing musics from the 80's, including Duran Duran's \"Hungry like the Wolf.\" Indeed, my appetite was like a wolf.  

My experience from this location is a positive one.  The only downfall is that the dessert case is smaller than the other locations. Just the perfect size to display the monsterous \"Motherlode Cake.\""}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Our server \"Ivy\" was probably one of the best waitress I've ever had. Very friendly and attentive. I also noticed that when I went to pay the bill another friendly server offered to pick up my check which I thought was also courteous and helpful. The food was amazing too! Overall a very good experience here."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times before and never had any issues.  I always get the California Citrus Chicken Salad, which has either grilled or blackened (your choice) chicken strips.  Very tasty.  Well, I took my husband Sunday for Father's Day; we had 6 pm reservations.  We got seated almost immediately, but it took over an hour for us to get our meal.  I again ordered the Chicken Salad and the waiter asked if I wanted grilled or blackened.  When my salad was brought to the table, the chicken was like lunch meat chicken.  Big paper thin slices all over the top.  I questioned the waiter about this, and he rather rudely told me it was always served like that.  Well, I guess I must have been in la-la land the other times I've ordered it.

While I probably should have asked for a manager and sent it back, the whole ordeal with the waiting and attitude just made me want to get the heck out of there as quickly as possible.  My husband is on the phone with them as I'm writing this.  We'll see what happens.  But I doubt that I will ever be returning.

Oh, another lovely added \"bonus\", the restaurant was about 85 degrees inside and we were miserable.

{"text":"I've come here several times over the past few years so I'll summarize based on all experiences. 

My most notable experience was when I came here for thanksgiving dinner. This was the first time having dinner out on thanksgiving.  I  usually do the cooking but felt like trying something different.  The menu was extremely limited and over priced.  Despite having reservations we still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated.  The turkey was dry and lukewarm.  The rest of the meal was inedible.  For the 300 we spent to feed 6 of us I would have much rather gone to Denny's and paid a fraction for better service and food. I brought up the issues to management and corporate but I was ignored. To me it feels like they simply don't care.

Despite that massive let down, I opted to try them again figuring a holiday probably isn't the best time for them. In this occasion I ordered a salmon dish and what I got was bland and over cooked. The service was also lacking.  I love salmon and was quite let down.

This next, and most recent occasion was this past Friday.  My family was treated out for a celebration of a special event for my wife. We had a reservation and this time we were seated promptly. The food was better, but not worth what they charge. My wife had their ultimate fish and chips. While the fried fish and shrimp were good, the tilapia was lacking in seasoning. The fries aren't anything to speak of either. 
I had the widow maker burger figuring how could they screw up something so simple and I was also excited about a burger with onion rings, avocado, and bacon topping it. Unfortunately they must have run out of avocado because of the 4 people in our party who ordered this burger, mine was the only one to be missing the avocado. It's a giant burger but I just felt really let down by them again. Since it was late and we all wanted to leave as well as the fact that it was close to closing I just kept my disappointment to myself. By the time I would have been provided with avocado, everyone would have been ready to go and I wouldn't have been able to enjoy it anyway. 

I really try hard to like this place. I keep wanting to give them opportunities to make up for issues in the past but time after time I am met with dissatisfaction and disappointment."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are only because of the nice bartender and manager. I came in near closing time for a drink and some food. I ordered a salad and a burger. The burger came, no salad first. So I just canceled it. No big deal. Then the burger had cheese and tomato, both of which I had asked to be left off. The bartender took it right back to the kitchen with her apologies. The \"new\" burger I got was just the same one with the cheese scraped of. I was just going to cancel my food and leave. The bartender got the manager who offered to buy me a new burger. He offers it to go, so I accepted his kind offer. He clarified my requests and asked how I wanted it cooked (medium).  A long while later I get my burger to go. Once in the car, I opened it to grab a bit or two while it was still hot. Well, the burger was cold and the edges were charred. I think it was the same burger again with just the cheese evidence on the edges burned off. The fried were also ice cold so must have been the original ones I had gotten about 30 minutes earlier. They were cold then too. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm such a fan of good food and great value. Claim jumpers never disappoints. I needed to use the restroom before eating and was pleasantly surprised to find a clean great smelling restroom.   We ordered the sampler and soup and salad. And I'm very pleased with them. Food never disappoints here."}
{"text":"I give it 1 star only because I have to, and the food was good. 1. I called in advance and the girl said it would be ready in 10 minutes. The food was not done for 40 minutes. 2. She gave us food with NO NAPKINS OR UTENSILS!"}
{"text":"Super creative adult beverages.  Loved everything about it, I always try something different and have never been disappointed.  Get the grilled artichoke and chicken fried steak.  favorites."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying i've been going to Claim Jumpers for over 10 years. I have always enjoyed my grilled chicken breast and skinny fries. Apparently corporate thought it smart to get rid of both items. Here's the issue. People love places like this because of what they like. Corporate comes in and changes everything to save a few bucks. It isn't going to work. Last night I dined at this location. Upon looking over the menu I noticed the grilled chicken was gone. I asked the waitress about it and she was very rude regarding this manner. She had given me a speech about how corporate changed the menu and anything that's not on there can't be served. I understood this wasn't her fault so I kindly asked if it was possible I order the kids chicken nuggets. She again very rudely responded that I could not order off the kids menu if i wasn't a kid or an 85 year old woman. I asked her to check with her manager because I have never in my life at any establishment been told I couldn't have a kids meal. I offered in fact to pay more for this meal. I ended up getting happy hour food that was all crap including their new thick fries which are disgusting. Between how a loyal customer was treated and the changes corporate has made this place will end up with all locations closed."}
{"text":"They made us wait an hour and a half for our food. My food came out cold and she tried to force us to take it to go. Very disappointed with the service, won't come here again."}
{"text":"Service sucked asked for our food to go . Asked the server when he handed us our food if dressing was on the side as we were planning on walking a couple blocks back to our hotel. He says \"yup\", trusting this didn't check and get to our hotel and it was soggy drenched salad . Even if we were to have eaten at restaurant we would have asked for the dressing on the side and basically he liked as he was probably the one that put it together himself. He forgot our bread had to go to kitchen to ask for it after waiting ten min. He already had our money so I guess he didn't care about us getting our bread . I would have loved to include his name but we didn't get a receipt either apparently for the $43 27 for a vege burger, baked potato and soggy salad . Won't be back . The only reason for two stars was when I walked up to kitchen to ask for bread a very nice bald guy asked if he could help me and when the server said it wasn't ready he stated it's ready I'll be right back and went and got it for me .
Food was ok not worth  the price  and server was shitty."}
{"text":"I checked into the hotel around 11:30 PM and this was the only place open. While it wasn't terrible packed service was slow and not too friendly. I had the chicken fried steak which was great. Well fried and heavily seasoned, it was exactly what I was looking for. It was fairly tender and the mash was good as well. I had a slice of carrot cake to finish off my meal, it was large but not that great as far as carrot cakes go."}
{"text":"I have no damn idea how this place even has 3 stars. This place sucks ass. The food is ok but everything else is horrible. It takes forever to order and even longer for your food to get served. Oh and if you want your check get comfy and take a nap because it'll be awhile."}
{"text":"Walked in at 2:30pm on a Saturday. 
Hostess no where to be found at a pretty big restaurant. Sat ourselves in the saloon area. 

I think only two servers, and couple food runners were working at that time. I wouldn't blame them it was dead in the restaurant area. 

Anyway, we were able to order from the happy hour menu and got the calamari and the spinach artichoke dip. 

They have awesome drink happy hour selection, but the food.... Save your money on more drinks and skip them. 

Happy hour portions of appetizers are very small. The calamari doesn't even look like calamari. Lol. Spinach artichoke dip was pretty good, but you get a way bigger portion for around the same price at like YardHouse.

The service was awesome tho! Wish I can say that about the food too."}
{"text":"I am giving this 5 stars not because of the food which was good but for rather the outstanding customer service we received from the server we had. Her attention to detail the care that Letashia showed was beyond belief. She is without a doubt an Amazing individual."}
{"text":"This claim jumper has always been hit and miss. The last two times, it has became a lot better. Lunch and Happy Hour visits. The hand battered lemon pepper fried zucchini was outstanding. They have a new recipe for their thai slaw. Less sweat and a bit of horseradish now. Window Maker hamburger was excellent, but very big. It was a bit messy (But to be fair, I am a messy eater). Overall, much better than past experiences. I'm giving it only three stars, but will increase it to four if they maintain their recent improvements."}
{"text":"First of all I want to say that Desirae is an amazing server.  Excellent communication skills, very sweet, genuine and we could tell she was enthusiastic about her job.  She made our dining experience over the top.  I ordered steak & coconut shrimp and my husband ordered the rib eye.  Clam chowder was delicious and the hot cheesy bread was crazy good.  The only reason I'm doing 4 stars is because my steak was a bit overdone (ordered Medium) I did not express this to Desirae so she didn't know.  It's fine because we will come next year when we work the Aloha Festival. Thank you Desirae for your positive attitude and making us feel so welcome."}
{"text":"Management is rude. Only good thing about this place is happy hour and a handful of employees. Most are pretty rude"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, never by choice. 

I can't really knock the service too badly as they don't seem any better or worse than any other chain on a busy night, but the food is just not very good. It's also pretty expensive for what you get. I always leave feeling like I would have been better off going somewhere else and either paying less for the same kind of food, or paying the same for way better food. I avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"Met friends for drinks here on Saturday night.  I had been here once before during happy hour and the food/drink specials at the bar were great!  Another time I went for lunch and felt jipped by the prices, but I guess that's because the happy hour deals were so good.  

I do like the atmosphere of this restaurant - much nicer than an Applebees or Friday's but not \"stuffy\" or too fancy.  Just right for a casual lunch or meeting friends for an \"easy\" dinner and drinks night out.  The service has always been good here but still, I can't help but thinking that I'm never blown away by the food.  

I think the thing that was most surprising was that they were getting cleaned up and ready to close at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  We had to move the gathering back to the house. 

I think I'll keep this on my list of \"pretty darn good happy hours\"."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME experience there!  I am a vegetarian and the waitress and the kitchen staff went above and beyond to make me a veggie sandwich that wasn't even on the menu.  At times people get really annoyed when you ask for things not on the menu but I couldn't have anticipated such accommodation!  They were so kind and the sandwich was amazing!!!!  Thank You Claim Jumper!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken pot pie and was pretty good, also ordered the cheeseburger...not so good. The bun tasted really grilled, tasteless beef, under cooked for medium, stringy fries....just couldn't eat. Thankfully Waite staff had it removed from our bill. 

Not sure will return, menu was so so and thus experience left us, we'll blaugh."}
{"text":"i ate the clam chowder bowl here. it was just okay. when i got the bowl of soup, it was lukewarm even though i waited quite a while for it to be served. the soup was a little more creamier than i would have liked, but if you are a fan of thick soup, then this might be your bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Service was incredible. The lunch plate with pork ribs was amazing. 10 thumbs up!!! Service is always perfect. A must for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Not good at all. Food wasn't cooked well at all. Service was horrible. Took forever to get food. Nobody was in the restaurant so not sure why it took so long. Expensive for what you get. Never will go back."}
{"text":"I love their new revamped menu it's got so many yummy options that are light and fresh.  I loved their Southwest eggrolls and Shrimp salsa which is Ceviche and their Chinese salad is sooo Yummy too.  We'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I know this is crazy but I really enjoyed my FREE lunch today!! I have the Landry's card and they give a $25.00 credit for your birthday month. I decided to use it here for a quick lunch since it was going to expire.

I had a cup of potato cheddar soup and half a chicken salad sand. Wow it was huge and so good. Bread was made in house and melted in my mouth. Delicious!

The bf had the pot pie, also huge and thought it was delicious. They have a very large selection for lunch specials. The service was really good and I even got a red velvet cupcake. I did not pay a cent for this meal. The Landry's card is so awesome!!"}
{"text":"We used to really like this place. I generally would go for the same dish- the black tie chicken pasta. 
We went last night though and it was not at all good.  I always get the chicken on the side, and they didn't bring it with my meal, so they had to go back to the kitchen and brought it about 5 minutes later.   They maybe give you a scant 1/4 cup of chicken now, and it is not by any means blackened. It tastes either pre cooked or boiled and their 'blackened' seasoning tastes like oregano and (maybe- if any) black pepper.  It was pretty awful. The pasta was a little greasy and bland on its own. 
My boyfriend had the tri-tip.  It was alright but nothing special, it was also served a little cold do he was disappointed about that.
They used to do a really good job with their food, its too bad their prices went up and the quality went down."}
{"text":"First time coming here and have been waiting on our food for over 20 minutes. This was after we got our soup and salad that took 15 minutes to arrive. Our server is very nice and has been helpful, so I don't believe it's her fault. I think the problem is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have been to claim jumpers quite several times and it has been a different experience each time.  

A few times before the service was slow and the waiter would never stop by and refill our drinks.  It would take at least 30 minutes to get out food out and another long wait to get our checks.  However, lately I've been seating at the saloon/bar area and the service is great and gotta love the happy hour.  Decent prices and the food is good especially the pretzels! Also, one of my favorite desserts that they have is the chocolate chip calzone, it is amazing.  especially if you love chocolate and its pretty filled with chocolate goodness :) its always worth getting."}
{"text":"The gimmick of this establishment lies in the ridiculous portion size. One meal at Claim Jumper can feed two people easily. With the relative low cost, this place is great for big families. 

At one time, I truly enjoyed this place. Now, not so much. The food is nothing special. I came here with a friend that prefers American food, so we stopped by after he got off work. Navigating the menu for something light can be difficult due to my introductory paragraph. For those who are cautious about what they eat, during lunch time they do offer a cup of soup and a salad or half a sandwich and salad. I decided on the former. Opting for the French onion soup and California citrus salad, it was enough to fill me without making me feel sluggish. The soup was salty, but the crouton and melted cheese helped mellow it down. The salad was delicious. The mixture of Mandarin orange slices, cranberries, candied walnuts, avocado, and lettuce tossed in a citrus vinaigrette is wonderful on a hot day. The salad is a nice blend of sweet, tart, and creamy. Usually it comes with bleu cheese, but I find the flavor overbearing, so I asked for mine without. The combo comes with your choice of bread; you can choose between corn muffin, blueberry muffin, cheese toast, or a sourdough biscuit. I chose the corn muffin. They are large, but dry. With the butter they provide, it probably would have been more moist, but usually corn bread is rich enough.

The service here is simple, neither remarkable or contemptible. When we needed refills, they were taken care of."}
{"text":"Claim Jumpers is consistent no matter where you go. I tend to find that the food is acceptable, but not awe inspiring. This is the place to go for a lot of food for little cost. Most of the portions are good enough for two or more.

Even though my friends and I were not too hungry, the appetizer, soup, and sliders were enough to put us pass satisfied. The calamari ($11.99) were cut from some monster squid that always makes me think of eating rubber bands. The French Onion soup survived the down scale in size that some other dishes did not. The sliders came in an order of four with a pile of shoestring fries. Another friend had joined later on. He ordered the chicken tortilla soup and a chicken bow tie pasta. With an alcoholic drink, the total bill came to less than fifty before tip. I always enjoy the French onion, but otherwise it was a mediocre meal. If you have many people who cannot agree, this would be a safe option to satisfy the masses."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. It took over 20 minutes just to get drinks, the appetizer took forever to the point we almost had it cancelled. Almost an hour later all four entrees arrived. The reason I'm not rating it less than 3 stars is due to the fact that the food was really good. The grilled fish tacos and the BBQ chicken sandwich were delicious and the children's menu pizza was very good size for a children's menu item."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the service! With our big family it's never easy going out to eat. Not only was the staff extremely friendly and had patience while we tried to figure out the best things to order for us all, but they offer a FREE baby plate with applesauce, oyster crackers, cheese and mandarin Oranges. How extremely thoughtful. Something to keep your picky baby eater busy while you enjoy your meal! The little things go a long way. We will be back to feed our pack of hungry kiddos!"}
{"text":"Came in with my date while we were shopping in Town Square Mall. Approximately 70% of the seating was empty. When we came in the host said it would be quite a wait for a table. What?! The place is more than half empty! At that I wanted to just walk out as I realized I was dealing a mismanaged restaurant, but then the host says we could sit in the bar area. We walk to the bar area and every friggin seat is taken, so we sat at the bar. 

The bartender was the waiter and of course it took forever for him to acknowledge us because he had to wait on 50 other people. When he takes our order I specify \"no cheese and no tomato\". The food took forever and guess what...I got tomato and extra cheese. I also ordered a salad and guess what...they forgot to bring it.

The food was gross. It was obviously microwaved garbage out of the freezer. Tasted nasty. I took a few bites and the bartender places the bill on the bar in front of me... $65 !!! Seriously? I get better food and service at Dennys for $10. 

I called the manager over. He was very nice. I told him that I'm not paying for this horse crap on a plate they placed in front of me because it was completely wrong and the taste was terrible.

SERVICE: zero stars
QUALITY OF FOOD: zero stars

I will NEVER return to this place."}
{"text":"My family and I were at The Claim Jumper a few weeks ago.  The food was good.  But the really remarkable thing was the service by Christopher!  He was awesome!  It was very busy and he had many tables to cover, but provided great food advice, was pleasant and humorous and obviously really liked what he was doing!  Good work, Christopher!"}
{"text":"Went here recently for a birthday dinner with the parents. We had 4 adults and 2 kids and were seated in one of the large booths and had drink orders taken immediately. Our waitress Nina, however was far more interested in talking to the guys at the table next to us than serving us. We ordered 3 appetizers and they were all delivered by someone else thankfully. We ordered a second round of cocktails, but was able to get them from another server before Nina returned to say she was going to put in the order for us. The food was all decent. I got the ribs since I was in the mood for them, and they didn't disappoint. It was painful waiting 20+ minutes for our check as we watched our waitress flirting 5 feet away. This might have been a great experience if it weren't for the service."}
{"text":"I have been in Las Vegas for over 8 years now and I have never been to any of the Claim Jumpers before. Love their food! We had great service. Very fast and efficient. Our server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a party here with family recently and was severely underwhelming. This experience is everything you would expect from a restaurant right in the Arizona Mills parking lot. We had been planning this event for a while and had been in contact with the restaurant about our details. Day of, we entered a steaming hot and narrow room where no tables were set up for catered party. There was trash in a corner of the room along with broken tables and chairs stored there. There was a TV but none of the channels changed because the remote controls all of the TVs in the restaurant so that was lame. The food itself was mediocre, and we were served like we were at a feeding trough even though this was a reserved party. They brought out the food in aluminum takeout containers so we could just line up and scoop from it I guess? The portions were not really that big either so an 8-10 of noodles really could only feed like 6 people. Unsure of what they were trying to do or not trying to do? Not a very good experience and reconfirmed why I had never been here before to begin with. Yuck."}
{"text":"I have always loved the claim jumper.  Their chicken is the best.  For a chain restaurant the do a good job.  Service is great and do is the food.  I have one complaint. I ordered the big sampler. Had chicken,  ribs,  sirloin. The menu said a half rack of baby back ribs.  I got 4 very small ribs. I don't think there is an animal that walks the earth with 8 small ribs like those were.  Otherwise the rest of the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Well what a difference a few months make! Family in town last week, had a couple of kids with them, they wanted to go to dinner and asked about Claim Jumper, with fingers crossed, we took them, and we came away surprised and happy with our visit. 

So we decided to try again tonight to see if the quality and service had truely improved or last week was a fluke. We  can say yes it has improved!

Our server was friendly and attentive, bringing extra ranch for our app and making sure we had full glasses and plenty of napkins, not to mention asking if we were enjoying the food. 

My husband and I can eat, so this was a challenge, we got fried zucchini strips as an app and for the two of us, it was way too much, about 15-18 sticks fully breaded, fried golden and extra crispy!

For entree's I got the full order chicken fried steak and my husband got the fish and chips. Everything was crispy, tasty and warm. I stiil feel their mash potatos are too thick and dry, but seasoned welled. My chicken fried was really heavy on the breading but crispy and tender, so overall, a good meal, much better than 10months or so when we last ate. Will move this place back up my list of good deals!"}
{"text":"Server. LeAnn ...  was great .....but I got a shrimp that wasn't deveined !!! Not good !! Poor quality  control !!! Then the manager delivered  replacement that still were not  cleaned still had shell and legs on them ..... Worst thing is manager offered shrimp replacement and then charged me for them ???? Really wtf !!!!  Always have enjoyed claim jumpers !! Service is always superb !!  Fried zucchini is a great starter !! The happy hour specials make a good thing ... Even better ask to sit in Leann sections you won't be sorry !!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm CJ just isn't that good anymore.  Today we ventured to the Green valley location and it was just \"ok\".  Service was also just \"ok\" but the food was less than satisfactory.  I think the presentation was the most disappointing.  We ordered the app of shrimp ceviche and chips. Everything was just thrown on the plate - it was so messy.  They no longer have the turkey dinner so I opted for the tri tip. It was a bit dry and the muffin was way too sweet (sugar coated....ugh overkill...lose the sugar).  Kids pizza was decent sized but that was it....prices are high, a little too high for the food that was served.  I think the Towne Center location is Prob a little better than this one. Maybe one benefit is this is not as crowded....but that's it."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with my fiance for dinner. We were both starving and it was the closest place to eat. Our waiter was super awesome and attentive, but the food was...just mediocre. I got the Absolut Tortellini and my fiance got the BBQ Burger. I asked for mine without the bacon and the chicken because I've never like the combination of meat in my pasta. He told me he could take the bacon pieces out, but the sauce was cooked with bacon grease. I still decided to give it a try, which was a mistake. I am okay with eating bacon and bacon flavor (I'm not a vegetarian or vegan) but it just did not go well with the meal. I don't know if eating it with the chicken would have made it better, but after a few bites I had to stop because the grease was just so thick and outweighed the taste of everything else on the dish. Not to mention, it was $17.99 and I felt that for such a high priced pasta it should have tasted better.

I would be willing to eat here again, but I will probably pick something safer to try - something that can't be messed up."}
{"text":"After not going to the restaurant for a while we decided to head over there tonight. What a mistake that was. Had 1 waitress & then we had a waiter. The waiter had so much cologne on it was over powering & we couldn't wait for him to leave the area. Our salads came out & then we were told we had to wait for bread since it wasn't ready. No problem. Then it came out - hard as a rock. The table next to us were tapping their bread with a fork saying how hard their bread was. Next our dinners came out. The meat was like shoe leather & the shrimp was like chewing on cardboard. I have never had such a bad meal. Although the manager took off 1 meal it it still left a bad taste. Prices seem extreme for the poor quality."}
{"text":"Fantastic discovery! I just moved to Phoenix and didn't eat here for weeks, but what a treat!  I've been several times now and the staff are very friendly and it's just nice to see genuine smiles and service that exceeds expectations.   For a place that has soooo much to choose from, I admit, it amazed me that everything I've gotten thus far was so delicious.. from a simple, basic club sandwhich with a spicy Thai cole slaw, to a ...huh?  Jamaican Jerk Sweet Potato?  Not sure who came up with such an unlikely combination but this thing was absolutely off the chain delicious! Fair to say, that unless you are eating at a truly fancy restaurant with an artistic chef, you are not going to get such a creative combination.  I probably don't even need to mention the desserts.. the chocolate cake \"slice\" probably weighs in more than most whole cakes, but besides having it to snack on for days, it is one of the very best I have had, and I really love a great quality, moist chocolate cake.  From a basic hearty Chicken Pot pie, to a nice steak, this place is a really great experience, and you won't leave hungry, that's for sure.  Geez, I just talked myself into going again right now after I post this."}
{"text":"I realize I'm being overly aggressive with this rating but I am sitting here, as I type, fuming at how long it's taken. We got here at 417 and it's now 542 and we still don't have our check. THREE tables that came after us got served first and have already eaten, paid and left. Mind you, I'm here with one other person. We didn't even order appetizers. 

The steak was cold when I finally got it but I didn't dare say a word as it's taken over an hour to get two steaks. Their broccoli was 3.75 extra and was so crunchy it's hard to tell if it was even steamed. Our total for two iced teas, two steaks and two salads came to 53.73 which would have been fine IF I wasn't watching now a 4th table leaving that came after us. What's even worse is a manager came over to let us know their was a backup in the kitchen, yet I've timed it and no one had waited as long as us. 

Here it is 549 and we are still waiting for him to come pick up our card so I'm going to pay upfront ... Because apparently he's never coming back  
NEVER COMING BACK!!"}
{"text":"That was the worstEST restaurant I have ever been! Service was horrible. They made my handicap aunt to get out from the scooter and walk. They didn't cook the food the way we asked. And instead of recooking they just brought it back with the bite on it. The manager called my husband sweety twice, which no-no in a restaurants!! This is my first bad review ever!! NEVER EVER COME TO THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had anything that I don't love here.   My favorites are the CJ honey blonde, the shrimp salsa, and the Jamaican jerk chicken stuffed sweet potato! If you love sweet potatoes, that one is ridiculously flavored packed! Try it, you will not be let down, or leave hungry. Finish up with the original cream cheese pie with Lorna Doon crust, mm scrumptious! Or, for you chocolate fanatics, dig into a Huge Chocolate Mother lode cake! It's massive, decadent, and perfect with coffee or a salted Caramel Martini!!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my last experience at Claim Jumper.  The beer comes out ice cold in a frosted glass and the sangria was good.  The food was good, not the best, but a good value.  The dessert is always amazing and the main reason why we went out.  It had been over a year since we had last ate at a Claim Jumper, but we were in the mood for a good dessert and a nice meal and the Chocolate Chip Calzone was calling our names.  One of the best simple desserts around."}
{"text":"Great trip tip dip sandwich. I'll come back anytime for that."}
{"text":"I am commenting on Thanksgiving Day food at the Tempe CJ.  I have not been to Claim Jumper in years and had fond memories of the fresh and large portions they typically serve. I was so disappointed yesterday (Thanksgiving Day) to get such small portions with lacking taste. We were all hoping to eat off the regular menu but they only offered a limited menu of Turkey, Prime Rib, Salmon and Tri-Tip.  My Tri Tip steak was at room temperature, dry and so chewy I had to send it back. I ordered it medium rare and it was almost raw. The waitress was very nice and took it back and brought back a medium cooked portion which I could chew and she was kind enough to bring some sauce for me to cover the dryness. Again is was at room temperature.  My friend had salad and it was the smallest portion I had ever seen served at any restaurant.  I ordered soup (claim chowder) and it was also very small but the best thing I ate there.  The mashed potatoes was also a small portion, dry and tasteless and we all had to ask for gravy to flavor them.  The vegetables, carrots, onions, and squash were fair and all very low cost. This may sound petty but CJ is known for fresh food and  large portions and I expected the side orders would at least be their normal size given the price we paid.  I ordered the apple pie and it tasted like a store bought pie and was incredibly tasteless.  I only took a few bites and didn't bother finishing it.  In summary, the waitress was great but the holiday dinner was very disappointing.  I only wish I had taken pictures to add to this post."}
{"text":"we came here for pre dinner cocktail drink. I went with a st michelle riesling and mr h went with a blue moon. nice bar and our server's name was Lynne. she was pleasant and quickly brought out our drinks. I don't normally eat at CJ 's because the portions are ginormous but I do like them for a quick drink, happy hour and maybe an appetizer to share. i would suggest folks have dinner here if they want to get super full and burpy."}
{"text":"Service was ok!

Waitress was very nice but absent most of the time :)


They definitely pay more attention to the bigger table and never get back to you if you are a smaller table which is crap.

Prices were too high for what I tasted, I can't justify the quantity nor the quality for what I paid.

Waitress was overwhelmed with a large table which made our wait longer.

Manager was pea-coking around knowing we were waiting for our food for a while and never bothered to help her.

Beer was expensive :$

It's honestly not that great of a place besides the furniture but I'm not eating the furniture.

Food wasn't that great honestly we could of went to any burger joint or wing joint and got the same thing for a cheaper price if not half and immediate service.

The music that played in the background was loud and more like a diner or a breakfast place music, then it was punk rock, honestly it was annoying.

With the ok service and the little food and the high bill, I definitely wouldn't tempt myself to come here again.

Few years ago Claim Jumper had huge portions of great tasting food and great prices, I don't feel it is the same place :$

Took a good wait to get her to come back and bring the check, god what a hassle.

Paper bill came without even a folder and was wet and crappy.

They do deserve zero star and I paid for what I got :) and there is nothing else to say.

Point blank."}
{"text":"Always go for the chicken tortilla soup. Can say enough good things about the happy hour menu, friendly service and as part of Laundry's you can build points towards discounts."}
{"text":"First and last time here. The menu is boring, Nothing special. Service below average. Food is greasy and portions are huge but taste bland."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great happy hour, great restaurant.  We have been here so many times, and have never been disappointed.   I don't think there's a bad thing on the menu.  Just be prepared to get a ton of food, so it's worth the money.  We usually have a take home bag. If you're on a tight budget,  enjoy the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I keep coming back here to see if they will dissapoint.  No dice.  Always good, ordered grilled chicken. I'm a creature of habbit.  Staff friendly, service fast, seated quickly.  

If you are looking for a great solid filling meal.  This is the place."}
{"text":"Tried CJ's because a friend gave us a gift card. SERVICE: We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door; told hostess we wanted to sit in the bar and she immediately took us to a table/booth. The service was fast getting our drinks - i wasn't sure what i wanted in a craft beer, so the bartender brought me three samples of her recommendations, awesome; we ordered an appetizer and asked that we finish that before our main course was delivered. The waiter was great, he even asked us 3/4 through our appetizer if we wanted him to put our food order in - that is great service. FOOD: We both had the sliders; they were very, very good, and perfect portions, the meat was tender and spiced just right, french fries were hot, crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside.
We have been back twice since, and have not been disappointed - will come here again when we are in the Avondale area. Updated stars to 3 as I didn't mean to give 4."}
{"text":"My husband had a birthday reward through our Landry's membership so we decided to try out claim jumper. We ordered a California pizza, and a grilled cheese both were pretty good. We then ordered a chocolate chip calzone which was delicious. The manager Samuel was very attentive, and made sure we had a pleasant dining experience.  Our waiter David was equally attentive, and came around often. They seemed to genuinely care if we had a pleasant dining experience, and did everything they could to make that possible. The prices were reasonable, but the exceptional service is what will definitely bring us back out again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place (used to be 4-5 stars). But was so disapointed when we had lunch there yestereday. 1st of all the 2 items we ordered on their lunch menu was the same exact price as on their regular menu haha. That's no biggie but their food was horrible and what used to be large portions are now about 1/2 to 2/3 the size (depending on whats ordered) and no longer good. I had mozarella sticks which used to be a lot and yummy, soso now. The real dispaointment was the calmari. It tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp forever. It was limp and soggie. I took it home and put it in the toaster oven and it tasted better than at the restaurant, yikes. Dh ordered their widow maker and it was seriously cold. The whole thing was just cold, not even luke warm, it was weird. They made him a new burger and comped us for it but the food over all was still just not good. My dds had the potato cheddar soup and they changed that recipe. It used to be my favorite soup ever, definitely not anymore :( We will not be going back there at all!!"}
{"text":"I just had the best grilled california cobb sandwich, but subbed with fried chicken.  My wife had the chicken fried chicken with mash potatoes, and it was amazing as well.  My daughters chicken nuggets were great and she is a pickey eater.  Service was perfect.  Smiling server and good food, thats all i ask for and this visit nailed it.  My family and will definatly be back!"}
{"text":"Got the grill chicken Cobb sandwich with good a  cheese and chiootle aoli.  The Baum sliced chick sand.  Betho was our waiter he hooked up the LIIT !  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Wow....this place has changed a lot in the past 8 years.  No longer have the garlic mashed potatoes, use to get the Cobb salad and now it is half the size but more for the money, it seems the portions have gotten smaller and the prices of everything has gone up and the menu options have grown.  There is now pizza on the menu, it would take at least 20 mins to read the menu and that means you are going to be waiting another 20 more mins for an appetizer and then 20 mins for your meal. That is to long to wait for food and plus the time you had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Give the chicken pot pie a try, its enough for two and very good. my only fault with the pot pie would be the salt level is just a tad bit more than i need."}
{"text":"I've been to this location so many times, I've lost count. I checked in today and it said this was my first check in. What?! Well, a review is long overdue.

If you're a fan of huge portions and a very broad menu, Claim Jumpers will not disappoint. The staff is very friendly and the food I've ordered has never been anything less than amazing. The prices are a little steep, so don't go in expecting neighborhood diner prices. But you get what you pay for and that's excellent food. Certain I'll be back a few more times in the near future. The places is overall clean and presentable so I give kudos to management and staff. Great job and keep up the good work. This visit was for my Mom's 80th birthday pre-celebration and they gave her a free piece of red velvet cake with a candle. They didn't light the candle however (weird) but that's ok. :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Our waiter was very understanding and accommodating concerning my food allergies. The whole kitchen and management were alerted so that there were no accidents."}
{"text":"First, a little back story.......
I have fond memories of eating at Claim Jumper a decade and more ago, before it changed ownership.  I remember extra large white plates full of extra large helpings of delicious food, garnished with lettuce and an apple.  Portions were so big that I had a guaranteed left over meal for the next day.  Oh, the Ore Cart and Whisky Chicken..... Claim Jumper used to be a very enjoyable experience, a special meal, one of those places you looked forward to dining at! 
   Well, times changed and Claim Jumper was sold to a large restaurant conglomerate.  We watched the portion size shrivel, we watched the menu selection get smaller and smaller, and we said goodbye to pretty plating with lettuce and an apple.  The quality of food and overall integrity of the original Claim Jumper theme eventually changed so much that we wrote off the chain completely. 
Enter Las Vegas, August 2015.......
  On our most recent Vegas trip we found ourselves in downtown around dinner time, right next to the Golden Nugget.  I rely on the Golden Nugget as the nicest downtown Hotel/Casino.  As we strolled through the Casino looking for dining options we saw a sign for the Claim Jumper.  We decided to give Claim Jumper a nostalgic visit for dinner.... 3 adults and 4 kids.
-It's very busy and seems to be the obligatory \"24 hour cafe/restaurant\" of the Hotel.  This is not necessarily a bad thing..... Grand Lux Cafe at Venetian / Palazzo is owned by the Cheesecake Factory....and it's terrific.  
-Service was friendly and just fine
-The obligatory bread plate was a big doughy mess swimming in butter.
-The shrimp pasta should have been called pasta soup since it was sitting in a 3/4\" deep pool of melted butter and oil.  My kids took one bite of the shrimp and declared that they would not eat it because it tasted like chemicals.  My kids love grilled shrimp.
-Grilled chicken salad was on par with what I expect from a fast food restaurant.
-I ordered the Loco Moco which is hard to mess up.  White rice, hamburger patty, fried egg, gravy.  It was just that, and it was fine.
-Overall the food was pretty bad, I will NEVER return.

The Claim Jumper you knew as a kid is dead!  The only thing left from the good old days is the name, which is the only reason why customers dine here.  If this restaurant was named Jimmys Diner it would be empty.  It's sad that this once famous name has been dragged through the mud and tarnished beyond repair.

A funny side note-  As we were walking out of the hotel after dinner I bumped into a colleague who was staying at the Nugget.  I told her we just finished having a terrible meal at Claim Jumper.  She told us that she'd dined there the previous night, ordered the shrimp pasta, sent it back and left the restaurant without eating!"}
{"text":"We used to visit Claim Jumper at least once a month when we first moved to LV back in 2003. But in the last 5yrs we haven't been very often, not because we didn't like the food, just not any particular reason. We often talked about going just never made it. After reading reviews, was a little hesitant to go, but decided to give it a shot to see for ourselves. We went at about 1130a and the restaurant was nearly empty. We remembered how big the portions were, so as usual my daughter and I shared an entr√©e. We got the Chicken cobb sandwich with fries. Hubby ordered the fried zucchini appetizer which was new to us, and the widow maker burger with fries and a wedge salad. Other daughter ordered the fish and chips with a ceasar salad. 

Never to disappoint , the appetizer and entree's were more than enough. fried zucchini was so good, I ate quite a few pieces. The cobb sandwich had a nice lite bun. but I didn't even finish half of the half I had because I ate some of hubbys wedge salad and a couple bites(2) of his burger, plus some of the fries. We were all pleased with our orders and service. We didn't get the motherlode cake for dessert as we used to do in the past, just box it right up. We were already bringing home leftovers. 

All in all, it was a good experience for us. by the time we left the restaurant, it was pretty full."}
{"text":"This location is exceptional, great service right when you walk in. Everyone was consistent. Food came fast, taste was great.. There is a kids menu.. Only thing is that the spaghetti lacked sauce so they gave us an extra small bowl to fill it up. 
Nice place, clean & most of all- great service!"}
{"text":"The server was awesome and all the staff rocks but the portions aren't as big as they used to be, and the food is lukewarm but you still can't beat the chocolate cake!"}
{"text":"I find restaurant naming conventions interesting...for whatever reason...I'm glad they put that much thought into naming these things.

If it were up to me to name these places, I doubt I could come with something witty and charming.

Claim Jumper for example.

Claim Jumping was a particularly heinous crime back when I was young and the earth was still cooling...punishable by some particularly unhappy ways to \"meet ones maker\" as meted out by the rough frontier justice of the time.

That's possibly the origin of the name \"Claim Jumper\" for this place...eating here could certainly contribute to your premature demise...we saw a number of people that are clearly Knock, Knock, Knockin' on heaven's door...at 4,000 calories per serving:)

I would call this place \"Jumbo Food\" or \"Mega Portions\" or \"Godzilla Grazing\" or something like that...but it's not up to me:)

Claim Jumper is mostly about quantity...not to say there food isn't OK...it is...just OK...especially if you are in the moo'd (get the bovine reference:) for something that will satiate your hunger until sometime next month:)

The Beautiful Carin and I have been  here a few times over the years and it's great for when you haven't had a chance to get to the grocery store...a meal here will provide leftovers to feed you for the remainder of the week...just add a glass of water:)

We went back to Claim Jumper the other evening, to meet a friend and have a little dinner (a euphemism if ever there were one:)

On this visit, Carin had a 55 gallon drum of Chopped Cobb Salad and I had the  1/2 order of Chicken Fried Steak (I know they call it \"Country Fried Steak\" but it's not steak any more than it's chicken so...)

The  1/2 order was only 15 lb's of thickly crusted cube steak, mashed potatoes and gravy (gravy on everything is always a plus BTW:)

How on earth can anyone but the 1,000 pound man eat the full order of this?!?! 

I am honestly not complaining about the size of the portions (well, not in any real way), but how did \"double\" become the serving size of choice?...Just curious:)

We took home more than  1/2 of our dinners and DeeDee was thoroughly delighted with us..esp. the Chicken Fried Steak...she's not much of a salad eater:)

You know what, there are certainly worse chain and non-chain restaurants around and even though I am giving them crap about serving sizes, Claim Jumper staff are always nice to us and the service has always been above average:)

So I say, let's not hate them because you need a shovel to get around on that platter they call a \"dinner plate\"...go see them when you're headed out for survival training for a few weeks and you're going to need a few thousand extra calories to stay alive:)"}
{"text":"When am I going to get my desire for unhealthy foods out of my system?? Here I am again, eating burgers and fries. This time at Claim Jumper which, I am told, is known for their good burgers. I ordered the cheeseburger with double cheese (hold the Thousand Island, please).  That burger was gooooooood!!!  Oh, man.

But before the burger, we had appetizers. My friend had a couple of pomegranate sangrias, which she liked a lot. We shared pretzels, which were YUMMY, and tried the chicken wings, which were also deelish. The medium ones were tingly, but not unpleasantly spicy. She said her spicy wings were only slightly spicier than the mediums.

Back to the burger: I ordered it medium rare and it was juicy and pink. The toasted bun had just the right amount of crunch, and the lettuce and tomato were very green and red, respectively- almost made me feel better for eating a burger.  The string fries were good- nothing special, but tasty.

Claim Jumper doesn't stand out to me as being any better or more memorable than any other chain restaurant of its ilk, which it why it gets 3 stars. It does a good job for what it does. Decent food, decent service, friendly & casual atmosphere. Definitely a contender for a friends' night out, a casual date, or family meal kind of thing."}
{"text":"Lunch was great.  I like this place in general, but I am not that impressed with the prices.  The lunch specials are worth the trip.  The kids menus are good.  Had a great sandwich and soup combo.  The reason for the three stars is that there are so many place in Town Square to choose from, this place does not stand out.
IMO, one highlight of this place is that my husband LOVES the meatloaf.  It is better than average and if you have a desire for it, then it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper has become my go-to happy hour place.  Seating in the bar is usually not a problem.  The food deals are a steal.  

Some of my favorite happy hour food items: the small salads, loaded skins, street tacos, calamari, and spinach artichoke dip.  I wish the fries with the gravy sauce was still on there.  

I can't leave Claim Jumper without the butter cake dessert.  Even if I can only fit two bits, I will just take the rest home and have an amazing breakfast.  I keep meaning to try the new salted caramel butter cake, but then I forget when I am there!

Service is acceptable.  My girls and I have had days where we were slightly ignored due to how busy the establishment is.  I get it.  Most times I see it going that way, I make sure to grab the server and get the second drink ordered before I run out of the first one.  

Speaking of drinks, you can never go wrong with a glass of wine.  However, if you are so inclined, the lemon drop martini and raspberry martini are excellent.  I also like their mojito.  

Of course, the full menu is available in the bar area.  Claim Jumper has some solid fish and comfort food entries.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best place to have a decent cheap meal in Vegas, if u go on the happy hour u can't go wrong, its 3 to 7 , 2 tacos or sliders for 3 was a killer deal, couple of those alone would be a meal. I think the happy hour is only at the bar area though. Me and a couple of friends went there and had a bunch of stuff. The Willow maker burger was a good deal for 7 on the happy hour menu. The chicken pot pie was creamy and delicious also the beef kabob's were a decent with roasted veggies.  Overall everything that we ordered were pretty good not disappointed at all. They also have a huge menu with lots of different things to try, so i will definitely be back to try some other things on the menu. Or at least for some cheap happy hour burger shots.

4 people ate for about 70 bucks not bad and it was a bunch of food,"}
{"text":"The service & the pizza were very good. The problem arose when we opened the pricey slice of Motherlode cake we ordered to-go. It was a mess. Compare the photo of the piece they sent home with us to the one on their website!"}
{"text":"This Claim Jumper was inside the Golden Nugget Hotel.  They were crowded but we were seated right away.  The waiter was a riot, making jokes with my son and having a good time.  For an elderly man waiting tables, it was great to see such a fun personality.

The food was good.  My son's meal turned out to be way too spicy so we had to order another meal for him.  They didn't charge us for either one.  That is service!

The room service food is also prepared by the Claim Jumper.  I was further impressed by their service after I found that out.  The must be one hoppin' kitchen!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for good coconut shrimp. Not only do they have it here, but for Happy Hour it's a steal!

After doing some shopping in the rain, the bf and I worked up a healthy appetite and wanted something for lunch that wasn't the typical bar food. After walking all around town square we decided to drop into Claim Jumper to check out their menu. We'd both been to CJ in other states/locations but for whatever reason had never been to this one.

We were pleasantly surprised when we looked at their lunch menu, it was filled with salads and sandwiches, not the greasy cheeseburgers and fries we'd seen everywhere else. While he put more money in the parking meter I waited for a table. I noticed that right in the lobby they had a huge sign with their Happy Hour info. Being that it was a Saturday, I wasn't expecting to find a HH, but was thrilled to see we'd made it with 10 minutes to spare.

The HH specials are great (Check out my photos for a listing of offerings)! Tons of options for both drinks and food. We sat at the bar and were ignored for the first 7 or 8 minutes, we sat discussing whether or not they would let us order from the HH menu at this point. But when we were finally greeted our waitress didn't even glance at the clock. She happily took our order, got us our drinks and gave us a few more minutes before coming back to tell us it was last call for HH pricing. 5 stars for that service, most people/places would have told us we were out of luck.

Everything we tried was off the HH menu. We ordered 2 orders of the Coconut shrimp - 1 each. They came with 3 decent sized pieces of shrimp, 2 sauces and a spicy slaw like salad. The Shrimp was perfectly baked and left me wanting more. $6 each.

We also ordered 2 Mini Caesar Salads which were anything but mini! We could have shared one, although at $3 each, who cares? They were good but too many croutons for my liking.

We had an order of the Spicy Asian BBQ Wings - 6 wings plus carrots, celery and dressing for $5. These were tasty! I'm not a huge wing fan, so you know if I'm downing them they gotta be good..

Finally we had a couple of Mojitos $5 each on the HH menu. The consistency in flavor wasn't great, one was more minty than the other, but not bad none the less.

This will definitely be a spot I return to if only for the Coconut Shrimp, but knowing they have HH options that are outside the greasy bar food will likely bring me back as well.

TIP: Happy hour specials from $2. Mon - Fri 3pm - 6:30pm, Sat 11am - 3pm. Also during football season Sunday all day!"}
{"text":"Claim Jumper treats veterans like royalty, a choice of free meals and always fantastic service. We live in AZ and the restaurant was full of veterans, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Upscale Applebees?  I wouldn't know any other way to describe this place to someone.  Was in TSq for a movie and Brio was packed so we gave this place a shot.  Famous for their portions and general apathy for  human beings sodium/fat/calorie intake...my wife was excited.  

I got the steak and bean chili in a sourdough bowl which also came with 2 more pieces of bread for $10.  Exactly what I wanted and it totally hit the spot for a relatively cold Vegas evening.  My wife for some reason opted for the filet mignon.  I am totally against getting steaks at places like this unless they're dirt cheap since they would never ever compare to the greatness of so many steak places we've been to.  This wasn't cheap but $25 for everything (salad, sides, bread) was doable.  Everything on her dish was ok but the zucchini sticks were really good and went well with the beer.  

I didn't know they sold their own beer.  I had 2 large glasses of the red ale and thought it was great.  I could've gone for another if we had time.  

If we're back here...I think I would just opt for the bar and appetizer type food.  But then Miller's Ale House is a 2 min walk from here so I probably won't be back....maybe if we're with friends that have kids."}
{"text":"The location is convenient if you live on the west side of town.  We got there at 5:30 PM on a Sunday so it was not busy at all, so I figured we would get a table fairly quickly since there were so many open ones. 15 minutes later we were finally seated. As we were being led to the table I saw that more than half of the tables were still empty and thought there was no reason to have kept us waiting up front.  

Once seated, our drink order was taken right away, so I thought things would go better.  Unfortunately, I was wrong. The drinks came quickly, and our waiter took our food order promptly... so far, so good.  Our waiter then brought us a loaf of bread but no butter or anything to dip it in.  Another 20 minutes goes by and he finally comes by again just to let us know that our dinner would be coming out shortly and then promptly left before I could even ask for some butter for the bread which was now not even warm.

The food finally came to the table 10 minutes later. It was ok for a family restaurant so It was what I expected. My disappointment was in how long it took to seat us and how long it took to bring the dinner when the restaurant was not even busy.  Overall, it was just ok and would look at trying some of the other restaurants that are just minutes away from this one."}
{"text":"Truly amazing service we had today by Jared!!! He was attentive, sweet, and very outgoing. I don't live anywhere near this location, in fact it's about an hour away. But I will more then willingly make the drive to go and see him! I could not have asked for a better lunch."}
{"text":"We normally love this restaurant.  This visit, the service extremely slow for not being busy. The server was nice though  The quality of the dinner was lacking. The chicken fried steak was over salted and over done. The server did, happily bring us some thing else"}
{"text":"We went here last night with a group of 8 people and the food and service was absolutely perfect!  We had a waiter by the name of Dominic and he did an amazing job with the hospitality, going above and beyond what was needed for us."}
{"text":"its always way to cold in that restaurant!!! great service and food but my gosh, turn up the ac!"}
{"text":"We used to come here often. Lately the food has been average and the service unbearable. I could even handle average tasting food if the service made up for it, but I shouldn't have to ask for refills and for a check. Not with empty glasses and plates on the table. Too many other options around if I want to spend this type of money."}
{"text":"Walked in, quoted 30 min wait and it took about 10-15 mins.

Ordered a $5 marg, not great.

Ordered a house salad after asking if the salad had carrots and was assured it wasn't. It does.

My wife's salad had a short hair on her salad.
Took a while to get utensils.

Ordered the pot pie, it was good.

Was going to order dessert but the waitress took way too long to come back after dropping off the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped at the Claim Jumper because it was right next door to the hotel. Always thought this brand had a good reputation, but not at this one. Wednesday night, not real busy. Hostes seamed confused an overwhelmed even tho it was pretty slow. 2 of us waited 20 minutes for a table even tho there were many open. Server was ok but he seamed to be working his first day. Salads arrived but no silverware. Waited another 25 minutes and no dinners. Finally tracked down waiter we're our order was, said he didn't know but would check, that's when we decided to pay for our drinks and salads and call it a night. Maybe Mr. Landry should pay a little more attention to his restaurants and a little less to being a Billion dollar buyer."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it stinks of prejudice. Why are all the black people seated by the kitchen? How come I waited over 10 minutes for a server, before I decided to leave? The food is mediocre and, there are better places to eat that treat everyone equally."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised to find there was no wait on a Friday night. The place is pretty huge in the inside. Our server (Zaid) was very good as was the food. Good for outings with the FAM. I'm stuffed... Over ordered, again."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:30 on Tuesday. Had no wait was immediately sat at my choice of a booth or table.  

Food came out fast and was very tasty especially the spicy Asian wings."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Bit expensive. But if you find the dishes that are worth it then your good. Don't waste your time with the steaks. Not enough for the price. But burgers and seafood pastas wahoo!!!! The wait staff freaking amazing and atmusphere also great!"}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food.

Came here on a Friday night with my parents and bf and it took forever to order or get any service because the server rarely came by our table. It's understandably busy since it's a Friday night but we noticed that he would go back and forth to the other tables and ignored us until we finally asked someone to track him down. We ordered the Black Tie Chicken Pasta, the Ribeye, and the Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes with two clam chowders & the potato and cheddar soup. 

One word to describe the food: SALTY! So. So. Salty. We barely touched the meatloaf & mashed potatoes and even the soups because of how inedible it was! The Black Tie Pasta tasted like cafeteria food - so bland and DRY. We had to ask for extra sauce on the side and it still didn't help. 

The only thing we partially enjoyed was the Ribeye and the bread that they offered (which was also really hard to get because again, the server was a no show the entire meal.) 

We found it so funny that the server only started getting nice and showing up when we got the bill.

We decided not to complain since thankfully we had a gift card that paid for our meal but definitely not going to come back here again."}
{"text":"Well Corbin the server was awesome and attentive. The food......well for the prices and quality, it left a lot to be desired. Spinach artichoke dip had good flavor, but they served it with homemade tortilla chips that were salted and seasoned. Whose culinary expertise advised that? A salty chip takes everything away from the flavor of the dip, but Corbin understood and brought me bread very quickly......you know....the way it should be served. The Entree I picked was the RIBEYE with added bleu cheese and garlic butter, side Caesar, and triple cheese potato pancakes (upon recommendation). First, the Caesar  was good and I especially liked the homemade croutons. The rest left me unimpressed. The steak was a New York (lol or your cow was super skinny), it was cooked perfectly at med rare but it was tough and grainy (typical of sub par frozen meat), and they laid about a 1/4 cup of this bleu cheese butter on it (Bleu cheese is very strong and you don't need that much to accent a steak). A quarter of the steak was fat cap and silver skin.........really? The potato pancakes were miniature and fried in panko and very bland for being \"triple cheese.\" They have the prices of a high end restaurant but the culinary expertise of nothing close to that."}
{"text":"There is no better way to describe this place than A-OK. A well deserved 3 stars! 
Given we had a group of 25, I had fairly low expectations for the service, but they did an excellent job! From the time we sat down to the time we left it was just over two hours, which I think is pretty decent with a group that size! 

Now beware, the menu is huge. Pages on pages! I had my mind made up three different times and finally when put under some pressure, made a decision. I settled on the Frisco Burger and fries, a swiss cheese burger with thousand island dressing served on grilled parmesan sourdough (like toast, not a bun). It was tasty but nothing special. I actually wish it were served on a bun. If I were to describe my eating pace, I'd say its fairly normal (if I'm not lying, a little quicker than the average) and the bread quickly became soggy. The fries were also nothing special, thinly cut with a good crunch. Again, nothing wrong with the food but I could get a similar burger under ten bucks elsewhere. 

Overall, everyone in the group seemed content and no problems arose, but I think this is a one and done experience for me."}
{"text":"Since buying a home in the North Valley we have come to Claim Jumpers on several occasions;  the service has mixed but the food has been worth the trip.   The managers have always addressed the service issues;  (wrong item or not cooked right).  The deserts are very good."}
{"text":"If I could, I would have given 0 stars. My friends and I sat in the bar area for about 10 minutes without being greeted by a server nor were we given menus. To our surprise, a couple walked in 10 minutes after we did and was greeted before they even had the chance to sit down. I am really disappointed in this establishment and I hope no one has had the same  experience my friends and I had. If you're looking for efficient service, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here last night and noticed something was different. After reading others, now i know why. Corporate sell-out.

No matter. We still had a great time working our way through the Happy Hour menu. Asian wings were great and all drums. Whoohoo! Split a Widow burger (good but not great) and also had fried zucchini and chips and salsa. Salsa was very salty and garlic-y but very fresh. 

Overall, service was friendly and attentive even though there did seem to be a longer than normal wait for drinks to re-appear. Food was good and prices were average. Best part was, though, it was the deadest I've ever seen it. Thanks Corporate!"}
{"text":"I've seen Claim Jumper food and pies in the frozen food section, but had no idea there was an actual restaurant.  We visited the Claim Jumpers in the nice outdoor Town Square Las Vegas.  We did not expect the huge food portions.  Hubby had the chicken and ribs entr√©e and I had the Tilapia, and it was sooo delicious.  Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert because I love their coconut cream pie!"}
{"text":"Would happy hour I'm very happy I went here last night even though it's a chain the food was good and service was great and the food is super cheap durning happy hour."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here and was very impressed by the decor.  It has a real rustic feel to it, which you'd expect from a place called Claim Jumper. The food was good, portions were enormous and the desert was delicious.  I got the ribs and coconut shrimp with a carrot cake for desert."}
{"text":"We would have ordered dinner there this evening, unfortunately the waiter looked stoned and couldn't get our drinks order right. Actually he even forgot the order and let the drinks chill by the bar. He was stumbling onto the dining room chairs, gave us a bread dish at the same time as our bill. He was wacky! It's too bad because we like Claim Jumper. We cut our stay short and went on to another restaurant."}
{"text":"So yesterday 4 I was introduced to claim jumper as my supervisor did a lunch for his team 

I must of drove by one of the many locations in Las Vegas many times and never had the urge to go in

My mistake 
As I just got chicken tenders and fries my team ordered a bunch of different items and they all looked delicious 

Not a single complaint from my team 

My food was fabulous,  freshly battered tenders with some bring fabulous bbq sauce 

I wish I could remember the tall caucasian young male name who was our server, he need to be recognized for being one of beat servers I have dealt with in a long time"}
{"text":"We did not dine in, we did take out as we were staying at a room in the Golden Nugget. I called in the order for a chicken pot pie and a plain classic cheeseburger, added bacon and comes with a side of shoestring fries. The gal that took my order was super nice and told me it was a 10-15 minute wait. My boyfriend went down and said that the gal he interacted with down there was super nice. The order was ready at the timed promised and the order was correct. 

My pot pie was as big as my face! It was sooooooo yummy! I could barely eat it, I only ate about half of it before I got full. It had lots of big chunks of chicken, potatoes, peas, carrots, mushrooms, onions and the delicious creamy sauce. The crust was flaky and delicious! I was in pot pie heaven!!! It also came with a fruit cup, but mostly cantaloupe,  two grapes and three honeydew pieces. Wish it was more mixed up rather than more of one fruit over the others. 

My boyfriend's burger, according to him, was really good. The fries on the other hand were too salty for him. I tried the fries myself, and the fries were pretty salty. Perhaps ease up on the salt or just let the guest salt them themselves. 

Overall, I would order from here again if we were staying at the Golden Nugget (see my review, was not very fond of my stay there)."}
{"text":"So came here for dinner on Christmas Day.  It was a limited menu and not very inspired.  Items like baby back ribs, bow tie pasta with chicken, and chicken pot pie.  You would think that being Christmas they would have ham or turkey with mashed potatoes/gravy.  The service was slow but it was pretty crowded.  The food was just food.  Nothing special or inspired.  If this is what special day food is, I would hate to see everyday.  

Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper used to be sooooo good when they first opened.  The quality has gone way down IMHO.  I ordered a mushroom pasta and it was tasteless.  Service saved this place from 1 star.  Great service.  For the price I was very disappointed!  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Server messed up my order on accident and the wrong plate was brought out but when I brought it up to him he brought his manager over and they let me redo my order as well as keep the items that were already brought out and charged me for the cheaper of the two which I got to take home and save for later! Got nearly $40 worth of food for only $15, ANYWAY the generosity and kindness of the staff is one of the best I've seen in Phoenix, would highly recommend just based on the great treatment you receive from this place"}
{"text":"Been in Las Vegas for a week and came to CJ for first time and the service sucked as well did signature bar drinks kids wanted to give it a try again and well been sitting for 25 min no drinks yet had to order with bus boy haven't seen our waiter yet and its empty in here! Wont be back! Work on your service thats how you keep customers!"}
{"text":"After ordering food to-go several weeks ago, we were very impressed with the food! It was very flavorful and delicious. 
Last night, we decided to visit the restaurant for dinner. Unfortunately, our experience was less than pleasant. The air-conditioning was not working (which was miserable in this heat) and they had run out of several menu items (blood orange margarita, red velvet cupcakes). We ordered drinks and an appetizer and decided to order our entrees to go, because the heat was so uncomfortable. The food was great (worthy of five stars!), but we were very disappointed in the restaurant. Hopefully this was just a one-time experience, but we will be ordering food to-go if we eat here again."}
{"text":"Two people can eat form one item. Huge portions friendly service."}
{"text":"Service was terrible , had appetizers with no drink not even a water !!!!
Took 45 min for one steak and a soup.
The steak was 3 diff temps starting from 
Medium, medium rare and dam near blue.
Worst place in Vegas !
Save your money eat anywhere but here !!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Had Adimir as a server and he was so helpful and informative as to what to order as well as the history of the establishment. I ordered the jambalaya. It was the right amount of spicy. World defiantly recommend eating here while you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I upped my rating for the shear fact that they did right on the bone in rib eye( ordered medium again)Much better than last time. The server was attentive and the food was good as well as the portions."}
{"text":"Being it my first time coming here this past Sunday as well as it being my Birthday, I was not in the least bit impressed. We (party of 3) came in around 4:30pm and wasn't greeted for about 5 mins. We just stood there looking around for someone to say \"Welcome, we will be right with you\". Instead we sat there waiting.  The hostess finally showed up and helped the couple that was in front of us. She walked them to their seats and casually made her way back to the front. And by casually I mean she took her damn time. Finally, it was out turn. She goes \"how many\" I say 3, then there was some silence as I can only assume what you was doing was looking up where to sit us on the computer. Then said this way. No \"how's your day going\" or anything. Then we get seated in, i swear the most trafficked area of the restaurant. Mind you, there was hardly anyone there... tables were open all around yet we get placed right by where the waitresses go in and out of the kitchen. Then our waitress comes back about another 5 mins after being seated, apologized for the delay. Overall our waitress was good. Nice, friendly, didn't mess up our orders. However, when it was time to get our food, a different waitress brings it out. Gives the other 2 ppl in the party their food, then asks me if i ordered anything...instead of responding with a sarcastic no, i said yes and told her what it was. She said she would be right back and went into the kitchen and disappeared, never to be seen again. Another 5 mins past, my waitress walks by looks and obviously sees me with no food and runs into the kitchen. Then appears with my plate of food. The food itself was okay.  I got the pot pie...which lacked in any seasoning or flavor. I dont recommend it. 
Overall the experience was a bust. Sure, you could go and probably have a great experience but for me...ill go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't order the calamari, it was the worst and so chewy! I had a spinach salad, it was OK. My friend had tri-tip sliders on of which barely had any meet on it, but his fries were good. Service was very good which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Chain or no chain, Claim Jumper is a solid restaurant. I lived in a city filled with chain restaurants that constantly competed for attention and favor, and Claim Jumper survived due to its quality and goodness. It ain't the absolute best, I'll admit that - and neither is this specific one. But the waiter was pleasant and was quick to notice that we only wanted dessert (rather than pestering to try out other foods/drinks on the menu). The desserts were delish, though a bit dry in some rare bites. The atmosphere, cleanliness, and service were wonderful - would definitely come again."}
{"text":"There is food here.

There are some good beers here.

If you go on the Zappos tour you might consider stopping here for a meal or a drink.

It's a chain. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Came to try food with husband. The prices were on the high side so ordered a cheeseburger. When I took the first bite, realized it was too charred/burned. I cut the burger in half n tried to each the uncharred part, but still had the charred taste in my mouth. I lost my appetite. The waitress had not come to refill my water and had been gone for a while. We felt abandoned. I was frustrated and just wanted to leave. My husband advised me to inform the Manager; I told him what good what would it do. I would have to rewait for the food. On the way out, the Manager was by the exit; I decided to tell him what had happened to my cheeseburger. His response was, \"You should've told me, we would've fixed it.\" I told him to never mind. I didn't want to hear that. We came to eat. Part of the dining out experience is getting good service and unburned food. I was not looking for free food, but was not expecting his lame answer either. Yes, they probably would've fixed what they should've gotten right the first time, but I wouldn't have wanted to wait another long period of time for something they should've gotten right at a place like Claim Jumper. I am never coming back here again. It is expensive, the service is poor, and the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Bring a jacket! It's freezing in this place!!  The food is the same as any other Claim Jumper.  Service is okay, building is a bit smaller than other jumpers."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is one of those chain restaurants that gives you giant portion sizes, but the food really isn't anything to rave about. I went here with a few friends last Saturday after we had our comprehensive exam and it was just alright. I really wanted to order a soup and salad, but that lunch special is only offered on weekdays (which is weird...people don't want to eat something lighter on the weekends? hmmm) and in order to get soup and salad, even ordering the smallest portion sizes would have been around 13$ (which is ridiculous). So I ended up ordering the tomato flatbread appetizer and a cup of the potato soup. The flatbread was fine, nothing to get too excited about, but not bad. It had sundried tomatoes on the top and was a little garlicky. The soup, on the other hand, was not good. It was the weirdest tasting potato soup I have ever had. It had carrots in it and it just tasted almost sour. It started to separate (I could see the cream and the grease) before I stopped eating it about halfway through. My friends got sliders and sandwiches, which I guess is the way to go here  because they said it was fine, I just wish they had some half portion options or smaller salad/soup options for more reasonable prices for the kind of restaurant this is....a national chain."}
{"text":"We are longtime no EX-customers of CJ in Las Vegas (Summerlin). The service has really declined since they were bought out (or whatever) by Landry's. When I asked nicely where the order was (after 45 minutes), the waitress curtly answered \"It's being cooked\". Did she think I didn't know that?  Obviously, they've cut their kitchen staff. 
The food is still OK but with slow service such as we had last night, we've put this restaurant on our list of \"don't go back except under the direst of circumstances\"."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't so sure about this place. My husband and I came on a pretty quiet evening, but our waitress wasn't to personable and didn't seem to want to come by and check on us. My husband ended up ordering  the Jambalaya Pasta and I order the fish tacos. The tacos were amazing, and I loved them, filling and satisfying. My husband didn't get so lucky with them jambalaya, it was very bland and he informed our waitress. They willing replaced his meal, and the manager even tried the jambalaya and actually came back to our table and thanked my husband for speaking up about it, it was an of batch, and ended up giving us a free dessert. Knowing that the manager took pride in looking into the food just tells you they do actually care about what they are serving. We will certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"They have a gluten free menu and apparently anything can be made gluten free here.  Be sure to ask."}
{"text":"Went here either Friday or Saturday, don't remember. Ordered and split nachos, zucchini and a Guinness with my sister. Including tip, we were out of there for less than $25. Let's just say, the zucchini is off the chain!

There were some CRAZY chicks at the table next to us being a total PITA. Get this, so this woman orders the spinach artichoke dip, which is literally like 8 billion calories because it's about 22 lbs of cream cheese, shredded cheese, and honey bee's pollen basket amount of spinach, served in a 50 gallon bread bowl drum. This stuff is clearly going to be greasy and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know it's not diet food. So this chick has the audacity to tell our waiter, Jesse, who was off the chain, by the way, \"this is way too greasy for me to eat. I want something else.\" 

Long story short, home girl wasn't too happy when my sister and I were not so quietly commenting about how obnoxious it is to send back food for ridiculous reasons. I was amazed that a manager comped her for it! Insanity. Sometimes, the customer is definitely WRONG.

Oh, and I must mention, the music was a crazy contrast - Warren G. in a log cabin themed restaurant. What can I say, Warren G. is always appropriate."}
{"text":"Food is always great and consistent. We were a party of 6 and had everything from steaks to the famous pot pie. Biggest issue was the service. Slow is an understatement.  Took 10 min to get seated in a half empty restaurant and then an hour to get food. We had to ask for most every refill and just soup and salads were 25 min. It got to the point we were just laughing at how slow everyone was."}
{"text":"We arrived and asked for a table for 3 and was promptly escorted past many empty tables to the other side of the restaurant.  When ??, she said they were starting to fill a section for a new waiter who had just came on.
OK, good enough.  Gabriel introduced himself and ask if we had been here before and did we have our rewards card.  Yes, to both.  They guys got a pitcher of beer and me an iced tea.  I love it when they bring a carafe so you can fill your own refills.
He brought a hot loaf of bread but we had to ask for some butter.  Our large order of crispy parm zuchinni rings arrived quickly and we devoured all but 2.  2 of both ordered the clam chowder instead of a salad, but we had to ask twice for some hot sauce to spice it up a little.  Entrees took a while but the wait was ok while the app and soup settled.  Ignacio had the after the gold rush chicken marsala and enjoyed it but was unable to finish it.  Uriel had the calzon but it was missing the pepperoni and sausage he requested and only had cheese in it.  He returned it and nibbled from both of our plates, which was ok.  The manager came over and offered a free mile high chocolate cake for the mistake.
I had the 7 oz steak and fried shrimp.  Steak was cooked perfect.  Shrimp were kind of soggy and cold.  I ate about half the large baked potato.
We enjoyed our meal and took home the cake.  Gabriel was an attentive server and we look forward to our next visit but will not order so much next time."}
{"text":"Arrived hungry left hungry. I've been here once prior to this visit and remember why I didn't return. Everything I ATTEMPTED to eat was bland and tasteless. Not once we're we asked how any of our food was by the server nor the manager that brought it out to us. We ordered 2 appetizers, drinks and 2 steaks and neither my girlfriend nor I could choke down more than 3 bites. The only thing we finished was our wine and beer. Not once we're we asked why we didn't eat out pretzel, soup, or steaks. We finally tried to bring up our concerns with the lack of customer service and very disappointing dinner to the manager and she offered to take care of our steaks which we already paid for. I politely declined as she continued to offer a desert and jokingly says \"Well those aren't bland\".  2 hours, $100 down, and a near empty belly still. And to think I was more impressed by jack in the box on the way home!"}
{"text":"Food  tasty.  Service lousy today. Normally even when it is extremely busy the food takes only about 15 to 20 minutes to be served. Today it took 45 minutes. 45! Server's excuse was that there was only one cook. Server should have said it was going to take awhile. No such thing. I would have gone elsewhere then 10 minutes later manager comes to apologize. Makes me wonder if we will come again. I guess if you don't wear all your jewels and name brands high end type your service will be bad. Now the manager comes and says the server took longer to get it in to the chef. Not the chef being slow. ???"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our first date night in long time on Sunday (January 8th). I forgot our waiters name but he was not attentive at all nor did he smile. It took him 15 minutes to even greet us. Our drinks took 20 minutes. Our food took 34 minutes. We talked to the manager that night and he didn't seem to care much about it or act on anything. The only reason I'm giving this place 1 star is because the food as alright. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really wish I would've gone across the street to Waffle House....

I used to eat here quite often back in 2010 when my friend bartended and was always impressed with my food. That was not the case today. My soup was ok, but failed to come with bread or even crackers like it used to, and for $7 that's ridiculous. I ordered the tri-tip sliders and yes, I realize they were only $4 for Happy Hour, but even for free they would be gross. Initially they came totally wrong and cold, and then the right ones had soggy buns that were drowned in garlic spread. Glad there were only 2. That's all my stomach could have withstood. My girl had the Cobb sandwich that was just \"meh\", with lukewarm fries. Our waitress was friendly and kept our drinks filled, but that was the only good thing really. 

I would avoid this place for sure."}
{"text":"We went to celebrarte my sisters birthday at the beginning we tell we split the ticket and she say I can do at the end we wait more that an hour for the ticket when finally she gave the ticket everything was wrong and we have to wait another 30 min
Will never come  back"}
{"text":"We had horrible service and eventually left without our food. No manager spoke to us as we were leaving and when we asked for the bill for the appetizer, we were told \"I got it - don't worry about it\" by the cashier
No apologies- we didn't want a free salad, we wanted our meals. The waiter apologized when he took our order as he had left us waiting for some time. Then he brought our drink and appetizer and never came back. Hello!! He went to tables around us several times..no drinks, no meal 
WTH
If you want horrible service and have all night to receive it ...this is the restaurant for you!
If I could subtract a star I would"}
{"text":"We stopped into Claim Jumper for a bite before our movie at Harkins. I'd been there once before, years ago, and all I could remember were the portions that were the size of my face. 
This time, we sat in the bar (a plus, since I'll do just about anything to avoid sitting near a family with a screaming 3 year old) and it was great. The service was VERY slow (knocking a star for that - albeit, it was very busy that night), but otherwise, the food was great, nice and tasty. They have a great happy hour menu with some killer deals on apps, and my favorite part is the decor. The Husband is very into rustic, and I like contemporary, and I think Claim Jumper hits right in the middle - almost like having dinner at my upscale cabin in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"My family and I held my mother's 80th Birthday Celebration at Claim Jumper and we were extremely satisfied, from the wonderful service to the awesome tasting food.  We had a private room that accommodated our party of 45 and we received the royal treatment.  Our menu consisted of the Sirloin Steak with Grilled Shrimp, Barbecue Ribs, Filet Mignon and Grilled Salmon.  All of the food was cooked to perfection, very delicious. Thank you all at Claim Jumper for making this day wonderful for my Mom!"}
{"text":"What a crappy wait for half empty restaurant and waiting for 30 minutes to get a table....the excuse was there was a 14 top reservation and they didnt want the cooks to get behind on orders...what a poor excuse. ...if there was a reservation then learn to prepare the staff ahead of time....as big restaurant as this...if you cant handle 14 top reservation and others have to wait for two people theres serious service issues and management staffing. ..hope the corporate ses this review and make some changes. ..as a executive chef myself ....theres no excuse for me and othe small 2 too 4 tops to be waiting this long..will not be back again"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was REALLY bad and slow. Waiter would disappear for long periods of time. We had something missing with our dinner and when we asked the waiter he got irritated and literally turned around and walked away. Weird. 24 hours open is awesome and food is good though."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! Try the asian pear salad with gorgonzola and candied walnuts. Truly divine."}
{"text":"Went with a group and needed a close location to the meeting event we had to attend. 
Service was good.
Food was very greasy and bland.
I gather this is a chain?
Either way once was enough.

Group of 7 vote? 2 Stars. A star for the nice hostess.
A star for our nice waitress.
Food was zero.
Frankly, they need to trim down the menu. You cannot specialize in everything.

To close, we tried the 7 layer \"advertised\" cake! 
The slice had to be sitting in the air of a couple days.
Sorry, nasty is the only description here."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Golden Nugget so decided to give this place a try for breakfast. The food was terrible and overpriced, reminded me of buffer food. Claim Jumper typically has huge portions with delicious food but not at this location, at least not for breakfast.  Avoid this place and head over to the Plaza Hotel and eat breakfast at Hash House a Go Go instead."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience pretzels on point and my club sandwich and fries were all cooked to perfection. Betho was a superb server!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal very much. The fries are too salty so order them plain. The ribs fall off the bones. Delicious but a little bit overcooked. The chopped steak with mushrooms and mashed potatoes was terrific. The staff was polite and anxious to please but forgot to bring the extra plate I asked for."}
{"text":"I love that it's 24 hours. The food was good, but overpriced. Keno on the table was a fun touch. The thai chicken salad was amazing.... everything else we tried was just okay."}
{"text":"Ok, so after a really bad experience I went back, against my better judgement and I am so glad I did. The service = outstanding, the food (ok I didn't brave my old favorite but tried something new) = outstanding, I am so grateful. I appreciate the food, the people, even the drink (I recommend the \"girls night out\" yum!)Left with a new found appreciation. Thanks guys, I needed that."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and first impression was good. Dim lighting, lots of seating, but strange hours. Closing at 9:30 and 10:30 always has me confused. We went twice before and they wouldn't seat us because it was a few before closing which is understandable I guess. 

They have boca burgers to sub any beef patty, which is nice. My fianc√© and I both went with burgers that night and they were awesome. And the fries? I could have just ate two servings of those they were so good! Our server wasn't anything special, not very conversationally or concerned with the turn out of our meal. Nor we're the other servers. No one was happy now that I think about it, but it was the holidays."}
{"text":"This place was awful. Service was comical. Food was absoultly disgusting. This is the kind of place where you stop a few bites in and its just like \"what the hell am I eating?\". Then proceed to stop. 

Potatoe cakes were good. Burger was not. My table of 5 all left with regret. 

Keno stops at 10 FYI if you planned to win millions on that."}
{"text":"and then theres claim jumper!.. . 

when i think about this place, it takes me back to a year and a half ago when me and the boyfriend were here to check AZ out  for the first time from icy cold WI.  we were exploring the desert all day and suddenly realized all that grumbling was our stomachs and not thunder. ( and yes i now know how often storms are here:) After driving around, we decided on this place, since we never heard of it. Walking in, my mouth dropped open as i was face to face with the most huge desserts i've ever seen !  i mean these things would be what dreams are made of if they would actually fit into my dreams!  

Ok so the lightbulb shoulda went off judging by the desert size, that the rest of the menu would also have steroid size standards, so since it didn't we started with the Avocado rolls.  WOW... no words..  just wow!  AMAZING!  

next i ordered the rotisserie chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes, and my boyfriend stuck with the half rack of ribs with veggies and baked potato.  My chicken was extremely juicy and full of flavor to the point where i just couldn't stop eating it.  The mashed potatoes were def up to my high standards and the vegetables cooked and seasoned perfectly!  The plates were huge and also came with garlic cheese bread that was soo good i would've been happy with a plate of that alone.  The ribs were some of the best my boyfriends had ( although he still has texas roadhouse as his #1)  and we both left in a serious food choma.  Sorry humongous chocolate cake, but there was just no room for you today!   Def a fave of ours, so check it out:)."}
{"text":"The service was definitely lacking here. I went to happy hour here this afternoon and the waitress, an older lady with dark curly hair was not very personable and rarely checked in on us. Then she made a stink about us wanting to split the check. The restaurant was dead btw so it's not like she has a bunch of other tables to tend to or anything. As we were dining we noticed that every server in the parking lot looked miserable coming in as well and while leaving we heard another guest complain about the bar service."}
{"text":"Where to start... So everyone I know have always been a fan of Claim Jumpers.. BUT I must say... Over the years, the food has really just gone to sh!t!! Every time we go back, it seems to be worse and worse.  My recent visit was pretty much catastrophic.  There was a bug in the starter salad to start... Then we had our entrees, my steak was overcooked.  I ordered. Medium an I got wayyyyy overcooked well done.  Hubby ordered chicken n ribs, hi chicken was bleeding, undercooked! So I had to complain to the server.. GM came over and apologized.  He removed the 2 entrees from our bill.  This was the only reason I gave 2 stars... The service wasn't bad, the food was! I will definitely no be returning to this location... And maybe No more Claim Jumpers as well.."}
{"text":"It's too expensive for just okay food. I had a steak last time and for the price, I could have had a better steak at Black Angus or surf and turf at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Saltiest clam chowder ever!!  Pair that w Caesar salad with salty croutons and you got yourself kidney failure!!! Waitress was clueless and kept asking us if everything was \"still wonderful\" ??? We had to change the soup cause we couldn't swallow that much salt... Next soup was just as bad! We won't come back!"}
{"text":"This place drives me crazy in a good way.  The other night I went there for the second time.  Luckily, it was late and they were pretty slow so I was able to pour over the extensive menu at my leisure.  It also helped that I was with my mom who gave me this horrible trait of indecisiveness.  When I'm with my husband, he scans the menu titles and picks one.  I have to read every description and then narrow it down little by little until the waiter or waitress comes and I am forced to make a snap decision.  

My mom was interested in the appetizers but since I had been here once before, I was able to talk her out of it.  All I had to do was remind her of the glorious desserts that were displayed when you first walked in.  Mom ordered the chicken fried steak and I ordered some mushroomy chicken delight!  It was served with mashed red potatoes, my fav, and I substituted parmesean zucchini spears for the roasted veggies and a biscuit the size of my fist!  We both agreed that the food was wonderful but saved 3/4 of it for the next day's meals and order dessert.

Ahhh, dessert!!!  The last time I was here, my hubby and I ordered the ice cream cookie sandwich and we couldn't get close to finishing it.  We almost cried as cookies are sacred!  This time, I ordered \"The World's Smallest Ice Cream Sundae\" which is a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream slathered with thick hot fudge and a mountain of whipped cream.  I ordered the chocolate chip toffee cookie on the side expecting just a cookie.  No, they brought the cookie out which is almost the size of the plate drizzled with carmel and chocolate.  I ate the ice cream and a few bites of cookie and brought the rest of the cookie home.  My mom ordered the creme brullee trio.  One was traditional, the other was something I can't remember and the BEST was the expresso chocolate!  Incredible!  Don't waste your time, money, or calories on the trio...just get the mocha!!  If you are a coffee freak, have a paramedic standing at your side for CPR...you'll have died and gone to heaven.

I will also support Kristin C's review:  bring your own Tupperware!"}
{"text":"Good food. Service was lacking. The server would disappear for really long stretches of time and we had to go find him to get our check split. The dessert is amazing and great to take home. I will probably go back to claim jumper but to a different location."}
{"text":"Excellent as always!

I highly recommend the 21 ounce (plate size) bone-in ribeye. You have to finish it off with a Chocolate Chip Cookie salad... (see picture) - of course it's healthy it's a salad!

Service is excellent - prices are pretty reasonable considering what you get. But it is a lill expensive.

Kudos to our server Brianna!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was that the bar looked understaffed. After waiting a while I had to get up and ask for someone to clean our table & let them know the two of us were ready to order. When food arrived the hot wings were not hot (temperature wise.) I ordered *grilled fish tacos & they came fried. Super greasy & not that tasty. I was disappointed they also forgot my french fries. When it came, it was way too salty. We ordered two CJ Margaritas & they were too sweet. Overall experience was very disappointing. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Bartender apologized a couple of times for the wait, however it was the least they could do at this point. Only good thing was they had NFL Football on. Btw it was happy hour. Still not worth the wait, food or drinks. Almost forgot!!! Our bartender Todd over charged us $7.98. We had to send the check back for correction. The manager came & asked us about our experience. We were honest. He comp our food. After another apology, we promised we'll NEVER come back."}
{"text":"Wow! I just returned home from CLAIM JUMPERS in Tempe Az...it's my folks' 50th anniversary and I'm from out of town so I had never been before...no one could tell me what to order because EVERYTHING is SUPERB...that's what I kept hearing from my family...so I jumped in with a dirty martini and the fish tacos DEEELICIOUS!!

It won't be the last...Thanks for just being TOP NOTCH...YUMMMMMM great ambiance and decor too...Please to Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The service at this Claim Jumper location was horrible.  I was trying to think if it was a kitchen issue or a service issue or a management issue.  I settled on a management issue.  There were plenty of servers running around during our Sunday afternoon visit.  The restaurant was less than 50% occupied.  After FIVE...count 'em...FIVE individuals attending to our party of three elderly female diners, we finally received our food ONE HOUR after entering the establishment.  We encountered a carousel of personnel for no apparent reason.  There was absolutely no excuse for this poor display of culinary service other than management.  The manager dumped us into a no man's land because we requested a table vs. a booth.  Nobody was assigned to our table.  We had to constantly flag down employees for simple things like, oh...I don't know...THE CHECK???  I will never, ever, ever, ever return to this Claim Jumper location.  EVER.  Management is incompetent.  People need to be fired.  This was a disgrace."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food not so much. It's been a  year or 2 since I've been here. Used to eat at This Claim Jumper location once a month or so. The food quality has dropped a lot. I got the coconut shrimp for $21.99, the shrimp were not fresh/juicy and they were over cooked. The sliders were not juicy but very dry. The shrimp pasta was so oily and rich. It was laden in oil and cheese. Gross. The desserts are still pretty decent. 2 stars for our awesome waitress. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here almost monthly at least.  A brief time away and on our first return visit our the portions significantly smaller and with a very different mix of ingredients.  And I am only talking about what used to their Cobb Salad.  We have eaten many times to never be disappointed.  This time, I suspect, will be our last. Ruby Tuesday's just down the road is a much better deal with their salad bar.  At CJ we even asked to speak with the manager to express our disappointment.  We were told he was busy in the kitchen....enough said."}
{"text":"Tri tip dip is fabolous, all food i had there was amazing. Big portions and good prices!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food!! Server was very friendly.  Bread fresh out of the oven.   Fast food served.  Love it!"}
{"text":"BLUF(Bottom Line Up Front): Forget the client and you get 1 star.
OK. I'm a little late with this review(night of 5 Feb 2016). I hate writing the really bad ones.
First off, THIS IS A CHAIN.
After James(our server) took our drink and appetizer order we thought this was going to be a good night out.  Our bad.
We got the Onion Rings based on a Yelp review.  They were standard.
James took our entree order and the wait began.  After 25 minutes he apologized for the order not coming out. After 30 minutes he apologized again. Minutes later the meals came out.
My wife had the Absolute Tortellini. It was OK, nothing special.
I had the Fish Taco. Stone cold.  This was fried fish, stone cold. Like they took it out of the refrigerator.
This place uses runners.  The meal was probably done and no runner brought it to the table, but the server and kitchen staff didn't ensure the meal was right before it came out.
I complained to James and he told the manager.
The result was comped meals and a desert, which I hate them giving me a desert. I don't eat desert usually.
I want an explanation of why they F**ked it up. That lets me know you identified the problem and maybe your will correct it.
I should know better than to eat at a chain. 
As a gypsy I sometimes forget that the reviews of Yelp locals may be jaded."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very good food, good portions without being grossly exaggerated.  Exceptional for a chain restaurant.  Save room for the giant desserts.

Appetizer: Roasted Artichoke with Garlic Mayonnaise - Delish!
Entrees: Cedar Plank Salmon and the Rib & Chicken Combo. - Perfection!
Desserts: Green Tea Creme Brulee - light, airy and not overly sweet.
and the World's Smallest Sundae, which is a normal size sundae with creamy vanilla ice cream and decadent hot fudge..."}
{"text":"First time in today, was nice open seemed like a lot of seating available for larger parties as well. Menu was large almost too large, prices were moderate. Portions were large though and drinks were good. They offer a massive chocolate cake for dessert that would feed 4 people. Parking here isnt the best but there are two garages on either side as well as lot parking with a little walk. Would go back, food was good and worth the prices."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here due to the large portions and delicious food. The last 3 times I've been there for dinner, there was an issue with the food, or lack of it. Two of the 3 times the waiters forgot to bring out our appetizer. Additionally, 2 of the 3 times tgey messed up my food. Yes the manager comps the meal, but I dont come for free food. I just want the food I ordered, made the way it says on the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day and were very impressed with our server Riley! He went above and beyond to give us great service. Will definitely come back for the delicious bread as well!"}
{"text":"Food is ok and it's nice that it is open 24/7 but don't expect the same food you get at the stand alone CJ's."}
{"text":"So I ordered the Salmon Oscar @ $27.99? Well the salmon came out Dry. Not worth the price!  This is at best a $13 meal."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here a lot as its close to my work. Service is always very good, and the food is very good as well. Portions are huge, I get a lot of 1/2 sandwich and salad which is way too much food for me. I joined their meal club which is a decent bargain. I like this place!"}
{"text":"I got a message from someone from claim jumper asking for my # to contact me ...as of today no call. What a shame , 3 of us get togeather at least once a month and eat at this location maybe more. They would still have our business had they taken care of this. The manager certainly dropped Tha ball and as far as corporate I guess our business isn't important to them."}
{"text":"I visited earlier today and would have to rate it as a typical, corporate, casual-dining restaurant. The service and food were okay but not anything to write home about.

They seemed to be substituting huge portions instead of focusing on the quality of the food they were serving. I had the Jambalaya which was greasy, had far too many onions (seemingly half the bowl) and the whole bowl had taken on an unappetizing mix of brown and black instead of the bright oranges and reds I would expect of quality Jambalaya.

My dining companion had the Tri-Tip steak which he said tasted good but he hypothesized that the mashed potatoes they were placed on tasted like they were made from potato flakes.

The one redeeming thing was the salads we stared the meal with. The spinach salads really were delicious... I only wish I had ordered the meal-size one and forgone anything else. 

With all the good restaurants in/around Vegas, I'd recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"only reason not 5 stars is we sat for 15 min. then I finally got up and pointed that they apparently forgot to designate us a waiter.
after that it was much better. the chicken pot pie was as good as ever and of course killer deserts.  I am thankful that I do not live closer to one for my weight."}
{"text":"Accommodative staff. Kid friendly. Great food and choices. We had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and the wait staff was very friendly. The food was mediocre overall, however the Chicken Fired Chicken was a home run and the  desserts were monstrous which is wonderful! I would go again, but would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with my Claim Jumper experience. I used to come here years ago and it was great. I would have recommended to everyone. I don't know what happened to this place. Food is way over priced for what you get. I got the tri-tip beef sandwich. Since it was $15.00 for just the sandwich and fries I certainly expected a much better sandwich. This did not even include a salad. I had to pay $4.00 more for a very small pre made salad. Beef was not of a good quality and over cooked  and roll was hard on one side. Fries had so much salt that I had to ask for a replacement. Which when replaced became half the size. Everything was way, way too salty including the salad. I've never had salad that was salted before. That should be left for the customers taste choice and I do like salt but when you put that much salt it ruins the food. Even the Motherlode cake was disappointing. Used to be a favorite of our family. Overpriced poor food. Could have had a steak and rib dinner for $20.00 at Longhorn. My family and I will Never come back here again. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second time to this claim jumper my first time there i had a burger and fries that meal was delicious. Yesterday i had the beef rib and tri tip meal the tritip was cooked perfectly and so were the veggies perfect flavor and very appealing to the eye!!! Unfortunately the beef ribs did not have much meat and just tasted like old dry burnt bbq crispies. I was really looking forward to the beef ribs too but luckily the tri tip made up for those \"the cook who sent those burnt bones out should be ashamed and needs to  take a lot more pride in what they send out ill stick to Lucille's for beef ribs\" 
Our waiter Edward was on top of things and very friendly."}
{"text":"His place was pretty good we went here having never been and it seems like a good place and the atmosphere is casual and good mining experience and good quantity of food. The price wasn't too bad for what you get. Try it."}
{"text":"Food is okay. 

Server Blake was kind of condescending and I don't know if it it's because we were one of the only tables of color eating there. 

They do offer a happy hour but the options seemed limited."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Love the tacos! The pretzels and cheese are also good.  I am in a deep like with the fried macaroni and cheese as well..."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper. It is a shame this restaurant in the Golden Nugget chooses to not honor our vets and current soldiers on VETERANS DAY simply because they will make so much money on tourists. Wonder how they would feel being under Japanese or German government!! How a boycott and emails to their main office. I was in the Army from 1963 to 1969. Shame on them!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful and enjoyable meal. I ordered roasted tri tip. It was very filling very thin slices with a light gravy, mashed potatoes and stir fry vegetables. Plus a salad and a muffin. 
It was filling with a. ice cold glass of passion tea the way it is without sugar."}
{"text":"Came here on an afternoon for lunch, and the service was pretty fast and efficient since their lunch hours aren't all that busy. Their portions are filling, and you have flexibility as to how you want something cooked or prepared (no butter on veggies, cooked blackened, etc.) Our server was fairly attentive to our needs, and their portions are easily sharable among a large group (which is recommended)."}
{"text":"After a long day outside by the pool my wife and I opted to get a small bite at Claim Jumpers. Chris was our waiter and greeted us within 1 minute. They were VERY busy so this was a good sign. He immediately brought us water and a carafe of water saying \"He understood we'd been outside all day and wanted to make sure we were hydrated!\" Good sign #2. My beer came fast and we ordered the Appetizer sampler as to not spoil our appetite for dinner tonight. So our app came and it was only warm. Flavor was good. No sour cream so asked for some and it took a little longer than it should've. All and all a good experience. Chris was definitely on top of his game!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar tonight from Richie & Kristina the cheese potatocakes that Richie recommended were good. The tri tip dip was amazing. Great night and a fun staff behind the bar. I will be back. Thanks for good service you 2. Love the happy hour menu and drinks."}
{"text":"You know those people who hate all of the excess of America?  Don't bring them here.  

Ya know how some places will give you a sprig of parsley or a twisted orange slice to garnish your plate?  Here they give you a small apple.  Yes, a small apple.  And it looks quite proportionate.  Yikes.

This is a great spot to come with friends.  If you have one of those friends who claims they can eat anything and still be hungry - bring them here.  When you walk in it feels like some old lodge with a large stone fireplace and stuffed animals on the wall.  So don't bring your PETA friends here.  No like-y.  

Not only is everything ginormous (yes, I spelled it that way on purpose) but it's actually pretty darn good. This isn't inspirational cuisine or anything, but they do a pretty mean meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The girlfriend's favorite is their Chicken fried chicken.  Dear heavens.  It's \"needs it's own zip code joke\" worthy.

Don't come here on a hot night with plans to go out afterword.  Come here after something else so you know you are on your way home.  Because there WILL be leftovers.  Enough for one or two days most likely.  And so far everything we've tried heats up quite well the next day.  

Environmental note - Feel free to bring your own Tupperware/storage from home.  Use the big purse.  Bring one for everyone if you want.  Because not only will you using them mean less boxes in the old landfill, your food won't dry out or pick up any other fridge flavors.  And since this food may be dinner for the next few nights - these things matter."}
{"text":"Ok so we had dined at another Claim Jumper and was pretty impressed with the food and service there so thought we'd try one closer to home and was really disappointed with the food this time. Tasteless and undercooked !!! Disappointed as we'd brought visitors from out of town there and really quite embarrassed since we'd been raving about the place and food! Guess we'll not be revisiting this claim jumper again pity since its in such a nice part of town!"}
{"text":"This claim jumper is the best I've ever visited! This restaurant is well run in both the front and back of the house. EJ does an amazing job training the staff to seamlessly execute both catering and in-restaurant orders. Great job!"}
{"text":"Well, overall my experience here was not the best. I couldn't wait to leave. They messed up on our order with a party of 2! My wife waited as I ate my dinner. They manager asked if everything was fine and he said good and continued walking thru the next table. Did get a chance to say much. We had 3 different waitresses. The server walked by our table with our appetizers and I had to flag him down.  Maybe it was not my night but next time I wil pass. Our original waitress was nice."}
{"text":"I came here in high school (8 years ago) and haven't been since. I recently came with my husband and I love this place. They give way too much food but I can eat lunch and dinner the next day. Our waitress I think her name is Rachel is super friendly and a great server. One of the best I've had. We come here at least once a month now :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain.  They have happy hour specials while football is on, so that's nice!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, but decent food. They have a Cheesecake Factory-like menu, that has about 20 pages of options.  The fish and chips were decent, but the bf did not like the beef ribs at all. He said they were tough and had little meat. Service is great!"}
{"text":"For my  husband birthday we went to Claim Jumpers. If you have a card you get  points on your card everytime you visit and on your birthday month you get money taken off your bill and a free desert. Their desserts are amazing. 
We have not been to Claim Jumpers in a while so we decided it was time for us to visit. Has usual we have had great service. This time we had WOW AWESOME SERVICE. 
Shawn was our server. We usually ask for Dominique but this time we did not ask for anyone specifically. They gave us Shawn I think we have had him as our server once before. Shawn knew us from a while ago so he knew what we always ordered from a long time ago. We was impressed. We always start out with the wings with a Lot of Bleu cheese dressing.  I really love their Bleu Cheese dressing. I wish they would sell it. We did not have to ask for extra blue cheese he already knew and he brought it out and he brought out ranch as well. The dinner we had the Ribs soooo
Good fall of the bone good ribs.  Shawn brought out extra ranch for that. We like dipping our ribs in the ranch. Service was superb. We rarely had to ask for anything Shawn is really good at his job. Being a server for 30 years {Myself} back east Shawn is a dam good server. We will ask for him everytime from now on. 
 Thank  You Shawn"}
{"text":"Wife normally loves this place but not this time. Service was slow and not too bright. WiFi password must be a secret asked 3 times and couldn't get a working password. My wife asked to taste a beer ( sample ) and waitress just brought one out. Our meal took a hour to get to our table after ordering ??? The place was pretty empty ( Tuesday nite 5:30-8 ) My sons and my meals were ok nothing great ( his spaghetti and I had 7oz steak and grilled shrimp )  My wife ordered her normal Seared Ahi salad ( Ahi was bad so she sent it back and just asked for a greens salad with same dressing because of time) Ty the Manager came over and said Ahi was over cooked sorry and walked away. We finished and ordered desert which is always yummy. When we finally received bill Ahi Salad was still on there with a $7 discount ?? We asked and waitress just said that's what manager told her to do. We paid bill as it was so we could leave after a 2+ hour dinner. We more than likely won't go back at least to that Claim Jumper."}
{"text":"I believe this might have been the first or second time I've ever been to claim jumper, and I left with a bad impression. This place was conveniently located after shopping in town square, and a friend was craving for some chicken pot pie. 

Since she had heard that their establishment serves pretty good ones. I was down to get some as well. Long story short, I didn't, and I'm so glad the disaster was with one, not two chicken pot pies. 

My BBQ chicken salad was good- 3 stars.
The appetizer platter- 3 stars. Artichoke dip was okay, mozzarella sticks were gooey and yummy inside, and fried zuchinni's were okay. 
BBQ baby back ribs- 3 stars average. Fried mac and cheese were terrible, and the bread was unappetizing. We didn't even touch it or pack it to go. 

Chicken pot pie- 1 star horrendous. It was extra thick than usual, more so than any chicken pot pie I've seen or tasted in my lifetime. I wasn't born yesterday. And the flavor was even worse. It tasted like they put too much corn starch or flour to thicken the sauce. It was also just warm, not piping hot like you would expect right out of an oven. The puff pastry taste and quality was meh. And that's usually the best part of the pot pie.

We talked to our waiter who initially gave us attitude so I told him we weren't crazy, and that our chef friend had tried it as well. He responded, \"I'm a chef, too.\" Okay, nice one buddy. Cuz that's really obvious from where we're sitting. I didn't see the relevance--not like he got to taste our pot pie. 

We got the manager or whomever the boss was to stop by, and he wasn't very helpful either, with a lot of pride about a product that was mediocre at best. He insisted the texture was correct, and that it stiffened from cooling, which wasn't the case for us. 

He then offered to remake a batch, but my friend was so disappointed, and ordering another pot pie was not an option, especially since they had said the inside would be the exact same batch. 

He then stood there for a while asking if she wanted to order another item instead. And when she said \"no,\" he stood there asking her what she wanted to do. Birds were chirping. Awkward silence. And then he said something along the lines of, \"well, why don't you think about it while I take this back.\" 

It almost seemed like they thought we were unnecessarily complaining, when my conversation started with, \"everything is great, except for the chicken pot pie.\"  

I've been to so many restaurants, and If a customer doesn't want an alternative dish, and the food was clearly not even eaten except three bites, I would think the immediate response is to remove it from the bill. It was obvious that he was waiting for her to bring it up. They ended up charging her for the mini salad that came with the pot pie. I thought that was just to spite her. 

There's plenty of other places in this town that have great food and service, I think the fact that our chef friend could confirm that the inside didn't taste or look right was enough for me to know that we weren't crazy.  Oh, I forgot to add, she actually got sick immediately after we walked out. Don't know if that's a coincidence. 

Sure won't be back here!!"}
{"text":"The food was great but our service was not. Our server was named Heniz (I believe) and he was terrible. He was not attentive. He kept making excuses and kept saying other tables were keeping him busy. We had to wait like 15 minutes from the time we first sat down until he even greeted us. Never refilled things quality checked things. He also refilled our waters with a sprite water mixture. Yes the manager we brought this to the attention of was great she gave us a free chocolate piece of cake to go. But still more should of been done. So much for having a nice birthday dinner. It literally did not live up to the standards I know Landry restaurants has. I am a Laundry card holder and have been to many of their restaurants but this was beyond terrible."}
{"text":"Been only once. Had the biggest sandwich ever known to man - with 6 slices of bacon. Cut the beast in half and it looked like two regular size sandwiches. To me, that translated to \"late night snack.\" 

Service was quick 'n friendly. The decor is interesting. Unique ceiling fans. I don't remember much about the decor - too busy staring at the sandwich, which, upon request, came with a side of fresh fruit. Yum!

Word of advice: tote a jacket. I froze my ta ta's off."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. They can have one star for having clean glasses, but the rest of the night brings it back to zero. Took a couple minutes to get seated with practically no one in the restaurant. Go to order and they don't have the beef ribs that are on their menu, but you can get the pork \"because they taste the same.\" Tell him to come back in a couple minutes and closer to ten minutes later our waiter comes back for my order. Food comes out and mine is miraculously with it, but whose is missing, none other than the toddler. He asks if he can get us anything else and I ask what about my daughter's food. Then he says oh yeah, it was burnt and it would be two or three minutes. Ten minutes later while keeping her entertained and  her mini pizza is still not out, we ask what's up and he says it is in the oven still. Husband has time to talk to the manager and come back without her pizza still being brought to the table bBy the time she gets her food, my food is barely warm, and it wasn't like I missed out on anything because the potato cakes were dripping grease and my chicken was beyond char-grilled; it was burnt, which they tried to hide by putting the burnt side down. No apologies from the waiter; no trying to fix it by him either. Manager offered to remake my food but I didn't want everyone waiting on me. Only slight fix on the night was the manager giving us half off and removing my daughter's pizza. That made our meals about the price of going to Applebee's, which is about the quality of the food we received. Plus who knows what the hell that smell coming from under out table that resembled rotting food. Now I get to go home and make myself something to eat since my food was swimming in grease and burnt. So much for a nice family dinner.  Won't be back ever. Should have taken not having what I wanted as a sign and left."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation on Valentine's Day here (I know this post is a bit late). When we arrived there was a crowd of people waiting. We speak to the hostess and tell her we have a reservation for two. She looks it up...and there is no record of a reservation. That was the first warning. She told us not to worry and that we would be moved to the top of the list and invited us to take a seat. After about twenty minutes of waiting we approached her again to which she replied, \"How can I help you today?\" She had no recollection of our previous conversation. We reminded her but she looked at us blankly. We asked how many people were in front of us because at this point we were fed up. She told us we were third on the list...so what she told us earlier was a blatant lie. 

Once we were finally seated the waiter we had was great. He forgot to get us something we asked for but his kindness made up for it. However, the table we were seated at was like a see-saw. A little weight on one side and it would lean in that direction with a thump. 

The food was okay at best. Bland and overpriced.

Overall, even with the kind waiter, I won't be eating at this or any other Claim Jumper again. The only reason we stayed was due to the fact it was Valentine's Day and it would be a nightmare to find another place at that hour. 

The experience was ruined right off the bat by the hostess and nothing could really make up for lying to our faces."}
{"text":"The four stars are by no means for the food's taste. The service is incredible here and the waiters and manager are extremely friendly. Their food is heavily laden with salt so beware those watching their sodium intake. I can't say I enjoyed my food but, my boyfriend enjoyed his meal a lot. He liked the steak that he ordered and said it was the best he ever had. I had a piece and can attest that it was very nicely marinated. My food; however, was salty to the point where I couldn't eat it. The BBQ shrimp were good but, I was hoping for something lighter on the salt after that appetizer and did not get that in the entree. They tried very hard to accommodate my tastes and brought a salad without anything salty which I enjoyed. Maybe next time they won't put as much salt. I would come back based on service. It speaks volumes when they go to the lengths they did to service me."}
{"text":"First place we found for food in Golden Nugget, and have generally had good luck with other locations. The food was fine, although their salads keep getting smaller and smaller. 

The service was absolutely awful. The hostess didn't tell anyone we were there, so we waited and waited. Finally the hostess took our order and brought us drinks. We finally met our waitress right before the food arrived. We saw her for one drink refill and when she brought the bill. For the price, we'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I had my first meal here a few days ago, and while what I ate was generally very good, Diane's Fried Shrimps were seriously overcooked.  My Chicken Pot Pie had a golden and flaky crust filled with carrots, onions, mushrooms, and peas all held together within a good Cream Sauce but one that was not very liquid in texture.  Tomato Herb Focaccia with a classic Italian Marinara Sauce was also very good.  A bowl of New England Clam Chowder was rather floury but nevertheless tasted very good.  And Fried Zucchini was excellent, retaining all of its heat within, which seems appropriate.

Likely because of a shorthanded waitstaff, initial service was very slow.  Then it noticeably improved.  One persistent fly alighted on our booth while we ate, which was a bit irritating.  Otherwise the overall experience was fine."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours inside of the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino, this Claim Jumpers is decent when nothing else is open. Luckily, they sell alcohol and their portions are huge. I went for the house salad, which for some odd reason tasted salty. I definitely wasn't too fond of that, but as hungry as I was, I had to eat it. This place is definitely convenient, but I would only come back in times of desperate need."}
{"text":"Okay, so my husband and I decided to stop here after the restaurant we decided to eat at was having plumbing issues. We finally came across Claim Jumpers after driving around and starving we chose to eat here because it's been a while since we had it and it WILL be the last time we eat here! 
My husband ordered a personal pizza and I ordered wings.. when his pizza came out and he took a bite it was a soggy pizza and my wings tasted like they were cooked in the microwave; fatty and rubbery . The only good things were the drinks! It's disappointing when you go into a restaurant and have to pick at it because you're not satisfied. They're menu items are wayyyyyy overpriced! Maybe a different location would be better but this one was not impressive at all."}
{"text":"We were beyond starving after a long day.  We decided to go to claim jumper at 7 pm on a Friday night.  The wait was long but the hostesses hinted that happy hour was still going on and pointed us to the bar area.  Plenty of seating.  

Scott waited on us and gave us the best service experience ever.  Food came out quick and we were in and out within an hour.  Drinks were never empty.

Good food, good experience!"}
{"text":"Oh!!  HORRIBLE doesn't even begin to describe it!  Do yourself a favor and just stop at the nearest McDonalds!  Mediocre (at best) service and a food disaster will remind me to never eat at this restaurant again. 
My dad wanted to take my husband and I out for a nice dinner while visiting, so we could have a night off from cooking and doing dishes. A kind gesture turned into a nightmare...
1) We parked in the only shade to be found, only to get out of the car to smell the sewer steaming up from the vents below.
2) My husband and my dad ordered beers, which came out FLAT, warm, and in dirty glasses no less!
3) Our server was slow and seemed to forget most everything (it took her three visits and two requests to bring me a refill of diet soda)
4) The food I ordered came out DRY and lukewarm.  How long do you leave chicken sitting under the heater before you serve it???  The chicken was dry, dry, dry and I could tell by looking at it.  How do the cook, expediter, food runner, and server ALL miss that?  I could practically snap the chicken in half (which is what I did when the server asked how everything was).  They replaced it and took it off of the bill, but I'm still angry about it several hours later.  

All in all, I will never return to this restaurant and I will spread the word verbally to everyone I know.  I am not a heinous b%@ch or a gourmet chef, but when I can cook better food in my own kitchen than be served at a restaurant, why even go out?  It's depressing, actually."}
{"text":"In the past this was always one of my favorite restaurants.   Not any more.  Took Mom here for a special birthday dinner and was very disappointed.  They have made some changes to the menu, which wasn't too much of a problem but the food quality wasn't what it used to be.  Prices when up, portion sizes when down, which we could overlook if the food was still the same.  The meals don't come with the bread options any more, which is something we always looked forward to.  Instead they give you this tiny loaf of tomato bread with a side of marinara sauce.  The chicken fried steak was way too thick and the breading tough to cut through.  Looks like they stacked both pieces on top of each other and dipped it in the batter.  No flavor at all.  Presentation was also bad.  My plate came with the steak and mashed potatoes and a minuscule amount of gravy.  Very bland looking.  Service was also very slow and drink refills were almost nonexistent.  The only reason I gave them 1 star was because the onion rings were still really good.  Probably won't go back.  Not worth the money.  These changes must have been recent since we were there 2 months ago and it was still the same as it always was.  We must not be the only ones who felt this way since we were there on a Saturday and the place was empty."}
{"text":"Bad service bad food. Never again, if you are thinking about going here do yourself a favor and change your plans."}
{"text":"Love this place everyone is very friendly and patient with my 5 boys, we come here every Saturday to have family dinner and love it kelvin is amazing friendly and very knowledgeable..."}
{"text":"I'm use to my claim jumper back home in Rancho California never had a bad experience there. Tonight was my first time at this location for starters the spinach dip was horrible under cooked the artichoke wasn't even cut up it was in huge chunks every chip we tried to dip kept breaking our server never once came after she brought the spin dip so it sat at the edge of the table un eaten so I order a bowl of clam chowder I guess this location got rid of the bread bowl so they brought it in a regular bowl it was literally an amount I would serve my 2yr old for 9 bucks I could not believe the serving they gave all while the server never once coming to the table all in all horrible experience food and service. Never going back to that location.. check the photo out this is how the clam chowder came couldn't even fill up the bowl"}
{"text":"This place is over priced but food is yummy. The mozzarella sticks we ordered as an appetizer was better than most.  We ordered the club sandwich for the entree which was also yummy. I wanted to order the chocolate cake but it was 13 dollars ! No way! Our bill was 31 dollars and my hubby and I split our meal with an appetizer plus drinks. 
I recommend splitting meals here. It's the only way unless you want to spend a ton. 
The service was good but we were the only ones there.."}
{"text":"Fried apps are decent here and a value at happy hour.  They have those silly \"schooner\" mugs for beer which have the obnoxiously thick glass.  This place has an odd menu in that they try to do everything, American, fish, quasi-asian dishes, etc.  Prices are a little high for what feels like another chain similar to Applebee's or Chilis."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and was quickly seated.  Server was attentive, helpful and his recommendations were well received :-) had the parm garlic pretzel bites, margirita pizza and quesadellia Requested that quesidllia be made with flour instead of corn and were made to order without a problem.
All food was YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Thursday night, my sons birthday and he chooses the restaurant to celebrate. Claim Jumper. It is well located on the corner of Charleston & Rampart. Lots of parking. 

Nice waiting area with a fireplace (not lit,shame) and an outside area for warmer months.large and very clean restaurant with friendly younger staff.

Seated quickly in a big booth, the seats are a little low or the table is too high. I'm not sure which! We are quickly served with water and our drink order is taken. \" Small or large beer?\" I'm asked. \"What's the difference?\" I enquire. \"16oz or 18oz\" is the reply. Strange, 2oz. \"Large\" because I'm crazy. 

Lovely beer in a huge heavy goblet thing. Wifee has Chardonnay and kids have huge sodas with endless refills. My kids are not listening to our First Lady, Michelle O. \"bring on the sugar!\" says them....

Kids order mozzarella sticks to start. Huge, chewy, cheesy and well received. 

Mains, pizza & chicken finger & fries for kids. Adventurous, no. Good? Yes.

Wifee has a nice turkey club sandwich and I order the tri-tip. The beef was very tasty but not pink as promised on the menu. They brought over an individual red velvet cake for the birthday boy which was a nice touch and it was a satisfactory night. Good choice for the family, not spectacular but certainly well worthy of further visits."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible all the way around. The server came to our table at least 15 to 20 times it annoyed the crap out of me. The food took forever and when it came out everything was cold. I sent it back and still even then half the food was still cold. My girlfriend's order got all messed up as well.The manager comped our meal but really I won't be back after that experience. With my lunch being just butchered, it just put me in a bad mood."}
{"text":"There food is delish!!! We got the Blackend Chickwn pasta with Alfredo Sauce, Tri Tip Combo, Ceasar Salad & Calamari. It was soo good. Calamari came with a salad. That salad was off the hook. The pasta was amazing. Tri tip was perfectly cooked Medium well. Definetly will come back here when in Vegas. There staff was so super nice. The girl waitress that helped was so amazingly super nice. Would give them 5 but then lost that 1star because there tables was so small. But still would go back here just because there food is good and the staff was awsome!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to have dinner at Claim Jumpers, as we haven't been there in a long while. Our experience this time was not as we would have expected. 

My wife loves fish Taco's and they had a special for $2.00 Fish Taco's. As the waiter came to take our order my wife asked the waiter if she could get just 3-Fish Taco's as it's showing on the specials board when you walk in. The waiter stated that he had to go ask the manager. When he returned he said that would be okay so my wife ordered 3-Fish Taco's. She did not want any sides as we had ordered an appetizer of Onion Rings. I ordered the Original Tri-Tip Dip which wasn't bad. When our food came out my wife got her 3-Fish Taco's and sides (which she didn't ask for). 

Now here comes the whole bad experience. So, my wife didn't eat all 3 Taco's and she asked for the last one to be boxed up. The waiter did so and also brought the check. This is when we felt the unprofessionalism of the management staff and the waiter was caught in the middle of the whole thing.  We reviewed our bill as we do with any restaurant we go to. This time it showed $13.99 plus $2.00 for the additional Fish Taco. My wife then spoke to the waiter again stating she asked for the special Fish Taco which $2.00 x 3= $6.00, not $15.99 like on our bill. The waiter than went back to the management staff as there was a misunderstanding. After much back and forth we paid the bill and could not get a manager to come and speak with us about this misunderstanding. They just kept using the waiter as the middle man, (BTW the waiter was great). The restaurant was not busy at all.

They did send the waiter back and said they would remove the 3rd fish taco but we could not take it home and my wife had to give it back. I have never experienced such a thing at a restaurant EVER! My wife gave back her food and proceeded to call the manager the next day and spoke about our experience. They chose to tell her they would look into the matter and would contact us back. We never heard back.  

It's a shame as we liked this restaurant and now we will not be returning. We felt like just another customer that they didn't give a damn about."}
{"text":"Service in the front  skipped us 3 times. Cause am mexican? I don't know. That was to start off. We waited like 15 min till we got a table. And they were literally empty. And still made us wait. Drinks and server are great handled our orders fast and very professional.  Customer service is there. Thanks Francisco and your great service. Was on point with everything. Willing to come back and asking for him to receive great service."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be.  My husband made reservations for Mother's Day.  We were seated at a table where the sun was shining right in on us and getting worse as the sun was setting.  The shade was broken and numerous flies were going to be a problem.  We asked to be moved.  We had already ordered our drinks before we moved.  They brought all but mine.  Then it took forever to get it.  I ordered the Fish and Chips and so disappointed.  Mostly batter and hardly any fish at all.  I couldn't eat it.  The 7 layer chocolate cake is delicious though."}
{"text":"The service is good, but the food did not deliver.  Hence the two stars.  

I ordered the ultimate fish and shrimp dinner plate.  It came with 4 grilled shrimp, 4 battered shrimp, a piece of seasoned fish over a plate of fries.  Everything was overly salty, and unfortunately neither the cocktail or tartar sauce made it any better.  I asked for my fries well done, no salt and neither of it was cooked the way I like it.  The fish was overly seasoned and so needless to say, I got to taste of bit of everything and left unsatisfied and disappointed.  This dish came with a side dish and I ordered a cup of clam chowder that tasted like a cup of salt.  I just picked at the clams and left the whole cup of salt soup alone.   

Not my plate of seafood, so I'm not coming back.  Next time, I'll stick with a much better option at The Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"Lately, I have been enjoying Claim Jumpers Happy Hour specials which can be found in the saloon area between the hours of 4-7PM. While the portions are small, think of it as tapas, Claim Jumper style. At least that is the way I think about it. Generally we always order a few dishes and share everything. I highly recommend the tri-tip sliders, street tacos and pretzels! All very good and all cheap to. 

The service at the bar is solid to. I started to joke with the bartender that CJ was becoming my go to hang out place to grab a drink and food after work because the specials are just that good. Needless to say, that is not the first time she heard that. Overall, CJ is a solid place as far as the bar goes and there happy hour menu just takes it up that extra notch."}
{"text":"Good food as always.  Definitely had James a jumping this evening but he managed to give us, and the rest of his guests, the attention we needed.  Impressive!  Clean with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The pretzel bread is worth the trip!  Wow!

I had the Talipia Bianca.   Talipia, shrimp, wild rice, asparagus, avacado & cream sauce.   Excellent luck!

Wife had meat loaf with roasted vegetables and real \"lumpy\" mashed potatoes (she wanted me to express how well prepared they were as the \"lumpy\" in this case was complimentary).  Meat loaf was very good, but she raved about the roasted veggies.  

Alexis was our server.  She is a cute native of Vegas with a lovely personality and servant's heart."}
{"text":"My opinion has definitely changed! I think they added some new items to their Gluten free menu, and I love it! We got the GF Absolute Pasta, and it was wonderful.
There was no wait, and hardly any crowd at all. 
Our server, I'm sorry but I couldn't hear if her name was Jamie or Janie, but she was awesome! Super helpful, super smart, kind and way funny!!! She had us cracking up every time she came by. Her service is what has changed my opinion of this establishment to a good one :) in my opinion, she deserves a raise."}
{"text":"I can't say I didn't see it coming, but a recent dining experience on a Friday evening was pretty much ridiculous. My party of 2 wanted to dine al fresco, so we headed to the patio and were told a table was opening up. As we went to the table, another server told us that someone will get to you eventually, or something to that effect. It was packed on the patio, and we saw that the servers were rushing around. 

O and MG, no one stopped by our table for about 20 minutes, so we gave up and went to sit at the bar. Things did improve after that, luckily! We got our drinks pretty quick and were finally able to order. We had 2 appetizers- the spinach/artichoke dip and breaded lemon pepper zucchini. The zucchini was delicious, and the dip not so much. It was not hot and needed more flavor. My meal of simply grilled mahi was pretty good, although the sauce could've been tastier.
My dining partner really enjoyed the steak and shrimp entree. Our server/bartender was pretty good about checking on us and did mention something like they didn't expect such a crowd that night, which didn't make sense to me. I learned my lesson about trying to dine on the patio, for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm

Not a huge fan of Claim Jumper it's a fun time but the food isn't all it's cracked up to be.. When we went it was kind of dead and it's such a big space that you figured they could have done more .. I wasn't a big fan of the way it is layed out..

However that being said our waiter was awesome and very friendly and our food came at a timely manner.. I would indeed come back again to grab a drink or watch the game but not just for the food.."}
{"text":"Food is actually really good. The best thing on the menu in my opinion is the prime rib. They also have really big portions for kids meals which is great. I really wish they offered organic options for both the adults and the kids meals. I would eat here more often if they did."}
{"text":"Here visiting Phoenix Arizona, Claim Jumpers...nice and friendly staff, but disapointed about not having a salad bar at this location. Was told by manager that only in California the Claim Jumpers have the salad bar."}
{"text":"Barely arrived in Vegas around 3am and the only 24 hour place open was Claim jumper! (Iove this place so it worked out perfectly). The entire front of the restaurant was full I was so surprised! The servers were super busy but on point ...Tami and this other tall white boy were killin it! I had a Pefect Patron margarita (delicious ) and wings . Bomb! Will return . And THANK YOU TAMI & THE TALL WHITE BOY for your excellent smiles & service!!!"}
{"text":"For a gimmick eatery it's not as bad as you might think. The Yelp questionnaire says Good for Brunch, Lunch, etc. Claim Jumper is not good for anything. It's a place to take people whose gustatory senses have never been awakened.  If you grew up on pop tarts, mac & cheese and chicken tenders, Olive Garden, Applebee's, Chili's, Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumper are your kind of place. 

Why \"claim jumper\"?  There's a fake gold mine wagon out front to tie in with the spurious \"concept.\" The interior is more like a ski lodge than anything to do with Old West mining settlements.

I wonder how Native Americans like eating at Claim Jumper. Their forebears were forced off their land by murderous '49ers. 

I'm sure most patrons know of the '49ers only as a football team and are likely clueless what the Gold Rush was. \"Motherlode,\" as in Chocolate Motherlode Cake will have no meaning for them. It could explain why so many call it Claim \"Jumper's.\" 

The music system sounds like a radio station that's only half tuned in. Tinny tunes blare over cheap speakers, setting your nerves on edge before your drinks even come.

We were treated to a steady blast of hot air from an overhead vent.  It was 80 degrees out. Why would they run the heat on a warm day?  Company policy I'm sure.

You couldn't ask for a nicer server than Dominica. A perfect angel. She refilled our Arnold Palmers for nothing. She wears a rock that's worth probably a year's pay for me. The bill does the math for you:  A 20% tip, calculated before taxes. Kudos to Claim Jumper for getting that right!

While we waited an inordinately long time for our order (it was mid-afternoon) we were treated to complimentary cheese bread, like angel food cake with cheese flavored icing.  We know not to expect this type of eatery to give away anything of value.

I had a \"widow maker\" cheeseburger for $14.  Not bad. 1371 calories, 2732 mg of sodium.  What is that, a tablespoon of salt?

I'm glad I went for the tasty Thai slaw instead of shoestring fries.  Lucinda was happy with her burger.  Dani had a child's meal of mac & cheese while finicky Sandy barely touched his bowtie pasta.

The portions are not huge.  Maybe that's a dinner feature. Gluttonous portions are just a gimmick to divert attention from mediocre fare.

It was Dani's birthday.  We like Dani so we eschewed the cringeworthy forced celebration by restaurant staff.  How sad to recruit strangers to sing \"Happy Birthday\" for you. Kinda like a Jumbotron proposal.

Note:  I saw Jerika's review about a \"booger\" on a spoon.  I wasn't going to mention it but I had to ditch my place setting and grab one from a nearby table. The napkin had unidentified debris stuck to it. The knife had a particle of baked-on food.  Soiled linen and cutlery and leaving the heat running are sure signs this establishment suffers from poor attention to detail."}
{"text":"Claim Jumper is huge. It can fit a lot of people in it. We had a really big party so I knew it was going to take a while for drinks, food, checks, etc. But it actually was pretty decent. Our server was pretty attentive and split the checks in many different ways so I was happy about that. The thing that docs the stars is the food and how we were always finding our water glasses empty. The appetizer tray was really delicious. Fried lemon pepper zucchini was surprisingly good. Mozzarella sticks can never be too cheesy. But the chips for the spinach dip was really thin and broke easily. The garlic bread was actually really good but our pasta came out kind of cold. I had asked everyone else how their meals were and a lot of them said salty. C'mon Claim Jumper are you trying to kill us? I tried the fries and it literally tasted like they dropped the whole salt container on them. No wonder why everyone's water glasses were empty, the food was just too salty. BUT, on the bright side, my sister said she liked their shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place to dine at! I been wanting to rant about this experience I had here a week ago but I didn't have a yelp to until now! And now that I do I can tell you all how much this place just really is below standard. Heard so many good things about this place to come and such a disappointment! The food is so nasty and soggy ! I got a chicken tenderloin that was probably Walmart packaged and was complete bland and tasted worse than nothing. I rather taste nothing than cardboard because that's what my chicken tasted like! My wife got a California citrus salad which all the lettuce being all wilted and just disgusting. 


Service wasn't that great at all. Our server didn't even notice our unhappy attitudes and our passive complaints. Didn't have a clue what was going on. We're not the type to complain and try and get a free meal out of no one we pay for what we eat rather it tasting bad or great. Unfortunately this time it was a bad one.. server came by maybe 3 times within the hour and 20 mins that we dined there ! Not one refill and the place want even that packed at all! Over hyped, maybe another location might give us a better time just maybe."}
{"text":"Ever since my brother attended UC Irvine, I have been hearing him rave about the food and the huge portions they serve at Claim Jumpers.  Back then there were no Claim Jumpers in NorCal (at least not that I am aware of, until they opened one in Fremont, CA a few years back).

Anyway, since coming to Las Vegas, I found one in Summerlin that is not too far from me and I actually drive past it fairly often on my way to and from school. So one evening I decided to stop by and try this location with some friends.

It was my second or third time at any Claim Jumpers, but the others were old pros and knew the menu and exactly what favorites to order.  I studied the menu and finally decided on a full slab of Beef Back Ribs that is \"slow-roasted then flame broiled and loaded with flavor\". When it came out, my dinner does indeed look massive. But ribs from a cow is big normally, but I had no problem polishing it off since it was mostly bones. Although it wasn't as flavorful as advertised, and in a BBQ class I attended, we made better beef ribs oveall as a class.  And compared to their BBQ Baby Back Pork Rib I had tried at the Fremont, CA location, it wasn't as good relatively.

Anyway, we were mainly there for the desserts, so the table of 3 ordered and split the Chocolate Motherlode Cake, I Declair, and Lemon Bar Brul√©e. Our waitress thought we were crazy, but was happy that we each ordered a dessert = bigger tips on a bigger bill.  And overall, I thought the dessert was good.  Nothing fancy about it, just the huge portions loaded with way too much sugar and calories that people come here for.

Chocolate Motherlode Cake - Good, but after while the chocolate overload took over and I was done with this dessert. Don't try to eat this alone, unless you really love a lot a lot of chocolate.

Lemon Bar Brul√©e - The tartness helped cleansed the palette from the chocolate and slab of ribs, and this one we actually finished. Would totally order this one again, even if I am not sharing.

I Declair - It was okay. Really big and unwieldy as a dessert to fit in the mouth, but easily cut down to big mouthful portions. The whipped cream gave it volume, but it was forked aside and didn't add much to the dessert.

Location - near Boca Park in the SW. Very nice area. Parking is not an issue unless you want a spot right by the door, otherwise the strip mall has plenty of parking for the businesses in it. It is a little far for visitors to Las Vegas, unless you rent your own car.

Service was average but friendly. We were mostly left alone in our corner booth table the majority of the time we were there. 3 stars.

Food - 3 stars. Just A-OK. Portions are big, but you also pay adequately for it. The draw is not the quality of food served, but the relatively large portion size (except on ribs... a full slab is a full slab). So in my opinion you are not getting any steals from the price to value perspective.

Good for groups, especially for desserts? I think so, especially if your group wants to split a big dessert."}
{"text":"We were sat in the private dining room because of our large party.  The room smelled stale (maybe the carpet needed to be cleaned).  The food is just ok to me.  I had the grilled shrimp.  The shrimp were slightly over cooked.  The rice was OK.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this is related to the same claim Jumper in Summerlin.   This is a nice-looking restaurant and the food is horrible.   I had chicken fingers and could barely tell the chicken fingers from the french fries for the price it was ridiculous. I tried the rotisserie chicken it was dry and flavorless I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I was treated to this place back in July of 2016. They put some kind of cleaner in our drinks. I don't know how else to write this, but they put some kind of kitchen cleaner in our drinks. The waitress didn't believe us and just laughed it off. We had an 90 year old man with us and when he kept telling her that you can smell the cleaner in the drinks, she kept telling him to just drink them and that we were imagining it. 

I was sick for 3 days. Everyone else was sick for a couple days more. Those that had a suspicious drink became ill in just hours and stayed ill. 

Two of us called the restaurant and were told a manager would call us back, they didn't call back. I wrote their corporate office and never got a reply back. When I called they connected me to someone that didn't even speak English and they hung up on me and I could hear laughing in the background. 

Something very odd is going on at this place. They act very suspicious and when cornered in questioning they will become even stranger. Everyone in the party that wanted some answers from the Claim Jumper have come to the same conclusion. There is something odd going on inside this restaurant. 

I should have wrote a review on it back in July but I figured someone in our party was going to sue them so I held off. 

This place may kill someone, or maybe it already has. Enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"We have been trying new places every Friday on Date night. Have not been to a Claim Jumper before so we gave it a try. Definitely on the \"won't do that again \" list. 

Arrived about 8:30 it was pretty quiet and dark  inside. There was no wait which kind of made me wonder why on a Friday night. Walking past the food prep area two of the wait staff were laughing loudly after one dropped an F bomb in front of us. We were seated and we had a nice quiet meal that was on par with Denny's for a premium price. My salad was good other than they make croutons out of sweet corn bread. The combination of Blue Cheese dressing and yellow cake croutons was just wrong.

I ordered fish and chips because it's hard to mess that up. Wrong again. Over cooked fish jerky fried in rancid oil. All on a huge pile of soggy french fries. My wife got grilled shrimp and fillet Mignon. A different  waiter brought her plate and announced here's your sirloin and shrimp. He was told we ordered Fillet Mignon and grilled shrimp not Sirloin and Fried shrimp. He said Oh I think it's the same thing. No sirloin and fillet Mignon is not the same thing. He took the plate back to the kitchen. Our waiter came back and said whats the problem? We told her and she went to the kitchen and brought the same plate back with a side of grilled shrimp. I seated facing the kitchen and could see that her plate had not moved from when it was taken back. Now it had been sitting back there and was cold. Well we left knowing why it was nearly empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I love this Claim Jumper it's close to my house and the location is perfect! I can honestly say I've enjoyed every meal that I've ever eaten here! 

The menu has a little bit of everything that you could want. My favorites are their Steaks and the Baby back ribs are pretty amazing for a chain style restaurant. 

The place is huge open and airy so you never feel like you're sitting on top of the people next to you. 

From the greeters to the servers it's always a pleasant experience and it doesn't break the bank to come in for a good meal!"}
{"text":"I rarely send food back to the kitchen to be cooked more and I've never had to send food back twice... until tonight.

So why 4 stars? We'll get to that.

When my wife and I first arrived, the place was pretty well packed. Yes, there were tables open, but the greeters were out of menus and had to wait for some to make their way back to the front desk before we could be seated. The greet staff appeared overwhelmed. When we were seated, the person who guided us to our seat (Jason?) didn't really seem to care much about what he was doing.

We had to wait for a bit for a server to show up, but Amy got our drink order and our appetizer order quickly once she made it to our table. The loaded potato skins appetizer was quite good.

We put in our dinner order and got our salads shortly after the appetizer arrived. And this is where things started falling apart. My wife's green salad was fine, but my Caesar salad wasn't as green as it should have been. The iceberg lettuce was turning brown.

Not that we had a lot of time to consider our salads since the entrees arrived very quickly. We both had steaks and baked potatoes. The potatoes were big and fluffy and quite well baked.

The steaks on the other hand... PJ ordered hers medium and I ordered mine medium well. They were both medium rare at best. Hers actually looked rare. We flagged down Amy who was surprised the steaks had shown up so quickly and so obviously undercooked. She apologized and took the steaks back to be cooked more.

Chris, the manager, soon showed up to apologize for the inconvenience and to thank us for our patience. I mentioned the brown lettuce to him and he took the offending salad away. He offered to bring something in place of the salad, but I declined.

The steaks came back and this time... they were maybe medium rare. Maybe. I told Amy the kitchen was making the restaurant look bad. She once again apologized profusely, seemed genuinely upset on our behalf, and took both steaks to Chris. He came by and this time started out by saying he was embarrassed. We mentioned that we'd been at the restaurant in the past and had very good experiences before, but it seemed like this was a really \"off\" night for them.

He agreed that something had gone off the rails and graciously comped our meals.

The steaks arrived again, but not the same ones. They cooked new steaks for us and this time they were just right. Amy stuck around to be sure as we cut into the middle of both our steaks to check them. They were flavored perfectly, cooked perfectly, and we ended up having a nice meal.

Chris gets points for dealing with us both times things went wrong and for crouching down to our eye level for the second apology and taking responsibility for the mistakes. Completely comping the meals was an unexpected and welcomed gesture. He also went out of his way to make sure we understood that Amy wasn't to blame (we knew that, but it was nice to see a manager have his employee's back like that).

Amy gets points for showing her concern for our satisfaction and for being just as baffled as we were over the obvious poor quality of the preparation of the steaks. Meat shouldn't be red on steaks done medium or above, and the first two were red through and through.

Both of them thanked us for our understanding and for not losing our cool (yes, PJ has mellowed me that much over the years). We got Amy to laugh a bit and she got us to laugh as well by asking if she could get us an \"undercooked dessert\" with a perfect deadpan expression. She earned her 20%+ (before the comp) tip.

So, even though we had an adventure of poorly timed food service, confused employees, and undercooked food, Amy and Chris went out of their way to make things right, and whoever cooked the new steaks for us showed us what we knew the kitchen was capable of doing. They screwed up, but they took responsibility and handled the situation quickly and professionally. That's why they get 4 stars for what could have been a 2 star performance or worse."}
{"text":"Had there happy hour on this beautiful Sunday & it was horrible.  Ruined my day. The food was such bad quality & looked like they through it on the plate. Everything was either tasteless or  salty.   The margaritas we watery & just all around a horrible experience. I'm really disappointed & bumbed because I so excited for a great Sunday brunch.   I wouldn't ever recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Not the fastest service, but who cares, the food is soooooooo good! And you get a lot of it, for a decent price! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.

- restaurant clean.
- waitress was friendly and nice.
- drinks refilled - thanks!

Come up: burger on lunch menu.

burger was huge!  It tasted delicious.  I was so full tho.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I came here on a Saturday night for a friends birthday. Service was a bit slow but made sense because restaurant was busy. Drinks were prepared well but my entree was not up to par. I didn't even eat half of it because artichokes were so sour they were inedible and fish seemed as it was not fresh. I tried to eat it it it was awful..after tracking down manager I brought it up to managers attention, David. David said he would let kitchen know the quality was up to par but refused to take item off the bill even though I did not even eat majority of it. Not only did he argue with me but he did nothing but offer a cupcake and I told him I did not want a cupcake.I work in the restaurant business myself inside the Venetian and I will never come back to this location and will definitely advise people to stay away from this location. What ever happened to hospitality and guest concepts? So disappointed and this place left a bad taste in my mouth. Ruined birthday and whole dining experience."}
{"text":"Good food but very poor service, this location also feels very un-inviting as I am a Hispanic man and stopped by to grab a bite to eat with my family but as soon as we walk in we received uninviting stairs from not only the customers but they employees as well we were taken to a table and sat there for 10 to 15 minutes without being attended to at this point we decided to get up and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Usually sit at the bar for lunch. Bar staff is always friendly, however the food seems to take a long time to come out. The restaurant is typically pretty empty when I go in so it's odd how long it takes for food. Started trying other items on the menu.... So far truce all been sub par. Overpriced for the quality"}
{"text":"Happy is the name of the game here. They have a pretty awesome happy hour and luckily, the hours aren't too limited, so I can actually make it in time. They also offer it on weekends and all day on Sundays during the football season. Sweet. 

I've always been a fan of Claim Jumper, one of the better chain restaurants around. Big portions and pretty tasty food. Desserts are good here as well. 

My fella's not a fan, so I don't get here too often, but it's always a food option for HH."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars but I am giving it 5 because not much about this experience could be approved upon.

Needed a place with only about a weeks notice to accommodate about 25 people for my parents 65th wedding anniversary, yep 65th.

Claim Jumper's happily obliged. The website has banquet menus with costs per person listed which is another plus. Reserving the space was a breeze. Jeff took my info over the phone and someone called to confirm the day before.

Arriving about 15 minutes prior to guest arrival our space was set up and ready to go. Xavier was our server, our only server but this guy has it down and he provided us with excellent service. Our beverages were never dry and he was quick with all of our requests.

Soup and salad orders taken followed by entree' orders. I had the clam chowder. When it was put in front of me I was a little apprehensive, it was so thick it looked like paste. But...this was some of the best chowder I have ever had.  Salads all looked good. Fresh greens and toppings.

Entrees came out quickly. Everyone ate commenting on how good it was.

The menu is extensive but we opted banquet menu options only. For less than $20 a person guests received bread, soup or salad, an entree choice from about 10 selections ranging from burgers, jambalaya, chicken fried steak, grilled chicken and the like with unlimited non-alcoholic beverages.

They also let us bring a cake from a outside source, providing the plates and utensils.

I HIGHLY recommend Claim Jumper's for small banquets and events. Food is great, service even better!"}
{"text":"I really hate to give 2 stars because Claim Jumper's is one of our favorite places. The chicken pot pie is phenomenal but today...

Met a high school friend here because I needed to go to IKEA and she lives close to AZ Mills. Arrived at about 11:20 on Presidents Day. Place was just starting to get busy. Hostess greeted and sat us right away. Our server, Christian I believe was his name greeted us immediately and took our drink order. He brought our drinks right away and came back about 10 minutes later to take our food order.  This is where this visit goes downhill. Waited awhile for our lunch to come out. One California Citrus Salad with chicken, one bowl potato cheddar soup and one kids 2 slider meal. 

Once our meals arrived my friends salad was picture perfect. My soup obviously had been sitting awhile, a skin had started to form on the top and my son's burgers were ice cold. Not lukewarm but ice cold. Our waiter was MIA for the rest of our lunch until my companion flagged him down for our ticket. 

If our service would have been even average I can justify the $40 price tag, but 2 of the entrees were cold. And at $8.99 for a small bowl of soup I expect it to be perfect! 

Will we go back to Claim Jumpers? More than likely, but if we receive the same type of service the next time we will probably cross it off of our list."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a nice catch up lunch. The food and service were excellent. Love coming here and they had great gluten free options for me to choose from. Only thing was I smelled something similar to gas when I walked in, I think they might have gas lamps? Other than that though great place, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've loved this restaurant since I lived in Chicago. As always good food good service yummy chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Sometimes their food is beyond excellent and other times it's horrible. Being there during the day vs a busy night seems to make no difference what so ever! 
There are a select few really good servers here, a couple have become good friends, but there are also some really bad servers as well. Sadly, there's no in between, they're just good or bad!"}
{"text":"Great visit to CJ. Had not been in a while. They did not disappoint. We had a porterhouse and the baby back ribs. Both outstanding. 
Great service as well!"}
{"text":"How sad that a restaurant that used to be so good fall so quickly. I have been to the Claim Jumper in Buena Park, CA, and the Claim Jumper on Baseline in Arizona and I am convinced that both restaurants over charge their patrons. The food was just okay, nothing special, just okay, but the prices were extremely high. A basket of fried zucchini's should not cost $9.99, especially when their batter didn't even adhere to the zucchini sticks. The chicken pot pie cost $17.95, outrageous! Even Marie Callender's frozen chicken pot pie from the freezer section is much better. Claim Jumper's chicken pot pie was not only dry and clumpy but there were hardly any mixed veggies in the pie. Oh yes, their drunk chicken for $22, was way over priced. We also had two large salads that was very tasty, but far from being large in size. In fact, the price was larger than the salad. I almost forgot, they took out their produce bar and added more tables, a big mistake. My family will never visit any Claim Jumper again."}
{"text":"The Claim Jumpers was located in the middle of the Golden Nugget Facility. It was as most things are in Las Vegas Casinos, quite a walk, with all the distraction signs so much larger than the signs to help you to dinner. Well the staff of the Nugget are helpful, even if they only point in that direction. On the way in the fish tank experience in the Nugget is impressive. Now in to Claim Jumper. The hostess was helpful and we must have come at a slack time as we were surprisingly seated immediately. The waiter had one to many cappuccinos as he talked at a speed that was indeed breaking the sound barrier. No  worry, we got our order in successfully and it was a simple order, a cobb salad and a Chinese chicken salad. Her cobb was very nice, however it would have been even nicer to have something other than iceberg. Oh well? My Chinese chicken salad was interesting. I do not every remember have a salad that was chopped this fine. So fine was the chopping I thought is was a minced slaw. All the flavors were there, somewhere. All in all the salads served us well and we are off to our next adventure."}
{"text":"NO PRODUCE BAR? Why not? Ordered an expensive hamburger that was below average. Fries dry and thin. Burger burnt on bottom. The bun was hard. What happened to CJ? This used to be a great place. I guess since the sale to Landry's the place has declined. Just like all the rest of Landry family of crappy chains. Sad to see what used to be one of the best concepts now one of the worst managed chains in the country. AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Great steak and potato.  Ordered rib eye with bone and baked potato.  Super good.  Carrot cake was just ok.  Seven layer chocolate cake tasty.  Hot fudge Sunday was simple and very good.  I would recommend this restaurant.  Excellent servers.  Manager stopped by to ask about dinner and very nice."}
{"text":"This place is really cool for children and older, retired people.  The food is awful.  Nothing on the menu is interesting- they serve meatloaf for crying out loud!  WHO SERVES MEATLOAF IN SCOTTSDALE??!!"}
{"text":"This was an OK lunch. My burger was good, but my mother in law's wrap she said was only ok.   Love the shoestring fries.  This is a chain, so you pretty much know what to expect, it's pretty OK food for a decent price.  Nothing to write home about. Nice service and we were sat quickly, I'd go back with my family for a quick lunch if someone else in the group wanted to, but I wouldn't suggest it on my own."}
{"text":"We just ate at Claim Jumpers on Ft Apache.  I allow myself one sweet treat on my birthday.  I ordered the brownie to go.  When I got home and opened the box, it was a big dry chocolate muffin with 1 tbsp of frosting in a small to go cup. Not even enough for a bite.  Soooo disappointed as again, this was to be my one sweet treat until my next birthday. When I called to complain, I was told that is how we make our brownies now...in a small bundt cupcake pan.   OMG... it didn't even taste like a brownie as dry & crumbly.  Fool me once but fair warning to those of you who remember the big square double frosted brownies CJ USED to make!!!!"}
