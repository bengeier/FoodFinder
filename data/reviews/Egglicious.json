{"text":"Alright .. second visit to this restaurant.  I am loving it more.  Never judge a book by its cover!! This place offers up an extensive menu offering both breakfast foods and loads of lunch options - no dinner service here!  We arrived around 10 am Sunday morning and were seated right away.  Awesome service right from the start.  Friendly servers, clean and fast.  We both had eggs benadict and yeah I'm a huge fan!!   Coffee strong and tasty to boot!!  Only issue is the parking although this is a smallish restaurant to begin with.  Peeps waiting for our parking spot when we were leaving.  Give this place a chance and you'll be surprised!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times; breakfast is okay, it's hard to mess up breakfast but it's decent for the price. Great service but have found hair in my potatoes and my boyfriend found steal wool in his eggs. They apologized but seemed annoyed. I also don't recommend the Benedict because it's very vinegar-y. Overall, it's okay; mildly disappointing but as far as breakfast goes, you can't go wrong. Just double check your food first."}
{"text":"Been there a few times, and all of a sudden, they start trying to increase the volume and quality of the home fries by a putting lot of miniscule pieces of green peppers in. I am highly allergic to green peppers, and it was not stated in the menu that the home fries had green peppers in them. (This was a recent change, apparantly.)  They were so small and burnt, that I did not know they were in there until I started having an allergic reation.  I ordered the bacon \"soft\", and every inch of it was burnt to a crisp and inedible.  I like pinapple, but NOT as a breakfast garnish that leakes all over the rest of the food. The service is slow and borderline rude, considering it's almost empty when I'm there, snotty attitude, and no mid-munch visit for check-in/top-up.   They did not charge me for the last breakfast, but that does not make up for me being sick for 4 days."}
{"text":"Honestly don't understand what people that gave this a low star rating expected.  Fast service, good food at a reasonable price. You're at a diner so you're not going to get Michelin restaurant grade food but, in my opinion, that's not generally what you want for brunch. 
Good portion sizes and well presented. 
Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Well, well, well....ask and ye shall receive!!  Just last week, Egglicious got a little facelift....new seating (more of it) and a redo on the parking lot (more of it, too!!).  It still is diner-like but in a good, homey way, and the extra parking spots will go a ways toward to helping the breakfast crowds.

I love breakfast here (especially the bennies and the skillets) but lately have been dropping by a lot more for supper and a time or two for lunch.  The burgers are great value (love the kaisers), the fish and chips (two pieces is the standard order) and not-out-of-a-packet tartar sauce simply delicious, and the curry chicken pasta is fast becoming a favourite.  I would encourage everyone to try them for supper.  The menu is limited but the owners and staff are working hard to expand, while keeping the quality of their offerings up.  Give them a try!  There are still kinks to work out but they will get there with enough support from area foodies.

Oh...and just while I am here.....Nag, nag, nag.......you really, really, really need garlic bread on the menu!! Please????!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely Etobicoke's hidden secret!  The selections are similar to Cora's but the portions and prices are 100% better. The food is fresh, always consistent, and the service is friendly.  Be prepared to wait a little as the place is always packed! Ample parking available and an easy location to get to. I have been a repeat customer for eons."}
{"text":"It was a great surprise stopping by this place after a long drive. The waitress was super nice and our meals were prepared quickly.  We ordered the triple decker and western sandwiches and everything was nice and fresh; the fries are addictive.

The menu is super affordable and I want to come back to taste the breakfast/brunch items!"}
{"text":"A 'go to' brunch on the weekend for me. Food is always consistent and tasty....lots of choices of eggs Benny and always a special Benny too!! Big menu with lots of choice whether you prefer savoury or sweet! Good price point too."}
{"text":"I dropped by with the friend who had recommended this place to me. I always drive pass it since it's fairly close to home but it had never appealed to me to be honest compared to other chain restaurants that serve all day breakfast. To my surprise, I was extremely pleased with my first experience here! We arrived at roughly 7:30am (we woke up extra early to try it out before we drove off to our classes). We were greeted with a very warm welcome by the serving lady who was the only server working at that specific time. There was only one other man in that restaurant when we arrived. When we were ready to order, service was fast and helpful. My friend and I both waited maybe a little less than 10 mins until both our breakfasts had arrived. Portions were a good size for its price! My hollandaise sauce was up to par on my \"Eggs benny and Cajun chicken\" and I was very happy by the end of my meal. Chicken wasn't too dry, home fries were delicious, the poached egg just went so well with the cajun chicken. At the end of my meal, I noticed about 5 other customers had arrived by 8am- service was still top notch. From my experience, I highly recommend you check this place out. It's quite underrated and I would definitely drop by again; very soon too!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this ridiculous breakfast restaurant. Ridiculous in a great way. Listen, there is an inexplicable statue of a triceratops outside and that's arguably the best thing about Etobicoke. 

Also featured here: Awesome vegeterian options for me, meaty meat meat options for my man. 

Staff is always very friendly. It's some damn good greasy diner food. What a hangover cure, this place is."}
{"text":"Solid. The service is fast, friendly and efficient. Hot sauce rocks! I tried their 8 oz reuben sandwich with fries and I should have ordered the 6 oz. I probably would't have been able to finish that, either. It's always busy but they seem to turn their tables quickly. Lots of benedicts on the menu and if you like Avocado, you're in luck! You can add avocado to almost anything in the menu. 
The side orders of fruit are large, fresh and feature a nice variety. I don't really like fruit, but definitely something to note.
Bonus: delicious caesars!!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean, fast service, lots of menu items to chose from. Waitress was very attentive. Seems well run.

We will be back."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot may not look like much from the outside, but it is worth checking out. 

They have a large menu with lots of unique (and tasty) options to choose from. All the breakfasts come with plenty of fresh fruit.

The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was decent, fast service, but I got my bill when I wasn't even half way done my meal. I was never asked how it was or offered more water."}
{"text":"Location: Somewhere in Etobicoke. They have a parking lot, but I have no idea how to get there by transit (if you were coming from the core then you'd want to drive). 

The place: It has a diner feel to it, but was recently renovated so I would categorize it as 'modern' diner decor. Very clean, lots of windows. We got there around 9 a.m. on a Monday (Civic holiday) and didn't have to wait to get a table.

The goods: I ordered a 3-egg vegetarian omelette that was served with potatoes and a side of sausage + coffee. I asked to substitute one of the veggies and this was no problem at all. The omelette was huge and delicious, as were the potatoes. Also, there's not a lot you can say about breakfast sausage but the ones these guys serve, totally rock. 

Service: Our waitress was fantastic. Super friendly and attentive, always checked in to see how we were doing, and we never had to ask for water/coffee refills. 

Price point: The whole thing cost me about $13 with tax. Note that the coffee and sausage were extras ($1.95 each) so double-check the menu to see what's included when you order. 

I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm in town. Check it!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the ruff. Unbelievable breakfast joint with fantastic service and even better food. Personal recommendation: chicken crepe! Moist chicken pieces with an amazing hollandaise sauce! You gotta eat here!!!"}
{"text":"En busca de nuevos lugares de desayuno.
Decidi probrar este lugar. 
Ordenes omellete con ham y espinaca y queso suizo.
Wowwww estaba sobre cocido practicamente quemado. Le comente a la mesera que si prodian cambiarmelo y me contesto que tendria que pagar por un nuevo platillo.
No vuelvo a un lugar donde no toman responsabilidad de los errores en cocina 
Mal servicio y mala comida."}
{"text":"This is our favourite place for weekend breakfast. The staff is super friendly, the service is quick, the food is always just right and portions are very generous. We have never been disappointed here! Get the Lumberjack breakfast. It's got a bit of everything and can totally be shared between two people if you add in an extra side of eggs and fruit. The 2 pancakes that come with it are perfectly fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. However, the potatoes are definitely our favourite part. Perfectly seasoned and never undercooked. We have never found another breakfast place that does it better!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Egglicious for their Curry Chicken Bowl. It's amazing the flavor of the curry mixing with chicken and vegetables. The rice on the other hand wasn't at my liking. Its kind of hard compared to asian restaurant which is soft and fluffy. If you are really hungry, I recommend eating their breakfast. It's HUGE! My boss and I were never able to finish the whole thing."}
{"text":"After some searching for a breakfast spot near to Colonel Sam Smith Park where I went ice-skating last Friday, I decided on Egglicious Cafe and Grill. When I arrived, it was still very busy although it was almost noon; not sure if the lunch crowd was already starting to come in or perhaps it is always like this. There were also a few people coming in for either pick-up orders or to order take-out. The service started out quick, but then there was a bit of a wait for my food after ordering, and little contact with my server after the food arrived. The restaurant is fairly large, with seating for about 70-80 people I would estimate, and lots of windows and bright colours in the decor.

I ordered the Morning Glory, which was french toast with 3 eggs and bacon, and a cup of coffee. Everything was fine and the portion was good; the french toast was 6 fairly thick half-pieces with butter and syrup. The coffee was strong but not overly so. There was also a french toast plate that came with fruits and cashews instead that I almost ordered, and about ten different versions of Eggs Benedict, as well as the usual egg breakfasts and sandwiches and entrees. My total bill was $16, so about average for the size. I cannot say that my experience was as great as some of the reviews that I had read, but I am willing to give them another try in case they were busier than expected that morning."}
{"text":"I ordered from here on uber eats, so disappointing. Our food came Luke warm, the home fries were pretty much mush, our eggs benedict's were supposed to have goat cheese, they didn't, the salmon on mine tasted extremely fishy. We also ordered the chocolate banana berry crepe as a dessert, it came with no berries, almost no chocolate, and no English Cream on top as advertised. Would never order from here again, a waste of $45"}
{"text":"I have been to Egglicious on  numerous occasions and the the food has been excellent and the staff freindly. 
On Sunday March 25th I was there for a late afternoon brunch with my partner and we were placed near the check-out. To my disgust the manager/owner was berating one of the servers loud enough so that I could clearly hear what was being said. Not only was this embarrassing for the server it was totally uncalled for to be doing this in such an open place for the diners of the restaurant to hear. He not only berated her he was swearing at her and telling her if she didn't like what he had to say she could get the \"Fxxx\" out.
I am so disgusted with his behaviour I will not be returning to this establishment in the future!!!"}
{"text":"After a morning group-birdwalk at nearby Colonel Sam's Park, I was starving. We drove into the parking lot and thank goodness 01 spot was there. If not, don't fret, next door, Tim Hortons has plenty of spots, they usually have drive-thrus. (No need to park far on this cold day) When we got inside, around 11:30 a.m. we had to \"wait to be seated\". I asked my partner if they wanted to go elsewhere but we stayed. There was a place to sit while waiting, which is rare in other spots. Not that long of a wait and thankfully someone is there to take control of the situation--how many people, etc. Less than 05 minutes, we were seated. The table was cleaned expertly without having to see the previous customer's leftovers. Our order was taken as soon as possible and the wait was not that long for the food. My partner was on their smartphone and the review said a good 15 minute wait from 01:00 p.m. to 02 p.m. The review also said 45 minutes for the whole eating time. Not for us, less than 05 minutes to be seated, less than a minute to have order taken, and quite a bit of time to finish off the huge portions, phew. My partner suggested I take half my meal home, it was overwhelming for me....First time I said nope, I will try to finish it off here, may take a while, tho. Today was Sunday before Family Day and with a full house, the service was; efficient, correct, and pleasant. No long waits for a coffee-refill, which was free, as compared to other spots. My partner had Panini, while I had \"Skillet-meal\". The Panini was so packed that while taking bites, the toppings kept falling on the plate, that's how packed it was. The Skillet-meal never said it came with eggs but I am glad it did--very good dish to have if you want meatless, which is what I chose; Veggie Skillet-meal. Before we got our meals, I thought I should ask for the usual mayo and catsup was already at the table for the home-fries but nope, the skillet-meal was not dry and the home-fries were not dry, either. No need to add; mayo, catsup, salt or pepper in both meal-sides. I didn't check my partner's meal price but was surprised it was only $08.95 and toppings only $00.50 @ making the chicken-breast Panini only $09.95 and it came with a side and a pop. (If you want cheese it's $01.00 extra) My Skillet-meal was only $10.95 and the coffee was $02.50 but guess what?--a pile of milk/cream was at the table--no need to beg for more, like in other spots & the coffee  was refilled a few times before I could finish-off the huge meal servings. The receipt was given before we finished our meals and we were told we could pay up front as compared to other spots where you have to wait and wait for the receipt to pay and  leave. The tip is either by amount or percentage, so you are not stuck wondering how much percentage to give--give what you want in amount. This place has been here for 06 years and my partner recalled it being there over 40 years ago but under a different name and ownership and I am glad I said, let's go see what it's like now. I'll be back fer sure !! I appreciate how they do not hide their prices--most spots only show the starting-price on their menus and then when you get the bill, you realize how much the extras were \"after\" you ate them.
P.S. Do not go by the customer photos on here; the Panini we had was larger than that--needed 02 decorative toothpicks to keep the contents intact, the home-fries were more than that and the pineapple-slice (free) was larger than the photos."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super fast, fresh and friendly. The staff are lovely and get orders right even if you make changes to an order. One of the best orders of home fries in the city. Keep up the great work, see you next weekend (and the weekend after that and after that). I would like to wish that cute as a button server good luck in her travels and I hope she has a long, positive and health life."}
{"text":"I don't know what to tell you but I had a western sandwich one time from there and it was pretty gross.  The toast was soggy, there was very little omelet in the sandwich and it just looked/tasted like whoever made it didn't give a shit about - not cheap either - had to throw it out."}
{"text":"So, I was in Toronto, and I had a hankering for breakfast ... at 8PM. This seemed like a difficult proposition at first, as consulting the Yelp app wasn't much help, giving me false positives for places that seemed to serve breakfast, but mainly only at proper breakfast designated times.

And then, I found this place. It's totally sketchy looking from the outside, and to be honest, the inside really isn't all that better. However, the food was excellent. The service was also quite good, but we were the only people in the place, so that's kind of hard to mess up."}
{"text":"So my aunt and I wanted breakfast after a morning at Costco's. She wanted real breakfast as her husband doesn't do swine so when they go out for breakfast it's more like lunch. I typed in breakfast/brunch into yelps and gave her the options. She chose it and away we went, in search of brekkie. 

Menu and options are amazing and prices are fantastic. Not to mention mimosas with Jack Daniels. 

Yes the place is a little run down but it s about what comes out on the plate more than anything else. 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it has. Been a year or more since my last visit, which was not so great.  But I decided to try again last weekend and this weekend....redemption!  The place has the same delicious food and same owners, but the place has been remodelled and the service is proficient now.  You'd be hard pressed to find better breakfast eats in Etobicoke with the exception of a couple other favourites of mine.  Thank you Egglicious for evolving into what seems to be a popular weekend breakfast hotspot!"}
{"text":"You know when you drive by those restaurants with the big 'All day breakfast' signs and it looks questionable, but you see vehicles in there so you think, I'll give it a try in hopes of discovering a hidden gem?

Well, that is not the case with this place.  The only draw I could see was the couple of waitresses who hung out at the front counter chatting up men.  It seemed to be their prime accountability.  Seating customers, offering menus, checking on customers and being observant for refills, taking bills to tables, or even cleaning tables...those things don't seem to be a part of their day.  The food just isn't worth reviewing.  I don't advocate fast food, but you'd be better off with a McDonalds or 7-11."}
{"text":"Generous portions with decent prices. The interior is a little old and ripped, but the exterior has a triceratops, so yah..."}
{"text":"Thought i would give this place another go. I've been here a couple more times for their smoothies and shakes, which were great.

Today for lunch I got a corned beef sandwich (6 oz). To my surprise the sandwich came with homefries, a small salad and pickles all for $9.30 (tax included). I have to say for value and food portion this place really is generous. So I was excited to try the corned beef sandwich. It's a bit different than what i've seen at other deli places. The bread here is grilled with butter on the outside. When i took a bite of this juicy sandwich all that I could think about was how crazy salty the corned beef was. It was a real shame. And the mustard did not help. There is no way I can recommend getting a corned beef sandwich larger than 6oz here. The meat is just a salt bomb. I could not taste the salad after eating a bite of the sandwich and I could barely taste the hash browns. And I just altogether avoided the pickels... For the price, sure it's cheap, but it was hard to finish."}
{"text":"I had lumber jack for my breakfast there. Very good portion. Totally loved it. They offer all day breakfast which is a good news for me. The staff kinda gives no attention to you unless you waved at them."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast here. The waitress was very friendly. I forgot the name of the palte, but is consisted of a few eggs, bacon, other stuff and 2 pancakes for 10$ - now thats a deal."}
