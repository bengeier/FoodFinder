{"text":"Super slow and the staff are not trained enough. Every time I order a drink I need to wait for fifteen minutes, insane"}
{"text":"The best bubble tea at UIUC! The boba is always fresh and has a good taste. The ingredients are fresh too so it doesn't have that artificial flavor."}
{"text":"I usually don't post any review but their salted cream float just got me! It was so good. They said they made it in house themselves and you can actually taste it! The cream is really rich and it goes so well with their organic tea, especially oolong tea which is my favorite. I also like green tea latte, rose milk tea and brown sugar milk drink. Also friendly customer service and modern interior design."}
{"text":"Their tea taste amazing and boba is legit! My wife is from Japan and she loves this place."}
{"text":"Although there are many bubbletea shops opening up here and there, Latea remains supreme in quality and taste. You can taste the quality in their boba, and the tea has no artificial flavors; all natural. So if you're looking for some quality bubble tea, I highly recommend Latea. My favorite is the oolong tea with boba and pudding, half sweet, less ice, sub whole milk."}
{"text":"Ever since I have graduated from Purdue, I have never had a real decent bubble tea. I drove almost three hours to UIUC just for this place. They have kept the same standard as before. This place never disappoint."}
{"text":"Latea still reigns supreme.

They keep messing up my orders of regular green/black tea (almost 50% of the time), but they're always nice about it. Today they even gave me the milk tea they made for free, on top of remaking my regular tea drink. While I feared the terrible gas-tronomic repercussions of drinking milk, my less enzymatically challenged friend seemed to enjoy it.

Thank."}
{"text":"LaTea has great service and a great menu! They're one of the few bubble tea places on campus that offer milk alternatives (soy and almond milk) and the boba is great too! I tried the lavender milk tea yesterday and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been to La Tea several times, I'm ok with most of their drinks but they are just so overpriced. I don't think the drinks they sell deserve the price tag."}
{"text":"Is Latea better after their soft-opening? Short answer: no.

The most important trait of any food/drinks place is consistency. Sadly, Latea lacks consistency. Depending on what you order, the drink could taste great, or mediocre. Even if you order the same drink all the time, for the SAME drink could be delicious for one day, but nauseating for another day.

It seems like they're trying to train up new employees. Time will tell.

In summary, Latea is overhyped. Don't let the 5-star reviews fool you!"}
{"text":"Hmm the creamy cup wasn't so tasty. Tastes weird. Tea was ok, nothing special. Bubbles were soft not bad"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night and it was fairly busy. I waited and waited and waited...and my drink never came and it turns out they lost a few of the orders. I ordered the house milk green tea with 25% less sugar and it was disgustingly sweet. I drank less than a quarter of it and I couldn't tolerate it anymore. My friends ordered their drinks with 50% less sugar and they also complained that it was too sweet."}
{"text":"I visited my friend during the winter break and my friend recommend Latea to me. Have tried it several times and it never disappointed. My favorite drink is house milk tea, with boba, less sweet, less ice. I also tried their oolong milk tea, brown sugar milk drink and fries, they are all pretty good. I am not the person who normally write review, but I definitely recommend Latea!"}
{"text":"Ok place. My go-to place (chatime) is temporally closed so I tried this place. Milk tea was okay. Not impressing. Most of the time this spot is super busy and takes FOREVER to get your order ready. I don't care about organic tea stuff so I'm going back to chatime when they open again"}
{"text":"In terms of actual bubble tea, I find their drinks to be watered down compared to Chatime. I always get less ice and significantly less sugar in any bubble tea place. Both their house milk tea and oolong tea didn't have a strong enough tea flavor in it, leaving me disappointed. Their house green milk tea, however, is decent. In terms of food, the parmesan basil fries are definitely good, yet very soaked in oil and a bit too salty. 

Tl;dr - I definitely prefer Chatime due to their stronger tea. Come to Latea if you want their snacks or a more \"open lounge\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everything I said in my earlier review still goes (they're awesome) but today something I rarely have happen occurred. It was kind of loud when I was ordering so I think the person behind the register was a bit swamped. She made normal fries instead of sweet potato ones and when I pointed it out, she was so nice and accommodated me and my friends really well. She even gave me a card for a free drink for the trouble despite the fact that I really didn't mind the mix-up. Thanks Latea! You're awesome and your employees are some of the friendliest I've met! :)"}
{"text":"Love their oolong milk tea! The large size is hugeeee! Will come back and try something else again!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. It was my first time there and the lady ringing me up made a couple different samples for me to try. She was so helpful and made sure I got what I wanted. I have been back many times since and have received delicious drinks and great service!"}
{"text":"I was one of their first customers there, and my favorite tea there is their oolong milk tea. I can actually taste the brewed tea on top of the milk and sweetener. The milk tea is also very smooth, unlike most places that usually has a powdery taste."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for bubble tea on campus. I recommend their milk tea & all tea based drinks over the fruit smoothies"}
{"text":"Very fresh milk tea ?we tried  the house milktea with redbean and vanilla milktea with rainbow coconut jelly for free ?Taste  so fresh and different from other milktea in champaign.^_^ Unique environment and cute boy?sweet \"girl \"?

ps?This is my first time  write review.   Sososo fresh?"}
{"text":"So my fiance and I go to this place today and we order a medium lavendar bubble tea. We get our drink and my finace tries to put straw in the cup. Now this is not our time putting a straw in a drink before considering we are 30 year olds so we have done this a few times on our lives, if not more. Anywau, he tries to put the straw and the cup literally breaks from the side. Now this has never happened to us before, so we all are in unchartered territory as to what happened. Anyway, the cup breaks, the milk is all over me and the floor and we start cleaning. We go to the register and asked if it would be possible to substitute the drink considering the cup the drink was served in cracked. The guy on the register says to my fiancee that its not possible that could happen. He says its really hard to believe what you are saying. I dont understand, does this employee think that people like to pay for drinks and then break the cups on themselves and ask for another drink? Its not about substituting the drink. I can pay for another drink but atleast dont tell people that what they are telling is hard to imagine. I mean your coworker was cleaning the mess the cup in which you served the drink. Least you could have done is ask people around you what happened and give the customer benefit of doubt. 

Just saying, i have personally served at cafes and this kind of attitude from hosts is definitely not appreciated."}
{"text":"I would say this is the best bubble tea in Champaign.... i've gone with the mango smoothie (with boba) three times already and it's great!!!!   I've also tried the strawberry which is just as good, but I prefer the mango.   The bubbles are nice and chewy... the \"smoothie\" had real mango bits in it.   Awesome.   I've also tried the fries which are addicting....they are crispy, classy and oh so scrumptious --- i had it with parmesean basil --- sooooo good.   I was ashamed that I finished the entire bucket.   It is pricey but you pay for what you get!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and a great environment. It was my first time having bubble tea and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Went there many times, but for the first time, I got so disappointed by their greetings and attitudes. The cashier threw back your card, didn't hand you a pen for signature like they usually did, and the guy at pickup station didn't help you bag up your drinks like always. Please train your staff FOR THE SAME CONSISTENCY. I paid so much not expecting this level of service."}
{"text":"The ONLY organic bubble tea on campus to serve high quality drinks.
You can actually taste the tea flavor like they brewed it that day. All the tea drinks come normally bitter, so you can customize the sweetness level yourself! Most other places already make their drinks sweet and the \"customized\" levels just mean more sweetness, which is really misleading. Unlike the other bubbletea places, Latea uses their own homemade sugarcane syrup instead of corn syrup or artificial flavoring!
I ordered the strawberry smoothie once and they actually use real fruits. I noticed that the other bubble places just use syrups and ice and call it a smoothie, which is ridiculous.
I believe they serve the best and most chewy boba. The staff is also very accommodating and nice.
My favorite is the oolong milk tea with boba, half sweet, and less ice."}
{"text":"This was my first milk tea experience, and I really enjoyed it. Great service and presentation. They did run out of cheesecake but were apologetic and very nice. Longish wait, but the place was packed. We had the plum green half-sweet (a bit too sweet) and almond with bobo (wonderful). Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This business is wonderful in a cup. My favorite drink in the entire world and conveniently open until 12am on days that require some late night study. The ambiance is quaint and quiet, yet very busy but the line moves quickly. I liked the fact that Latea is like an internet cafe- everyone there is studying or meeting freinds and drinking tea. Very relaxing and calming.

On this occasion, I was looking for a yummy bubble tea- the place I went to prior, though highly refreshing, tasted a little watered down, yet reading Lateas website about their organic teas and variety of customization- I decided to go for it. We ordered the Green Milk Tea with boba regular sweet level and the Vanilla Milk Tea with Boba. Goodness! They were very tasty and fresh. I could tell the difference between the newly organic tea I just tasted and my previous experiences with teas that may have been artificially flavored.

I will definitely be returning as I am a huge fan of bubble tea and tea in general. The best being that Latea uses orgfanic ingredients and thats the difference for feeling great and being great from the inside out. Drink to health, sante!"}
{"text":"First time having milk bubble tea so I don't have anything to compare it to BUT I loved it. I ordered a salted caramel milk tea with boba and 25% sweetness. It was the perfect level of sweetness to kind of cut any bitterness that might have existed. Price seemed reasonable although like I said I have nothing to compare to. Saw someone next to me order the green tea latte, will be back to try that very soon!"}
{"text":"Best boba on campus. They're really good with accommodating special requests. Desserts are  too. Great customer service and lots of cute workers."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD milk tea with tapioca!! Definitely recommend. However, be prepared for a long line and difficulty in finding seats since it's a popular place. They also have food on the menu which is a plus! Haven't tried it myself though"}
{"text":"Just moved to CU and have been here so many times. My boyfriend and I have our staples, green house tea and I like both the house black tea and the matcha tea- with boba of course! The wait can be long but if you time it just right you can be the only one in the whole place, too."}
{"text":"I really do not want to recommend Latea because I don't want to be crowded out from this wonderful boba place.

- Taste
I guess the taste of house milk tea would have been slightly better if it had a little stronger flavor of tea, but otherwise the quarter-sweet option was perfect for me. They also let me try the Xian Cao jelly, and again the taste was not strong but I think that was intended for the balance of the drink as a whole.

- Options
There wasn't many options as Chatime but it was still overwhelmingly many for me. I liked that they also had fries in their menu (which I didn't try yet). It is always good to have a little bit of saltiness along with the sweetness.

- Atmosphere
This was (maybe) the only reason that I gave this place 5 stars not 4. Try this place around the lunchtime on one of the weekdays! Extra-friendliness of the people here and the big window that I loved somehow made up the unique spring-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"every time I went to latea and got a milk tea I will feel very uncomfortable later(either nausea, headache, or insomnia), EVERYTIME! would you please change the formula please please, i am pretty sure it's not myself, two of my friends say the same thing as me. 
The milk tea is even stronger than coffee to me, if you feel not good having coffee, dont try latea. Horrible, i will never step into latea in my life."}
{"text":"I love their bubble green tea lattes! So good. Must try!!"}
{"text":"I have a latea craving once in a while. All milk tea places are about the same price but I like latea because I prefer my milk tea more milky. I usually get the green tea milk tea or the mango milk tea, always tapioca add on. They have a reward system but it always seems to be down so I only reaped the benefits of it maybe only once. I think what also sets latea apart is the Large size is 1L and it's huge. Doesn't even fit in your cup holder . It has a nice lounged area. If I had money to spend I'd come everyday... Keep on doing you, Latea."}
{"text":"I am not the kind of person to return to an establishment after a negative experience. I believe that I have given Latea many opportunities to WOW me with an item. Trying three drinks in different categories proved to have the same outcome: an unappetizing taste and disappointed customer. The distinct milk taste is too strong in my opinion. Although the tea leaves are organic, something tastes unnatural and off. I have tasted my fair share of bubble tea by traveling to Asia multiple times every year. I believe that Latea is a super Americanized version of the Taiwanese classic and is a poor excuse for quality milk tea...

Although the location is close to my classes, it is too far a walk (in my opinion) for untasty drinks. Although the employees provided me a complimentary drink card for my next visit, I have not returned since."}
{"text":"Nice bubble tea place. They have a GIANT size which is nice if you want to have a lot of it. We don't have tons of options for bubble tea in Champaign so this place is welcome. I prefer Chatime though."}
{"text":"I'm not usually big on tea, but I still stopped by every once in a while. The drinks are of good size, they're good, and they have lots of things to mix in. The flavored french fries are great snacks, too. I often got a drink and sipped it while a friend or two and I relaxed and worked on homework or idly browsed Reddit. It's a cozy, quiet place that is never empty, but always has room. The staff are nice, the place is kept very clean, and it's close to Seniorland so it's easy to swing by on your way back from class."}
{"text":"I like latea. I like your drinks a lot. You have the best milk tea in this town. However, there is one thing I wish you would pay more attention which is your sweetness consistency. Since you opened, I've been there like 4-5 days a week. I found that sometimes a regular sweetness tastes not sweet at all. The same sweetness level tastes differently each time. My friends and I all noticed about this.."}
{"text":"And then there was one... LaTea is the last legit bubble tea location on campus until Chatime reopens (Cocomero doesn't really count) and the flavors here are just decent in my opinion.  They have a pretty good rewards program that can get you free add-ons every few purchases. 

There's a flavors chart on the wall behind the cashier. My favorites are the house milk tea and the oolong milk tea. But they also have some cool floral flavors like Rose or Bouquet Milk Tea and Salted Caramel Milk Tea!  You can also customize how much ice you want as well as how sweet you want the drink (regular, less sweet, half sweet, none, etc.), which is pretty cool. Their sizes, especially the small and medium, are pretty standard. But their large size is huge! When I order a small oolong milk tea with no add-ons, it comes to about $4.40 something, which I think is acceptable, but a little pricier than I'd prefer.

I docked off one star because the lines can get crazy long, not only to order, but also the wait time to pick up your drinks can be slightly ridiculous sometimes. Overall, I'm so thankful this place is here because sometimes you just get a craving!"}
{"text":"Good milk tea place around this area! Very rich tea flavor and not that sweet. Also the staff was very nice and helpful. It is also a great place for friends gathering as it has a lots of tables and sofa area for you to stay. Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Got a small taro milk tea with boba, quarter sugar, less ice.  For some reason, I wasn't thinking about all the other taro boba drinks I had in the past that were actually smoothies instead of milk tea.  This milk tea was SUPER strong, to the point where it was actually kind of bitter.  I guess the bitterness was also more pronounced because I got it with less sugar.  

I do like how they give you the option for less sugar and less ice.  But my concoction wasn't exactly my cup of tea (no pun intended, LOL), so I'll have to go for lighter blends of tea next time (such as jasmine) or just get a smoothie with boba if I don't want the strong-tasting tea."}
{"text":"Probably the best bubble tea on campus! It's located one block west of the engineering quad and I often find myself here between classes. The atmosphere is super chill although it does get crowded around lunch and dinner, and the employees are super friendly. There's also rewards program for all of us bubble/milk tea addicts. Highly recommend, and I wish I had discovered this place earlier in the college career."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place in #glambana for boba! The oolong milk tea is definitely my go to! So delicious! The boba is also great texture-wise. I've gotten the parmesan fries a few times and they are divine! Although, I should add that they do feel pretty heavy after eating them.

The wait for drinks can be pretty annoying as this place can get really busy but staff have always been very friendly and patient!"}
{"text":"Slow. Really really slow. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks.
The staff who work here are not super on top of it nor professional. 
Impossible to study here, this is more for people watching or socializing.
When it gets busy, seating becomes and issue.
I personally find the customize your ice and sweetness option weird. Most places just make your drinks and if you have special preference, you let them
Know. But now they are asking you to even customize how
Much sugar to add. 
Various cactus and indoor plants here, though i feel like they need a bit more soil than the tiny decorative containers they are in.
The tea are fine, but not out of this world for $5."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday and asked the worker at the register if he can give me more of the creme on my salted creme float and his reply was, \"As you can see, we're very busy right now so I don't think we can do it for you.\" What kind of reply is that? It wasn't busy at all. I used to work at a bubble tea place in Chicago, so I would know what busy means when I see it. Busy means line out the door. But he got the nerve to tell me he couldn't give me more because it was busy. He could have just said yes or no as an answer but he got to give me a bs excuse like that."}
{"text":"Latea is probably the best tasting bubble milk tea in the CU area, and there are a lot of them here, so that's a great compliment. They brew their tea from fresh leaves consistently; their boba is always well cooked and not chewy, and they have promotions going on all the time. The prices here reflect the quality, so they are higher than average, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I ended up coming here after chatime closed and every drink I ordered even with the less sweet option was too sweet. I'm from California in the bay area where the milk tea is ACTUALLY GOOD and LaTea doesn't taste very authentic at all."}
{"text":"For boba I can honestly say this is one of the best places I've been to. I tried the recommended rose and bouquet flavor and I was so surprised. Both of the flavors had the flavor of flowers but in the form of a drink. I decided to go 75% sugar level just so it could bring out the flavor better. I honestly think the tea packed with flavor and I was really pleased. The price of the boba is really comparable to other places but their large is larger than the general 20oz most places have as their large!

In addition to boba they have small pastries and cakes and smaller appetizers like fries. Perfect place to come and just hangout with friends or come and get work done if you don't mind the busy environment."}
{"text":"The bubble tea here is legit! Oolong milk tea and milk green tea are both great options. The large size here is 1000 mL, which is as much tea as anyone would hope to get. The bubbles are delicious, service is pretty fast, and the premises are clean. The menu has a good variety of food on it, too. 

With places like Chatime and Milk Tea House gone, Latea stands out even more as the place to go for bubble tea."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea ever. Finally an authentic bubble tea place. On top of that, they only  use freshly brew organic tea to make their drinks. Defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not the best milk tea I had in town, but you can still try it. The people here are so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I love how you can choose the sweetness for your drinks! I came and tried the green milk tea and it was yummy. Could have been a little colder and it was a bit pricey for a medium but I enjoyed it. I wouldn't be opposed to coming again if I was in the area, perhaps to try some of the enticing add-ons shown on the menu."}
{"text":"The tea I had was mediocre and extremely overpriced.  $7 for boba??!?! Outrageous.  Even if they had Jesus making the tea I still refuse to pay that much for a drink, when I can pay the same price for any meal on campus."}
{"text":"Very fresh milk tea. My favorite is brown sugar milk drink with boba! The house milk tea is also really good!! The line is always long, however it is worth waiting."}
{"text":"Tried this new item Yu Yuan and loved it! Just a few more pieces more would be great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down the best boba place in Chambana! Everything I've tried on their menu from milk tea to regular tea and even their fruit smoothies are amazing.
It is a tad pricier than other boba places around but the quality and taste is worth it!"}
{"text":"The line was crazy. Only one girl at the register. She was very nice, it was my first time so I had a few questions. She was polite and answered my questions. 
I had the house tea with boba, it was good but watered down, even though I asked for light ice. If I'm ever in town and go back I would ask for no ice."}
{"text":"Great place! I love that they have all organic ingredients and brew their teas in house, no gross processed teas here! Customer service is super friendly, and the whole place is so cute. I can tell this place will be a big hit with students on campus. My green milk tea was delicious but I do wish that my pearls were softer. I have a sensitive stomach and this was the first time I've had bubble tea which hasn't screwed my stomach over. I've raved about this place to all my friends and I recommend it to anyone looking for good quality bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Latea is my favorite boba tea in CU! The interior is very clean with good energy. Service could be a little faster, but the staff is always nice. Make sure you add boba to your drink, as this may be a common mistake for first timers!"}
{"text":"I got a bubble tea here. I really didn't like it. The flavor was not what I expected. I had hoped it would taste like tea, but it was mostly milk and I really disliked the tapioca globs. Everything on the menu was expensive and most of it was stuff I had never heard of. I like to keep an open mind and try new things, but this was not a good one. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"With the opening of new bubble tea shops, I thought LaTea would try to up its game, but it hasn't. The green house milk teas I've gotten recently have been watered down and tasted mostly like milk.  The furniture and decorations around the interior also need better care. The tables are starting to get wobbly and a few of the terrariums have started growing mold in them."}
{"text":"I like that you have the options of sweetness and ice levels. A lot of times I've been to bubble tea places and it's 90% ice. I appreciated that one can specify. Prices are a little steep for my boba tea fix to be honest (being from Cali...you can find a range of prices, but it is Chambana so this is the normal price-range). The bubbles were very soft and a good texture (thumbs up!). I got the spring mix which was a rose, lavender, and a sweeter caramel (3 flavors in one--win!). The combo was delicious and very light and aromatic. I really enjoyed the tea and the atmosphere of the place is really nice. They also have other items on the menu I want to check out!"}
{"text":"Decent drinks, Starbucks price. Customizable amount of sweetness, ice, jellies + boba, and large selection of flavors. Actually, there's so many it makes the menu hard to read. Not too much different from ChaTime, but when you walk to Latea you won't feel like you're part of a drug cartel."}
