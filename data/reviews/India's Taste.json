{"text":"Came out looking for lunch and found this place and they have all day buffet. No one greeted my friend and I. The tables didn't have utensil or cups. There was a mess across from our table and no one cleaned it until we were leave. The food was average. They offer veg and non veg. One steam rice and noodle option. Few dessert options. Rasmalai was among salad I found cucumber piece in mine. Butter chicken was salty. One reason I would not come back because they made us wait long period of time for one naan! I mean they were serving one Naan at a time and I timed them and it took the staff 8-13 mins to bring out another naan. We were not the only one deprived from being served with naan. There were other tables that were too waited for naan! By the time our naan came out dishes were all cold. They should work on customer services skills and professionalism."}
{"text":"Excellent decor and clean. Food was good but was a little cold. I was happy because the food's taste was great (Named the place right). The Shaih Paneer was my personal favorite on the buffet. The Nans ( indian tandoor roti) was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the second time I went here. I didn't realize this was the restaurant I went for my neighbors confirmation. -It is clean -Yes, i agree the curry is too thin...not the best when i'm dipping my naan in -Wide variety..i ate most of the vegetarian dishes, since I don't eat meat -They make fresh naan, but it's not fluffy..crispy though -Service is very friendly  Overall, I've been to way better buffets. This is nothing special. Trust me."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service. The food has no flavour and takes the server over 30 mins to get your order. Wouldn't recommend !"}
{"text":"Initially, from the reviews this sounded like a great place to to, so a friend decided to join me on this culinary journey to Markham.   We arrived early for dinner, no-one was there, we then started to review the buffet, and the first thing you notice that's not acceptable,  was the food was just warm, not hot. Makes you feel it's the lunch offering transformed into dinner. However, there was a modest amount of dishes to choose from, including buttered chicken, and a mysterious curried chicken. You have to wonder what kind of curried chicken are you offering? non-descript and unpleasant.  Perhaps offering kormas, madras,  or vindaloo curries would have stirred my interest.  There were cold pakoras, I did try one, but it lacked freshness. The key to great Indian cooking is fresh ingredients,  quickly cooked in ghee or mustard oil, and onions well cooked until they are brown, and a garlic/ginger paste for additional flavour. This gives the base for curries then you add curry leaves and your assortment of spices. Since this is a lunch/dinner buffet, It's more cafeteria style than anything else.  Nan was brought to the table, it was okay. Overall, this doesn't cut it in any way as an authentic Indian offering, but if you like cafeteria style food you can eat your heart out"}
{"text":"Indian food is my go to comfort food. This place is great for vegetarians. The food is really good. The amount of veggie options are comparable to the amount of meat options that they have, so there's plenty to choose from. Don't be afraid, try everything! It's a buffet after all... The sweets counter....ahh...so many to choose from. Its right at the entrance! You look at it before you eat and after you have finished your dinner. I swear, I think they have given you no choice but to salivate because you really want/need something sweet before you leave, so they strategically place the sweet counter there for that reason.  And yes I bought pounds of the sweet stuff. I brought these babies home and they were good! Barfi--Good consistency, not hard and not too soft. Sweet and so fresh!!   Service: Not good. We came at around 1pm. Lunch rush! 30 minutes to wait for a table and the servers' main concern is to just clear the tables. They don't even bother asking what you would like to drink, if you need extra napkins, etc. Sometimes they forget to give you your ordered drinks. My mango lassi 3.99 took awhile to arrive. Our bread was not even served. We gotta say \"excuse me but.....\" at least 4 times.   We paid at the counter because that's what everyone was doing. We didn't even bother the servers to bring the bill. Mind you, we tipped 20%t but I wonder if they give it to the servers. They should hire more servers in my opinion!  Oh well.   Location: It's in the middle of industrial office area. No wonder they get good traffic here during lunch time! But if you're not from around here and just wandering around, you'll totally miss it.   Next time I will try this restaurant during dinner time, maybe it will be a different experience. I'll post another review then.  Btw, for the ladies that need to use the washroom, it's well stocked wih TP and it's sparkling clean. The Gents, sorry your washroom there reeked of P!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden Gem! If i'm craving indian food this is the ultimate place to go The nan is extremely fresh from the oven and there are alot of options to choose from. The price is amazing for what you get.  My favorite is the butter chicken, goat curry and the deserts!  Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here, and was really disappointed by the food. Firstly, the chicken biryani almost set my mouth on fire. It was fiery red, and menacing, I have a moderate heat tolerance, and it was just way too spicy!! The Karahi Gosht was just okay.  But their sweets are really tasty! I'd go back just for that. So, that's where the 2 stars are going to!"}
{"text":"Best nan in Markham and butter chicken combo. Good value too. A variety of choices, good safe family choice."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Especially the fact that they had pani puri, fresh naan and the lamb curry and butter chicken was delicious. The food was fresh and absolutely great price."}
{"text":"This place has a big buffet of tasty food for veggie and meat eaters! Their lunch buffet is 12.99, what a great deal! And dinner is only 14.99.  I get thirsty easily and water could have been provided quicker (I had to ask a few times).  I love Indian sweets and they have a large selection of colourful desserts!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a couple of years. I have been here at least 10 times - probably more - always for lunch. I have no idea what dinner might be like.  this place is a buffet. If you order take away they will get it from the buffet (I've seen it happen) I don't consider this a setback since I don't order take away.   another poster put that the buffet is small. I really don't think it is. I mean - its not mandarin or frankie tomatto's. the stuff that I like is always there : butter chicken, goat curry, tandoori chicken, gulab jamon, bhel puri etc.   there is a dude at the back who is constantly turning out naan. interesting to watch if you have never seen it being made.  the food is prepared constantly, and switched over often due to the amount of people regularly coming through the door.   HERE IS A TIP THAT IS USEFUL. we have noticed when it is more busy you can have trouble getting naan from the servers (the naan is not at the buffet - you need to flag down servers who bring it around) - FLAG THEM DOWN. if you wait for them to come to you, you will never get them - this is probably because they are constantly running around serving people. TELL THEM how much naan you want - if you want 10 pieces because you have a big table and people want more than one each, they will be happy to oblige.  sorry to ramble about that - but we noticed this is the one thing that has changed as this place gets more and more popular - and its something which is easily fixed by just grabbing a waiter(not literally - that's assault :)   This is not the best indian food I have had - I think it is quite a legitimate argument to claim that the food at other indian spots is better in the area - more flavorful - but this is the best indian buffet in the area that I know of. (I am not counting 'the host' because that place is bedlam at lunch and you can't viably revisit the buffet since you need to line up for 10 minutes to get to it)  one last thing that I like. When you are done your meal. just get up and walk to the cashier at the front and pay for your meal. No need to wait for wait staff to bring your bill to you. This is especially good for a lunch spot since I find when I am done with my meal I want to quickly exit."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Indian buffet for a reasonable price. Selection is decent and everything is consistent and delicious (love the naan and shahi paneer). The servers are attentive and the place is clean. I'm here a few times a month, and the one negative comment I have is that my water glass is never clean! Nevertheless, I do highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fab! Fab fab... Wow. Awesome selection. Best Indian in Markham - hands down. Packed during lunch. Basket of naan to very table, friendly service . A fav of mine"}
{"text":"Good value, Nann bread is hot and fresh, curry are tasty, but they don't offer something hot spicy, like vindaloo beef etc. by the way, they don't offer any beef curry, but they have chicken, goat or veggie. All in all, it's a place you can try, you may like it."}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Not pricey, good food and friendly folks. . They also have option for a veg or non-veg platter under 10 bucks. Can't beat that.  Caution, do not over eat. Recommended."}
{"text":"I came to India's Taste for their buffet which runs all day. The decor is nice, the place is cozy and comfortable, and they have big screen TV's up playing popular bollywood music videos. This restaurant also has a little place inside where you can buy fresh Indian sweets. Once you pick your sweets out, they put them in beautiful boxes for you.  The buffet had many dishes that were constantly being replaced with a new hot and fresh batch whenever the tray was empty. I tried plenty of dishes and my favourite was the shahi paneer. The food is fresh but it lacks spice and the curry is weak- it's watery instead of being thick, the way it's suppose to be. The naan bread is served in a basket at your table, and I found the naan to be good, but I've had better. Their naan is more on the thick and slightly crispy side.   When it was time for dessert, I found that the gajar halwa (sweet milky carrot dish) and gulab jamun (fried milk balls in sweet syrup) were the best.   As for the service, the staff is friendly but the service is pretty bad. The naan bread took some time to arrive, when ordering drinks; they never arrived until we asked again. The staff had trouble comprehending what was being said.   This restaurant is okay. The food and the service should improve in order make the experience better."}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet for non vegetarians and very well priced too. Not too great for vegetarians though. Good selection of curries, tandoori kebabs, fresh salads. Love the meat curries and most of the food seems fresh. Some of my vegetarian friends were not very impressed though and they happened to go on a weekday, while my experience was great on the weekends whenever I have visited them."}
{"text":"Go to this restaurant during off-peak hours (if you can!), so you can enjoy the eating experience. This restaurant is very popular, so the wait time for dinner at peak hours is very long (and they don't have much room for people to stand and wait at the front). Nevertheless, this restaurant is awesome, and I've brought all of my friends here. My friends who were Indian-cuisine virgins all love this place, and my friends who are foodies are also fans. They have plenty of food options for vegetarians, so all carnivores, herbivores, omnivores or whatever-vores can leave the restaurant stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. We went for the all you can eat option, but some dishes were room temperature or cold (which was a disappointment). Overall it is a very good place if you want to try different Indian dishes. The waiter brings you fresh naan and the service is good."}
{"text":"A great Indian buffet.  Good choices. I would say about 30-35 different dishes for mains,about 10-15 choices for appetizers, about 10-15 choices for desserts(including ice cream).    Go elsewhere if you don't want buffet.  I've came here for weekend dinner 10+ times over the last couple of years.  It's currently $16.99(Friday - Sunday night).  They bring the naan to you fresh.  Most of the food in the buffet area is quite fresh too.  Highly recommend the paneer butter masala, most chicken dishes(although there butter chicken is hit or miss), goat and lamb curry, honey ball/Gulab Jamun(super sweet but super soft!), rasmalai(cheese dessert soaked in milk cream?).  Good value!"}
{"text":"Its a decent buffet place. Good variety of curries and fresh naan. Their mutton curry and butter chicken were winners in my books. Sunday lunch here is $14 or $15."}
{"text":"Frankly I avoid buffets at all costs but I was both starving and in a rush. Awesome value for a buffet. Lots of great surprises too.  While much of the food was standard Indian buffet quality, several dishes were way over the top better. Wow.  It's always a relief when the meats are tender. I was pleasantly surprised to see lots of attentive staff.  All I can say is take lots of little tastes on your first go around. You will find several items that warrant a second or third visit.  I really wanted to give them 5 stars so I ordered a Chai. It was OK.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"nice dinner buffet. I loved the dessert . they can really improve on service"}
{"text":"Great value for your $$$$. Not much of an ambiance but still a nice place to have a satisfying meal. Food is not too spicy, which can be a positive or a negative depending on your taste. However there should be something for everyone, kids, vegetarians and carnivores alike. Wished the fresh naan flowed a little more consistently."}
{"text":"I live in Markham over 10 years and never recognized this restaurant. Don't let the outside fool you, it does get crowded once it reach dinner time! We got buffet like 90% of the customers there. We love the most are their curry chicken (nope, not butter chicken, but its not bad either), vegetarian snack (that's the name), samosa and all their desserts.   Is it the best Indian foods ever? Probably not if you compare to other well known Indian restaurants in Richmond Hill. However, their staffs are quick when you need anything. The atmosphere is nice and comfy. The foods are fresh (at least during the time I went). There are some variety for you to try. You can eat fast or take your sweet time. The cost of the buffet isn't cheap, but not expensive either. You have a choice to order from none buffet style, that is cheaper, but they still scoop the same foods from the buffet areas. They also have a separate dessert section (pay extra), but I am too full to order more.  I would definitely come back for second or buy dessert!"}
{"text":"Not friendly to children.     My 7 year old son who ate a single bowl of rice and a chicken leg was charged as an adult $15.99.  Unacceptable.   Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is good,  I liked the grill stuff but some of the veggie dish needs some more freshness, also naan need to less burnt and cooked thought out. Overall amazing"}
{"text":"They have a decent selection of items. Some of the items are pretty good like the golab jamoon. Some items were kind of cold by the time I took it back to me seat like the butter chicken. I like how the hot naan comes to you.  The other thing I didn't like that really brought down the star rating is the manager/owner is kind of a prick. We had a reservation and right on the dot, your entire party isn't here I'm going to take away some seats. Really asshole?"}
{"text":"This place smells and too much oil and spices. I have tried other Indian places but somehow this place did not get a good rating from my end. This place needs some renovation. When you go out for a meal, quality cannot be compromised. It's not expensive but not a good place to try Indian food specially if you are new to Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Attentive servers. Clean and simple. Love their chat menu. Must go for casual family dinner out."}
{"text":"Best indian food I've ever had!!! I used to go to The Host for my indian fix but I stopped since discovering India's Taste. There are lots more options and the naan is freshly made and fluffy! Their fruit platter is really good too - the fruit is always fresh and sweet. It's a great price too! But try to avoid peak dinner time - it gets pretty packed!"}
{"text":"Since I work around the area this has been my go to spot whenever I'm craving Indian food. The buffet selection is excellent with a large variety of options. There are certain items here that you won't find at other buffets.   Only slight downside is that sometimes you have to flag the servers down for naan when it gets really busy. Other than that the food is great and is one or the best Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is a buffet so I will rate it as such  Food: 3.5 Service: 3.5  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3+  I went to India for over a month a few years back and since then, I've been trying to find good Indian food in Toronto. I've visited a few places but once I heard there was an Indian buffet called India's Taste, I knew I had to try it out.I came here with 3 other guys, each of us having varying experiences with Indian cuisine.  The food: It's a pretty small buffet with 3 medium-sized stations. The first station included appetizers, salads and such. The second station consisted of various meat dishes and the third station offered traditional Indian-vegetarian dishes. The stand-outs for me was the tandoori chicken which was tender and had a good strong flavour. I'm a meat-kinda-guy but I'm surprised that my favourite dishes were from the vegetarian station. Their curry's have good flavour and are spicy enough for my taste (I avsolutely love spicy food). I was only slightly disappointed with their butter chicken as it wasn't as flavourful as I've had elsewhere.  Service was ok. The servers gave us plenty of fresh naan bread (no garlic naan) as often as we wanted and explained their dishes to us when we asked.   I was only disappointed that most of their desserts and my favourite Indian snacks weren't part of the buffet. Instead they were in a different area close to the entrance where you can buy them separately by the pound.  Summary: OK buffet. I might come back one day and bring a few friends. Hopefully their buffet dessert selection increases by then.  Overall: 3+"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Nann is fresh. Alot of goat options. Alot of sweet options.  It's little hard to find. Food quality is fresh."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian buffet in the city. They have very friendly, professional staff. It is always packed so be prepared for line ups especially on Indian holidays like Diwali etc. But I love their veg and non-veg selection!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out here on a Sunday night and it wasn't ready when we picked it up but for good reason.  We had ordered tandoori chicken and they were making a fresh chicken for us instead of scooping it out of the buffet.  Sure enough when we got it the chicken was burning hot, blackened on the tips, uber fresh.    The accompanying curries were all excellent, chicken was tender and moist and not crazy spicy.  Naan was chewy and pillowy.    It's a bit confusing when you walk in because there's a sweets counter to get take out from but the food doesn't come from there.  Just wrangle your way to the person at cash and tell them you ordered ahead of time."}
{"text":"Went: 6:00 pm Thu June 18 2015 (14th couple date) Ordered: Curry Mutton and Chicken Korma and Garlic Naan Cost: incl. tax and tip $25-$30 Comments: They do have a buffet here for a very reasonable $13.99, but we decided to order a la carte. The curry mutton was excellent. The naan was good. We had to order the Chicken Korma again but that was nice as well. Everything was fresh and very tasty. However, the service was not great. It was hard finding a waiter. They did not refill our water. They missed the second half of our order and trying to pay at the front took longer than I thought it should have. Bottom line: It is worth coming here for the food but not the service. I am a little hesitant of returning here because of that. 4 stars for the food. 2 stars for the service."}
{"text":"It was my first north Indian restaurant experience. Went here twice with my boyfriend and I liked some of their food. I'm not familiar with their food name so can't really mention each of them but their butter chicken wasn't my taste. Dessert was good! Not so busy buffet in the evening of week days"}
{"text":"Great authentic indian food! We enjoy it every time. Love the meat dishes, and they have amazing sweets :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, not too much variety but if you enjoy the staples you're good to go. Their desserts aren't part of the AYCE though."}
{"text":"When I walked in from outside, I was not expecting it to be so huge inside! Service was quick, and the staff was friendly and patient.  Pros:  -cheapest indian all you can eat buffet I've ever seen - $12 for dinner  -naan is served warm -very busy and active, so food is always moving  -wide selection of veggie and meat dishes,  and dessert as well  Cons: while there are plenty of tables to sit at, it still feels cramped in some areas. The buffet area can get super packed and there isn't much room to maneuver around. Also, some tables are so close together that you might find yourself squeezing between chairs to get to your seats.   -the food isn't all that spicy. I grew up on a mostly west Indian diet, which has a lot of similar flavors, and I found some of the food to be a bit bland. I guess for a buffet they want it to be accessible to everyone, so this may be a pro for some people     All in all,  a great place if you're looking for an Indian all you can eat buffet. Just add some spice and be sure to get a good seat :) In Markham, there is better indian food but not for this price"}
{"text":"Very disappointing place. The service was poor, waiters were hardly doing rounds.  The food is bland and pretty tasteless. This place is quite overpriced for The poor quality of the food and the service."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, I'm always on the hunt for new Indian places to try. That being said, this place will always remain a staple to me. The quality of this place is very consistent and the taste is good! Lunch and dinner buffet price is the same, $14 or so per person and there is lots to choose from. They also have a wide variety of sweets I haven't tried but they look great! Be prepared to wait during peak hours (lunch).   My only \"complaint\" would be that the atmosphere makes it seem like a fast food place but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Went in for some sweets, ordered some gulab jamuns and ended up picking some laddos as well. Came home to find stale sweets.  So one thing for sure, they might have the best buffet in town but sweets aren't their forte."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good for a buffet.  There were 6 meat curries and 6 vegetarian curries, plus several other dishes including Tandoori chicken and some type of fried fish.  The naan is brought fresh to every table and was very good. I will go back next time I'm in Markham."}
{"text":"India's Taste is a small AYCE buffet restaurant on Denison that is really hard to spot if you're just driving by. It may look old and \"ghetto/sketchy\" from the outside but inside is a nicely decorated venue.   The buffet itself is really delicious! The only problem here, is that there isn't too much variety. You can make your own chaat which I highly recommend, (google it or ask a server if you're not familiar!)   They have the basics like panner, butter chicken, fish pakoras, veg and non-veg thali and daal, but don't have a lot of the specialty dishes that you'd find at higher end buffets (aka ones in Brampton). However, for the price ($15 for lunch) it is definitely worth it. You'll be full and will leave satisfied.  Service can be a little lack lustre at times. We would often be waiting 5-10 minutes for a waiter to bring us more naan. There were 6 of us so you could imagine how quickly a basket of 6 naan would finish up haha. Overall service was not bad though and I give them a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here every time I'm in Brampton.  Great place. The price is right and the food is fresh, varied and excellent.  Naan gets delivered to the table, piping hot and baked to order.  This is usually my indicator of good things to follow.  Vegetarian dishes are excellent and meat dishes (amazingly) are very meaty.  Regardless of time of day, the food seems fresh and is quickly replenished.  Some Hakka dishes available which is good for nervous palates.  Besides the buffet is their even cheaper combo platter...a huge amount of food where you pick some curries from the buffet and comes with salads, naan and dessert....another excellent value."}
{"text":"I don't really bother eating the main meal dishes here .. I am usually full by the time I am done with the starters. The fish pakora and chiken kebab are awesome .. I can eat a whole plate of just that. Then there are some noodles and some more chicken appetizers along with pani puri and chaats. All of those taste great too. And when we are done eating and line up to pay the bill, my eyes keep looking at the options of sweets. I end up buying some sweets and paan too.  So, overall this place is never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Came here with four other coworkers for late lunch today at 1:00 pm on a Wednesday. There was a steady flow of customers which covered half of the restaurant but no wait time. This is not the first time here for me but it's been awhile. The restaurant staff is still friendly and clean just as I remembered it. When it comes to Indian cuisine, I prefer lunch buffet so that I can have a little bite of everything I like. What makes this restaurant worth while to visit is the fresh naan bread that they bring to your table."}
{"text":"Found three beard hairs in the food on my last visit. Quite embarrassing, as I was excited to introduce my friend to the restaurant, and of course, he finds the hairs. Not 100% certain they were bears hairs, but I hope so as they were short and curly's. Too bad - It's great food at great prices!"}
{"text":"What you'd expect from an Indian buffet, good selection and freshly baked nan.  Great value, LLBO, and open till 11 on most days."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Overall, the place is pretty okay. The service is attentive. Someone came by to offer naan and refill water constantly, we never had to flag them down. There were a lot of food options, which is definitely a plus. Several meat (chicken, fish, goat) and vegetarian dishes, a decent salad bar, fruits, dessert, and ice cream. The price is more than reasonable for the selections available. My points are a bit low just because I didn't think the food was that great. The taste was okay, but it wasn't very flavourful -- mostly it was just very salty."}
{"text":"The food was not any good.  Service was really poor plus 2 of the servers was talk to each other and looking to me makes me feel they are talking about me.  The place was not that much clean as well as the plates and the food.  It is a regret to eat there.  I don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Decent indian food with fast service. I have had the following dishes:  1. Channa bhatura - Channa is good and while bhatura are large, they are WAY too oily. They drip in oil when they are served to you and I feel like I'm eating a heart attack so I can't enjoy my food unless I pat it down with a stack of napkins for 10 mins. It tastes good though.  2. Butter chicken - the sauce tastes great (nice and thick and just enough spice) and the chicken is pretty consistent, although a bit on the dry side.  3. Garlic naan - always dry and thin but has a generous helping of garlic, just the way I like it. It would be better if it wasn't so dry because it cracks.  4. Samosas - average. Can't complain.  5. Goat biryani - lots of large pieces of meat. This dish is so flavourful and worth the price. The goat melts in your mouth!  The service is great for take out or dine in."}
{"text":"India's taste is a medium-sized establishment with a fair amount of seating for what it has to offer. The actual buffet area is quite small but has a satisfactory sample of food to offer. In terms of spice level, it definitely is on the mild side. However, if you have a weak heart for the world of spice, it might be a good idea to stay away - my friend looked like he ran a marathon by the time he finished eating his first plate of food. Being my first time here, I didn't realise that naan was served to your table and so I loaded up on rice during my first round. I do have concerns of the sanitation of their desert station, notable the ice cream parlour where the scoopers are placed in bowls of shallow murky water that's been sitting there for who knows how long. Overall, service was adequate, food was decent, but navigation was definitely challenging with how the restaurant was laid out."}
{"text":"While the buffet selection is quite large, I wasn't impressed with any of the dishes individually.  Decent selection of spicy and mild choices.  Best to come here if you want quantity and variety, but just don't expect great quality tasting Indian food."}
{"text":"Indian dinner buffet for $12.99 per person?! What a deal!   India's Taste is located in a sketchy plaza, which I'd be hesitant to enter if not for our friends' recommendation. The interior of the restaurant is small, hence the crowd lining up by the door. We waited a good 30-minutes before we were seated. During this wait time, I noticed many customers walking in to buy sweets for take-out. There are so many types of sweets, I don't even know which one I'd order. The staff behind the counter explained that they're mostly made of syrup and corn starch/flour, although they're different colors.   The buffet itself did not have much options, but I was stuffed by the second plate. This never happens to me, but Indian food can really fill you up! The vegetarian dishes were Meh, but I loved all of their lamb curry dishes. The butter chicken was too watery, but the chicken was nice and tender. Naan bread is brought to your table by the server, and they constantly refill it!   Service was attentive - when we were done with our plates, they were collected almost immediately. The servers may not be all-smiles, but they worked efficiently given that this is a $12.99 buffet.   Sad to say, I had no room for dessert, but I will come back next time a little more hungry!"}
{"text":"Whoa, am I full.  The restaurant doesn't look like a sit down restaurant from the outside, but has plenty of seating when you walk in.  The buffet tables looked clean, and I noticed that the bread was made in-house. The vegetarian dishes stood out for me, although I'm very much a carnivore.  That's why I'm giving this place 4 stars. Did I mention to leave room for dessert?  They look small and unassuming, but are actually really filling (and probably very rich).  And I loved every bite."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place have such few reviews.  I know all you guys are trying to keep this place a secret!!!  Been here for lunch once and usually come here for dinner.  The food selection is the same.  Lunch $9.99, Dinner $10.99.  Nothing spectacular about the decor, but it's nice, clean and comfortable.  They have few TV's up on the wall playing bollywood music videos (without sound...*phew*).  Staff is very accommodating and prompt on the service.  They bring the Naan (Indian Pita bread), fresh and hot to the table.  This is is one of the VERY FEW places in town that serves authentic indian dishes only not as hot (spicy).  I believe this is the only Indian buffet that have 2 ~ 3 goat/lamb dishes.  I LOOOVE goat!, so a bit biased there.  They also have Pani Puri and Chaat Papri (Indian street food)  I'm surprised people are saying their curry is too runny and the naan is not fluffy...duuuh, if you want thick curry sauce, you should go to asian reastaurants, where they use corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Authentic indian curries are not suppose to be 'thick'.  Not water, but not thick.  For dessert, I noticed they have Gulab Jamun, Rus Malai and ice cream.  Since i'm on a diet...hahaha, i didn't try any of those...looks good though  My credentials? I lived in India for 14 years."}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Naan Bread, Butter Chicken, Veggie Fried Rice, Sweet Dessert Ball  || Rating: ( 9/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (7/10) Ambience, (6/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:    One of the few buffets I actually like and return to, India's Taste has an expansive clientele, from families to officer works, and people of all different ethnic backgrounds.   The dishes are all self-serve, but are quickly replenished and don't sit around too long. The best value is lunch time, as the dinner service is more expensive but doesn't really add any new dishes to the table.   The real standout here is the Naan bread, which is made fresh and brought to your table. Servers are attentive enough to ensure Naan is replenished, as well as any drinks that need refilled and plates that need taken away.   Overall, a great place when you're feeling for some Indian food, but come with an appetite to feast!"}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend with my second-nephew who is FOB from India.  It was so bad that it turned him off Indian buffets in Canada.  It's actually pretty funny because he loves to eat Indian food and the next day, when I offered to take him to a different Indian buffet, he flatly refused.  IMHO,  Appetizers:  - Tandoori paneer: too dry, resulted in being super chewy and rubbery - Chaat papri: good, seemed freshly made - Chicken tandoor broke my second-nephew's heart.  He calls them lollipops and he was disappointed in them - mint chutney: good - tamarind chutney: weak/watery  Main courses:  Non-veg - sauces for all the non-veg dishes were decent to good, EXCEPT for: - butter chicken: sauce was ketchupy sweet.  I'd say too ketchupy sweet except the sauce shouldn't taste at all like anything remotely resembling ketchup or sweet.  Veg: - I was traumatized by the two paneer dishes.  I'm a paneer fan and the butter paneer was too ketchupy and the karahi/bell pepper paneer dish had an extremely off-putting combination of spices that I've never had before.  I never thought I'd find a paneer dish I'd hate but I found them here.  The naans were fresh and tasty.  The gulab jamuns were okay, soft and soaked in syrup, but my mom's made better since there didn't seem to be any cardamom or pistachios in theirs.  My second-nephew did not like the carrot halawa.  As a result of my experience with the rest of the food, my second-nephew and I did not think it worth the extra calories to try it and further risk our respective waistlines and tastebuds.  The service was good.  So was the selection of Bollywood music videos.  On a side-note, we observed that when members of the staff sat down to eat, instead of self-serving from the same buffet we ate from, they had their food brought in from the kitchen separately.  Would I ever go back there?  No.  But I can't give it 1.5 stars so I'll round up.  The only good thing that came out of our experience is that my second-nephew will not gain weight after coming to Canada, at Indian buffets, since he was so traumatized."}
{"text":"My second time coming here. Went on a Wednesday for their dinner buffet. For a $13.99 weeknight dinner this place is a steal! I tried to eat every single dish but couldn't pull it off because there's just so many! I've been to my fair share of Indian buffets and this place is easily one of the better ones because of the price and options. There's an appetizer section, salads, desserts, lots of curries, warm from the oven naans.. I could go on but as I write this my stomach is asking me whyyyyyy did I stuff so much food in there??? Lol! Don't know why it took me so long to come back. Definitely will come back sooner rather than later with more folks to share this gem of a Indian  buffet spot!"}
{"text":"Tried the buffet today with family.. Service was pretty good and impressive. Lots of choices on starters both veg and non veg.  Also lots of tasty options with deserts especially rice kheer and gajar ka halwa was amazing. We also loved 2 special Tawa items-lamb and veg.   We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The interior is beautiful and well maintained. There is plenty of seats and this place has a private room and accommodates to large parties.  The bathrooms are clean and nice.   The customer service is kind of all over the place, you walk in there's no host to seat you, however we got seated outside on the patio as is it was a beautiful Saturday evening. There isn't an assigned server to each table, we had our naan and drinks served to us by more than one server, and I guess they lose credibility because you don't get to build that customer/server relationship.   As a person of Arab descent, it was hard for me to understand the different food names written on top of each dish. I wish they wrote in parenthesis what each dish contained to make it easier for a non-desi to understand what was being served. Also, I wish they drew a chili pepper next to the dishes that were spicy. The dessert selection was minimal, not much to choose from. The best part I would say was the naan, it was freshly made to perfection. Overall, the food was good however it was kind of expensive for 3 people, we paid around $89 with tip. Have I had better cheaper Indian food in the GTA area? ABSO-FREAKIN-LUTELY!"}
{"text":"My fiancee often buys samosas here when we have large parties and the quality never disappoints. He always mentioned about the buffet so we finally decided to try it this weekend and we really enjoyed it! We had an early-ish dinner, we got there around 6pm on a friday night. It was still pretty dead so we were seated and served quickly. The friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff was \"ok\", however we were attended to often. The food selection is not as big as a larger buffet like \"tandoori flame\" but there were still enough options and the food was delicious!! The naan was made to order and it was really good! Also it was 16.99 per person.  Overal, food selection is smaller than bigger places but still great food, staff was \"ok\", and can't complain about the price! I would recommend this place and would visit again!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time. Great for takeout. They change the TV diner thali container often so unfortunately portion sizes can be unpredictable. Delicious flavours and good selection.  Staff is helpful and friendly, some challenges with accent  are over come by being patient and asking again. The mango lassi drink is a nice complement to a take out dinner to cool down the spices. Both meat and veg options, and both are good. Huge dessert takeout section if you like those sweets."}
{"text":"Went there on the weekend for some lunch buffet.  Outstanding food for the price! The sauces were great, the Naan was incredible, and the staff was definitely attentive.  If you are going to complain about this place then you probably haven't been to many buffet's or indian restaurants.  Neither are usually as good as this one lol"}
{"text":"Very authentic, freshly cooked, fast service, amazing food. I love their butter chicken. I can only have mildly spicy food but they provide more than enough options at this buffet. Great bank for buck; there's no way you can leave here feeling hungry. They also have amazing galab jamun. Naan is handmade, hot, and fresh and is delivered to your table quickly. To help balance the heaviness and fried quality of a lot of the dishes they also offer caesar and greek salad options (not Indian food but I personally appreciated the variety). Great place!"}
{"text":"Love the place...great food and the nice thng about it is that it tastes's so. Much like home made...unlike the standard oily fare dished out at your avg run of the mill joints ! Service was great even though it is a buffet place with plenty of offeres for naan's rotis"}
{"text":"First time back after a year and its just as good as I remember it. A fair selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian North Indian fair. Not as spicy as I would have liked, but I eat Sri Lankan hot. My dining partner thought it was plenty spicy.  I absolutely love the shahi paneer and channa masala. Saag was also excellent. As are any of their veggie options. No, I am not vegetarian, but they cook these dishes do well; do not miss the meat at all.  But for those carnivores, I highly suggest the Butter Chicken and the goat curries.  Unlike the similar restaurant in Richmond Hill, in this place you do not need to search for the ingredients.  Plenty of vegetables, meats, and cheese in that savoury, creamy sauce.  Tandoor items are also great, namely the naan, paneer gobi, and the chicken tikka. So juicy and succulent was the meat, that I had to have a couple of piece after my dessert. Tandoori chicken was a touch dry today, but it was all leg and thigh pieces, so very tender and flavourful meat, nonetheless. And who could resist roasted cheese and cauliflower?   I am more of a rice eat, but the naan was nice and soft, and buttery; but still crisp to provide a textural contrast. Perfect for mopping up the various gravies on my plate.  Do not forget to try the tava veggies. Yes, I like my veggies, especially eggplant, and there are plenty of those mini orbs among the various broccoli, carrot, peppers, onions, and the likes. Very flavourful.    The chaats are also nice. Don't know how to eat them? Ask the servers how to do it. Or better yet, let them whip you up a plate. Crisp pani puri, tart yogurts, sweet and savoury chutneys, spiced potatos and chickpeas, and indian style pickles; served together with black salt, and some spices, it is an additive combination.  Samosas are great when fresh; lovely filling of potatoes and peas combined in a crisp shell. Vadai are light and fluffy. Onion pakoras are only okay, and only when fresh. When sitting for a bit, the excess breading shows, as their crispy exterior diminishes.  I also commend them on keeping a salad option (Cesear and Greek) and fresh fruit. Plenty of cheese in the salads. Fruits were fresh and sweet. I mean, sweet watermelon in this season is hard to come by.  Desserts are great, but avoid the ice creams. Nothing special about those. Instead stick to the selection of gajar halva, gulab jamun, kheer, and rasmalai. Lots of dried fruits and nuts in the halva and kheer to keep the flavour and texture interesting. Gulab jamun is fresh and wonderful, but not for those who do not like Indian sweets. Rasmalai is soft and creamy; not spongy as I have had in other place.  They manage to keep the trays of food refreshed often, often taking them back in the kitchen for replacing, rather than just pouring more on top. Servers were attentive about clearing plates and bringing naan, and helping out at the buffet. The decor is nothing stellar, but there is nothing to complain about. Its clean, its unobtrusive, and it works. More important to me is the food and service.  Over all, a wonderful visit. Prices are good for the quality and quantity of food. I would recommend any day, and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Wanted to come here for a long time and I wasn't disappointed. Self serve dishes with decent selection. Several lamb choices if you like lamb. 12.99/14.99 ayce lunch/dinner. My favourite chicken curry was great, juicy and tender. The spices in the curry tasted great as well. Just not spicy as I assumed it would have been. The naans are served fresh to your table. Cool Bollywood being played on the TVs to set the mood. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Came by for dinner on Saturday for their buffet. The restaurant is hidden between other industrial looking buildings so it can be easily missed. Parking spots are limited as are seating inside. They do get quite busy during their dinner service so be sure to arrive early if you're coming with a larger group (4 or more).  The food is your basic Indian fair without the spice but you can add peppers to your dish to spice it up. Flavours weren't as pungent as I was hoping it'l be but still decent nonetheless. They bring fresh naan to your table every so often which is great because you'll always be eating warm naan and the staff are very friendly.  I would come back because their price is very fair (~$20 per person for weekend dinner) and would recommend it to others for a simple Indian food fix but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"very upset with my last visit here.. my parents usually pick up food from here when it's a night no one has time to cook.  the last time my mom ordered food from here the lady ended up being rude to her over the phone. she said my moms order was ready by the time we got home we realized we paid for naans but they weren't in the bag and the lady said it was our fault for not checking.  irrespective of this, I chose to give them another chance as everyone is allowed off days.  I went for the buffet - the food didn't have the same quality and taste to it. the paneer was hard, the daal was soggy and they took their time coming around with the naans. my bf had the meat dishes and said that the butter chicken didn't satisfy his cravings like it has in the past.  oh and for some reason, the food was overly spicy on the day we went. they didn't have many mild options."}
{"text":"Been here half a dozen times so I have a fairly okay impression of it. Not great, but decent enough for me to come try again. The price was the main attractive point until recently, but overall it is still an okay deal compare to its competitors.   There are lots of dishes for the buffet option, and honestly you might as well go with the buffet option (compare to a la carte) because your food will mostly come from there anyway."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I go very often especially on the weekends where they serve halwa puri. They make it on the spot.  I love the fresh puris come out to order so they don't feel greasy or heavy.    I have also gone for the buffet however I find it expensive.  They have good variety but not enough for the price.  The halwa puri price is perfect.  Service is ok.  They are alway in a rush.  Overall clean and delicious food"}
{"text":"ayce / buffet prices are 15$ lunch and 17$ dinner. they also have takeout desserts. They have a decent variety of meat  dishes as well as vegetarian options. My favorite were the goat curry, paneer korma and the eggplant stew. There were also fruits, Indian desserts and appetizers, such as pakoras and samosas.   service was very fast, they were constantly refilling our glasses and bringing fresh naan (included in the buffet price). you can see the kitchen through a little window and it looks clean."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Dollar value Indian food buffet around.  Man i love this place ... the Tandoori Chicken is to die for as well as the Butter chicken and battered Tandoori Fish.  So much selection in meats and veg and the Naan bread is excellent.  The value and food is so good that it's packed for early lunch and dinner.  You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Naan! Naan! Unlimited freshly made naan made me a fan of this place! I went to India's Taste on a Saturday night with my family for the first time, and left with a full belly and satisfied palette. It was a busy day for them, however the staff were still friendly and helpful (and also kept the naan coming~). They have a good range of choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians. I have little knowledge about Indian food, but I did enjoy everything I had, especially for the goat/lamb dishes. I will most likely return when I have a big craving for Indian food and naan."}
{"text":"This buffet is delish! I love Indian food and buffets like India's Taste are an excellent way to try out things that you normally would be skeptical to buy as an entire entree in an a la carte restaurant.  The price is very very good (as others have said) and I especially love that fresh naan comes to your table quick and plentiful.  Drinks are an extra charge but that's fine with me as long as they keep the buffet prices low.  I would come here all the time except it is a bit far for me... may be a good thing for my waist line!"}
{"text":"This Indian buffet is just average. It has no appealing features other than offering an all-you-can-eat meal for a very good price. It's a cheap place to eat at, and you get some of the typical Indian cuisines you would find at other Indian restaurants (chicken tikka, Chana masala, etc). It does, however, lack a lot of choices. They could do better by improving the menu. Perhaps by having less Western food (like macaroni pastas, salads) and adding more Indian delicacies (like dhal or chicken pakoras). I do like that the naan bread is constantly refilled by the servers though, that's a plus, as I don't have to keep getting up to get some bread."}
{"text":"I went one time , butter chicken it's just curry with no chicken , for the price I pay I was expecting good food , they are ripping on the butter chicken curry . Also service was not great"}
{"text":"The first time I went here was on Valentine's Day. It was PACKED and even though I had to wait for about 30 minutes to sit down, I believe it was well worth the wait. It is a 'hidden gem' as some would call it.  The buffet great and the food was fresh and warm. The only problem was some of the buffet items were not labeled so I had no idea what I was eating half of the time. The naan was fresh and delicious and brought to our table quite often. Because they were selling sweets at the front, the desserts at the actual buffet section were limited. There was also a variety of tasty meat and vegetarian options. Nothing was too spicy, but some curries had a pleasant kick to them. I would definitely dine there again!"}
{"text":"Went for weekend lunch. Pretty impressed with the variety of the Indian buffet for a cheap price. The restaurant was packed and there was a line waiting at around 1:30 PM. There were different curries like chicken, goat, and a vegetarian curry. I especially enjoyed the chicken curry. The fried fish and tandoori chicken are also very delicious and tender.  There is a bar for meats, one for vegetarian foods, a salad bar with fruits like watermelon and pineapple. There is also a cake/pudding bar. I noticed a lot of desserts that you can buy for take out near the cashier.   The highlight of the buffet was the unlimited freshly made naans that are delivered to your table. They taste much better than the ones bought in store as they are freshly made and have a sweeter taste to it.   The servers are very quick at collecting your finished plates and refilling your lemon water. Be prepared to be super full, so come with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"India's taste? More like India's disgrace to be honest lol. There are SO many great Indian options in Brampton and Mississauga - do yourself a favor and skip out on this place. The food is strange tasting, curries are watery and not very authentic, and they can't even get a simple dal makhani right. You know a place is not Indian when they can't make dal makhani, the simplest trick in the book!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few Indian buffets around Markham and others like tandoori flame. This buffet is the best yet.  It's good for vegetarian, non vegetarian. With appetizers, mains, desserts and you order the naan to your table.  Some menu items: samosas, chaat papri, pani puri, tandoori/tikka meats, variety of chicken curries, vegetarian  (paneer, chickpea etc) with Indian desserts and ice cream.   Though this doesn't have as wide a selection as tandoori flame-- it tastes way better. If you want quality food, don't go to a buffet- rule 101 of food.   The customers here are very diverse- from all parts of Asia usually which is great.  You pay at the counter - which is fine I've done it at many Indian restaurants before."}
{"text":"We go here just for take out... especially the Fish Pakora's. it is just perfect every time we have picked it along with the green chutney and the raddish on the side. We have heard the buffet is good too as per the review and will surely make if one day."}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian and they serve some bomb ask veggie food here! Their naan bread is so damn good! They serve it to your table fresh in a bread basket.  The food is so fresh and tasty. The food isn't that spicy, which is not a bad thing because you can eat more that way.   This is defs the best buffet is brampton, I've gone to Tandori Flame before but this is definitely better!"}
{"text":"The food has always been good but they jacked up the prices ridiculously high for buffet being at 17 dollars per person. Used to be 12. Also they have cheated on the bill by jacking up prices and machine not giving the accurate total on the items due. We discovered it later. They charged us for 4 people when we were 3 and then said we didn't communicate properly to them. Is that our job to verify how many people ate?"}
{"text":"Not the type to write reviews, let alone negative ones, but I was dissapointed by this place. I've decided to give this place two stars because of the price (about 12$ dollars for lunch buffet) and another star for the variety of dishes. The food was fine, I'm not an expert at Indian food but from what I tried so far this was just normal food, nothing to special. Tandoori chicken was boring, but everything else was ok. But that is about all the positive moments about this place. I was coming in with really good expectations after reading the reviews, but was left dissapointed. First of all, the interior was really depressing, and yeah you could say that for a 12$ buffet you can't expect a red carpet and a diamond chandelier but nevertheless, this wasn't the first Indian buffet I've been to and everywhere else they at least tried to make the interior cozy. Maybe a good interior is not the most important thing to look for in a buffet, but service - that is another question alltogether. The waitress was nice, and we were seated pretty fast(well he place was almost empty). But we only got a glass of water for each and got a refill when we were about to leave. Next 10 minutes after we were seated the waitress brought us naan. I was really looking forward to eating fresh garlic naan and was expecting it but apparently it was at an additional price of 2.50$. Since I was craving it so bad I ordered it. But it only came when we were finished eating which was about 40 minutes after ordering it. At that point we were getting up to pay the bill, so we decided to just take the naan with us since we did pay extra for it. At the register we asked for a bag for the untouched naan and the man there said \"You can't take food out of here but fine here you go\". I was shocked by the rudeness.  Maybe if I hadn't come in with good expectations I wouldn't be writing this review, but I feel like I needed to write an honest review for those who are deciding whether to go depending on these reviews."}
{"text":"Its a great place to go get indian food in buffet style. Its great to go with as a group, you can reserve a table in advance. Waiters are very nice and food is great for the price. I actually find the food pretty tasteful and their is so many options even for vegetarians or meat lovers. The desserts are great and waiter always keeps refilling the naan fresh."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends for their all-day buffet. This place's buffet actually has a lot of choices. They had a fair amount of meat options, along with many veggie ones. They also had a number of options for dessert, such as kulfi (in a number of flavours), ras malai, carrot halwa and gulab jamun. The only downfall was that most of the food was mediocre. In fact all the curry sauces were too thin, and nothing including the naan was that great. However, for the price, the food was acceptable.  Also, they had some flat screen televisions on the walls that were playing music videos from popular new Bollywood movies, which was quite neat.  The staff seemed a little overworked, so the service suffered throughout the meal. However, with the exception of some of the forks, the place was very clean.  A big bonus for me was the fact that this place has a bakery inside of it, which is full of Indian sweets for sale. Furthermore, all the sweets for sale in their bakery are quite delicious.   Overall, this place is okay."}
{"text":"Wide range of choices, very Indian taste. Service is fine. Good place for quick bite."}
{"text":"I'm a picky Indian food eater, possibly because it's my background and I'm always comparing to mom. But, I gotta say, for an AYCE place, I love the food here. I enjoyed the Daal and the Lamb/Goat dishes in particular. Price for weekend dinner is definitely reasonable as well. But, my only negative was when I asked for a Fanta in the glass bottle and they brought it to me in a glass. I wanted to drink from the bottle, otherwise why not just give me a can? Again, nitpicking, but it would have been nice."}
{"text":"FOOD: Their buffet doesn't offer a large selection of Indian food but the quality is decent. You really get what you paid for. It used to be $13.99 for lunch buffet which was a really good deal. And their naan is superb and freshly served to you at your table! I come here occasionally for lunch during the weekdays and is usually packed.  ENVIRONMENT: Don't be fool by the exterior of the restaurant. It doesn't have the most glamourous and attracting exterior but the interior is clean and big enough to accommodate larger groups.  SERVICE: Attentive staffs. They do regular water refills and naan refills. It could be slow at times during peak hours but overall pretty good service."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place for ayce Indian food. I would highly recommend visiting on a weekday for lunch (cheapest time) with an empty stomach cause it is WORTH IT.  Get the butter chicken with some of their freshly in-house made naan. It's like lying on a cloud in heaven, it so good. Their tandoori chicken is delicious as well- not too dry and it'll just fall off the bone.  Don't forget to also try their Indian sweets. Rasmalali, my favourite, is creamy with a hint of a pistachio flavour. They have some other delicacies behind the counter for purchase of well."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious, lots of non vegetarian and vegetarian options, unlimited naan, and most of it was spicy - which I love.   I really enjoyed all their chicken dishes. The goat was decent, a little fatty but it's to expected. The samosas were delicious too and not too greasy.   I enjoyed that everything had some heat to it and it wasn't all mild like I was expecting. Keep that in mind if you don't like spicy food though.   Service wasn't great. I have to say...  We got seated right away but had to wait awhile for water and cutlery. He never did ask us if we wanted anything to drink other than water which one of us in our group did... We waited to see if he would come back around to ask how things were but he disappeared. Dirty dishes weren't taken off our table until we were eating dessert which was odd too... Usually buffets take them away as soon as they see them.   Dessert was okay. Not too many choices especially when you see all their special desserts for sale individually but I do have to say for some reason the ice cream was amazing. They didn't buy the cheap stuff most buffets buy.   Decor inside was nice and there was plenty of seating. They seem to have a private seating area as well if you made reservations for a big group."}
{"text":"I love that this place has buffet all the time, why need to change to a la carte at night time? Who doesn't love Indian buffet. This place is clean, really clean, there's ample parking, great service!   The quality of the food is a bit inconsistent, I must admit. I've been here a few times. But overall there's a good variety of food here. I like that they have Caesar salad here for those of us who don't like the other types of cold vegetables. The veggies and fruits are pretty fresh. I like the butter chicken and goat curry. They had this potato with spinach dish that was pretty good. Sometimes the rice gets dried up but if you go during the rush it's usually okay. They have different dishes everytime I come. This time they had French fries. Although the French fries got cold I attempted to concoct my own butter chicken fries and it was not too bad, I thought. They also have samosas here but I find it too doughy and never fresh. However, someone does come around to bring you fresh naan, although I found the naan a bit too oily.  Things were not clearly labelled so I didn't know what some of the things were so I tried some of everything. That's the beauty of buffets right? I had a meat sauce looking curry with peas, it was not bad. Some yellow curry with fried fish fillet. It was really lemony and sour, not to my liking. I also tried various vegetarian dishes with cauliflower and broccoli. They all taste similar to me. I'm not a fan of the curry chicken so much, I guess just cause it's not as smooth and creamy as the butter chicken. It doesn't sit as well in my stomach.   They have a good variety of fruits, watermelon, cantaloupe, pineapples, and red grapes. For dessert I always have the orange paste with the Indian honey timbit. Today they also served a neon orange pretzel! (Sorry, I don't know what anything is called but if you were there you'll know what I'm talking about!) The Orange paste is simply divine, I really like it. It's really sweet in a not so sweet way. The texture is great and mixed with some almond slivers and raisins is the perfect combination. This is a great place and in my standards super clean! There's great service and you can sit comfortably. The consistency of the food can improve a bit. There's also a myriad of sweets in the front display counter that I'm dying to try!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for different occasions. Their selection is okay. I go there for the naan and butter chicken (lol), but the naan is served by the waiter. I was there last week and I waited 25 minutes (I counted) before I got fed up. My waiter spent the entire 25 minutes at the front desk talking with the \"greeter/manager/guy at the front\". I settled my bill and left halfway through my meal. I usually excuse bad service for good food but this was horrible service with ok food. Will not come back."}
{"text":"1.  For ten people only eight placements were provided.  2.  Food is far from real taste of India. It really sucked and was sweet.  3.   It was a buffet and waiters won't remove the used plates even after requesting five times  First time seeing such rock bottom service in Canada.  Save your $$$ as there are many better places to eat much better food."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian buffets I have had. Incredible variety and selection, including appetizer items and desserts. A bit pricey, but worth it. Service is also excellent. They had everything you would want and expect in an Indian buffet, desserts included carrot pudding which was the best I've had at any Indian restaurant, Jalebi, Gulab Jamun and much more. I'd go back there again."}
{"text":"The food was alright, price was great though. 11.95 for lunch buffet. Don't expect delicious food, it's a buffet and the food tastes that way."}
{"text":"A hidden little buffet (who drives around Denison and Esna Park outside of work hours?) that has an all-day buffet for a great price.  Dinner here is only $12, and you get a variety of Indian dishes which are all fairly good.  This clean buffet (they must have a good ventilation system, because when you walk in you aren't hit with a waft of curry scent which is oft to common for Indian buffet restaurants) is tucked in on the NW corner of Denison and Esna Park, on the very end of an commerial building in an industrial area.  How people end up finding this place, I have no idea.  If you do stumble upon it though, you get great value for your money. The dinner buffet (same menu as the lunch) is only $12, which is a bargain for buffet go-ers.   The curry is good, but not great, a little thin for my liking but it's tastes good and the meat is tender.  They have about 8-10 meat dishes, a variety of masala, curries, tandoori and others, and about 8 vegetarian dishes as well. They also have a table with some salad, fruits, and appetizers.  Dessert is a bit lacking, with only ice cream and two or three Indian desserts (I'm not a fan of Indian desserts anyway, so meh).   The naan is fresh (you can see it comes straight from the oven in the bag, as they have a small open kitchen where some of the food is prepared) and they refill your basket regularly.  I LOVE naan, so I always carb up here :)  It's been getting busier and busier the last few times I've went, so the popularity of the place is increasing, even though they have a fairly bad location.   All-in-all, a good choice if you're hungry for a buffet, in the mood for Indian food, and on a budget."}
{"text":"Thank you guys for having such a big selection....i never get sick of all the assortment...India's taste means you get food from all over the country....north to south...all area's covered....Cant wait till you add haleem to your menu. Great Stuff!!! keep it up! I usually order of the menu and bring it to work. They deliver every time!!!!"}
{"text":"I have the worst experience i ever had. we went to the restaurant at 9:20pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm. So 40mins earlier but the front desk person wouldnt allow us to eat inside. He said buffet closes in 10mins and then we mentioned we would just go for 1 round and put the food we need once but he says no we couldnt do that,we then later said we would order the food(Al carte) and he says no....this was so rude... 40mins earlier and we wont let us eat anything...i feel humiliated"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian dish ... The tandoori chicken was a bit dry other then that it great , good and friendly wait staffs . This a repeater ."}
{"text":"Very very tasty!  Loved this place and the service was awesome. I forgot to post a review until now and I have no idea why."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch with the buffet. $12.99 on Friday - Sunday lunch. Good selection of curries and they bring you fresh naan to your table. Also had the mango lassi which was tasty. Desert selection was decent, assuming you left some room. Overall, would likely go back, probably for the cheaper lunch buffet during the week :)"}
{"text":"India's Taste is an all day buffet serving vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, pastries, and sweets.  They're open seven days a week. They also service a la carte items too.  They bring you fresh naan bread to your table but sometimes you have to wave the server down for some extra naan or water at your table. It's a very casual restaurant and fit for families and gatherings."}
{"text":"The food is good and affordable but the staff gets annoyed a little if there are too many people"}
{"text":"Pretty solid buffet at this place with lots of dishes (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian) to choose from.  Went there for the first time tonight and tried about a half-dozen different dishes. The Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Aloo Goobi, and Vegetable Pakora were all particularly good, but I was rather disappointed in the Curry Chicken and Curry Goat. To be honest, both of those dishes actually smelled and tasted off - maybe the meat used was not as fresh as the other dishes?"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I ordered 45 samosas and they said \"10 minutes\". 30 minutes later still waiting. All things considering I understand 45 samosas may take time to make, however I saw a batch come out which was easily AT LEAST 50 samosas. what they did was serve people who came AFTER me with small orders. I asked how much longer, the lady at the front said \"yes it's coming\". After the 40 minute mark I asked what's taking so long and she said \"sorry how many did you order?\" This just ticked me off. I said 45 and bit my tongue since I didn't want to cause a scene. OVERALL very horrible customer experience. They don't know how to manage their intake of orders.   1 Hour later I got my order.   Don't know how this place keeps its customers with such horrible customer service.   I would NOT recommend people to come here."}
{"text":"Limited selection of food, but very reasonable price.  Sometimes a wait during lunch hours. But not expensive."}
{"text":"They had a good variety! I'd come back again if I'm craving for Indian food. Good price for all you can eat lunch buffet on weekend! 16.99"}
{"text":"Good lunch buffet with an amazing fried Mushroom. The Restaurant is clean and better looking with the new tables.  Last week my friend and I thought of giving it another try as one of our previous visits was disappointing. This time we were pleasantly surprised. The buffet was always kept full and the variety was really good. I had seconds of the Fried Mushrooms; amazing! Their concept of bringing fresh naan always rather than serving it through the buffet is appreciated.  The restaurant looks really good with the new furniture. It is always kept clean too. Service is nothing to comment about with the servers only coming when needed. A little attention to the guests would up it a notch. However, there is nothing to complain about the service either.  A good choice for the lunch hour of a busy professional."}
{"text":"I love this place. Fresh food is always coming out of the kitchen. The chefs and the employees are all super friendly. And most important of all, the food is effing phenomenal. It's all you can eat too! So eat as far as your stomach can curry you.  They've got vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for everyone. Naturally, I'm a meat eater so here's what I usually get.  Butter chicken: It ranks up there with the kingpins out there. Creamy, complex, and mouthwateringly delicious. OMG just thinking about it makes me drool.  Tandoori chicken: Yo, this place makes the best tandoori chicken. Get the drumsticks and leave the thighs alone lol. The drumsticks will blow your mind. Bold, spicy kick and just the right amount of heat on these.  Chicken Korma: Had hints of coconut running through it. Sweet aftertaste so quite interesting. Was cooked with egg and peppers I believe. Really tasty.  The goat here is delicious as well but the quality of the meat can sometimes be inconsistent (sometimes super tender sometimes a lil tough with the bone in pieces).  Goat vindaloo: This item is a special I think (I believe they rotate it out for other dishes sometimes like fish). Nice and spicy sauce. Just the way I like it. Very similar flavor profile to malay red curry.   Goat curry: The curry is more of a brown sauce curry here. Very different from jamaican goat curry which is yellow sauce. Still really good.  Lamb tawa: Similar to the goat, some batches would be super moist, tender and scrumptious. Other rounds, it would be slightly chewy but still flavorful.  Chicken Biryani: The biryani is definitely above average. I wouldn't say it's some of the best I've had though. Have definitely had better elsewhere.  Naan: You can come here and make a meal out of the naan alone. Not even kidding. It is second to naan. I've got a million other naan puns but I'll refrain. It's always served fresh here. You can taste the butter in the dough. The servers come around frequently and refill your naan basket if they see that your table is out.  Gulaab jamun: These deep fried milk pastries soaked in syrup are pretty tasty and a great dessert (don't eat too many though or the sweetness can build up!)  Mango lassi: Best mango lassi I've had so far. It's like $5 so definitely not cheap but it's soooo good. Test of a good lassi: eat something really spicy, take a tiny sip. If it quenches your thirst, then you good. This lassi was so satisfying. Could really taste the yogurt.  Every time I come my friends and I go into a food korma (ok, I'll stop with the puns hehe). Guys, Guys. I didn't even mention the best part yet. THE PRICE! It's $23 now for dinner on weekends.   Note*: It used to be $13 for dinner buffet on weekends then $16. Yes, you read that right. The price raise was inevitable though (what with the ridiculous min wage hike). Tbh, $23 is still amazing for quality ayce in markham or richmond hill albeit the decreased value.  Great food, friendly service and very fairly priced. So what are you waiting for? Cumin side and make yourself at home!"}
{"text":"We walked in late on a Saturday night, when the place was so busy. The manager was very courteous.  He promised to get a table with in 20 minutes and had the whole 15+ party seated with 17 minutes. The servers consistently checked on our guest to make sure we were taken care of. Very professional service."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a week night. $14 I think it was.  Pretty big selection of food and was full before I could try everything. The fish pakora, goat curries, butter chicken and Naan were standouts.   The dessert not the best.. I'm not a huge Indian dessert fan and the cakes and ice cream were all pretty lackluster. The service was also below average. They forgot our drink order and had to ask for the Naan bread. Just bring that over when I sit at the table!  More of a 3.5 rating than a 4 star. The quality of food leaned me the other way."}
{"text":"I've been to many AYCE indian buffets including Kama, Dhaba, The Indian Cuisine, etc. but this is my favorite. They have many different meat curries, butter chicken, and non stop freshly made pipping hot naans that come out as soon as you are done what is on your table.  Only bad point is the ice cream was frost bitten, but dont think any one comes here for that when there is the godly gulab jamun."}
{"text":"I love to go to Indian Buffets because you get to try all the goodies without having to commit to one thing.  So I have been to my fair share...  This is the best Indian Buffet I have been to!  They have such a huge selection of foods, vegetarian and meat both.  They even have goat, which I haven't really seen at too many places.  One of my favorites is the Butter Chicken.  They also had a stewed eggplant dish last time I went that I really loved.  Naan is a must!  They are constantly bringing out fresh, hot naan.  You can even see the guy in the back cranking them out all the time.  They are always busy and have a buffet for lunch and dinner.  Bring your appetites!"}
{"text":"Great for buffet! The samosas are crazy expensive. I'd rather make the extra trip to Samosa King (Embassy Restaurant) for the samosas.   India's Taste Price: 2 for $1  Embassy Restaurant: 5 for $1.   Same size and better taste"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Indian buffet restaurants in Peel. There is a lot of variety in every section (appetizers, curries, desserts). The dosa and sambar, kabobs, chicken curries, dal makhani and chili chicken are all excellent. Some other dishes should really be better: roghan josh, amritsari fish, some of the paneer dishes. But the overall taste and spice of the dishes is very good.  Also, pleasantly surprised by the restaurant's ambie.nce and look. inside décor is very good. Photo gallery does not do justice"}
{"text":"Had another visit yesterday. Was I satisfied?  I have a very sensitive stomach and don't do very good with onions( I wish I can kill all the onions in the world) Sure, my stomach was a little upset yesterday but that doesn't stop me from coming here because  Great service Cost - $3x for 2 people dinner buffet Taste - it's a taste of India all right Vegetarian option  Hopefully I can train my stomach to eat like Yelp Elite Alice W. xox"}
{"text":"Buffet selection was impressive, and delicious. The \"tandoori snacks\" we're superb, but so was most everything else."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great place for Indian food if you're craving for it. There were a lot of Indian patrons which for me is a good sign that this is a good place to eat. The naan was very fresh when it came to the table, and I love how there is a vegetarian counter. Although I eat meat myself, I have many friends who are vegetarian which makes it on my go-to-list for vegetarian restaurants. The place is clean and bright, will definitely be coming back for more in the future."}
{"text":"Great buffet and lots of options other than your typical Indian buffet. Gets busy after 8:30 or so."}
{"text":"Similar to what other people have said in their reviews, this is a hidden gem in a very industrial area of Markham. First off, the price for lunch or dinner buffet is under $15 - it doesn't get better than that! And aside from the low price, the food is actually delicious! Any time my family feels like ordering some Indian food, we always order from here - whether it's for catering or just to pick up desserts.  It might be kind of a maze to find this place, but there is lots of free parking right in front. There's a nice selection of food ranging from salad to goat curry to delicious butter chicken. Lot's of options for vegetarians and meat lovers alike! Personally, dessert is my favourite part of any buffet and I was surprised that there's a decent selection of ice cream flavours and fruit for such a low-cost buffet!  Service is excellent - they're always bringing fresh naan to our table and refilling water. Sometimes there would be a little build up of old plates but that's not a big issue at all! Overall, one of the top Indian buffets in the GTA and I see myself coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Summary: this buffet-style restaurant has one of the best naan bread I've had in the area, which balances out the mediocre service and rather lackluster noodles  Top Must-Get: naan bread Top Regret: noodles  I've come to this place on and off over the past few years - whenever I get a naan craving, here I am. My last visit here was over the winter holidays, and the first thing I noticed was that they hiked the prices up, AND did an EXTRA hike for the holidays itself. Not cool.  However, you do get your money's worth if you eat a lot... and I do, so here we are.  It is bigger, offers more variety and is generally more organized than the other Indian buffet I frequent (Bombay Grill on Hwy 7), but that's not saying a lot. However, variety is important: this place has at least six meat dishes poppin', including lamb curry, beef vindaloo and of course butter chicken. They also have tandoori chicken, which was alright - but I'd probably lean to the curry dishes a bit more, since it wasn't the best tandoori I've had.  The veggie options are solid too - I am a particularly big fan of their aloo gohbi (potatoes and cauliflower) although they don't always have it out.   Be wary of the noodles: they LOOK good but the flavour is disappointingly absent, even though it looks a bit oily (that's supposed to be the trade-off, right? Oily/unhealthy for better flavour? But no.)  For your carbs needs, wait instead for the FRESHLY BAKED NAAN. Does it go well with the Butter Chicken? My dear sir/madam, it goes AMAZINGLY well with the butter chicken. Do note that they will come offer each table a small basket of naan whenever it is freshly out of the oven, but I have found that prompting them gets them to check in on it a bit more frequently. I could honestly probably just come here for the naan and butter chicken all lunch (but then, why deprive yourself of all the variety?)  Worthwhile if you're craving Indian and in the area. In terms of variety, this is better than Bombay Grill, but the latter is cheaper (and for me, closer to work)."}
{"text":"I love this little gem of a restaurant! Great prices, food is pretty consistent and tasty. I've only been disappointed during non busy hours when I got take out and found our butter chicken really watery and plain. But MOST times especially on lunch - it's delicious! ! Great buffet.  Myself and my co workers frequent here regular!"}
{"text":"Went in for the lunch buffet and went out wishing I hadn't. At first I was pleased to see a wide array of vegetarian friendly dishes, but upon trying them found only one, the channa masala, to be worth eating. Water and naan were rarely refreshed and stay away from the dal! The only thing remotely deserving of a star is the mango beer, which I desperately needed to wash away the taste of the dal..."}
{"text":"The food is typical Punjabi fare. Delicious & appropriately spiced. The desserts are superb & fresh. Fairly crowded place with a good buffet.  The wait staff is nice but completely clueless about how to wait on tables. Often times you have to wait in the front to be seated & with the chaos & confusion of crowds it is hard to catch their eye. They also bring menus only for the adults! The wines taste awful. I had to send back the wine the one tine I ordered it & the waiter was affronted by this. I told him that I should be affronted that such wine was served! He was not too happy to replace it with a freshly opened bottle. The wait staff is also not knowledgeable about what A la Carte menu item is available. The management of this restaurant needs to take interest & train the staff properly."}
{"text":"What??? No current yelp review on this place yet?!?!   Came here back in May 2011 and I have to say.. this is probably one of the best Indian buffets I have ever ever had.    Buffet encompassed a LARGE selection of choices with a vegeterian section, various chicken curries, and fresh fruits. They also had a huuge selection of various indian treats.    It was so good I literally sat there for 2 hours eating with the cousins. This lunch was then proceeded with a long afternoon nap. =P"}
{"text":"I came here because of the many positive reviews on Yelp!  The restaurant is tucked away in an industrial area, and doesn't look like much from outside, but the inside is actually quite modern and comfortable.  I went for the lunch buffet, and was quite impressed with the food! There was a good variety of chicken, lamb, and veggie curries. Most of the meat was tender, although some of the lamb could have been more tender. The curries were slightly spicy, and had a good mix of spices (but taste could have been stronger).  For dessert, they actually have ras malai! I also discovered galja halwa (with the warm food section), which is now one of my favourite indian desserts! There's also lots of fruit for dessert, and salad as well. There were no soups, so maybe they could add some to the selection.   Service was really attentive; they bring you pieces of fresh naan when they see you are running low! They also top up water quite quickly.  For about $15 for lunch, the variety and quality is great for what you get!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of curries, limited salads.  Good service, very clean establishment. Overall a reasonably priced buffet.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"They have corrected the service problems and I have been there several times. They now also feature for take out a wide array of Indian baked goods.   The food is tasty and the service excellent now...Bravo!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place if I ever want an Indian buffet. There so many options, both veg and non veg. The flavours of the butter chicken and goat curry were on point and I couldn't get enough of their pakora. The naan is made to order, it does take a while for it to come and you would always have to flag down someone if you wanted more but it always came hot and fresh. They also have an assortment of chutney and dessert. Wasn't a big fan of the tandoori chicken as it was dry and hard. Something I would suggest to the owners is to give the bill at the table as you would have to go up to the front to pay and on busy days I've seen people lie about how many people were at the table or what drinks they had. I would definitely be coming back to satisfy my next Indian food craving."}
{"text":"I love this place for the variety and like others have said, clean, very well ventilated. I always come back for the goat curries, bread is made and served fresh to you, as well as an appetizer dish you can order."}
{"text":"Went on the Victoria Day holiday which is what made the price end up at about $25 per person.   Quality of food was really good. For a buffet, there was a good variety for both vegetarians and non-veg people. A key factor is they bring fresh naan to your table! And when you finish it all, they'll just keep bringing more! Be sure to try the butter chicken, paneer, and the veggie pakora! Definitely my faves!  Have been here many times and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food quality : average. Poor service If you want to eat good Indian food, this is not a right place."}
{"text":"always hot fresh and tasty, great variety, good service, always leave full. It's clean and an unsuspecting location for such a gem.  Incredible food"}
{"text":"Great Indian food slow service.  I had the buffet and the food was very hot temperature wise. The spices were rich and flavorful.   The naan is served fresh my favorite part of the meal. My least favorite part is the cost curry it was way too chewy"}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 4 and 5 star rating but going to go with 4 because I've only been once. If the next time I'm at least as impressed as the first I will up the star count.  I came across this place one day when I was in training nearby and had about an-hour-and-a-half to kill for lunch. I checked my handy-dandy Yelp ap to satisfy my Indian craving and was drawn here by the great reviews.  As far as my lunch buffet experience here goes... wow. Just, wow. The place was bright, clean and well laid out. There were more options than I'd ever seen at an Indian buffet including a breads area, a salad bar, a hot meat entree table and a hot vegetarian entree table. All of the items that I tried (no meat) were decent to great, with the exception of the saag which tasted like it came out of a can. I appreciated that they brought a pitcher of water to the table to pour at my leisure. The staff that I encountered were all polite and efficient.  I can't wait to go back. Nom, nom, nom!"}
{"text":"one of the best indian Buffet places in gta. Price is reasonable and sevice is good too. They have a great variety of dishes which really shows that they care for quality of food considering its a buffet place."}
{"text":"clean, local, fresh food....just be sure to make a reservation peak times during the weekend as you can be waiting for a while.... but the wait is worth it!! butter chicken, naan, veggie and meat tawa...is good....even the Cheetah beer is quite quenching....always a pleasure to go back.."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. Lots of choices with meat and vegetarian meals.  The naan was extremely tasty.  The desserts didn't have too many options however, they were very delicious and it was enough for us.  Lots of tables available.   The price is very cheap however, kids pay the same buffet price as adults.    The service was not good at all.  Noone greed us upon walk in. We were not sure if we should just sit down.  Nobody explained anything i.e. That you need to order naan separately.  It was hard to get the waitress attention. At one point the waitress lifted her finger up to tell us to wait.  Lol"}
{"text":"We've tried a lot of Indian places, and given that Brampton arguably has the largest population of Indians outside of India it's no surprise that India's Taste is as good as it is.  The buffet opens early, closes fairly late, and remains open all day throughout (even what would be regarded at between lunch and dinner at other buffet places). The food remains fresh and hot even in this mid-meal period.  Service is good but more reactive than pro-active - and the reason for the loss of 1/2 a point (where applicable). The price is also quite reasonable. Paying at the counter after the meal, you're in line with people ordering counter items which can result in frequent congestion. This goes to the service improvements that might be considered.   Top notch Indian food though."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this restaurant. I've been here more than a few times for lunch and dinner and I have never been wowed. I'm always surprised when friends rave and insist on coming here.  True, they have a wide variety of options but quality always suffers. The chicken always looks like it's been sitting out forever and their chutneys are nothing but food coloring and a few mystery spices. Many of their curried dishes seem to be made with a shared base and doused with sugar.  If I were to return, i'd stick with the offerings in the tandoori pan by the chef enclave and call it a day. It's the redeeming dish.   The service is generally prompt and efficient. The location is also great. Too bad."}
{"text":"One of the best places for Indian snacks like samosa and sweets."}
{"text":"Drove by this place many times but first time trying it out. Food here is pretty good. A good variance of goat/lamb dishes.  Naan and the curries or butter chicken sauce is amazing. Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. We bought whole bunch of sweets out of all of those things that were good were jalebi and amertis everything else was marginal.  we will go there again only for Jalebis or Amertis nothing else."}
{"text":"I had take out from here and it was blah. I ordered Malai Kofta and Shahi paneer. Shahi paneer smelled liked old tomato pasta sauce. Malai Kofta tasted watered down. I hate getting a craving for Indian food and being so disappointed. This place is crossed off. no more."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Place is usually busy. The have a good variety of food for the buffet and quality is decent. I like the Kabob and Tandoori. Service is kinda lacking thought."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as always and very friendly service . The time was finishing for buffet but they accommodated us. Amazing . Must to go for anyone who likes desi food..."}
{"text":"FOOD: Food here is amazing. The spring rolls and other appetizers are so good here. This is a buffet style restaurant and has both non veg and vegetarian options. So many curry options for both and employees always being fresh naan. They have different food stations such as: salad bar, veg bar, non veg bar, dessert bar, naan and others. Food is hot and fresh.   PLACE: Looks small from the outside but quite spacious inside! Don't judge the place by how it looks on the outside.   STAFF: Friendly, helpful and nice.   PRICE: $$"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 out of 5, rounding it up to 4.0 for sure.   Certainly the best Indian lunch buffet in the area and it's hidden down Denison where it looks very industrial. I can't believe i haven't left a review of this place yet. It's a great place and I love coming here. It's certainly the best value for money if you're looking for the ol Indian lunch buffet. They also have a sweet section to buy sweets if you're looking for that.  Atmosphere:  You'll find a ton of free parking around on the side and behind the building. The inside isn't anything special but you'll find the typical bollywood youtube channels up and going, and some punjabi music playing to while you eat. Enough tables and booths for everyone and they have a child seat to accommodate the children if you want. Usually a good atmosphere with lots of people from everywhere with line ups. Good indication they're doing something right here.   Food:  You have a lot of items. An appeatizer buffet section and one veg and one meat section. Tandoori chicken, kebabs, chicken tikka, shai paneer, palak paneer, butter chicken, goat curry, rice, naan (lots of hot and fresh naan), grilled paneer. Vegetable thali and lots of various lentil and potato carb dishes you'd find in an Indian buffet.   Their buffet has all of the favourites though expect the Butter chicken to be swarmed and prompty refilled all of the time. Not too spicy, not too mild and full flavoured. The way it should be. The chicken could be a little juicier but not bad. All of the other apps, salads, meat and veg dishes are good. About as good as you'll get at say an Indian wedding buffet. Not bad at all.  It's not fine dining when you go buffet, but it is hot and there is plenty of selection. There is also ice cream, gulab jamun,   Value:  For $12.99 at lunch it's tremenedous value. Lots of value. Even dinner isn't that bad, at $6 more but it's essentially the same items so if you can get them at lunch that's your best bang for your buck.  Solid 3.5 out of 5 rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"I read the Yelp reviews and thought my family might enjoy it, since we loved the buffet at the Tandoori Flame. We didn't get there until 9:00pm and in case you decide to check it out, you should know the buffet shuts down at 9:30pm.   The buffet has around 30 items, about 1/2 are vegetarian, the rest are meat, rice, noodles, and a few dessert dishes.  The curry goat was very authentic, along with the butter chicken, chicken Korma, and tandoori chicken. I also all loved vegetable dishes, they were very tasty. Both my cousin and I tried the spicy chili chicken, it was the hottest dish there, still kicked the next day lol.  All in all, you can't beat the price for food quality. If you want authentic tasty food that is sure to satisfy vegans and meat lovers than I recommend you give it a try. The naan bread rocks!  Service for drinks is a little slow, best to forgo the Mango Lassi and hit the pop fridge."}
{"text":"This place is my go to Indian joint. It's all you can eat as well which makes it really attractive. And at $14 you can't lose.   There is a wide variety of dishes from goat to chicken to veggie.   All of their dishes are fresh and exciting.   The butter chicken is really delicious and they are very generous with their meat.   The best part is that you don't leave the restaurant feeling dehydrated and pasty.   The food is clean and fresh.   Great place!"}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza on Denison and Esan park you will find this gem. It can be hard to spot the restaurant because the exterior look exactly the same as the other commercial buildings beside it.   This is one of my favourite India buffet spots. I came back to this buffet many times and each time it has been an amazing experience. I like that there is a large selection of apps, curries and bbq to choose from. On my last visit I noticed they added more desserts to an already decent size selection. The staff can be more tentative as during my last visit the waitress didn't bring us nan until we asked for it, but this is one off every other time they have. Overall, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"India's Taste is my favourite AYCE Indian buffet restaurant. The food is consistently good and the cost (13.99 for lunch) is very reasonable. The service is also very good, with servers constantly refilling water glasses and offering freshly made naan.  I still don't know the names of all the dishes, even though they are labeled but I know what I like when I see it. They offer a lot of vegetarian dishes, chicken, goat, salad, fruits, and ice cream. All good.  I particularly enjoy the chickpeas (chana masala?), paneer (cheese) tikka masala, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, goat curry, and the naan. Everything else is good too but I can only eat so much. I always leave feeling uncomfortably stuffed and very satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place has really improved over the years. I like the environment and buffet style. I've never had a problem with service. The naan is good. There is great variety for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. My go-to Indian buffet as it is conveniently located."}
{"text":"Standard Indian buffet and a good deal for the price. The lamb curry was very good and I liked the warm carrot pudding. Some of the chicken dishes were hit and miss though, and I did not like their fish option. They also give you naan at your table.  They definitely need to change the table cloths more often though. Almost every single table I saw had smears of food on them, which is not very inspiring."}
{"text":"We really very much enjoyed this Markham Indian restaurant. We went for lunch on a Saturday, and there was a great selection.  They had all the usual suspects.  Such as: - Butter Chicken ( boneless) - Tandoori chicken - Goat Curry - Daal - Aloo  Plus lots of different kinds of salads, rice, fish, lots of vegetarian choices, and they brought fresh man baked right on the tandoor. It was awesome. Loved the Naan bread. Service was nice and friendly and we ended up having Mango Lassi with it also   Dessert was fresh fruit, ice pudding, ice cream, carrot pudding. and the cake balls in cardamom syrup.   Food had a bit of bite to it but definitely suitable for western palates. It was pretty busy with families and couples alike."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for an Indian buffet, the only thing I don't like about it is that most of the food isn't warm. The naan that they bring to the table isn't hot/warm, nor are there food items that are sitting on warmers.  I was also turned off by their ice cream scoop sitting in stagnant dirty ice cream water.. They should really clean it regularly!  However, I still think the food is pretty decent and priced reasonably for a buffet on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Nice to find an Indian Buffet serving dinner not far from me.  For a great price, too, as others mentioned.  On top of everything, the food, while not extraordinary, is very good.  Lots of veggies offerings plus fish during our visit as well as various chicken and goat curries (no lamb).  They also had three desserts in addition to the ice cream.  Of these, the carrot halva was especially good and deserving of note.    Good selection of salad items (not all strictly Indian) too.  They also sell sweets and paan to go."}
{"text":"Every time I eat Indian food I ask myself why don't I eat this every day?  I love the flavour and it is so satisfying.  Then after I overeat it, I ask myself, how do people eat this everyday?  India's Taste really delivers if you are looking to scratch that spicy itch.  For a buffet, the food is fresh, the service is attentive , and the place is clean.  You will find a good variety of vegetarian and meat dishes plus there is a good salad section.  The naan is served fresh as you ask for it.    My only thing is the desserts.  They are soooo sweet.  I am not into sweets, and the dessert section here is crazy sweet.  But their carrot dessert is amazing if you can handle the sweet."}
{"text":"I have to say this was a pretty decent Indian food AYCE experience. Just for being an AYCE I wasn't expecting much in terms of quality but I was satisfied with all the variety and the freshness of the food. They also do a good job refilling the naan and they bring it out fresh when you ask for more. Even with all these positive comments I still must say that I would much rather have made to order and pay a bit more. But for the price you pay and the decent quality of food I have to give this place a quality 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Food was cold. The place was freezing. People were eating in their jackets. Save your money. Don't go."}
{"text":"One of the better Indian buffets I have been to for the price. UNLIMITED NAN :)"}
{"text":"Came here with friends and had a pretty good dining experience. It's not fancy, it's more homestyle Indian buffet but decent selection to choose from.   Lack of signage made it hard to tell what I was eating. Mostly I had to guess what they were. The butter chicken was pretty good and so was the tandoori chicken. I don't know what everything else is called. I also really liked the chick pea dish over rice. I could probably eat a whole plate of just that.   Had an ice cream section but looks pretty messy and unappealing :(  Fruits looked fresh and sliced into bite sized pieces ready to eat.   The best thing about this place is probably their hot naan bread that they bring to you. Love it! Soak up that sauce!   Price is pretty good for all you can eat, around $17 plus tax."}
{"text":"I'm surprised it took me so long to discover this gem!  If you're wanting some quick Indian food because you're craving it, this is the place to be.  I went here on a Saturday night and it was quite busy.  They automatically assumed that we were \"all you can eat\" so we totally just went for it!  There are a LOT of options and thus, you have to pace yourself.    Their butter chicken & tandoori chicken were really good!  The paneers were okay - still doesn't beat Spice 11 in Guelph.  They also had an array of samosas, pakoras, deep fried goodness.  They also had goat curry, lamb curry, etc.  The options were just...ENDLESS.  Perhaps my favourite was the butter & tandoori chicken.  There were also an array of choices for dessert - you had the less-traditional stuff like fruits and ice cream or you could venture into things like gulab jamun (which I LOVE).    They also have a sweets counter and I didn't know what half the stuff was but they all looked very pretty!  I did buy half a pound of jalebi.  Although there's nothing better than a fresh hot jalebi, they still tasted good a day later.    When you come here...come hungry.  Don't come looking for some fancy, white table, westernized, dim light place.  You're looking at a fast food style Indian restaurant so your mind has to have that set when you walk in :)."}
{"text":"Yummy Indian food!   Pani puri - so good! I could eat like 10 of these! Crispy hollow shells filled with potato mixture and some sour, sweet liquid... never had anything like this.   They also have a bunch of different pakoras. The fish wasn't the best so you can probably skip that. They also had these deep fried potato balls - they were really good! The sausages and meat patties were also delish. They also have some Western style appetizers - salads and pasta salads.  Paneer curry is really good here and so is the classic butter chicken!  For dessert, they have fruits and Indian desserts like gulab jamun. There is also an orange-coloured dessert... definitely get one of those, it's really good and almond-y.   Also the fresh naan here is the best! Be sure to ask for several rounds of these!  To drink they have lassi which is freshly made. The mango flavour is amazingggg!  Btw, you'll be surprised how quickly you get full even after just 2 plates of food."}
{"text":"In my quest for finding decent, fast, cheap, delicious all-you-can-cram (AYCC) Indian restaurants, this is absolutely a must eat.  I don't know how much it costs since a friend of mine bought me lunch, but I know how he rolls...  So it can't have been more than $14.  I had a thorough sampling of several types of meaty deliciousness and I was not disappointed.  The rice was ok, but the naan was spectacular.  You can even see the chap making them at a breakneck pace.  The veg items were all just as tasty and I even tried a fish dish that was excellent.  The menu changes constantly though depending on how much of what flora or fauna they can get at the best price per tonne.  I didn't try any of the desserts as I was all crammed up by the time I had finished sampling the meats, carbs and veg.  They did have a large display case of what looked like traditional Indian sweets, and various baked goods, but alas I was stuffed and was having difficulty maintaining the integrity of the waist button my pants as clearly my pants had shrunk during the meal.  As for ambiance, there are plenty of \"authentic\" looking customers.  Additionally, the teenagers in the parking lot sporting beat up tuner cars and lousy moustaches seals the deal.  (Their mom's clearly approve of them eating here for lunch... it must be good)  Great food in copious quantities at a price even a starving artist like myself can afford.  I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE Indian buffet restaurant for a fair price. The food is consistently good and the cost is very reasonable. The service is also very good, especially when it comes to bread items, they will bring fresh naan and/or roti straight to your  table."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for their buffet ($13.99). They have a decent selection of food with an especially large variety of goat dishes.  What I particularly love about this buffet compared to other places is that they have a waiter who brings fresh naan to your table.  Also, there's is constantly a waiter or a waitress passing by in case you need anything. The service here is a A+.  I highly recommend this restaurant and I'll be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"The food is no too good in dine in  Ordered butter chicken - Not good too sweet the  butter chicken was had the Naans with butter chicken were shockingly sad Their service was good and polite but the food could be better  Tried their snack counter samosas /fish pakoras/ Kachori and sweets All very good Not going to their dine in again India Sweet is good for desserts, sweets,samosas but not a la carte  I believe the buffet here is good So next time Ll try the buffet Must have their fish pakoras Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Really great option for lunch takeout. A fixed price box, choose items from the buffet. The server will even load the box for you and give you fresh Naan. Food quality is good, can get very busy during lunch hours."}
{"text":"This is our go to Indian buffet restaurant in the Markham area.  Located near the intersection of Woodbine and Denison, it's one of the few Indian buffets that's still around in the area and there's a reason why it has survived... Value.  Friday weekend night dinner prices are $16/person, kids about $9 for kids 6-9 and $6 for kids 2-5.  There's a variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for all types of tastes.  Because the place is usually packed food turnover is excellent and fresh.    Freshly made naan is served table side and goes well with all the delicious butter chicken, curry beef, paneer, goat curry, etc...  The fish pakoras are excellent along with the gajar halwa (carrot based desserts) but ultimately take your time and eat slowly or you'll regret it:)  Everytime we go, I have to loosen my belt holes a few notches afterwards, so be warned!  Service is courteous and you pay at the front when you are done.  They also have take out of Indian sweets that you can take home."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend to try out.  Happy with my experience.  Last time i tried Indian buffet was a long time ago, in Brampton which was over 8 years ago.  It was good in Brampton, and it was good here too!!.  This place is not extremely huge for seating, and they don't take reservations after 6pm on weekends. Staff is friendly and pretty quick. Food was tasty and good!!! I just tried a little of everything including goat curry,  On a saturday night, we got there at about 7:30pm and waited for a table until past 8pm. Paying the bill at 10pm there were still people waiting to be seated.    Will visit again!!"}
{"text":"Great place for take out and dine in... I come here mostly for their biryani rice (veggie with extra paneer), my brother likes the chicken biryani, had the buffet here before too.. Good place for Indian food, place is always packed with Indian people during lunch hours. If you ask them to make it extra spicy, it gives a good kick if you like spicy food - which I do. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We came in for a weekend Indian buffet lunch and came away happy.  They have a large selection of food and everything is helpfully labeled. There are a wide varieties of curries, a vindaloo dish, saag, butter chicken, shahi paneer and a variety of fried items (eg. fish pakora), you can even get paneer separately. I enjoyed all the food and felt that it was worth it.  The dessert selection has a number of ice creams, a fruit platter (the pineapple were sweet when we went), as well as desserts named 'rice pudding' (I think one is ras malai, but their might be 4 different kinds). Na'an and water top-ups are frequently brought to your table. They take credit card.  Compared to Chauhan's nearby, there's a bigger selection, but at a higher weekend lunch buffet price.  The restaurant is clean and a large window allows you to peek into their kitchen as well. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside feels recently renovated. It's of course cheaper on weekdays than it is on weekends."}
{"text":"The buffet was amazing!! loved their butter chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ridiculously low prices, and absolutely wonderful service.  The owner is well acquainted with my family, needless to say, this is my family's favourite joint for traditional Indian food.  You can get the buffet, or the thali- both are great. Also try the Cheetah beer!"}
{"text":"This guy... Really. Walked in and it looked busy and based on the Zomato and Yelp rating I assumed this was a great place. The buffet looked fresh and busy too. Loads of variety. From there on it went downhill. Came in to get a takeaway. Asked the guy at the cashier what was the better selling Chicken dish, butter chicken or chicken tikka masala. He told me they are two completely different things. Duh. I didn't ask that. I asked which one you thought was a better selling one. Then he continued to argue with me about how Malai Kabab and tandoori and all the others were not kababs. Long story short, silly misunderstanding but he continues to argue. Whatever happened to the 'customer is always right' motto. Refrained from typing this review out till after we tasted the food. Really dude with food that tastes that bad how do you manage to have that much arrogance and that attitude. Yeah, not going back there again. I rarely ever give out bad ratings but this one deserves a negative rating really. Positives: Malai KABAB was decent and so was the sheekh."}
{"text":"India's Taste has one of the best buffets in the GTA. The place is always busy, especially weekday lunches and weekend evenings. The couple who own the restaurant are always hands-on and very welcoming.  There is also a wide assortment of sweets available in gift boxes.   The food: Separate tables for meat and vegetarian dishes which is really nice for those who don't eat meat. As soon as you are seated ask your waitress for an order of  'Papri Chat' which can be ordered mild, medium or hot. We like to call these \"Indian nachos\", a nice start to the meal with a unique taste and texture profile. Papri chat is crispy wafers, chick peas, diced potatoes, covered in a trio of sauces (yogurt/mint/tamarind) and yes it is included in the price of the buffet.  The naan is served hot and fresh, delivered to the table on request.  My favourites are the lamb curry, Tandoori chicken, Chicken Tikka and eggplant (bartha).   Don't forget to leave room for the amazing desserts; Carrot Halva, Ras Malai, and (hot) Gulab Jamun.  There is also ice cream and plenty of fresh fruit.  I suggest you bring a South Asian friend on your first visit as most foods are not well labeled and you may end up eating desert as a main course.  Service is friendly and efficient with every staff member pitching in to help where needed.  Bonus: Great Bollywood movies (muted) on the flat screens!   They have recently added a very nice party room that can accommodate about 30 guests.   The bill is settled at the cash on an honour system.   This venue is a great value, especially if you have a big appetite."}
{"text":"North Indian food in Brampton- shouldn't this just warrant a 5 star automatically? apparently not.   I ordered takeout: Chicken tikka (dry), saag paneer, chilli chicken and 3 naans.  First of all, just over $40; not bad, but considering the food, not good.  Second, chicken tikka was just spicy, didn't have any of the flavour, grilled or otherwise of tikka; saag paneer was a pureed mess of greens from a can and undercooked paneer; and chilli chicken was over cooked and very dry.   Naan was good though.... but not good enough for me to go back"}
{"text":"Came here for NY lunch. Great selection for price. Naan kept coming. Most food very good in flavour, but cold. The chicken biriyani had spoiled and when we told our server she shrugged it off. Had a piece of all the meats, and none of them were cooked through. Not the quickest of service. We waited for ages for our plates to be cleared, and my water was never refilled. May return..."}
{"text":"I can't say it's the best Indian food in Toronto as don't know but coming from USA... I can say it's much much better Indian food than all the best restaurants in USA and very much impressed with pani puri and almost every dish tasted great.     It's worth the money for real Indian food."}
{"text":"Good Indian Food buffet. Ala carte is not bad either. Decent food at pretty good prices (not on the high side though). Considering their menu selection and prices I would definitely say it is one of the best Indian buffet in GTA"}
{"text":"BLESS. Wish they had garlic naan but their plain naan was delicious. Xox PS: butter chicken was on point."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 2 stars for service (I'm being generous).   I was so excited for my bound to be authentic-ish Indian meal in Brampton, especially because AYCE! We got there and the restaurant was crowded, even though it was after 8 p.m. They are wildly disorganized - a huge crowd had formed and there was no system to determine who was next for a table and to divide people getting take out from people hoping to dine in. A few groups that were in there after us ended up standing in front of us, and tried to take our table before I spoke up. After waiting for about 20 minutes, there was no way I could let that happen!   At this point, I was starving and the buffet was calling my name. A server came around to offer drinks, and I got a (delicious) mango lassi, and a glass of water before hitting the buffet. Naan also comes from the server, who unfortunately disappeared for long periods at a time, which also means that water was scarce - a huge problem for someone who can't handle so much spice.  The food was all excellent and there was quite a bit of variety - the station area was cramped though, and there was no orderly line forming. Also, they appear to fill up their take out containers from the buffet, so if you happen to be stuck behind someone filling up a HUGE styrofoam container, things can get frustrating. Combine that with my lack of water/naan refills, and I left full, but annoyed.   I don't think I would come back after this experience - honestly, there is too much competition in this area to go somewhere that doesn't provide good service!"}
{"text":"Expect authentic and good  Larger choice than other buffets  and fresh  As large vegetarian choice as any meat choices  Run by and visited by original ethnic crowd  Clean environment  Open kitchen  Good service  In simple industrial neighbourhood  Good price  Extremely good Never had any place come by so often offering fresh naan!  Will be a regular"}
{"text":"To keep this in context I enjoy Indian food very much, but my knowledge is very limited. I enjoy the buffet because it gives me an opportunity to try many different things.  So coming year was a real treat, the buffet was overwhelming with the number of selections and everything was good they kept very clean and replenished. My only complaint is nothing was labeled so I wasn't sure, and still not sure exactly what I was eating.  But I can't wait until I'm back in town to come here again. There seems to be a lot of Indian restaurants in the area, but this is one we definitely need to check out."}
{"text":"Dined here today and was impressed by the interior decorating. This place had a lunch buffet which we took advantage of. Might have been a little pricey though (14.99 or so). Also, items such as naan/chapatis and chaat can be ordered by asking one of the waiters/waitresses there. Even as an Indian, it would make life easier by labeling all the buffet items so I don't have to take a wild-guess. That being said, the quality and taste of the food was exemplary and I look forward to making future trips there to try other items."}
{"text":"My first all you can eat Indian experience.   I'd much rather go to a place like Bombay Bhel and pay a little more for exactly what I wanted and have better quality. The food didn't taste bad so to speak, but it wasn't fantastic either.   The price was fair for AYCE and the venue is ok."}
{"text":"Punjabi-Sikh restaurant. I ordered a chicken tikka for takeout.  Tasted good.  From the outside it looks very basic and small but it is very big and nice inside. Classy dining areas.  Lots of desserts for take out.  They said the meat is HALAL and that they get it from Brampton Meat Market. ( the conversation took place as of April 2015)"}
{"text":"My family seems to love this place. We end up there a couple of times a year to celebrate various family birthdays. Our most recent visit was a few weeks ago on a busy Saturday night.   It has changed in a very pleasant way in the last few years with many upgrades to the main restaurant area. I will say that their buffet area could be better spaced or laid out to allow for a better traffic flow. I understand getting more bodies in means more dollars, but there is something to be said for customer comfort. I think their entrance area could use a bit of rejigging as well, simply because dine in, take out and sweet customers are all paying there. It always ends up in confusion.   The food is very good though. For my dad, who was actually born in India, it is the most authentic in terms of the flavour of their curries. He loads up on anything goat or lamb based. For the rest of us, we are big fans of the fresh naan and dosa. I could go there and only eat those two things. As long as I could have the carrot halva for dessert. It is so sweet, buttery and decadent in terms of its flavour. I'm trying to cut back on sweets but I could not resist a bowl of that delicious orange mess.   Service is spotty at best. Mostly staffed by moody looking teenagers and young adults. I mean, just bring me my naan, whats with the attitude?"}
{"text":"India's Taste is a fairly decent buffet for the price you pay. However, they did just increase their rates. Not sure if the deal is worth it for those that need to travel far, but for people nearby, it's not bad. They provide each table with fresh naan, and they frequently refresh your basket. Service is on the slow side. The atmosphere is quite dated, but it is clean. The selection of food would only allow you to enjoy at least 2 plates before you have to repeat your selections. I recommend the butter chicken."}
{"text":"Food is good, but only if you are staying for the buffet, if you are getting the thali's for takeout they don't ever fill the containers. My paneer dish had one small peice of paneer, my Kadi with pakora had no pakora.  Best thing is to eat there."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets when it comes to Indian buffets.  This place has been a favorite for me and my wife since we stumbled on to it back in 2010 when we were planning our wedding at a nearby hall.  We don't live anywhere close to this place, but we will go out of our way and travel here when we have a craving for Indian food.  The quality of the food and selection is amazing considering how little you're paying, the service is good but could be a little slow when the place fills up--which is to be expected.  The atmosphere is pretty casual, although I'm not a huge fan of the led lighting...it gives the place a cold look.  The place is always filled with sounds and sights of Bollywood via the televisions which play back-to-back Indian music videos. This is an ideal place to take someone that is new to Indian food as the selection is plentiful."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week and get their buffet take out.  The price is reasonable and the food is always as I expect.  The staff there have gotten to know my preferences as well, and as I'm usually in a rush, so they try to get me in and out of there as quickly as possible.  I recommend them for lunch, as it is more of a casual place."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat buffet the prices are reasonable with amazing food.  The naan they deliver to your table is sooo good. They're fresh and hot.  Wide selection of choices; along with desserts and a salad bar.  However the staff does seem to be kept to a minimum, as you can't get the things you order right away (drinks, tissue) etc.   Place is also kept relatively clean.  A must try for Indian food junkies !"}
{"text":"I'm not the type how leaves 1-start reviews for restaurants, but when you have a negative experience, it's worth sharing it with others. This is an all you can eat buffet, but I decided to order from the menu. I ordered Palak Paneer and Garlic Naan. The Naan was freshly made, tasty, but kind of small. The Palak Paneer was quite spicy, and tasted pretty bad. It was one of worst Palak Panners I've ever tried to be honest. It was watery, while the cottage cheese had a weird texture to it.  I ate a little bit of palak paneer and realized that I wasn't enjoying the taste at all + it was too spicy for me and the server never asked me if I wanted it mild, medium or spicy. I knew I had to voice my dissatisfaction with the food to see what happens.  Once I communicated my dissatisfaction with the food to the manager, they offered to take it back to the kitchen and make it non-spicy. I said that it would not make a difference to me, because I didn't like the food. The manager refused to take the food back to the kitchen and said that either I leave it or take it home, he'll still charge me, because everyone's tastes are different and if everybody did the same....well, you get the point. Fine, it's his choice, but he can be rest assured that I'm **NEVER** coming back to that restaurant.  Here's how he could have handled the situation instead: \"I understand there's something wrong with the food. No worries, would you like to have any other dish instead? No? Ok, don't worry about it. We'll take care of it.\" Alas, the manager decided that $11 was worth more than a happy customer who could come back in the future and bring more business. Instead, he earned an unhappy customer who's ready to broadcast his experience to his prospective patrons."}
{"text":"A friend of mine insisted that we go. She had been here a number of times and raved about the food. I usually don't like Buffet type dining, since I've found in the past, that the food, sitting for a long time, isn't fresh and not too tasty. Boy, was I surprised here!! It can get busy at certain hours, so, be prepared to wait a bit, but we were shown to a table within 10 minutes. For bigger parties (There was only two of us) Id suggest making reservations. A server immediately brought to our table water and cutlery and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. She then directed us towards the Buffet. Throughout the entire meal, the severs were very attentive, friendly and courteous. There was too much food to list all that was there, but it will satisfy anyone who loves Indian cuisine, with the variety, freshness and quality. I sure wasn't disappointed!! I'm sure glad that I listened to my friend and for sure, Ill be back!! Would highly recommend to anyone...."}
{"text":"i really like this place. there's always so much indian stuff i wanna eat when i come here, but i have to get the goat curry. it is just amazing. i stuffed myself to the top of my throat."}
{"text":"Great place!   A lot of variety for Vegetarians and meat lovers and clean.   The servers are friendly and are constantly cleaning and wiping down the buffet area.   3 rows for the buffet and in front of the kitchen there was 2 dishes a veggie option as well and right beside is a dessert area with ice cream and some cakes.   For $15.99 it's a really good price.    First time coming here but I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so popular. Maybe it's because they have a good selection, but that's pretty much the only good thing about India's taste.  The food all tasted bland and seemed like they had been sitting out for a while. The naan that the servers brought to our table was dripping with grease. We had to wipe off the oil with an napkin, that's how oily it was. None of the curries tasted...right. They all sorta had a weird off taste to them.  None of the servers paid any attention to picking up plates or filling water. We were sitting there with multiple dirty empty plates for a good 15min before someone thought to pick them up. We all ran out of water at the end of the meal and no one filled them up.  Disappointing experience, will probably never come again."}
{"text":"Craving Indian food without breaking your budget? Try this place and you won't be disappointed! Extensive buffet compared to other Indian buffets in Peel, with freshly prepared food as opposed to stale food lying in the buffet for days. I was impressed with their Cheese masala dosa, chilli chicken vegetarian dishes, gulab jamun and gajjar halwa. Surprised to even see a mix of Italian pastas at their salad bar. Wear loose/track pants coz you are going to get uncomfortable otherwise from stuffing yourself!!!!   Servers were friendly and prompt but get overwhelmed when it gets busy so the best time to go is between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Food was not tasty.  They have a huge variety of food but not quality.   The only thing I kind of enjoyed was the sweet Gulaab jaman.  Not worth the price."}
{"text":"I remember coming here over a year ago and I didn't enjoy it much. I prefer Tandoori Flame buffet over them (more flavor). This place isn't bad but it wasn't anything great either.. I'm known for going back to restaurants I remember and it didn't satisfy my Indian food craves. I ordered take out from here twice and I was more satisfied with take out then dine in.. Shouldn't it be the opposite? Either way I give it 3 out of 5 because they aren't bad but they aren't the greatest either. They should add more flavor, more spice, more love.. I'm not Indian, but it is one of my favorite foods and I've been to plenty of Indian restaurants.. so I sort of know what I'm talking about? Meh. Lol"}
{"text":"Food  is of decent quality, mostly catered  to non Indians.  Word  of advice , DO NOT TIP. Waiters do not get any  tip."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the west end of markham. A very clean Indian buffet with a large variety of veg and non veg selections plus 2 Indian desserts (kajaar and gulab jamun) and a selection of cake slices.   Thus is an AYCE buffet. The self serve variety.   We ordered mango lassi and soft drinks to go with the water for our meal - and yes they were slow refilling the water.   The food was fresh and tasty with a wide variety of Indian dishes from delicious mild dishes: a perfect butter chicken and tandoori chicken to the blazing hot vindaloo lamb. Not in the buffet- the naan has to be ordered fresh.  The staff was courteous and efficient. I dislike waiters who linger and chat."}
{"text":"Not only their Naan is good,  you can also ask for roti too!  Today's visit was quite pleasant.  Although there was a huge line up (family day lunch) and about 15 people ahead of us,  we got our table promptly.  The quality of food did not decrease because of  amount of traffic,  though the service was quite slow.  Either that or they're cutting us off after 3 baskets of Naan."}
{"text":"Fairly large buffet and a good selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. Food is always fresh and tasty. Appears to have new owners, but quality is still the same."}
{"text":"I went here for the buffet.  There were several vegetarian options, as well as chicken, lamb and goat.  Everything I ate was very good to delicious, and I tried to sample all of the vegetarian options.  The buffet is adequate, maybe a little small if it gets crowded.  They brought fresh naan to the table, which isn't a big deal to me, because I'm more interested in the other offerings.  There were also cold items, such as Greek salad, onion pickle, carrot pickle, as well as plenty of fresh fruit.  I will definitely go back here, and recommend it to anyone who likes Indian food!"}
{"text":"Always delicious food! My only complaint is that they do lack customer service. They don't know how to greet customers. Oftentimes they might forget to give you the naan bread (which is delicious!!). And they don't refill your water as fast as you would like, so sometimes you have to flag them down. Other times, they are pretty good about tending to you.   In Markham, sometimes you pretty much expect a lack of customer service. All in all, I do go back there often and will continue to. They have great food and fair prices."}
{"text":"Cheap (pricing) all you can eat Indian! This is my go to place whenever I crave butter chicken and naan. I also don't eat spicy food so this satisfied my needs! The buffet area is pretty small but you can't go wrong for $11.99 dinner price."}
{"text":"India's Taste is located in a strange part of town surrounded by industrial stores that you'd never think to find it here. On the inside, the restaurant is fairly large and clean though the buffet area is somewhat small. The food was just okay. The buffet contained some of the normal things you'd see at other Indian buffets, like butter chicken, samosas, cauliflower, etc. In the back, you can see the cook making naan bread. I found it amusing that fried fish was listed under \"non-veg snacks\". My group also ordered the papri chaat, which some liked, but I thought it wasn't particularly good. It tasted too much like lime and a mix of every spice imaginable. Overall I'm not particularly impressed by India's Taste."}
{"text":"This place is not friendly for child. Today me and my son went for lunch. They change same price for adult.  The goat meat is bit tough, chicken tandori was OK but need more taste. My son took butter chicken and he warning me to not take the butter chicken due to not good taste. He is normally never complain with butter chicken.  If you like Indian food buffet in budget avoid this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this location two times so far and I must say that the service is excellent, very polite staff. Both times I ordered the same items. Lamb Vindaloo with Naan bread and beer. The Vindaloo is not as spicy as I would like it but the taste is fantastic. I don't know how their buffet is or any other menu items but from what I experienced it is the best Indian I have tried in the GTA."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food! The buffet has more choice than most of the Indian food buffet around. Service is not great, but acceptable."}
{"text":"As of Jan 2017, lunch buffet is $15.99. They raised the price and food is about same.  Today experience wasn't the best. A group of us came here for lunch. Service was very good; very fast to clear out plates, refill water and bringing us naans quickly. Food quality wasn't as good as I remember.  We arrived early for lunch (around 12noon). Our first round of Curry dishes and butter chicken were cold; I guess they didn't have time to warm it up? Second rounds were better. Naans were warm and fresh.   This place used to be good value for $12.99 but at $15.99 it's not as good considering quality seems to be going down a bit."}
{"text":"very busy restaurant ... although i love Indian food.. i had no idea what to select when picking my food...  the food is freshly made and nann was delicious and hot.  i stuck with most of the things i knew.. but tried some interesting new foods too.. everything tasted quite good.. and not surprisingly i see alot of asian people in there too..     I cant eat alot of Indian food as i do at other buffets because i find all the currys and everything very heavy.  It sits in my stomach for a long time so 2 plates was enough for me.   its 15.99 on a weekday dinner.."}
{"text":"Good selection of meat and vegetarian dishes.. The Naan is well made, soft and still crispy.  Service was good, the people seemed to be very attentive. They have a nice party room that you can book. I think this is the best Indian buffet for the price."}
{"text":"I only gave 1 star because I can't give a 0. I used to enjoy the food here until I got take out one day. I asked for the meat selection and literally they scoop everything for you. And when I chose my meat dishes, she literally picked out the bones and gave me lots of gravy. Since then, I have never stepped foot back into this cheap a$$ restaurant."}
{"text":"If this is how India tastes, I'm not sure how I feel about it. Located on Denison, it's a little spot that looks sketchy looking. The inside is not bad though and spacious.   I have to say that the value is really good. $15 for an AYCE buffet is really awesome. That being said, I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a huge fan of Indian cuisine, but it was not the best for me. Being uneducated in these neat looking dishes, I really would have appreciated some descriptions on them since I have certain restrictions. I'd have to keep asking my boyfriend what is what. Sometimes I took the plunge, and regret was filled later. I really appreciated the warmed up unlimited naan though!  I do not think I would come back, but that's my own bias. I will keep searching for my Indian spot."}
{"text":"Indian buffet hidden inside an industrial area. From the outside if you drive by the area it is not what you expect, a restaurant in a highly industrial/commercial area of town. The outside looks small and probably a place you won't go in but inside was quite surprisingly large.   There were quite a few selections for the buffet and I in particularly like their goat curry and fish pakora. There were a decent selection of fruits and appetizers. The desserts wasn't as big of a selection by why need it when you have so much other food to taste.   Service wise was a little above average. It was nice that the server brought out the naans to your table but getting water refills seems to be a little lacking sometimes. But they were quite to remove your old plate.   Price wise, 11.99 on weekday lunch was not bad and free parking outside. Definitely will give this place a try again if I am in the area for Indian."}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5  I have come here on two occasions, and it's been really pleasant. First time coming to this place was with my friend, introducing me to Indian food buffet. Second time was with a group of friends. The place is not beautifully decorated, but it's clean. And it's always packed. Going to the buffet tables are a bit intimidating as if you are not familiar with Indian food, you would not have any idea what the names mean.  Good thing that this place is a buffet you get to take little portions of everything. The amazing place about this is that they have fresh naan, that a server just walks around with, asking whether you want more. And that stuff is delicious.  There isn't a big selection of food, but it's all quite delicious. They have the hot bar, and then the salad bar, some desserts, and ice cream.   For the price you pay, it's mighty delicious, and a great way to try an assortment of Indian food."}
{"text":"Hub's family is from India so naturally we feast on Indian food all the time. We had a family reunion the day prior to the wedding held at this place. The buffet is excellent- even for vegetarians and health conscious. You get your salad fix on one end with all the condiments and fruits. The staff comes to each table with fresh naan. And drinks are ordered separately. It's my 2nd time here in Toronto. And, I love their butter and tandoori chicken, goat curry, saag, paneer, samosa, chickpeas salad, and desserts. All you can eat buffet can be really tempting so you have to really watch the portions on your plate. I normally take a small portion of each so I get a taste of everything. The price is ridiculously cheap for tasty buffet food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have done their take out as well.  The most recent visit was for combining my wedding anniversary and my mom's birthday which was on a Sunday afternoon also known as CRAZY DIMSUM RUSH HOUR.   Since I wanted to avoid the headache and starvation of dimsum lineups we decided to go here instead. It's pretty much clear and you can easily get a table.   Price wise for the buffet depends on your diet and appetite. Those who watch their weight will likely find this expensive. I was relatively stuffed by the third plate.   Food wise I am not heat spicy resistant and I like to taste the food. So my choices are  Shahi Paneer Butter Chicken (has a mild kick) Goat Curry Veggie Samosa with Tamarind sauce Basmati Rice for buffer Naan Rice pudding for dessert  Mind you when we went there the goat curry was a little tough. I think it is too early so it wasn't too tender.   Now for the take out there is one thing that we loved but wasn't available on the buffet and that is Chicken Samosa. For me I like something to die for my food.   When I did the take out which had the samosas, butter chicken, shahi paneer and goat curry at under $35 with taxes. We had enough food to tide us by from Thursday when I got it to Sunday afternoon. YMMV.   The staff is mostly courteous. Especially the front facing staff."}
{"text":"Great value for your money! Don't let the exterior fool you. It may look grungy on the outside but the inside is nice and clean. We came for lunch on a Sunday and we were seated immediately.   The service was great! The waiters were kind and attentive, bringing out  fresh naan, clearing plates, and filling our cups with water often.   The food was pretty good. My personal favourites are the butter chicken and the tandoori chicken. My sister noted that they didn't have the cauliflower and eggplant curry she liked today but that didn't matter much. The rest of the food was a hit or miss based on personal preference but I just stuffed myself on the chicken.   Only downsides are the selections arent huge but you really get what you pay for. The buffet area was just a tiny bit cramped when more people started rolling in after 1 but overall it's a really good restaurant. I recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Love their fresh naan and mango lassie! Their veggie curry and chicken are so tasty. Just makes me want to come back all the time. The price is awesome 17.99 for buffet dinner and the service is great!"}
