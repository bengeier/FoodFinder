{"text":"Not really sure why China II has such bad reviews! I've ordered from here twice and I haven't been disappointed. Granted, I haven't been inside the restaurant, so I'm not sure what that experience is like. I have ordered the orange chicken, shrimp fried rice and egg roll both times (we usually just order very basic chinese food like this-- nothing fancy). I really enjoyed all three. It cost about $19.00 (including tax and the $2.00 delivery fee). They throw in a lot of sauces and two fortune cookies for free (although the fortune cookies have been stale both times...we still eat them though, lol). 
China II is maybe 10 minutes max from my house, but every time I've ordered from them, it takes them about 1 hour from the time I order to the time they deliver at my house. I was pretty surprised that it took this long, but I'm not really sure what the food preparation process looks like for them. Both delivery men have been very pleasant. I also love that I can order online (from my phone, usually). It's super convenient for us. Definitely will be ordering again whenever we get a craving for greasy chinese food!"}
{"text":"Got delivery from this place and was so excited only to be disappointed. The food was bland, egg rolls were awful and even the fortune cookies were stale! The fried rice wasn't good either.  Didn't arrive for almost a hour. Delivery guy was super nice but that's about it. There's no one that delivers in Indian trail aside from pizza joints so we were excited to find this place. We won't be ordering there again."}
{"text":"Trust me you do NOT want to go here. Food is mediocre at best and service is terrible. I went a few times for sheer convenience but rather go out of my way to go somewhere else. Everyone there is rude. The first time we sat there with drinks empty and no refills. Considering it's buffet all she had to do was fill drinks and clean tables. Not one refill. No service no tip... well the next visit she walks up and demands \"This time you leave me tip.\" But again no refills. One why should I tip someone for NOT doing their job and two as a server you do not demand a tip. Will NEVER return!!!!!"}
{"text":"Funny that the only review for this restaurant is by someone who lives many hours away.  I eat there at least twice a month and have never had a bad meal.  Sure it's not a five star restaurant but what do you expect in a shopping center?  The food isn't the best I've ever had but is far from the worst.  They provide a nice variety on the buffet and their take out menu is huge.  The people that run this place are very friendly and a pleasure to deal with.  If you're looking for a quick lunch at a good price you can't go wrong here.  Take it from me, I live 1 mile away, not hours!"}
{"text":"So this place is the only restaurant that delivers Chinese or Thai food to my house in Fieldstone Farms.... So I have want to love it, but it falls short. It is just enough to fulfill your craving after a tired weekday or a lazy weekend. The dishes are hit and miss... For example I ordered pad thai and pad see ew. Pad see ew was good but pad Thai was a miss. It was nowhere like it supposed to be. 
I still will order more food from them just won't have high expectations"}
{"text":"Pretty crappy Chinese buffet food. I got some take out and it was just bleh. Ginger chicken was sweet and no where near spicy and the sauce was like a soup in the container over saturating everything, rice was very soggy. My egg rolls and ragoons were fried in oil that tasted like its been in the fryer for weeks. I could smell the burned oil from the food before ever opening the package. Seriously do your self a favor and don't bother with this place when there are other great Asian food spots within a couple mile radius. Lol I laugh at the fact that they have Thai food as well.... What a joke!!"}
{"text":"It's a really small buffet not many options, if you get salad you either get ranch dressing or nothing. The presentation was not appetizing at all everything looked old and guess what tasted old too. They have the won ton soup, fried noodles in a plastic draw like I keep my makeup in, not food and certainly not at a restaurant. The potatoes were soggy, the fried rice was dry and all of the chicken dishes were cold you could tell they say there a while. And the ambience is that of a dive. I don't expect a whole lot from a buffet, but this didn't even meet low standards."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat, horrible personal!!! Went to this place to the buffet,  the food was bad, bad enough to eat so we decided to leave , as I was getting ready to leave I paid for what we got , the weitress who was serving us fell asleep on one of the tables so I woke her up and asked for my check, I gave her cash and I was wating for my change when she returned she was refusing to give me my change and  saying that that was hers and at first I did not undestand what she was saying and thought it was a joke, but then she started saying that the change was hers that that was her tip , it was not just a couple of bucks so ovusly I told her no you need to wait and give me my money I'll tip you but give it to me , she started yelling to me demanding the tip! People were entering the place and I just felt so embarrassed  I had my son and baby with me so I did not want to make it bigger but she was extremely rude . I will never be returning to this place."}
{"text":"This place sucks ass! I've ordered 3 times in the past year and had to wait for over 2 hours for food. I live 10 mins away. Had I known their 45 min time was going to be 2 hours I would have not ordered from there."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and was told about this Chinese restaurant. I was hesitant at first to order deliver bc its a buffet but the food was delicious! The driver was prompt and friendly. Not sure why the low stars but they deserve 5!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently order from China II and I've never had a problem with them before tonight. I made an order for delivery and was told it was going to be the usual 50-55 minutes. Well at about the 50 minute mark I received a call from the rude delivery driver saying he wasn't going to deliver to my house because I live down a gravel driveway. He offered to walk my food down my half mile driveway because \"he doesn't take his cars down unpaved driveways because it will pop his tires\". So my husband had to get in our car (which mind you has never \"popped a tire' on our gravel road) and meet the walking delivery driver. If you are going to be a delivery driver get a sensible car!"}
{"text":"My wife and her boss ate there for lunch today. Her boss said it was worse than hospital food bland. She showed me a picture of chicken on fried rice and it looked like mayonnaise in yellow, unseasoned mustard. She also said the fortune cookie bent like rubber when she tried to break it. My wife said there was a barrette with hair extensions for sale on a wall as you entered. There were open groceries like from a pantry in the center of the dining room where staff were working. Twilight zone!"}
{"text":"Called ahead for pickup and she said 10 minutes so i arrivedd in 15 mins and yet had to wait for 20 mins to get my gross food"}
{"text":"We love China II but your experience can be very dependent on how you enjoy their food and when. For around 8 years we've been ordering take out from this location and it's always amazing. The food is yummy, the portions are huge, and everything is always fresh. When we want Chinese delivery, this is always the restaurant we turn to. No question. That said, however, the buffet is extremely hit or miss. If you visit for lunch, the food is just as great. Everything is freshly prepared and the selection is great, especially considering the rather small location. If you visit for dinner though, your experience can be very different. Most of the food looks as though the been out all day and hasn't been freshly made in hours. The sauces are no longer smooth and the soups are unbelievably hot from sitting untouched for a long while. 

The staff are always polite and on the ball, no matter the time of day, and generally the prices are incredibly fair. We will continue to get our take out here but, for buffet dinner experience, we will head up to Matthews to visit a competitor."}
{"text":"some of the meals are hit an miss but today we hit them all. Our favorite by far was the szechuan chicken. Not too much heat for the family members who don't want it spicy spicy but enough to keep me happy. The cashew chicken was good but not great and the seafood delight was a solid 4. The rice was perfect--you may think that is a given but I never go back if a chinese place can't do rice!! We received a free cucumber salad that was delicious! and so refreshing. All of the vegetables in every dish were fresh and had that pop of juciness which is so indicative of whether it has sat out or has been made fresh. Glad they deliver to us in Lake Park."}
{"text":"Ate the buffet here before and it was bearable, however today it was not.  Went in at 1:15pm, there were 3-4 other tables of customers there so it's not like I was the only one eating and I had \"missed\" lunch.  Food was dried out.  Crab rangoon was the worst I've ever had, and that's a tall order.  I couldn't eat it...and I will accept almost any variety of crab rangoon or cream cheese dumpling.  It didn't taste like cream cheese or crab.  It tasted like deep fry oil and the contents had the consistency of dried out cottage cheese.  The Mountain Dew I got was so sickly sweet it tasted like a melted slurpee, but sweeter.  I thought Taco Bell turned up the syrup on their Mountain Dew....well....this place is way worse.  Undrinkable.  The rest of the food was dry and old.  The dishes containing a sweet sauce were congealed and reduced to a sticky syrup sauce.  Most of the dishes tasted the same, regardless of the \"name\" of the dish.  Lastly the older Asian lady who acted as the hostess and cashier had a stank attitude and walked around with an annoyed look.

I will not be going back here, they were a solid 3 stars before and I thought it couldn't get worse but they blew the bottom out of those expectations.  YUCK."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. Don't call here if you want delivery. It took 1 1/2 hours to get our small order. The woman just kept saying they were busy when I called. Never again. I could have driven there 10 times in the time I waited."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my house and actually delivers. Very hard to find anything that delivers food other than pizza in Indian trail. The people are very nice the prices are very reasonable, and the food is decent."}
{"text":"This is my first time to order this restaurant. This place is so nice!!!!! And this service is soooooooooo nice!!! I love the food here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always order food to pick up here.  We have ordered to go from here for a couple years now. We have always been happy. 

 Today we went in for the buffet.  It was awful.  Service was awful, the food was old and dry and they weren't replacing with fresh food.  So sad. I'm not even sure we want to go back to ordering to go anymore.  We were less than impressed today."}
