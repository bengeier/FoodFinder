{"text":"I just can't get enough of their sandwiches! Best Cuban sandwich I've ever had. Drool. And I love the Scottwich and reuben."}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker, from Brooklyn, I know Deli.. Scott's USED to be my go to place, sadly...no more. 
The greeting was warm and friendly as usual, but.. the place was empty .. it was a Friday about 3:30 pm..the only thing there.. was the roach that was on our table...
The waiter was less than interested in killing it, we moved to another table having already ordered. I would have left, but my octogenarian parents wanted to stay.. the sandwiches, that should have been hot, were look warm if that, they were not as flavorful as they had been, the fries were good,but we had to wait too long for the frier oil to heat up. 
The waiter eventually killed the roach on the other table, but only after I got up to go tell the man at the front counter. Then no one washed the table!! GROSS!! 
I would (as a customer service professional) have offered something for the unpleasant experience, even if it was only a complimentary round of soda! But not even an apology was offered. 
Sorry Scott's, you lost this generation..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how well this deli is reviewed... I've given it about 5 chances now.  It always looks promising, and is right next door to the Jewish bakery which I love.  Unfortunately, I've been pretty let down each time I've tried to grab some good food from Scott's.

The service is terrible, at least for take-out.  They take their time and acknowledge you if they feel like it.  I don't know about dine-in service, but you can tell having a smile would get a waitress fired.

As for the food... potato knishs looked outstanding, tasted like something you could buy frozen.  Bagels were okay but I had the bar raised.  Scallion cream cheese left a lot to be desired, which is sad because I consider a good everything bagel with scallion cream cheese to be the ultimate new york breakfast treat (after a good egg sandwich, of course).  Damn, the egg sandwich was awful that one time... did they get their bacon from Wendy's?

Still looking for a good NY deli, so feel free to pass one on!  Wish it could have been Scott's."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried is great. Piled high with deli meat and homemade potato fries. My favorite is the Ross"}
{"text":"I love family owned restaurants and will gladly try any place that isn't a franchise.  I was very surprised to go in on a Saturday morning and the place was bustling with activity and lots of diners, all of whom looked to be regulars and quite happy with their morning blintz or eggs.  I ordered a pumperdine bagel with lox, cream cheese and onions and it was top notch and piled high with lox.  Delicious.  Love the deli pickles, very authentic, not your normal over vinegared store brand.  

I would love to go back soon, after seeing their list of smoked fish...I love a good deli with fish choices and I can't wait to also try a corned beef sandwich."}
{"text":"The Lox platter is amazing! Great Jewish Deli. Has a bit of an old school feel to it."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that proudly displays 'American Fries' and 'All-American Toast' as a substitution for 'French Fries' and 'French Toast' are just mindless and a bit moronic. I asked our server about what I perceived as a type-o. She grinned her best 3 tooth grin and kindly answered  \"It's cause we don't like those French for not supporting us in Iraq.\" Uh. Ok.  

If you want a good meal, and not feel like your IQ dropped 15 points for reading the menu, I suggest not going to Scott's Generations."}
{"text":"I love Scott's. Pure and simple. This place is a gem from top to bottom. I've been coming here for over a year and food and service is always fast, friendly, and delish. 

The bagels are awesome- try the egg bagel. I used to come in every Thursday and eat a bagel, drink tons of coffee, and read the New Times. The waitresses were always very sweet to me and I felt right at home. I also love how they don't scrimp on the cream cheese.

The fiance and I usually have breakfast here and could easily share a plate because it is SO MUCH FOOD! The sandwiches look amazing (again... SO MUCH FOOD!) and the deserts look fantastic. 

Try the latkes and the breakfast sandwich with challa bread. It'll make you wanna holla! 

...See what I did there?"}
{"text":"When I have a serious craving for pastrami, these guys are my go to. The menu is extensive, the service is always good and the food is outstanding. They also have some of the best corned beef hash I've ever had. I recommend them to all my friends whenever I can."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Jewish delis.

This is Phoenix, not Detroit or Boston or New York or Los Angeles, but hot damn, the food here definitely could be. Coming from Detroit, I have been searching for a proper bagel, a properly smoked salmon, a proper Reuben, a properly seeded rye, a proper YOU NAME IT, and Scott's has served. Don't walk in here expecting a fancy dining experience; it's not that kind of place. It features quality, monster portions and incredibly friendly staff. 

Every restaurant is going to have have a particular specialty. For Scott's, go in and ask them what that specialty is. If you ask for mostacholi at a deli, there's a good chance it might let you down. But if you ask for kugel or corned beef or matzoh ball soup, this is your jam. For me, it's a taste of home. 

The three best parts of my trip: Crunchy new-dill pickles, Dr. Browns pop, and perfectly seasoned cow tongue (yum!). My friend got the Black Forest (which is smoked turkey and corned beef with actual carmelized onions on pumpernickel) and I got the Scott's Ruben-Ruben; both were SUPERB and large enough for us to take home 3/4's of them. We could not stop effusing or closing our eyes in happiness. The prices are standard; the options are endless; the service is fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. Treat yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Deli and awesome people! Scott's Generation's is a landmark! I can't wait to have a real New York Ruben!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place and it's close to home so we thought, \"Let's try it\". I'll start with the good first: The pancakes were very good. Now for the rest...I ordered the eggs benedict and when it came the bread it was on was the rubberiest, toughest bread I've ever tried to chew, there was barely any hollandaise sauce and the cheese was a square of cheap American cheese. The deal-breaker though was the eggs which were cooked until the yolk was as solid as any hard-boiled egg. I took a couple of bites and notified my waitress of how poorly done the dish was. She offered to send it back to be re-done but I declined. I never send food back, especially eggs! This was an $11 dish and they couldn't even poach a damn egg?! The waitress said she notified the manager but by the time the bill came no manager had come out to apologize or offer to take off that item from the bill. When I paid I informed the waitress that if that was how Scott's treated it's customers I would never be back. And I won't. Mediocre food was bad enough. Rude, uncaring management means I will tell as many people as I can of my experience and never set foot in that place again. Hope the management think their $7 or $8 profit was worth that. 

The one star is for the pancakes."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in the food here. We live close and like to support the restaurants by us so we decided to go for lunch. We ordered the Greek salad and a sandwich with fries. The salad was made with cheap iceberg lettuce and was soggy with dressing. I don't think it sat too long, I think that is just how the salad is. The sandwich looked good but tasted very mediocre. I'm sorry to say that I won't be back and had high hopes for this new restaurant in our hood. Possibly it's better for breakfast but I'm not willing to spend my money to find out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very clean service was really good very friendly I order steak and eggs the eggs were great the potatoes was good the steak was overcooked And dry.  Great selection on the menu many amazing things."}
{"text":"Worst lunch ever at Scott's Generations Restaurant on Glendale. 
There were six of us. Even though we had reservations which had been confirmed, the restaurant wasn't ready for us and we had a long wait before we were led to a back room and our orders taken. I ordered the French dip, and when it arrived the bottom of the bun was soggy to the point of falling apart, but the plate was dry. Hmmm. I tried all through the meal to get the waiter's, or someone's, anyone's, attention to no avail. The waiter never checked back with us to see if everything was ok (it wasn't) or if we needed anything else (I wanted more water and a new sandwich), but we were ignored until the waiter decided to present the checks. Then it was far too late to order a replacement French dip. I was very hungry and had tried to nibble at the top of the bun; there was no question of dipping it into the au jus as the bottom of the bun was already soaked with something I didn't want to think about. as the bottom of the plate was dry, I still wonder where the sandwich had been before it was served to me."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast for lunch. I am told my my lunch-going partner that the corned beef hash was very good (specifically better than Chompie's). The everything bialy and onion bagels we had were pretty good. The bagel was not as dense as a typical bagel. The home fries were strangely bland with some heat. The pricing was reasonable for breakfast. 
I will probably come back here to try other things like the cheese blitzes."}
{"text":"One of the best deli's in Phoenix. Great food all around. Everyone is so nice and friendly, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"To be honest, the only time I go to a deli is when I have a cold and need chicken soup. So today, I was feeling horrible. I did a quick search and found this place. It was 25 minutes away, but good soup is worth the drive.

It was serviceable. 

I went with the mish mosh since I usually get a kreplach/matzo ball combo. What got was a funny tasting broth (sweet onions?), two hard matzo balls, and no kreplach. The veggies/noodles/rice/chicken were good so it wasn't a complete disappointment.

Service was kind of slow, but friendly. 

It wasn't worth my lunch hour."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating lunch here today and it did not disappoint! 

We split \"The New Yorker\", a delicious and very large corned beef and pastrami sandwich. The meat melted in your mouth and had the perfect amount of flavor between the meat, Russian dressing and creamy cole slaw. 

The french fries weren't the best and the sandwich is rather pricey but overall I give this place four stars. I am looking forward to a return trip very soon!"}
{"text":"Let me explain the 1 star ....

I've been to Scott's a few times before ... LOVED IT! I've sat outside, ordered to go but never have I sat inside until last week.

Was visiting with friends and we got a booth, placed our orders ... started to chit-chat and out of the corner of my eye, I see something on the wall. No! Couldn't be! Why yes, it was your friendly neighborhood roach! And he brought a friend! We gals stopped talking midstream, looking around to see if anyone else saw what we did. Why yes!! our server saw the two unwelcome guests as she was standing at the food delivery window. Guess what she did??! Nothing. Until we pointed them out and rapidly moved to another table.

Honestly, we all were wigged out. Talk about an appetite lost! Too bad. I had totally enjoyed Scott's up until then. 

Most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Came for the first time seen from Check Please, Arizona. Service here is strange because I'm not used to seating myself so I asked the cashier for food and placed it. Sat down and waited for a while, my dad got his order real quick and my took a while from a minor miscommunication. All in all my dads Reuben-Reuben,(and yes I said that right) it's all the Reuben you could ever want. Pretty relaxed place. 5 stars for charisma."}
{"text":"Heard about this place, ran in to check it out and see what it's all about. 
Ran into a former classmate of mine from back in culinary school. Small world...

I sat myself for lunch, was immediately greeted and had my drink order taken. 
I had the hot pastrami on pumpernickel. It came with 2 homemade pickles cut in half and a small portion of coleslaw. Sandwich with side was $12. Not too bad considering it had probably 10oz of meat on it. 
Very good sandwich, and it rivaled Chompies. 
I look forward to eating their more often.. maybe for breakfast.. if I get  up that early.."}
{"text":"They have the best corn beef in Phoenix.  I haven't found a place like Scott's anywhere in Phoenix or the surrounding cities."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a whim for lunch and decided to take a chance on a corned beef, pastrami, and tongue sandwich on rye. The tongue was surprisingly fresh-tasting and tongue-y. The pastrami was without gristle. And the corned beef was as one may expect for a decent corned beef. A perfect compliment to the sandwich.

I'm sure that the less perhaps \"exotic\" combinations are equally as delicious, though.

Solid place, I believe. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"My car is currently being worked on and I was craving a real breakfast but couldn't leave the house. I thought I was completely out of luck until I found out this place delivers to my area. I ordered breakfast skillets for myself and my husband and we were both impressed by the quality and the amount of food! We both only ate half so even though it was a bit expensive, we get a whole other meal out of it so I was happy. Plus there is no delivery fee, but you have to get a minimum $20 order (not hard to do if feeding 2 people). Overall I was very impressed and delivery was about 30 minutes, like they said. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"I don't really know where to start with Scott's Generation. I come from the Northeast... when it comes to authentic Jewish delis, it's the land of plenty. In Arizona, I'm lucky to find a deli that even has actually edible corned beef on rye. Scott's Generation offers very good pseudo-Jewish food, but for being \"unofficial\" in my mind, it's pretty good.

Scott's has all the staples of an East Coast Jewish deli:

1. Dr. Browns soda
2. Matzaball Soup
3. A \"special\" (cole slaw and russian dressing on X sandwich)
4. Wise chips

Unfortunately when going to Scott's, I felt like the only Jew in a few mile radius. This was highlighted even more when I asked for Challah french toast. The waitress responded with just \"huh?\"... As I looked down on the menu, I realized their challah french toast is actually \"Kelly's American Toast\" with challah french toast written in small font underneath. Looking further on the menu, I was happy to see that they have an option to get kreplach in your soup... but upon further inspection, next to kreplach it says \"wonton\" in parentheses...

*rustling sound*

That sound you just heard (read) was my great grandparents rolling over in their graves. That's like going to an Italian restaurant in Israel, ordering spaghetti and marinara, and in parentheses seeing \"egg noodles and ketchup\" (at least to me).

Anyway... food wise, I give Scott's Generation a solid 3.5 stars. The service was also a solid 3.5. I give Scott's a 2 on the Jewish deli scale. In the end, Scott's gets an A-OK 3 stars, and I plan to go back one day."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's a childhood thing but Scott's Matzo Ball soup is THE only thing that help with my ailments. Big dense matzo balls like my great aunt Betty would make. The Reuben isn't to be forgotten either. A traditional New York deli is hard to find in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been a few times checking out various items. The deli meat sandwiches are great and served in huge portions ala Carnegie Deli in NY.  The place feels like it needs a makeover in physical atmosphere and attitude of the counter staff. Today I had the Kreplach Soup which aside from the unappetizing greenish color had way too much salt in it and I'm not salt phobic or anything. Is that much salt really necessary? My table server was excellent. Mixed feelings."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a recent Saturday.  The pastrami was ok, but it was tough and sliced too thickly.  Coleslaw is good, and the pickles were just starting to get sour.

The fries were great, but not enough to make up for lackluster pastrami.

I would go back, but with low expectations."}
{"text":"Favorite Jewish deli, hands down. Have been here MANY times. Of course, the food is really greasy, but there IS a dance studio right next door...

The good: great food. Some of it can be a little 'unexpected', and may not taste as you have tried before, but I would say it's still good. My favorite is The Scottwich. It's pretty big and LOADED with meat, which I love. If I'm going to have something, I want a lot of it, not just a little sampler. The breakfast here is pretty good, as well. Now, my favorite part: the cheesecake. Holyyyyyy....yes, it is amazing. I've had a lot of cheese cake - though I would not consider myself a connoisseur - and, in my opinion, Generations' cheesecake is pretty phenomenal. 

I recommend sitting outside - the inside feels a little shabby, and a little stuffy. Surprisingly, I haven't come across any flies yet while eating outside. Oh - and you can smoke outside, which is just fantastic for smokers. For those who don't smoke, fortunately, there are a lot of tables outside, so you can sit far away from me. 

The bad: some of the employees come across as, oh, I don't know..bitter? The average waitress there is at retirement age, which is fine, and that can be really nice: \"what would ya like sweetie?\". But the one of the waitresses at Generations doesn't seem too happy to be there - and she shows it.  That waitress, well,  you can definitely tell when she is having a bad day. I once asked for a little cup of powdered sugar and she gave me the evil eyes!! I couldn't believe it! And neither could my friends and family! But there have been times when she has been very sweet. Though you're walking on eggshells with her. If you get her, be careful not to ask for anything extra. The other employees, I'm not sure about, because we've only really gotten 'her', but I know there is a younger waitress who happens to be very nice and professional. 

Anyways, over all, Generations is an authentic deli, with great food (and cheesecake). And if you feel as bloated as I do after eating there, waddle on over to the dance studio next door and sign up for a Zumba class - and say hi to me. We'll talk about their fabulous cheesecake while doing some cardio."}
{"text":"I'm in this neighborhood each month. Now, I'm kicking myself for not stopping at Scott's sooner. It's the real deal!
I had the New Yorker. Oh my! The rye bread was so good. Stacked high with both pastrami and corned beef. I can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"I live not far away, and regularly visit several of the other businesses in this strip mall, but had never tried Scott's until about a week ago.  We arrived mid-afternoon.  It was dark and dingy, and even though we're both almost Medicare age, we were the youngest people in the joint (including the staff).  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it felt strange. The menus were filthy.  Service was adequate, but a bit slow.  

My partner had the corned beef hash breakfast, and had no complaints - there were fresh onions and peppers in the hash; the 3 eggs on top were perfectly cooked, and the potatoes and toast were fine.  I tasted the hash, and liked it.  The portions were huge. 

I ordered the chopped liver.  I don't know much about chopped liver, except I've made my own a few times and eaten it once from a Philadelphia deli (the Philly stuff was incredibly good).  This was awful; just awful.  Since when is it sweet, with no hint of onion?  I must not be alone, because I heard a woman at the table near us tell the staff \"you don't know how to cook liver.\"

I'd probably try Scott's again for breakfast, but PLEASE:  turn on some lights, wipe off the menus, dust the place up, sweep the floor.  If I'm going to pay above average prices for mediocre food, the place needs to be minimally clean and bright."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: my concerns come to the vegetarian dishes. I've eaten here twice both the veggie Ruben and the vegetarian sub. Just felt like an after thought. Been trying to stay vegetarian lately and it's been tough to find something halfway decent. Their other food looks good."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing Reuben sandwich! The place could be a little cleaner, but all in all a great place to get an awesome sandwich."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Our waitress stayed on top of our needs. My associate and I  work in a CPA firm down the street.  We decided to go to lunch here. The environment is nice - not outstanding but the place was clean. I ordered the Rueben which was fantastic it completely met my expectations.  My associate ordered the Juan's Join the Club.  He was underwhelmed. He told me the sandwich was dry and that he would have to take the half he did not eatit home and freshen it up."}
{"text":"I love this place. Sandwiches are huge, the bagels n' cream cheese are always fresh, and the servers are unique and accommodating. Every time I come here I feel like Norm from Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time customer and will NEVER be back.

Over $12.00 for a veggie sandwich and fountain soda that was supposed to be served with a deli pickle and side of fresh fruit. The fruit 'cup' was literally 3 grapes and 2 pieces of cantaloupe stuffed into one of those tiny 2oz plastic dishes that should be used for ketchup to-go. My 'deli' pickle was 3 small, soggy, soft spears that were terrible and I swear had somehow gone bad (how can a pickle go bad, you say? I don't know either, but Scott's managed to do it.)

My sandwich was okay, but was on genaric wheat bread, loaded with raw red onion (I'm talking about nearly half an onion) a piece of lettuce and a slice of tomato. Their veggie cream cheese was the only saving grace to the sandwich, but was lumped on in the middle of the bread, so I had to dissect the sandwich to remove a lot of onion and spread the cream cheese around.

Besides the poor quality food, the service was terrible. I walked in and placed my order to go. I got out my card to pay, and the guy at the counter said I could wait until my food was ready. 7 minutes later, there were 3 other tables trying to pay for their meals at the only register in the place, so I had to wait longer. never mind the fact that (I actually think it was the owner?) interrupted the customer in front of me to talk to the guy at the register about his cell phone that was ringing... Seriously?!

Bottom line: get way better service, don't serve deli pickles if they're not, and if you're going to offer a veggie sandwich, give it just as much love and attention as you give the corned beef hash and liver you serve."}
{"text":"Bad food bad service greasy matzo ball soup. Skip this dump. I literally took one bite and left it was so bad. Went to subway next door instead"}
{"text":"Had the Pastrami sandwich and it was satisfactory.  It was on the dry side.  It comes with fries and they were just fine.  Now, I did have the homemade brownies, and they were awesome!  Would order those to go:-)"}
{"text":"We went to Scott's Generations on a sammich mission.  We want to find the best of the best sammiches, and we found some of them!

I ordered the \"Mike's Jumbo Philly Cheesesteak\" which was really delicious.  Great flavor in the meat, veggies, and bread.  My only problem was it wasn't so jumbo.  It was normal, but honestly, I don't know if I could have finished it if it was jumbo.  

The side of fries was pretty tasty, perfectly done crinkles, a great compliment to the sammich.  

I also tried my friend's \"The James Cagney\" (Brisket) and another friend's \"Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben\" (Which was half pastrami half corned beef).  

Both of those sammiches were also delicious.  Perfectly cooked meat, great bread, not much more you could ask for.

Out of all three of the sandwiches \"The Scott's Perfect Reuben\" was probably the best.  So if you are having a hard time choosing, go with the Reuben (half / half).

This place is a little pricy for a sandwich, but it is well worth it.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This reminded me of going to the deli in NYC.  The type of food, the bagels, the excellent mustard, the black & white cookies, ... and oh, the knish!  I went during a slow time - so I had a few minutes to ask about their sandwiches and recommendations without slowing down everyone else.  I enjoyed the experience - the service, the food, the selection.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, BUT

1. it is inconsistent.  One day I'll get lots of cream cheese on my bagel and another day they'll skimp out on it and leave lots of dry parts.  I paid $5 for a pint of matzo ball soup and got one tiny (and very dense) matzo ball--felt a little ripped off. There should be standard portions I think.

2. I think I was over charged my first time there.  My bill came to $10 but according to the menu my bagel was 3.20 and the soup was $4.95.  Is the tax rate 20% now? The amount is so small that I didn't make an issue of it, but I read another review complaining of the same thing so I think it's worth mentioning. 

I'll still go back for bagels because they are way better than Einsteins, especially the cream cheese, but I'll be sure to check any to-go orders for skimpy portions before leaving next time, and check my bill carefully before paying."}
{"text":"Okay I've been here before and had the hungery man breakfast when I got my meal I was told that there was no more sausage, this would have been nice to know this when I ordered it and who runs out of sausage at a deli. The portions were very small for 10 bucks and the restroom was not clean at all....not too happy right now and still hungery....gerrrr"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Real NY style over stuffed (boars head cold cuts)sandwiches. I love the bagels.  The Matzoh Ball soup rocks too...I would give this place 4 stars but every time I come in the owner/management gives a really crappy vibe..I know I usually come in late afternoon and they are quiet,  they just had a busy breakfast/lunch so its all good, maybe they are winding down from a tough morning....Having said that, Im NOT looking for any special attention because Ive been going there on and off for 5 years. But seriously? Act like you give a hoot (hoot is code for $%*)...I would be there all the time if they acted a little gracious and chill..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Scott's since I was a kid. Great bagel breakfast sandwiches with 2 eggs cooked to order, a bagel of choice, meat of your choice and cheese of your choice for around $5. Their pastrami is also delicious.  Try their Scottwich!"}
{"text":"Arrived at this place for the first time.  Was told to go \"sit\" at a booth; that menus were on the table.

Searched for a clean table even though the restaurant was nearly empty and had multiple waiters sitting around including the person at the register.

Other than my waitperson, the rest of staff looked at me as if I were from Mars, not evening smiling in my direction.

If your looking for food, go. If your looking for good service, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We stopped eating breakfast there long ago due to always getting our order incorrect. Eggs always burnt, nothing tasting good. Today we stopped for bagels and cookies to go. The cookies were so rock hard and stale I can't believe they would even sell them. The rainbow cookies you could not even bite. They resembled a tiny brick. This place gets worse and worse."}
{"text":"Not happy with my service, hair found in wife's sandwich, and then during another visit was left hanging waiting for the manager to get off the phone he was conducting a phone interview, and no waitress even looked to take care of us at the deli counter. Will not visit or spend my hard earned money at Scott's !"}
{"text":"The James Cagney sandwich is hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. Their new location is in a great spot and it's closer to my office! Great service from all of the staff too. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious grub. Order the James Cagney and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here enough including several times since I started reviewing on yelp but have held back...today, I'm busting it out.

I have a lifetime of eating in various Jewish deli's in Chicago, Florida and Arizona and Scott's is typical, not exceptional but certainly a restaurant where food is decent, portions are excessive and pricing is never a bargain.

So I have no particular gripes and I would recommend the place to others who are looking for good chicken noodle/matzah ball soup or a massive corned beef or pastrami sandwich. For this you cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Scott's has become one of the go-to places on our list of Sunday breakfast spots. The food is great, the service is good, and the brownies are to die for. 

You won't find anything fancy here- the food is simple, wholesome and tasty. The french toast is perfect. I was informed by one of our breakfast crew that the chorizo is way too spicy, but I don't know why you'd order chorizo in a Jewish deli when there are so many other good things on the menu. 

On my last visit, I had a veggie omelet. That thing was as big as my head, served with yummy potatoes, and provided two tasty breakfasts. Whatever Scott's lacks in style, they make up for in cheese. Holy hell, was there cheese. Not a bad thing, just a little overwhelming. 

The brownies are to die for. I haven't tasted a better brownie since...well, I just can't remember. Scott's brownies are cakey, perfectly moist, slathered in a not-too-sweet frosting, and they're HUGE. 

Give Scott's a try. The menu is large enough that there really is something for everyone. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and wow what a menu....you could eat here everyday and not have to have the same thing twice."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here today and it was very good.  We had the Lox and bagel plate which had a generous portion of Nova Lox and plenty of condiments.  we also had the Greek Omelet which was very tasty and had a nice proprotion of veggies to eggs.

Service is attentive and friendly - a nice find"}
{"text":"New location same great taste!  I have been going to Scotts for 10 plus years and every time it's a great experience.  The staff is always friendly and the food is unbelievable.  The new location is beautiful with a very upbeat vibe.  If in the area I would highly recommend you stop to check it out."}
{"text":"Scotts is what you expect when you say Jewish Deli.  The corned beef hash is crispy on the outside, with green peppers and onions mixed in.  All of the portions are large to say the least.  The first time we went was for breakfast, but after seeing a corned beef sandwich go by, I changed my order!  Bacon that tastes like bacon, eggs cooked the way you ask for them, and lots of personality in the staff and owner.  Jan is a hoot, and Scott is always behind the counter to add color.  Not fancy, and you will have to Fabreeze when you get home, but a great meal that a chain will never match."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place- if you like bialy's like I do, they have the BEST bialy's in town in my opinion.  If you get an entree, be prepared to take some home, as their portions are enormous.

It's a typical New York family owned deli.  Sometimes one of the owners (I think he's the son of the owner) can be pretty moody and rude but if you can deal with that, it's worth it for the food.  I go back here all the time when I'm in the mood for a good bialy or breakfast.  Excellent cream cheeses too- my favorite is their veggie cream cheese.  They have lunch and dinner too.  Give it a shot!  I can't think of a better Jewish deli in town."}
{"text":"This place is on the list.

You know, that list you keep of places you plan on coming back to, again and again? It might be purely mental or physical, but when someone within earshot says \"i'm in the mood for a Reuben\" that list springs into action.

Scott's Generations is at the top of that list, for sure.

I've never ever had sandwiches, nay sammiches, quite like this. But, being from California I've never had the pleasure of an authentic Jewish Delicatessen either. Our table ordered a half-and-half Reuben, a jumbo philly cheese steak, and my order, the James Cagney: a beef brisket sammich on an onion roll with coleslaw and some amazing chunky fries on the side.

My mouth is watering purely from the memory... My friends and I each kept half of our respective orders, but cut the other halves in two so that everyone could get a taste of everything. The cheese steak wasn't bad, but I've had better. My brisket was GLORIOUS, and I savored every bite. I even got up to grab some mustard for accompaniment but it went unused since it was so perfect and juicy. I have to say though, that the quarter piece of the Reuben I tried was definitely my favorite thing on the table. AH! IT WAS SO GOOD!

Not only can Scott's build a perfect sammich, they back it up with stellar service and great attitudes. It was a little pricey, but I also felt that for the price you got a TON of food! I'll be back soon. and again. and again and again, with friends."}
{"text":"How have I not sang Scott's praises yet? Well, here I go! 

Do you want a place for a good, solid, stick to your ribs breakfast without being too frou frou? Scott's is the joint! It's a Jewish deli in the middle of my neighborhood! I was so surprised that I hadn't noticed it before! Chrissy P invited me to join her for breakfast one morning and I was just blown away! On my first visit, I had the eggs Benedict. My only complaint was that my eggs were a tad overcooked, (not runny) and I wished for more hollandaise sauce. 

For my second visit, I brought my little sis and her BFF and we chowed! I had the Hash Mash and we shared an order of the french toast. I don't know why I challenged myself to my own personal \"how much breakfast can you stuff into your stomach\" contest, but I think I won. Everything was so good! There was nothing to complain about. 

I wish I could go to Scott's every day for a hearty breakfast! The dishes are simple, the service is straight forward, and I have NEVER walked away hungry. I will return very, very soon!"}
{"text":"Wow. They messed up the most basic stuff. Really horrible, all the way around.

Let's see-- asked for kreplach soup, which is not on the menu. They have matzo ball and they have mish mosh (noodles, matzo, kreplach). I asked for kreplach soup and they brought me one dumpling. So how many dumplings in the mish mosh? One, right? So if I want the kreplach soup, then I would expect 2 or 3 dumplings. Call me crazy!

The soup was also cold.

Chopped liver tasted like liver... \"Livery\". At better delis, the chopped liver is smooth and creamy-- slightly sweet. This was bitter and not smooth. Unpleasant. I think it was made from chickens who drank a lot of cheap booze and popped pills.

They served it with bagel chips... Which is great, except a few good sized bagel chips were cinnamon-raisin. You gotta be kidding me. With liver? Disgusting.

Meatloaf was a friggin' nightmare. Not sliced from a loaf, but a patty that was baked. Super well done, chewy crap. Served with a beef base gravy, and they used way too much beef base.

Carrots were overcooked; mashed potatoes were ordinary.

My bill was $43. With tip, $50. Service was polite, but a little slow.

I am so angry that I paid for this crap. This is the second worst meal I've ever paid for in my life. I'm 40.

Very, very bad restaurant. Ugh."}
{"text":"I've been going to Scotts Generations for 13 or 14 years now. The food is always consistently delicious! The prices are a bit higher than what I'd like to pay for breakfast/lunch, but considering the HUGE portions, it's totally worth it! If your bubbie used to make knishes, blintzes, or matza ball soup you can't stop daydreaming about, try this place out!"}
{"text":"Way over priced for the menu.   Ordered \"Anitas Smothered delight\" ($14),  a chicken sandwich covered in sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Ordered to go.  When i got home and opened the box it was a chicken Cesar salad.   With only three tables seated, you would think they could get an order right.   Sorry,  off my list."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  My sandwich was huge, the corned beef and pastrami was very flavorful. The matzo ball soup was a huge disappointment..it was like malt-o-meal mashed in to a ball that had sat in a freezer and turned to a gelatinous blob, not good.  The potatos on the side were nothing special and there was no uniformity to how they were cooked. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Well this was my second time eating over at Scotts and I thought maybe a second try would have made it better...especially since I went to go buy a gift card for my boss who loves the place.

I ordered the Scottwich which is a huge sandwich piled high with pastrami, swiss cheese, grilled onions and generously served with side fries, pickles and coleslaw. My sandwich was simply Perfection! (about 13.50 after tax)

Unfortunately the service is not....hence the 3 stars.

When I called in Tony (The big guy in the front-I think thats his name) placed me on hold for 3 minutes, I thought they must have been really slammed, but when I went for pick up they were fairly busy but not packed. He had no patience and no sense of customer service whatsoever! I asked to purchase a gift card and he said they didn't have any, I then asked for a certificate of some sort and he said that he could make me one but threw a large fit because he had to... Then I proceeded to ask for a pound of cookies and he shouted \"como chingas\" which is not something very nice to say to a person (Those who are bilingual in Spanish know what im talking about). He became extremely stressed at having to write out a certificate and have phone calls and waitresses coming up to cash out the checks. He got even more upset and walked away! I apologized and said that I would just purchase one of the pre-packaged cookies that were on display... $50 dollars later I received my cookies, my to-go order and my $25 gift certificate. 

The food is awesome-definitely worth the price, but be prepared for the mediocre service!"}
{"text":"Man I normally don't like Reuben sandwiches but this one was amazing bread was perfectly crisp not soggy the sauerkraut was just wrong enough to get the flavor but then it over power the beef the beef was super tender not over brine just very well bound sandwich and that it was piled high not too bad for 14 bucks server was great too pretty fast to getting things I'll top of getting drinks and making sure head refills the whole time egg burrito was mediocre though when I get that again also use the free dessert checking offer don't get that brownie cheesecake not good at all very dry more brownie flavor than anything definitely will go back for the Ruben"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for lunch at work.  Not a quick order place, as it took quite a while to get my food.  Definitely overpriced (for $12.50 your sandwich better be amazing).  Inedibly hard undercooked potatoes (I really hated these).  Lackluster monte cristo sandwich which I ended up just taking apart and eating in layers.  Haven't been back since.

They definitely cater to \"the regulars\" and don't seem interested in attracting new business.  They better take heed.  Karsh's next door closed for a reason...

I'll stick with braving the parking lot and traffic for Miracle Mile.  It's much easier to zip through their cafeteria line, and their food quality is much higher."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have been coming to Scott's Generations since I was a kid. And I love their new location, it's a very cool style."}
{"text":"The New Yorker was amazing!  One of the best \"corned beef & pastrami\" sandwiches I've had ever!

The food was so good that we got a dozen bagels to go."}
{"text":"For me, Scott's Generations is the epitome of comfort food. Last week I felt really crummy, and the only think that made me feel better was a piping hot cup of matzoh ball soup and a crispy potato latke with applesauce. 

When I'm feeling right as rain, I indulge with their New Yorker sandwich: corned beef, pastrami and coleslaw on yummy rye bread .... It's amazing. 

Scott's even impressed my New York born-and-raised mother (while Chompie's does not)."}
{"text":"Love the old school feel of this deli! You gotta get that this is a family deli not Jimmy johns, you get good food made just how you want in the time it takes to make good food chill and try the nova lox"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have wanted to try this place out for a few years. This morning, my wife, daughter and I walked there for brunch. We sat out side, ordered and ate. The food was average, and a bit overpriced. The place was a little dirty.

I am an Asian American, and was born in Vietnam. My given name is Dung, which is an unfortunate name to have in the states, but it is my given name .  After I paid my tab at the counter , as I walked away, the man who tendered the transaction walked to his colleague with my receipt. They said my name out loud, audible to me from twenty  feet away, and half way out the door, and laughed out loud. He then said,  \"hahah, they named their stupid kid Dung!HAHAHAH\".   I've lived with this my whole life, but not so much as an adult.   This was disappointing to me that these men, who represent their business, were this rude and insensitive. So, Scott's Generation WILL be receiving a letter of complaint by me and I plan on filing a letter of complaint to the BBB.

If you are looking for a food /  restaurant review, this place is overrated. The food is forgettable  and the service, was beyond description."}
{"text":"We were in the area, and i had heard great things about this place from my boy Nader A so I decided to check it out. I only got a few latkes, some pickles and a kinish but it was all very good. The place is a great little deli with great service and awesome food. The latkes were very good, as were the pickles. I didn't try the kinish, my wife daid it was good though. I need to go back and try some of the pastrami and other goodies. Great little place."}
{"text":"Tried The New Yorker sandwich. It was awesome, you have to try one of these. Even better than at Miracle Mile, which I love. It has so much meat I only ate half the sandwich and all of my fries. Took the other half home for later."}
{"text":"Been going here for 20 years it seems like, and always been good to me. Food is good and I really like the new coffee cafe that opened up inside that place!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast there this morning.  \"Meh\"

Pro's
1.  Very attractive new location.  Well laid out, very nice facility.
2.  Service was very good.  Much better than my experience when they were at 7th Street and Missouri
3.  Their breakfast potatoes are very good.  As was their take on Huevo's Rancheros.  
4.  They had good coffee.

Cons
1.  Relatively expensive for what you get.  They nickel and dime you for everything.  Denny's at 7th street and Camelback has better food and is cheaper.
2.  Orange juice was awful (and my wife loves orange juice).  It tasted like the cheapest stuff they could buy. 
3.  Bagels were stale (yes, the Bagels at a New York deli weren't very good). 

Final judgement: We won't be back.  There are better places out there for breakfast."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there this morning.  The food was good, but the coffee could use improvement (I like good coffee with breakfast and it is high on my list of things I look for in a place to eat breakfast).

Service could use a lot of improvement.  Initially it was ok, but I waited 15 minutes for someone to refill my coffee while my coffee cup sat on the edge of the table.  Meanwhile a waitress and manager walked back a forth a number of times.  I was tired of waiting and went to the counter to leave.  They asked for my check and I said I didn't have it and had been waiting the last 15 minutes without even seeing my waitress.  He found her and said she'd been working a big party in the other room.  I asked why they didn't have the waitress in this room cover?   Waited another 5 minutes at the register for them to get my ticket.  Then a big guy came and asked if he could help.  I told him I had been trying to pay my check.  He got the check from the waitress and said to her \"What's wrong with you?\".

Bottom line - If they improve their coffee and get their act together on waiting on tables, this could be a very good place.  Otherwise, it won't do well.  

I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have here twice so far. Authentic New York deli offerings. Excellent breakfast and the BEST pickles!  My new favorite local spot!"}
{"text":"Ate here kind of randomly on New Year's Day, and it was pretty great!  I was looking for a hangover solution and the food here really hit the spot.  Great selection of breakfast items and friendly service.  The southern scramble that I had was delish.  The coffee flowed as readily as the wine had on the previous evening, so I walked out of Scott's ready to face the new year (right after the nap that I planned).  Also, sitting outside was some of the most interesting people watching I had experienced in years."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with Rand H ,Norm R and Robyn N a small UYE. This was my first trip to Scotts Generations and i found it to be an authentic Jewish deli. I had a bowl (more like a pot) of kreplach soup and a corned beef sandwich that came with pickle spears and coleslaw. The lunch was very good and the soup was amazing. I would and will return to Scotts."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there on a routine Tuesday morning while in the area. I wont be going back. The menu looked good and the place is clean and minimally decorated, but pleasant. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it came with potatoes. My food came out in a timely manner but what a disappointment.  First, it didn't look appetizing at all. The Hollandaise sauce was ill-colored and lacked taste. I compared it to something that may have come from a can or bottle. The poached eggs were fine but they aren't the star of this show - the drab Hollandaise killed the dish as i struggled, to no avail, to find something redeeming about the plate in front of me. The bread served was English Muffin like - but was stale and wasn't browned enough to provide that contrast \"crunch\" in texture you like in a good Eggs Benedict. The ham was good and seemed to be the most edible component  to me. And the kicker was this, on the bread beneath my bland sauce and poached egg was an unmelted slice of American cheese. I swear to you it looked and tasted exactly like a Kraft single peeled away from its gawd-awful plastic wrapping only moments before and they didn't even bother to melt the processed square of yuck to help disguise it? The potatoes accompanying my dish were pleasant looking but again lacked good taste and were underdone. 

Because I really wanted to find something i liked about the place and to quickly supplant the memory (and taste)  of my breakfast, I ordered an Apple Danish. After a few minutes in the microwave, i was presented with a very hot, and largely mediocre Danish. The pastry parts were dry and dense and lacked life and taste. It was reminiscent of the prepackaged Danish i might find at Costco.  The filling was Apple and sugar so it met the criteria to be called \"filling\", but nothing more. The glaze was paltry and would have made the pastry/bread part more edible but it was barely noticeable. Again with the corner cutting. 

The service was good and attentive, but it's not her fault my food was so lacking. It just feels like my whole meal was totally cheaped out. Very cheap, poor ingredients and a kitchen that didn't care about how my food tasted and that equals a dissatisfied eater who won't be coming back. You wanna buy and deliver substandard food?  Fine. But then don't charge me 20.00 for breakfast and pretend I won't notice. Charge what Denny's or Waffle House might charge, cause that is the impression your food made on me."}
{"text":"Good New York style deli... Tons of food and worth every minute.. Little dive with big flavor.."}
{"text":"I like the servers at my local NY delicatessen to be like they are at Scott's Generations:

* Surly 60 years old ladies
* Low on convo
* High on service
* Standard WTF look accompanied with an occasional  \"I'm not amused\" look.

I came here for breakfast again the other day and it was hopping with singles, retirees and families.  You walk in and seat yourself. The place is your typical strip mall storefront that stretches back lengthwise with a next door addition. On one side you'll find a series of naughahyde booths and on the other side you'll find the cash register, kitchen, deli counter where you can order fat free bialys, Hanukkah cookies, gefilte fish, latkes or side salads and luncheon meats by the pound. 

Breakfast here is dirt cheap. The breakfast sandwich is $4.  Eggs, hamsteak, home fries (sauteed with seasoning and grilled onions) and a bagel is $5 something.  Surly little old lady servers take your order and shout it into the kitchen - all old school and stuff.  Once my friend (who dislikes bell peppers) ordered the corned beef hash skillet and was disappointed to see bell peppers in the hash. We told the server and she brought out an entirely new dish, with new eggs and home fries.  No sigh. No face. No questions asked. 

Lunch and dinner looks pretty good - an extensive selection of sandwiches and traditional deli favorites.  Haven't had it though.  I can't seem to make it there by the geriatric last dinner time of 5 pm and 8 pm throughout the week (!)

Food here is probably 3.5 stars.  Service here is a solid 4 stars."}

Their sandwiches are huge. Seriously, I'm not sure how one gets his or her entire mouth around a bite. And, being from the northeast and a member of the tribe myself, I love the feeling of an authentic Jewish deli."}
{"text":"These 4 stars are based on the tasty food at Scott's. I enjoyed the latkes, 3 huge potato cakes served with applesauce and sour cream. Hubby ordered ham steak and eggs, accompanied by a side of home fries and almost cleaned his plate (ham steak was huge!). The booths were large and cozy; decor was very home diner style comfortable. Unfortunately the service was so so. Our food arrived fast but our waitress looked annoyed at having to serve us. We showed up at 3:20 Sunday when they close at 4:00, so maybe we arrived to close to day's end?  We will visit again soon and see how it goes because the latkes are already calling me back...."}
{"text":"New location, clean and elegant, very nice waiters and excellent food! We had Pastrami Reuben, smoked salmon w/salad, potato pancakes, hot dogs and a knish. Everything was delicious, and at a reasonable price. A great experience! We definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to go to Scott's Generations for about a month. After reading the reviews the build up for me was worth the wait.
I had the Reuben  Reuben with piled high corn beef. The rye bread was grilled to perfection. The sandwich comes with cold slaw (sweet and tangy) and french fries that reminded me of the kind that were made at Nathan's from New York.
My brother had the James Cagney sandwich. It consists of Brisket of beef, melted swiss cheese, grilled onions, lettuce &
tomatoes served on toasted garlic onion roll. 
We are ex New Yorkers who both agree. Scott's is hands down  the best deli on the west coast. 
We both can't wait to go back again and again to try other menu items."}

{"text":"WOW! Fantastic place that I have been ignoring for years, but glad I finally came to  my senses! 

So its hard to order here because everything looks so darn good, literally I could not make up my mind on what to get, I wanted it ALL!  So I settled for the corned beef hash and it was FRESH MADE AND FANTASTIC!!!! The sandwiches all looked piled high and the pancakes are huge! 

The waiter was super knowledgable, friendly, caring (when do ever hear that one in a review?), and seemed to love his job to the fullest.

Do yourself a favor and stop in, this is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Service, cleanliness, quality, price, and taste are all beyond 5 stars. Being from New York you expect a great deal from Delis and food that totes a back east flare. Whether you're homesick or hungry, you will get your life at this place all the way around. You'll beg to pay double your receipt. Go at the time of reading this post for your own good!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh 

Thats really all I have to say about this place. I randomly stopped here for my lunch break while I was working in the area. I'm originally from NY and really REALLY miss the NY style deli/diner's. 
I was excited to see if they carried cannolis, unfortunately they didn't, they might but that day didn't have any. Was really hoping to buy 2 for my parents, whom are natives to the Bronx. 

I sat myself, the tables were a bit dirty. Service was a older woman, she was very pleasant. I got a grilled chicken sandich and fries. The sandwich was great, fries were burnt and horrible. 

I MIGHT, just might stop by here again, if I'm in the area and have no other options."}
{"text":"Scotts Generations is tucked back in an unassuming shopping center. The staff was friendly and attentive. We came for lunch and decided on the Ruben and the Cheese Steak sandwiches. They were super delish, hot and fresh. Not to mention the portions were huge. Each came with allot of fried and quartered potatoes on the side and neither of us could finish, so ,ended up taking more then an extra meal home with us. Behind the counter they had beagles, sides, smoked fish and more to choose from, which a steady stream of people kept coming in for things to order. Service is a definite plus as everyone I saw was being served promptly. It has an old and tired decor but the food and service more then make up for this."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwhich shops EVER. OMG yum come in with an appetite, empty stomach, and loose clothing bc the portions are incredible. Reminds me of back east. Be starving you leave satisfied.  The cooks in the back are amazing and are always curteous!  Try the Philly.  My favorite is Scotts rueben."}
{"text":"First thought upon seeing my Scotts special Reuben reuben...damn, wish I had a second stomach. 

I tried Scotts for lunch. The place was kind of cramped and about half full. Theres tons of deli meats on the left ready to be cut and several booths to sit in. I sat in the back where the tv was on. I regretted sitting back there as its next to the waitress' lounge table against the wall where they gossiped about their day. Nothing wrong with that but I wish I'd sat more in the front. The place was so-so. The staff could have piped down and grabbed a broom and swept the place up a bit. Or maybe they could have grabbed some clean rags and gave the menus a good sponge bath. I seriously wish I brought some hand sanitizer after looking thru that thing. 

Anyhow, I didn't come for the ambiance as its a deli. My food came out within 5 or 10 minutes and the sandwich was freakin HUGE. Two massive pieces of reuben stacked with meat, bread, and sauerkraut. It was surrounded by short fat krinkle cut fries and a shot glass size of cole slaw. 

The first 3 bites of my king kong Reuben were absolutely delicious.  I thought to myself, this is what I'm talking about.  The bread was outstanding. Lightly buttered and crisp. The meat was tasty as well and steaming hot. The sauerkraut didn't do much for me nor did the cole slaw but I'm not really a fan of either. The biggest disappointment was the fries were undercooked. Nothing worst than hard undercooked  fries. 

There was so much food I had to ask for a to go box. I ride a motorcycle so I usually never take left overs as I have to strap down the box on my passenger seat and it looks a bit ridiculous. However, after dropping 15+ on a sandwich for lunch and considering how delicious the sandwich was I just didn't have it in me to leave it behind. 

Scotts was probably a 3.5 for me overall. It would have been teetering on a 4 but the fries and cleanliness dropped it down for me.  I would certainly be open to give it another try and maybe take a friend to share with next time as no one should ever attempt to eat that much food unless they are going into hibernation soon."}
{"text":"I would had given them six stars if possible. WOW... what a sandwich. I had the \"Reuben- Reuben\" packed with corned beef. Totally worth every penny. Served with a mountain of fried potato too. We sat in the dog friendly patio on a perfect Phoenix day."}
{"text":"I just found another reason to go to Phoenix. I only wish we had a Deli closer to Monterey then Phoenix that served a Corned Beef/ Pastrami sandwich as good as Scott's Generation Restaurant. I had the \"Reuben-Reuben\" that was by far best sandwich I've ever had. Stacked tall with a combination of Corned Beef/ Pastrami, Swiss cheese, Sauerkraut, grilled to perfection. It was so big the waitress asked if I wanted a box to take the rest home. I said it was so good that I was going to try to eat it all. Now I don't have to eat dinner. Reasonably priced too."}

{"text":"Definitely going to be my new favorite NY style restaurant to get some great tasting food and enjoy some really yummy take out products as well. Who doesn't like a tasty deli that serves Breakfast all day long and has Giant Sandwiches as well as all the traditional standards everyone loves.

This is their new location since the last one closed and it is very clean and comfortable inside. The menu is HUGE and has everything you could possibly imagine. They even have several items that you can bring home as well as fresh Bagels, Deli Meats, smoked Fish, and then some.

Ordered the New Yorker which has Corned Beef & Pastrami, cole slaw & Russian dressing piled high on your favorite bread and served with fries & pickles. It was very good and more food than you should probably be eating without a good walk afterwards.

My wife mistakenly ordered the Denver in Phoenix Egg Skillet which has diced ham, onions, tomatoes, green peppers topped with melted swiss & cheddar cheeses with a side of fries. She was really wanting an Omelet and distinctly asked for one. We were surprised when it came to the table and notice that is was not an omelet. We were both so hungry that we decided not to mention anything at the time.

When the server came back I made the comment that my wife's dish looked more like a skillet and not an omelet. She mentioned that it was not an omelet and wanted to know if they could remake the order. At that point half the food was already eaten so the manager kindly offered to remove the charge for that dish from the bill. Nice!

Overall service was friendly and a little sparse. Then again it was a busy Sunday and the place was rocking with hungry customers. We were both surprised at their dedication to keep us happy and a future returning customer. Not all places go to that extent and it makes a big difference.

Bring the family and anyone hungry for some delicious gut busting portions of food. They even have a larger room in the back for bigger groups of people. I'm personally hooked on their Pastrami and will be stopping by here on the way home for some take out as well. OH YEAH BABY!

{"text":"Owner yelling at employees in front of customers!

We ended up leaving and not ordering anything because we were having a nice Sunday and didn't feel like we should have to endure the thick air of negitivity. The owner was complaining loudly to a number of other employees about something. Then a young man/employee came in and he started yelling at him. Honestly, all this yelling, cursing, shaming, digust went on for over 8minutes! I couldn't belive that any establishment owner could be that ignorant. 

And to the young man being berated in front of everyone within a 20ft radius, RUN!!! I don't care what you did or didn't do, you don't deserve to be treated that way! 

Note to owner - If you need to repremand an employee, you need to do it behind closed doors. Furthermore, there is no need to complain to everyone that will listen, or HAS to listen prior to even speaking with him! 

Bad, bad, bad. I would never try this place. It was dirty as well."}

We began ordering from Scott's after MULTIPLE issues/problems with another New York style deli restaurant in town.

{"text":"Went for breakfast this weekend, and was aghast that I've lived two miles from  Jewish deli I was unaware of...

The atmosphere is great, and the food was good too. It's all pretty heavy and not especially healthy, but great options for a variety of eaters...unless you're a vegan, but I'm not going there.

I'd definitely go back, if not for the world's most amazing food, but for the feeling you get in a Jewish deli :) I'm also hoping to try pastries on a day where I don't consume several pounds of food..."}
{"text":"We saw this place feature on a TV show, they featured the Corn Beef Hash as one of the best, so for breakfast I ordered Eggs and Hash, it was very good, crispy and moist at the same time, not too salty or greasy like hash can sometimes be. My husband had the Eggs Benedict and he loved it. The place is in a strip mall, and not very fancy. Waitress was very prompt  and friendly. I would probably go back and try lunch next time, before I could really say if it would be worth a third try."}
{"text":"im not sure if this update is kosher but fuck it. i update for three reasons. 

1. brother just got back from visiting the mom in phoenix.  he went there with said mother based on my rec and loved it. his vivid descriptions of his pastrami, corned beef and chopped liver sandwich have been torturing me nightly since his return. 

2. no jewish deli in portland can touch this deli. memories of scotts + sad reality of portland deli scene= 5+ star upgrade.

3. i'm quite sure the only reason i gave it four instead of five stars initially was because of the lame name. that was rude of me. yeah, so, it does have a lame ass name. maybe only 4 jewish mothers in the 80s named their kids scott- it's a pretty goyshe name and i dont get it. but judging on the name was shallow and superficial of me.

already looking into best practices regarding chopped liver delivery methods."}
{"text":"great food.. love breakfast at Scott's Generation. Recently is has changed a bit, I think it is a staff change which has not helped the restaurants atmosphere. But don't let that stop you, order an full breakfast you will be stuff and happy!

{"text":"Pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami, pastrami.\" on rye...that's the way I judge a dood Deli, by their Pastrami Sandwhich. Well this isn't up there with Chompies (portin wise) but it sure was close. The pastrami sandwich was surprisingly good. I prefer thick, hand-carved pastrami, \"The pastrami was a perfect mix of lean and fatty portions and  and freshly carved. Definitely better than your ordinary pastrami. The pastrami here is to die for. Never in my life I imagined that pastrami, or any kind of meat for that matter, can be so succulent and juicy. It literally melts in your mouth. 

I got their Pastrami Sandwhich, my wife got their reuben. To go we got 6 bagels, lox spread, chopped liver, herring in sour cream sauce and some pickels.  

What's good here, the answer is everything As for the desserts ... The massive slabs of Cheeese Cake was moist and ridiculously good (and ridiculously big)

FOOD:  Unbelievably lean and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of my sandwich. oh and their pickles..... don't even get me STARTED they were  exactly how grandma used to make them and the pickles just topped it off. PRICE: Although the prices are a bit high you will definitely have leftovers for lunch the next day. CONCLUSION:  The portions sizes are very generous,  especially for the price! I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best corn beef hash in town. The corn beef is grilled mixed with peppers and onions with two eggs on top, side of H Ground and Choice of bread (do the bagels).   At $11 it's a great deal!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had time to try more of their food.....

Chopped liver bagel is great, and i love their pickles. 

Friendly staff, fast service. lots of room."}
{"text":"Excellent food! You have to come here and try this place...you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!  Seriously you gotta try it"}
{"text":"The corned beef hash is always really good and they sell lunch meat by the pound I mean good lunch meat by the pound the chicken noodle soup is so good and all the waiters and waitresses are great a definite must go"}
{"text":"This place is the worst.  Terrible service.  You have to battle to get peoples' attention even to be given a table.  Then they never come by to refill coffee.  Horrible food. My wife ordered an omelette and it came with slices of American cheese on top.  Looked and tasted disgusting.  It's a shame there isn't a Chompie's or Goldman's nearby."}
{"text":"While searching for a place open for New Year's Day during the late morning/early afternoon, we discovered that Scott's Generations was serving people still and decided to stop by.  A couple other times we have tried to go it has unfortunately been closed, but lucked out yesterday.

The location is a little hidden in the corner and unless you were looking for it, probably would just drive on by.  I ordered breakfast and my friend had a sandwich.  The mix of people in the establishment varied a lot in age group and the decor is quite eclectic.  I have been in search for a good Jewish deli place since I have left Chicago and have yet to find one to replace my favorite still back at home, but for now, this will suffice.

The portions of my corned beef hash were very generous, but the eggs were a little overdone.  My friend's club sandwich on sourdough was gigantic and was served with a decent sized pickle and plenty of home fries.  The fries themselves were a little bland and could've used seasoning, but I suppose that's what the salt, pepper, and/or ketchup on the table is for.  The sandwich itself he said was good, but nothing special.  

I will have to go back and try some of their other fare, but have tried the soups and corned beef in the past.  The soups are okay - I've tried the matzo ball and kreplach.  The stock could use a bit more depth instead of mere salt, but the corned beef is delicious.  I have also picked up bagels and the nova lox is quite yummy.  

If you're in search for a place with standard Jewish deli fare, this may be the best you're going to find around here (at least from what I've read), but honestly I still miss the places in Chicago or New York a lot!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and long wait times cannot  make up for decent food.  My dad loved the old place and we were excited to see it move to a clean updated location. We've been twice and both times service and wait time for food was over 40 minutes. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I think this can give the Jewish delis of NYC a run for their money. The place itself is clean and spacious, and the comfortable booths were just right for the mini-UYE with Rand H., Mike C., and Robyn N. I ordered a half pastrami sandwich and a bowl of kreplach soup; these came with sides of coleslaw and pickle spears. A plate of bagel chips was also served with the soup. The pastrami sandwich was superb and overstuffed like it should be; really tasty - I thought I should have ordered a whole sandwich instead of a half. The kreplach was good; tasty and hearty, and a bowl could have been a meal. I really have to come back here to try other stuff, such as belly lox ... but return visits won't be too frequent for me, only because the food is quite pricey. The half sandwich, bowl of soup, and coffee cost close to 15 bucks."}
{"text":"Original review: 24AUG2010:
Love Scott's!!! Just had the corned beef hash after my root canal...Still enjoyed it chewing on the left side...Been coming to Scott's for years!!!  Never leave hungry!!! From breakfast to lunch, the soups are fabulous and the sandwiches you can feed 2-3 people!!!"}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo Sandwich is the way to go when you order here. It's huge! So be sure to have an appetite or bring a friend to share. This deli style restaurant is laid back and casual. I feel like I'm eating in a deli in the heart of New York City. I have fond memories of dining with my mom here. The service is easy and quick and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Place is quiet at 6.00 am . Need updating , seats are weathered.the potions are large . Food is decent , service ice is a little  slow . Location is convenient"}
{"text":"Scott's Generations? Never again. I've been wanting to try Scott's for years. I love deli, and I was very disappointed by the food, service and overall experience I had at Scott's today. 

During the end of the lunch rush Scott's was empty. That should have been a sign. The restaurant was filthy. The temperature was hot and sticky despite having the the door open (it was about 72 in phoenix today.)

The booths had exposed cushioning, tables hadn't been cleared or cleaned and the floor looked like something that belonged in an episode of kitchen nightmares. Ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part. 

My friend and I finally found a clean-ish booth and sat down. Our table was dirty, and when the waitress came by I had to ask her to wipe it off even though there were visible crumbs and our menus were sticky. She acted like it had never occurred to her to clean a table off before. She actually tilted her head when I asked her to do so, as if she had been confused by the request. We should have just left. 

We ordered our food. I got a pathetic bowl of matzo ball soup, my friend a sad looking chicken noodle. I had one very tiny measly looking matzo ball, and the veggies had been cooked to death. There were chicken bones in my soup. The flavor tasted like it had been seasoned with a generic version of Stouffer's dressing mix. 

I ordered a lean pastrami and asked for it to go. It came to our table without fries  accompanied by the saddest, wilted coleslaw. It was not prepared to go. The pastrami was fatty (despite the menu bragging about how they don't charge extra for lean) The pickles were great, and house made. The pickles were the only bright spot of the meal. 

My friend asked if they had soda by the bottle, the waitress forgot that they carried Dr Brown's (a deli staple) and I had to jog her memory. She forgot the request twice and after being reminded twice she finally brought the soda.

By this point I was so over it I just wanted to leave. I asked for a box, she over charged us, I didn't give a flying fig about that and over paid just to be able to leave. 

Six hours later my stomach is upset. I won't be returning. I may be calling the health inspector. Like many generational things, I hope Scott's gets left in the past."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and always happy with the food and service. The last time we went everything was off, very dry meat which has never happened before. SO this will not keep me away as it must have been an off day."}
{"text":"I am giving an extra point for kind service and a generally clean and pleasing environment. That said, the place may need a new cook or new recipes. The food is pretty bad. We ordered a tuna melt that was swimming in mayo with overly hard, grilled rye bread. It was just a nasty sandwich. And their coleslaw was the same - swimming in mayo. What's the deal with the mayo? I had their food earlier and the experience was the same. The restaurant was not that busy. The woman at the front were very nice and attentive, but they can't overcome pretty bad food.  Maybe we've ordered the wrong menu items, but this was our experience...."}
{"text":"Living in Midtown Phoenix we have a lot of trendy breakfast stops that offer top notch meals, but with those top notch meals comes higher prices and long waits. Some days you just want cheap eggs and pancakes without a ton of effort. Scott's Generations is my go to for these days. I love walking in and automatically getting the feeling that you're in a mom and pop diner straight out of a Seinfeld episode (they sell black and white cookies!) The service is always friendly and fast. The food's not the best in town, but sometimes basic pancakes and eggs is all you want and they do it well. But don't expect to have fancy pancakes with lots of add ins like other nearby pancake places. So if a basic breakfast or lunch is what you're looking for, I would definitely come here."}
{"text":"Recently ate lunch at Scott's and being from the NY/NJ metro area, I know good deli and I can honestly say Scotts can give any deli in NY & NJ a run for their money! The pastrami and corned beef sandwich with chopped liver was mouthwatering and the fries were divine! Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. Sadly didn't have enough room for dessert but will be saving room the next time I go back! They have a nice outdoor space and a large dining room. Can't wait to go back and indulge in more and feel like I'm back east!"}
{"text":"The Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated and I went here for lunch today, and as we'd experienced separately in the past - the food was great!

Based on the foods he's disgusted by, I didn't order what I was in the mood for - had he seen it, he may not have been able to eat at all. So I went with the New Yorker (corned beef, pastrami, slaw and Russian dressing) on rye with the slaw on the side. He had the Black Forest (turkey, corned beef, grilled onions and Swiss.)
Both are served with pickles (I believe house-made) and fries. The bread is great, the meat quality is great - and as we both packed half a sandwich and most of the fries into boxes for another meal, we were reminded that maybe next time we should just share a sandwich.

Like all good delis - the portions are HUGE. And like all good Jewish delis - the service is subpar, the decor is hopelessly dated, the prices are definitely fair for the quality and quantity, and something about it just feels like \"home.\"

I made a mistake though. I ordered coffee instead of a chocolate egg cream. Too few places make a decent egg cream  - and I missed my opportunity. Then again, that's a good excuse to have to go back soon! (As if I needed one!)"}
{"text":"Holy cow! The Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben Sandwich is an accurate portrayal of perfection! I got it with corned beef and pastrami, with sauerkraut and Swiss cheese, grilled excellently on rye bread. 

This is the perfect place in Phoenix to grab a quick bite while you are doing some grocery shopping (or clothing shopping at the Buffalo Exchange a few stores down) and the price is very reasonable here. It came with fries, cole slaw and wedged pickles.

It definitely reminded me of what you'd find at Kat's Deli and Second Ave Deli in NYC!"}
{"text":"Oy! A real New York deli restaurant in Phoenix! We came in for breakfast on recommendation from my sister and will definitely make this our go to place when in town. I had the Monte Cristo sandwich, huge, full of all the goodies, turkey, ham, cheese, heaven between two slices of thick bread! Right brain had a simple egg breakfast, bagels, yes, BAGELS! We all had something different but brought food home -portions HUGE. Anything your heart desires in kosher is on the menu, again heavenly!
Come, satisfy your deli need, be full, be happy! Repeat as needed!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here on a Sunday for the first time and expecting the food to be delicious. Well obviously when I arrived you were seated promptly and ordered our food. I ordered the matzo ball soup and it was totally disgusting and incorrectly made. It was tasteless, small and dry so I decided to order the borscht and unfortunately guess what it comes out of a glass jar from the supermarket with hardly any beats in it, just beat liquid, what a waste. For the main course I ordered the smoke platter which consisted of nova lox, smoked fish and sturgeon.
The nova lox was dry was not oily sturgeon was dried out I have to say I was pretty disappointed with this location and I had better. Goldman's Delicatessen is much better and no not Chompies that place is a rip-off. JJ's Delicatessen along with New York Bagel & Bialy those places are much better."}
{"text":"If there was no other reason to go to Scott's, go for there bialy's and the take home.  I still have no idea what a real jewish deli should be but this has got to be close to it from what I've seen of it over the years. (Need to go to New York and try a few there to find out, I guess.)  Go early for the bialy's. or ask them to hold some for you.  They run out fast.  This place grows on you."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast and lunch.  Large portions, so be hungry, split or take some home. New location is great."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite among my boyfriend's family and it's definitely become a favorite of mine. We try to make it a point to go here for breakfast at least once a month. Their bagels are the best in Phoenix! They put the toppings not only on the top, but on the bottom of the bagel, so no matter what side you eat, you're getting topping goodness. The service can be slow, but it always ends up being worth it."}
{"text":"Came here cause of the Entertainment Book coupon, they no longer take it. Regardless we enjoyed the New Yorker, and hot pastrami sandwiches on rye. Both were huge and tasty, cole slaw very good french fries excellent and pickles delicious. Check out my sandwich and the large half of each sandwich which we had for dinner. My opinion they are bettrr than Chompies."}
{"text":"So far I have been here about 3-5 time within the last 6 months. And I have to say I keep coming back because the food is amazing and the staff are great. They have a large menus of sorts I seem to stay in the breakfast area. But I have brought many people on over here to try a great place for food and experience."}
{"text":"My part Jewish friend has been raving about this deli so come payday we went to check it out. Ive been in Phoenix a little over a month and have been getting sick from the food here...diarrhea lots, shit my pants once... anyway, i like to eat in divey non-american cuisine. This place aint seedy enough for me, I suppose.

I did not get ill from the food here

However....

 $12.95 for a sandwich, fries, and a dollop of soggy coleslaw ???

I kept hearing from my friend, his mom and the waitress that the sandys are HUGE.
nope.

Thought we might split one.
nope.

My sandwich was flavorless..err..thats a lie.. it tasted like stale bread.

$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!). I only had $40 (only ?)

Left the waitress $5.

Gave my friend the other $5 to put toward a plane ticket to New York where he might experience Kosher (and a bit of his heritage) on a more realistic scale.

..the fries were good tho."}
{"text":"Nice place. Food was very bland.  The pastrami was chewy. Fries not worth it. The service was good. The restaurant was not noisy."}
{"text":"I went in for a bagel and let me tell you their veggie cream cheese is to die for ! Super good !!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Monte Christo sandwich. Now I've had Monti Cristos in many locations and this is the only one that was not really a Monte Cristo. Basically it was a ham and turkey sandwich that was fried. No egg wash no nothing.  No preserves or jelly and the potatoes served with it were rock hard. The service sucked big time."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service.

Loved the potato latkes for breakfast.  And the bagel!  Mmmm... I'm a carb girl."}
{"text":"Best pastrami Reuben on the planet! The corned beef one was just as good but that pastrami is still on my brain. Def gotta taste it in your lifetime!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've had both the Scottwich and the Philly Cheesesteak, both are great- but the Scottwich is to die for! I also loved their Linzer cookies...yum!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I found this place! I've always been into the deli scene, but had never heard of this place. Coincidentally, I had recently watched Man vs. Food and When Harry Met Sally, both of which were filmed (at one point in time) at Katz's in NYC. At this point something deep inside of me craved top-notch pastrami or corned beef. 

The next thing I know I'm browsing stores in a strip and come across Scott's. I had a very tough time deciding but I went with the Reuben; not just any Reuben though, but a combination with pastrami and corned beef. I truly feel that I could not have made a better choice for my first visit because it was one epic Reuben. It was unbelievably rich and juicy. The meats worked extremely well together, especially when accompanied by the Russian dressing. Combined with fries, pickles and slaw, this was a meal fit for a Jewish king (oh, and the server was great; really relaxed and accommodating)!

Since reading reviews here on Yelp, I'll probably come visit again the next time I'm awake on the weekend early enough for breakfast. My first experience here was pretty astounding compared to most places; I even got free bagels on the way out the door! Go to this place and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Disappointing deli. The place just seemed dirty. Has the menu been replaced in a decade? No Kreplach. The chicken broth in the matzoh ball soup was of poor flavor and dilute. My daughter wouldn't even eat it.

The tuna and egg salads were pretty good but we did not get the sides that were advertised with the dishes and the tomato in which the tuna was stuffed was hard and flavor-less. The waitress must have made 20 trips to get us everything in our order and we didn't request any substitutions.

This is not a kosher-style deli either. Plenty of bacon and ham on the menu.

I would have given this a 1-star but other ratings indicated that some of the meatier items were satisfactory and I did not get a chance to try those. Unfortunately, I won't since I'm unlikely to return."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see this place being from Detroit.  It's like a mom and pop back east!  The food was great!  Loved the food selections.  Waitress was a nice lady.  All the stuff behind the deli counter looked delish!  I will come back for bagels next time my work has an event.  They looked really good!  I had the pastrami, coleslaw and a pickle.  Sooo good!  Not super salty like cheap pastrami!  Go here!"}
{"text":"We have had this deli on our list of Food Network places so thought we'd come in for lunch. Aside from the old decor, dirty walls, dusty picture frames everywhere, and blurry TV's, we hoped for delicious food. My husband ordered the corned beef and pastrami sandwich and I ordered the corned beef hash scramble with a bagel and cream cheese. The corned beef was wonderful but so overcooked in my scramble. Tough little bits of meat in the way overcooked eggs. I had to add salt and pepper and it was still tough and bland. SAD! The bagel was over toasted and tough. The sandwich on rye was very GOOD but his home fries were so overcooked, they were tough and inedible. 
Our waitress was a wonderful, very old woman who took great care of us!
Overall, we will not come back and feel so sad. We prefer to patronize local businesses but will cross this one off our list. :-("}
{"text":"I ordered an omelet with ham, peppers, onions, and cheese. The omelet was decent but a little greasy - and could have used some thicker chunks of ham. The side of potatoes and challah toast were pretty good.

Service was good, and it seems like a nice enough place. I may be back next time I'm looking for an early nearby breakfast."}
{"text":"well i stick to 4 stars for lunch all though that was my 1st time but the wife and i went for  breakfast last sunday morn. after the traditional being ignored for the first 8 minutes( BECAUSE WERE A NEW YORK STYLED DELI AND THATS THE WAY THEY DO IT IN NEW YORK) we sat down at a nice sized comfy booth our server a very nice older gal came and took our order cornbeef hash/breakfast burrito for the wife the cbh was fair (black bear diner has better and thats sad) burrito ok not great . there was 1 employ maybe a owner behind the counter defenitly from ny.........who cares .....sneezing, blowing his nose and then continuing to make the deli tray he was working on w/out washin his hands oh and then rubbing his nose with his finger as well lucky our meals were coming out of the kitchen and not from the front of the house where the 45 yo child does'nt know he needs to wash his hands when he blows his nose and is working w/food"}
{"text":"Well thought I'd try it and probably won't be back. $15 for a roast beef sandwich when Tony's up the street has far superior meat quality and larger sandwich for $7. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment for breakfast. Ordered the skillet with chorizo and cheese. Not a skillet, more like scrambled eggs with chorizo, folded omelette style. Then topped off with two slices of Kraft American cheese. The slices were still square. The breakfast potatoes were mushy in a bad way. 

With all the breakfast options in this area you'd think this would be better."}
{"text":"Size of the pastrami sandwiches I'm used to from the east coast!
 And you can get knishes!"}
{"text":"I'm going to do something I've never done before with this review. I'm going to actually review while eating the food for the very first time. That's right, I just got home from Scott's Generation after waking up on a girlfriend's couch with a brutal hangover and a huge craving for matzo ball soup and chopped liver. I picked up a to-go order, and they're sitting in front of me right now, eagerly awaiting my noshing session.

Right now, Scott's Generation is happily sitting at 5 stars. The employee handling my to-go order was awesome and seemed amused at my hangover remedy. Despite the fact that I love challah like a brother and could eat chopped liver for breakfast lunch and dinner, my parents insist I am not of Jewish heritage. However, there's never been an official paternity test, so I'm still holding out hope. On to the food!

The soup is fantastic! Lots of chunky veggies and chicken in a very tasty broth. The matzo balls are large with good texture. I would prefer a bit more seasoning, but I won't deduct a star because for all I know I'm just an Italian schmuck who doesn't know what a true matzo ball should taste like. But yeah, seasoning is good.

Opening my bagel chips and...wtf? Is that a cinnamon raisin bagel chip! Sorry, deducting a star. Bagel chips are for soups and spreads. I don't care who you are, nobody wants a raisin in their soup. Throw them out!  Eating the chopped liver and....giving the star back! It's delicious and I haven't even mixed in any onion!  I don't think I realized how dense a half pound of chopped liver would be, I kind of wish I would have got some rye for a sandwich. Sorry, internal monologue creeping into review, I'll stop that now.

Five stars for my first ever present-tense review! I can't wait to go back to Scott's to try the rest of their (very large) menu! Though for this trip, I'm glad I got out when I did. I was half drunk and the rainbow cookies were calling my name. I'll sober up first next time."}
{"text":"I should have followed my instinct to leave after seeing that page after page of the book-like laminated menus were caked with dried condiments and mystery foods.  Really gross!!!  

The chicken broth in the chicken noodle and matzoh ball soups was too thin and the matzoh ball was awful. -- small, hard, and with an off taste.  Deli sandwiches were OK.   Waitress was very nice.

Sorry to say that will be both my first and last time dining there."}
{"text":"I have to say that Scott's is simply the real thing as far as Jewish style deli's in Phoenix.  I ordered the corn beef and matza ball soup.  It was quite delicious.  The atmosphere is one of a deli with both intimate and group seating available.

The service is excellent with an extensive menu.  

Enjoy........"}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich ever! I may be biased because 1) I love bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches on a fresh made everything bagel almost more than life itself and 2) any legit east coast, Jewish deli, complete with that East Coast attitude makes me feel like home... But seriously, their bagels are amazing, they fry their eggs to order perfectly (easy, medium, hard), and the cheese is a perfect consistency every time! I've also had their brisket sandwich and their pastrami - both of which do not disappoint in any way shape or form. 

Scott's is definitely my go to when I want a little taste of the East Coast!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced.  There sub should be priced at 6.50 tops.  It's just okay at best.  Their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt.  The worse part about it was that my buddy wanted to go somewhere else but we went to this place on my suggestion.  Fortunately, there was no rift caused in our friendship."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally tried this.  It was nice inside and friendly employees.  My husband got the chicken salad on white bread and did not like it.  Said it was just chicken and mayo.  However,  my Scottwich was so wonderful that I still gave 5 stars. That was hands down some of the most incredible pastrami I've ever had!!! There was so much I couldn't actually bite the full sandwich so I took half off and saving it for lunch tomorrow. Whatever the garlic rye they used is out of this world."}
{"text":"The New Yorker is delicious and huge I couldn't finish it. Absolutely love this place it's definitely going to be one of my new favorites. The lady who took my order was so sweet great customer service is always a plus."}

{"text":"Scott's Generations Restaurant & Delicatessen is New York Style Jewish type of deli and is well known for serving  over sized deli sandwiches and breakfast all day. They are NOT KOSHER but Jewish style. They also offer deli take items. One of the things that sets this New York Style Deli Restaurant above the others is the selection of smoked fish they offer. I'm not aware of any similar restaurants that offer really expensive Sturgeon or Sable smoked fish. They also offer the better tasting hard-to come-by Belly Lox and a few other fish you don't find at other restaurants.

One of my favorite plates to get here is the Smoked Fish Platter. They say it serves one person but I get two meals out of it. It comes with delicious crisp deli pickle spears, some veggies, a correct size bagel, cream cheese, potato salad, cole slaw and three selections of smoked fish. I really like it and I can't get it anywhere else!

Most of the time the Pastrami is better tasting than from many of the other New York Style restaurants. Usually it's that just right seasoning and seems the most similar to an east coast taste, not too much smoke with extra black pepper and is very tasty. Also not too lean and not too fatty....and you have to get it on that double cooked Rye Bread. I did notice that once in a blue moon they do get in an off batch that is not as flavorful but still better than from an average sandwich shop that uses Boars Head Brand.

I've tried the knish....it's good and  better tasting than from an other popular spot...but not the kind that is east cost bakery rom my memory...........I do like it  since it's better than from another spot. but I's not my memory.

Service is usually quick and efficient.

This new location is bright, shiny and clean looking."}
{"text":"After you watch the movie \"Deli Man\" you will have a new appreciation and an unbelievable hunger for Deli Food.

The last 4 delis i've been to didn't make the cut for pastrami & fish.

Scott's decor is a little old and tired but the restaurant earned a current grade \"A\" Maricopa Health Inspection.

When I looked at the menu I saw many items I haven't seen on other deli menus including a very large selection of smoked fish.

I ordered the smoked fish supreme platter. I got fresh hand carved Nova Scotia, White Fish and Lake Sturgeon that came with many sides and a bagel. They do have belly lox on the menu but were out of it. The hand carved Nova was very good and maybe the best you can find anywhere. The white fish was outstanding. You can't find better anywhere. I thought the sturgeon was good but I don't have much exsperience eating sturgeon because it's normally about $70.00 a pound so I haven't eaten that much. The potato salad and the cole slaw had good flavors but were a little drippy. The pickle was really great and above average. The everything bagel was really different but good. It was almost like a very oniony onion bagel with also with the everything toppings and was really packed with flavor. My platter was very large and I took enough home for another meal.

My husband ordered a triple decker sandwich with turkey pastrami and corned beef. The turkey tasted like fresh roasted. The corned beef was good. The pastrami taste very similar to what regular pastrami taste like back east. It had the right amount of fat and the correct flavors. The sandwich platter came with a mountain of crispy fries that might have been fresh cut red potatoes with several tasty pickles and fresh coleslaw.

After I watched the movie \"Deli Man\" I learned that Deli's have the highest food cost of all restaurants because they sell mostly meat so it isn't the cheapest food because it can't be.  But really the thing that struck me the most was that there are no more immigrants that bring over the recipes. 

From what I tried already Scott's Food is very Good and I don't feel the need to look for another deli.

See the \"Deli Man\" Movie and support a Deli!"}
{"text":"A Jewish girl walks into a (oh, wait, I am writing a restaurant review and not a J.A.P. joke)....

When Scott's first opened many years ago, it was really good and had a lot more competition than it does now. In those days, there was Katz Deli, several Miracle Mile locations, Chompie's and a few other ill fated places (anyone remember Hollywood Deli?). I currently live in one of the best food meccas of the West Coast and can't get really good Jewish deli (Saul's is not great folks, and no, I have not tried Miller's yet). 

When Mom and Grandma picked me up from the airport, I had suggested we stop at Scott's to give them a try on the way to Sun City. None of us had been there in several years and I was really excited at a prospect for a delicious hot pastrami sandwich on rye. We got there, walked in and I noticed that the place itself looked a bit run down and dare I say, a little dirty? The owners are the same but the guy behind the counter who used to be friendly and Hamish just sat there like a schlub. We were directed to a table, and I immediately noticed how large their menu was. I ordered my sandwich sadly assuming that my regular hot pastrami would be (a) HOT and (b) on Karsh's rye since Karsh's is right next door. Neither was the case when my sandwich arrived and the pastrami was not delicious and I asked the waitress if I was mistakenly given the \"lean\" type of pastrami and she said I was not. Mom had a tongue sandwich and thought it was \"okay\" but she is not as picky (bitchy) as I am and Grandma had blintzes which did not look homemade but that of the frozen variety (I hope I am wrong here). Service was fair. Not warm and not quite the NY attitude that passes in these types of establishments.

After our experience I will no longer suggest Scott's and will have them drive directly to Chompie's."}
{"text":"This place is not good at all. We had horrible service the entire time we were there and it wasn't very busy. It took forever to get our food. Our waitress asked me if I wanted sour cream with the potato pancake, I said I did. Then she brought it without sour cream. It took another ten minutes to get the sour cream and I had to ask three different people for it before I finally got it. She then brought me the wrong sandwich and then it took another 20 minutes to get the correct one. 

I didn't think a deli could mess up a Reuben sandwich but they did. The pastrami was literally flavorless. Honestly the Reuben at Arby's has more flavor. The only good thing we had was the potato pancake.

We saw this place on Check Please Arizona and thought we'd give it try, we will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is unreal.  I was in Phoenix for the weekend and had memories of hanging out with my friend Scott who used to live here.  I got on yelp to find a breakfast place and Scott's popped up.  This is as old school as it gets outside of the Northeast.  The waittresses are awesome, the food is amazing and I really can't say anything that hasn't already been said.

I don't make it to Phoenix much, but anytime I'm in town I'll be visiting Scott's."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch options.  I appreciate having a quality deli here in the central phoenix area."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's the closest thing to a New York Deli that you will find in Arizona. The food is very good and the portions are large. I'm not a huge dessert person but the cheesecake is a MUST try. Best cheesecake I have ever had, compares to eating cheesecake straight from New York. A+"}
{"text":"What gives.  I was there for 5 minutes while waiters just pass my by.  Just had to leave.  Maybe it's just profiling."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the breakfast although I'd like to come back for lunch as the deli seemed great.  I had the Kelly's \"American\" toast which is french toast made with challah, and a side of bacon.  The french toast was too much for even my heavyweight appetite to consume.  It was very tasty, richer and chewier because of the challah.  The bacon was thick, high-quality meaty bacon.  Not a fan of the orange juice, definitely from concentrate.  Also, I don't care for eating on or drinking from plastic as you do here.  I'm not a germaphobe, but it seems like it wouldn't get as clean.  

Very casual, seat yourself.  Don't be put off if you walk in and don't see any tables by the deli.  Look to your right.  There's a whole other room where we found plenty of seating.  We enjoyed looking at some of the photos on the wall, all taken in New York.  Would come again if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing. I have eaten a lot of Reuben sandwiches...this was the best I've had outside of NYC. Loaded with juicy corned beef,  served with hand cut fries, and arguably the best cole slaw I've had anywhere and I'm from the south. A couple of my friends also had great sandwiches that we all kept ooohing and ahhhing over. I've eaten at chompie's, and this place is much better quality for the money. Also, they have house made pickles that are very tasty. I can't wait to go back, and bring my  hubby. My only complaint is that they aren't open later than 5!"}
{"text":"From the time I walked in, after a 14 hour shift as a cardiac nurse, to the time I left, there was not a single smile or  \"good morning\". I went to get coffee from Tres Leches Cafe next door and then to grab some food from the deli on the way out. I bought a breakfast burrito and a vegetable omelet and paid $18. The only thing positive about the experience was the amazing coffee next door. Even the owner/manager barely looked up to smile or greet a customer. Just really strange customer service--almost like they didn't want the business. By the time my friend and I finally sat down to eat, we both agreed it was basic, mediocre food. I will not be going back to them anytime soon."}
{"text":"Our family wanted to thank Tony for providing a Great Passover meal for a single Dad with kids. Everyone was very happy and filled. Love you guys.."}
{"text":"This place is a rathole.  Dirty, filthy floors and counters.  Slow service, not worth the effort to stop."}
{"text":"I get into these wild food moods where Ill wake up and have a craving for something, its usually pretty specific, this particular morning it was corned beef. Sounds crazy but once I get it in my head I wont be satisfied until I give into my cravings. I wasn't hungry though for just any corned beef, it had to be Boar's Head brand, aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get Boar's Head is a good delicatessen. I knew just where to go, Scott's!

Situated between an Ace Hardware and a Basha's, this seems hardly the spot for a tasty sandwich. Let me tell you, they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices. Feeling helpless and at complete mercy to my urges I ordered Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben ($11.50). So tall you cant get your mouth around it, its stuffed with corned beef, swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness.

When the server set my sandwich in front of me my eyes widened, it was a thing of beauty and desire. As I managed my sandwich for the first bite, I felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning, eat me, eat me. Enjoying bite after satisfying bite, my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy. Ordering a side of Russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip I think you'll agree, its perfectly natural.

For the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices, Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads, soup and half sandwiches. However, I for one don't go to Scott's to eat light, I go to Scott's eat well."}
{"text":"I understand that Inspectors found 20 cockroaches under the sink at Scott's Generations. Lovely"}
{"text":"Well, we went back for a 2nd time, & this will be the last time we go to Scott's Deli.... It was over 100 degrees today and the AC was not working...It was VERY warm in the restaurant which made our dining experience pretty miserable.  They had all of their ceiling fans on at full blast in the backroom which dried up my contact lenses & our napkins would keep flying off the table. We got the Greek Omellete and the cucumbers in it were bitter...had to take them all out. The waiter never even said 'I'm sorry\"......
 I am from LA and there are faaar better Deli's there than here in Phoenix! 
This deli was pretty average, nothing like Jerry's Deli, or Canter's Deli in LA....NOW we're talkin'!  
On a side note, I am so sick & tired of ALWAYS seeing sports on TV's in restaurants! ...Okay for sports bars, or maybe Applebee's, but it is like everywhere you go! It would be refreshing to actually see a movie playing on a TV at a restaurant....Something that the whole family can enjoy watching, just saying. :)"}
{"text":"Setting right next to a kosher bakery you gotta try the deli next door!  Super Ruben and nice people!  Toss-up whether its better then Chompies but nonetheless it holds its own in a niche market in Phoenix!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast it is nice to have something that reminds me of home!  Great food and a little attitude! lol  Bagels are really good and one of the only places I know of in Phoenix to get a good knish!  The deli sandwiches are stacked with high quality meat!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. The French fries are something you are going to want to pass on."}
{"text":"I am recently recovered from a cold. It started in my head and has moved to my chest. While the cough has held on, I credit Scott's Generations (and Nyquil) for the bulk of my speedy recovery!

There's nothing like a flavorful broth and your choice of noodle, rice, matzo ball, or (my choice) kreplach for a miracle cure. A full quart'll set you back around $8. 

Even better: you don't have to be sick to enjoy this place. 

I also like Scott's for breakfast. Excellent corned beef hash. Plus, the whole diner feel and a good, chewy bagel has the potential to transport you to parts East."}
{"text":"Though the corn beef was lean and so delicious. The rye bread was stale. Ugh hope this will not be the case going forward. No one came and asked how the food was during our meal. Will give them one more chance. Cause that corn beef is great"}
{"text":"Don't get between me and the smoked fish platter. This out of date deli with its oversized booths and the ancient wait staff is the best. There isn't a thing on the menu I haven't enjoyed and then spent the next week trying to burn off. My last visit for brunch caused me to calorie restrict for the rest of the day and most of the next. If Scott's were the only restaurant I could go to, I would be a happy, sated, fat man."}
{"text":"Scott's Generations Restaurant & Deli is probably the best delicatessen in the Phoenix market!  They are conveniently located at North 7th Street and Missouri and a strip center with an Ace Hardware and Basha's.

I met some Yelper's friends, Rand H., Robyn N., and Mike C. for a UYE some weeks ago here for lunch.  The restaurant is bigger than what it looks like from the outside.  It's a very clean place with plenty of celeb pics on walls from their prior visits to Scott's.  

The service was very good.  Our server was exceptional at keeping our drinks filled and serving.  

I had a hot pastrami on rye with a side or potato salad and coleslaw.  The pastrami sandwich was HUGE and it rated a 7 on a 1-5 scale for taste!!  I bet it weighed over 1lb by it's self.  It was full of pastrami-goodness with a hint of dressing that tasted fantastic!  It was one of the best pastrami sandwiches I've had.  The potato salad was not the same \"rock star\" status with a somewhat bland taste and it was too runny.  The coleslaw was not bad but not great and it played a better accompaniment to the delicious pastrami sandwich which was the \"rock star\".  I topped it off with a huge glass of iced tea and I was full for two days afterwards :-)

If you're looking for a really good deli, this is the place!  I look forward to visiting Scott's Generations again soon and try their smoke white fish or belly lox.  I will probably take some pastrami to go ~ it's that good.  I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week with Rand H, Mike C and Norm R after wanting to try this place since I moved to AZ a year and a half ago.  I've been missing my favorite Chicago deli and have been craving some good Jew food and I finally found it!  

For lunch I had a brisket sandwich on an onion roll with a side of kishke with gravy. It was excellent!  The beef was tender, flavorful and not dry, and the kishke was sliced,browned and skinless.  This is what I've been waiting for.  

While at our table we had a great view of the deli cases and menu boards and I knew I would have to order some food to go for my Mom and for me.  I ordered the Mish mosh soup and that was just okay - the matzo ball was grainy, the kreplach was mostly dough and there was only one of each and no kasha like I'm used to when I order this soup back home.  The chopped liver was good, my Mom and her husband liked it a lot, but I think Don and Charlie's has the best chopped liver in the Phoenix area.  The best thing I brought home was the belly lox!  If I'm going to eat lox, it's going to be the real thing and taste like lox - not the tasteless nova lox that's served to the masses.  It was wonderful and salty and full of flavor and I have enough left for a sandwich tomorrow morning :)

Overall this is the closes to a real Jewish Deli I've been to here in AZ - and I will for sure be back and try the corned beef/pastrami and potato pancakes next time!"}
{"text":"didn't hear from them from my email...bad service, non attentive
wrong items . quality of their food...bottom of the barrel for a Jewish
Deli...wont return"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with a friend. I had the Reuben which was excellent. My friend had the Philly cheesesteak which was so big he took half of it home. The French fries were real fat, crispy and made from real potatoes not frozen junk. I normally don't eat French fries but I cleared my plate of these. On my way out I bought some smoked whitefish and a kasha knish which I had for breakfast the next day and was excellent."}
{"text":"I tried the corned beef on rye. Comes with a pickle and slaw.  The meat was piled high and deliciously tender. The pickle was half sour(how'd they know that's my favorite). The slaw was perfect. I really enjoyed my lunch and was even saddened when it was over-lol!  Can't wait to get back"}
{"text":"Being that I am from the east coast and lived in NYC for many years, this is the first time in 4 years living in AZ I felt like I have tasted home.  The chopped liver, pastrami, and corn beef on the same level as the old Carnegie deli. Fries and pickles are superb. Having national mustard is clutch as well. My only issue and it is minor is the rye bread is good but just not that super soft Jewish rye you get in the city, the rest of the meal makes up for the small glitch in the rye bread which I think is an impossible ask unless you bring in the NYC tap water. We will be coming back frequently!"}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood, I've been to Scott's maybe three times. The food is pretty good admittedly but I can never get past the prices or the awful service. You would think that you get your sandwich wrapped in gold leaf.

Miracle Mile deli is good and more reasonable, and frankly I'd rather drive the extra mile. No pun intended. Scott's does not give me ANY reason to return. The service is atrocious. I once stood at the counter for almost 5 minutes before being acknowledged. They should pack up and move back to NY where people are ok being treated like jerks for walking in the door."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast Place Ever!  We wish we lived in Phoenix.  Doesn't look like much when you walk in but boy-oh-boy, we loved it!!  

Got to check it out.  We can't wait to come back to Pheonix.  My hubby is still raving about it, 6 months later."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today. I had the Scottwich. The sandwich was great. The only complaint was that the service was a little slow. I will be back to try the Reuben."}
{"text":"4.5 stars... 
Minus a 1/2 star for the fact that I only experienced take-out and the fact that the kreplach in my soup didn't taste right.  Other than that, this is my new favorite place to get matzo ball soup.  The broth tasted just as good if not better than any I've had before.  The combination of vegetables, dill, seasoning, and fresh chicken soothed my sore throat instantly and warmed me up too!

The menu is HUGE and the cases full of knishes, bagels, rugalach, muffins, smoked fish and more were impressive for the valley.  I noted that they have a section on the menu called \"On The Liter Side\" for those that are calorie or carb conscious.  I also noticed that they'll make egg white omelettes upon request (and for an additional $1).

I'll have to return to Scott's Generations when I'm feeling better and my appetite is back to normal.  Hopefully that will be soon thanks to the soup I enjoyed today!"}
{"text":"After 10yrs in the Valley, I finally found this Little hidden Gem. I honestly have to say its was the best Jewish deli I've been to. No more Subway when I'm craving a sandwich...Its close to the Biltmore area, which is a huge plus for me because its close to home. Just like any Deli its seat yourself type of place with a deli counter for your to-go orders. I luv this spot!!

Food: 5 STARS
I ordered the Pastrami on garlic bread. It had a huge portion of meat covered with Swiss chesse and grilled onions. It also came with homemade fry's and coleslaw. I was very impressed with the size of the meal. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!

Not only do they serve sandwiches, but they had a huge menu from breakfast to entrees. Everything that passed by our table looked great.

SERVICE: 5 STARS
From the moment we walked in ..we were welcomed with a friendly greet...to the moment we were leaving they made sure everything was perfect.

Location: 5 STARS
centrally located in the valley in a nice shopping complex. Next to Ace Hardware.

PRICE: 4 STARS
 $12.50 for Huge Pastrami Sandwich/ Fries/ coleslaw. It was a big portion, but just a tad pricey for lunch price. Take $2.50 off and it would of been a 5 too.

I def will be back all the time with friends and family regardless your pricing... Thank you for the Great Lunch."}
{"text":"The breakfast was gross. Waited 25 minutes for basic breakfast. Apparently the cook doesn't know the difference between American cheese and Cheddar cheese, and has trouble following their own menu. While there, the manager/owner took a call and refused to refund an order for a to go customer who was given the wrong order. He stated he couldn't perform a refund to the credit card, which is a blatant lie, not to mention poor customer service. Should have just come in for a bagel and probably would have been satisfied."}
{"text":"A great New York Style Deli. Huge portions and very tasty food. Breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"We always enjoyed this restaurant at the old location and like the new location even more! The food is just as good, the service is good, the place feels more spacious and lighting is better! We were pleased before, even more pleased now in their new roomier and brighter digs! Will definitely be back and would highly recommend this delicatessen and restaurant to others! Good coffee too! ;)"}
{"text":"I haven't experienced such friendly and good service in such a long time. Our waitress smiled at me and was up beat the whole time (I just don't see that genuine attitude any more) in addition to great service, the breakfast I had was delicious. I had their oatmeal and a side of seasoned fruit. The oatmeal was hearty and I love that my waitress brought me a whole dish of brown sugar (ohhh yee-a). The fruit was sub-par. I got two little pieces of pineapple, and the cantaloupe and honey-due were crunchy. But I'm not too concerned about it, I ate all the fruit and this place is a deli, not a fruit hut. I'm going to come again and branch out to something new - they had a lot of good things on their menu. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a New York style deli that carries smoked whitefish.  I finally found it at Scott's Generation!  I ordered their whitefish platter.  It was everything that I expected and more! Two large pieces of extremely fresh whitefish that pretty much melted in my mouth! It came with my choice of a bagel, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles. Everything was extremely fresh! My mother had matzoh ball soup and half a corn beef sandwich both were delicious!  The corn beef was extremely lean and worth every bite! I am so excited to know that The cravings I have will be fulfilled at Scott's Generation!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry. On a few levels. Needed a breakfast place in the area yesterday and went with Yelp. This is the first time I've been disappointed. with Yelp consensus reviews. 

I love Jewish delis and have learned to \"settle\" in Phoenix. 

But I'll never settle for Eggs Benedict on a bagel with a slice of Kraft American Process Cheeselike Food Product between the deli ham and the poached egg.  Don't offer something if all you're going to do is mortally insult it's memory!

The coffee at least is the swill I grew up with B.S. [Before Starbucks} - just like I remember in Jewish delis and everywhere for that matter - but that's another rant altogether. 

Meh-be the lox is good. Meh-be the good corned beef is piled sky high. I'll probably never find out."}
{"text":"We used to go to the old place all the time. Unfortunately they've created a cookie cutter sterile establishment. They've raised their prices and it's not as homey as it used to be. The food is still great as always and the wait staff friendly. Unfortunately I missed the New York style booths and comfortableness of the old place."}
{"text":"Very good food, and great service! I ordered a deli sandwich and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of meat on my sandwich. They did skimp on the mayonnaise and sauce so I asked for extra. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Love the restaurant it's a great place great new location. A wonderful fish platter. And great prices for breakfast and no long wait for a table like most places for breakfast"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than Scott's Generations. Buh-bye Chompie's with your high prices, rude service and dirty restaurants.

My partner desperately wanted a good Jewish deli sandwich and soup. After my last experience at the local chain that offers this type of food I had to find somewhere new. Scott's Generations filled the bill.

They offer HUGE portions at reasonable prices. The restaurant is spotless and the service was the best. You cannot go wrong with Scott's Generations. Wherever you live in the valley it is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"Nice deli with booths to sit in and eat there.  They have a variety of foods from quick lunch food to full on dinners.  This place definitely has a nice deli vibe.  Very good Italian beef.  Greeted with a smile and friendly banter.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Went here when they were at their old location, but the new place is a HUGE upgrade. Nice and bright, but keeps the deli feel. The sandwiches are filled to the max with meat and the sides are plentiful. Will always come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate breakfast here last Sunday and were not disappointed. The place wasn't too busy so it was easy to walk in and grab a table. 

I ordered the hash mash which is corned beef, scrambled eggs, potatoes and cheese in a skillet. It was very filling and delicious. However they did put way too much cheese on top and after a while it become too much. I would order the hash mash again, minus the cheese.

My husband ordered pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were big and fluffy and the bacon was thick and tasty, not fatty and floppy.

I looked at the other items on the menu and everything else sounds great. Lots of deli sandwiches, soups and their desserts look very yummy.
I plan to check them out for lunch or dinner sometime as well as coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"after reading the ratings I had ethical concerns about management and even patronizing this place, but fortunately, I did not deal with that guy. The lady who took my order was very sweet and the food was fantastic! I got the corned beef hash with white toast. Hash was out of this world with lots of green pepper and onions. Very moist and flavorful. Home fries were were well  seasoned and eggs were cooked perfectly as requested, softly scrambled, which is rare. toast was perfect and I don't even like it that much but Scott's made me a believer. I got to go, but it was ready less than 2 minutes after I arrived, just as I was quoted. Hopefully they heeded the past reviews regarding treatment of their staff; I would really like to try more items with a good conscience. that really matters to me."}
{"text":"Great place to get ny style reubens and pastrami sandwiches.  Great portion reasonable price you will leave full.  They also have bagels but i havent tried them yet.  Im sure they are great."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast with a group of friends. Neat diner/deli environment. Old school...  

Service was A+. We had an outstanding waitress yet the others would check to make sure our drinks were filled on an ongoing basis. The food...  Wow!  I had the hash which was incredible!  Others at the table had French Toast, salmon, and a scramble. All were delicious. 

The only regret I have is not going to this place while I lived in Phoenix. I'm definitely going back next time in town."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Jewish deli in the Phoenix area. By weakness is bread, and there's is amazing - both their rye and challah are spot on. The only complaint I can think of is they have a habit of not salting their French fries."}
{"text":"starve yourself all day, get really baked, and then go to scotts and order one of their giant, mouth watering, tender sandwhiches.

the sandwhiches are generously loaded with so many different kinds of meat choices you're bound to find something that meets your needs. i'm a big corned beef eater, so i choose the pastrami, corned beef, and turkey sandwhich. my friend ordered the philly cheese.  both were terrific. the fries were crisp and delicious. the coleslaw was some of the best i've had. i also picked up some rugelach in every flavor- so sweet, soft, and delicious - try the chocolate raspberry, you can't go wrong.

we were the only ones in there on a saturday afternoon which was a little weird but made for an easy going dining experience. the interior is reminiscent of many jewish delis back east, with seinfeld playing on the tv and pictures of the owner's family filling the walls.

i'm a sandwhich whore and will definately be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Scott's Generations is a great deli. Generous portions of very fresh everything, arranged in your favrite traditional formats and served by friendly staff.

They should be solid four stars. 

However, they lose one star for forgetting capers on my lox plate and weak weak coffee.

I'll be back to give 'em a second go and maybe another star."}
{"text":"The new location is bigger but less appealing then the old location. I like the bagels in the baskets on the wall much better than in the case.  The food prices are higher but the quality and portions seem to be the same. As always, this is a great deli. I just wish they brought the old ambiance to the new location."}
{"text":"He-uge piles of corned beef on tasty pumpernickel or rye breads.  I had the lox platter with bagel, cream cheese, capers, onions and tomato.  The other 11 people - one had the whitefish platter (huge and tasty), spinach knish (yum), tongue and pastrami omlette (hmmm didn't try that), and many more items at the other end of the table.  No complaints from even the pickiest eaters.  Love the new pickles!  The remodel is great too.  The extra room makes a nice space for groups."}
{"text":"First off, this listing says \"Delivery\" and all over their website they advertise for delivery. I work 2 blocks away from the store so I thought it would be easy to order some breakfast. I called and was rudely put on hold before even greeted. After 5 minutes of being put on hold I requested to make a delivery order and was put on hold for another 2-3 minutes- when the lady got back on the phone she said \"I don't think the delivery driver can deliver right now\", I then asked when he will be delivering and her response was \"he doesn't feel like it right now. How far are you and I can see if he's back\". I told her I was less than 2 blocks away and she put me on about a2 minute hold until she finished the call with \"oh maybe I can't find him anymore\". ARE YOU SERIOUS? Wow. All I can say I that I will never ever attempt to eat there again, and how unprofessional to advertise all over yelp AND your website if you only delivery \"when you feel like it\". Rude, unprofessional, unorganized, unwilling and I'm sure he food would have been about as good as their customer service experience. Shit."}
{"text":"Finally moved to a place with a little more space and convenience.  I used to stop in about once every 6-8 weeks, now you can bet I'll be there weekly.  Although not a kosher deli, Scotts has always carried many kosher brands.  Find the pickles you used to get in Brooklyn, or Fox's U-Bet syrup.  I'll be stopping in later to get bagels."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I never wrote a review for Scott's Generations!  I must stop here once every couple weeks or so.  It would be more often if I was in the neighborhood more...  The have the BEST chopped liver in town.  

I'm not a big knish fan, but one of my friends is.  She drives from Surprise just to get one.  I'm a huge fan of the Reuben sandwiches.

I stop for lunch, but I never go home without a pound of chopped liver, some delicious slaw, and (real chewy) bagels.

My only beef with this place is that they close early.  I can never get here in time for dinner."}
{"text":"For the love of god and all that is holy this is a feast! So one of my fellow yelpers recommended Scott's and today I was searching for somewhere to eat. Hmmm I decided on Scott's after looking at the pics. I thought holy cow that looks fantastic! 

Beware objects are larger than they appear in the pictures! I ordered the Philly with fries. This samich was very good, the steak was tender and juicy the veggies grilled just right and the roll was perfection. I had to take away one star. Sorry Scott fans. The fries were under cooked. They are fat fries and need a little TLC mine were still very firm in the middle. 

The portion is ginormous! I couldn't finish a 4th of it! This will be a splitter next time for sure! 

I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had a very interesting dining experience at this place last week.  I haven't been there in 20 years, and having lived in LA and NY I was excited to dine at a Jewish Style Deli.
First we walked in and weren't sure if we should seat ourselves.  So we did.  The booths were all torn, but this makes it close to NY authentic.  I almost never see this in AZ.  The guy behind the counter was serving someone and we kept waiting for him to come over and take our order.  Then after about 10-15 minutes the waiter came in from the back door and came over to our table.  It would have been nice if the guy in front told us to take and seat and the waiter will be in soon.  Even better, he should alerted the waiter that there were customers.

When the waiter got to the table he wreaked of cigarette smoke.  He had an odd look on his face.  My friend ordered a coke and myself a diet coke.  When he came back he served me the regular and my friend the diet.  Then my brother asked what diet Dr Brown's sodas they have and he named a few.  My brother ordered one that the waiter just named, and the waiter said they don't have it.  When we told him he had just mentioned it he replied, \"oh yeah.\"  Then 10 seconds later he came back and asked what kind of soda did my brother want since he already forgot.  The food took a really long time to get to the table because I believe he forgot to order the food.

Being from LA, I could tell he was stoned.  My 85 year old mom could tell something was not right about this guy.

He did get the order correct even though he didn't know who ordered what dish.  He also didn't have ketchup  or mustard on the table when the food was placed on the table.  

The food was excellent!  We all enjoyed it very much.  Best Jewish style deli in the Phoenix area, in my opinion.

Because the food was so good, and he did get all the correct dishes, I will give this place 2 stars for my dining experience.  If we just had better service I would have given it 5 stars.  Even though the food was so delicious, it was hard to enjoy it given the circumstances."}
{"text":"I though all week about the the \"Ruben Ruben\" and the other sandwiches I saw on \"Check Please\" AZ. We had a cup of the Beet Borscht & a cup of the Chicken Noodle. The Chicken Noodle had a totally new taste and my wife asked to trade for the Beet Borscht (cold and tasted like pickled beet soup). I couldn't recommend either . Since when is a Philly Cheese Steak made with machined sliced roast beef,  cooked onions & green peppers? You know you are in the wrong place when the \"cold\" slaw is the same temperature as the \"baked\" french fries. The $12.50 Ruben Ruben is a good sized sandwich with dry and un-flavorful pastrami. I had to add mustard and a shake of salt to make it taste like a Ruben. The service was s-l-o-w, and no one asked if we enjoyed our food. Guess they didn't have to since our plates were only missing a couple fries and the warm cold slaw was untouched.We had doctored our sandwiches with condiments so I saw no reason to not take them home."}
{"text":"We went to Scott's Generation for the first time today. The menu was very exhaustive and had options that would please everyone. Our party ordered the patty melt, the combo Rueben which was both pastrami and corned beef, and the smothered chicken. All of these dishes were delicious and had such large portion sizes that all of us took leftovers home. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast. We used to live within walking distance and we would have breakfast here frequently. Scott's rivals Chompies with large hearty breakfasts with quicker and better service.

We usually stick to omelets. They are giant, overstuffed, kinda greasy but good. The home fries are some of the best in the city. And all the egg dishes include the option of a bagel with cream cheese. Their bagels are awesome. 

After filling your belly with goodness, stop by Karsh's next door to take some pastries home for later."}
{"text":"What can I say.....the best hot pastrami on rye you can get in the southwest!  My wife had the French dip and was extremely happy with it. New location with great vibes and their updated menu is great!  I'll be back over and over."}
{"text":"I wanted to post a review on the waitress we had for Smunch yesterday, Nancy, but it looks like I can only review a business so I'll just update this one.

When I walked into Scott's this week and asked if I could make a reservation for a large group during Saturday brunch hours, they said no problem without any hesitation. When organizing Smunch every month, this is a lovely thing to hear. 

The table was already set up and ready when I arrived and people started gathering shortly after. We wanted separate checks, though not all separate and Nancy didn't miss a beat. She was amazing. And hilarious. She joked with us the entire time and told us of her serious karaoke schedule.

At one point, someone at our table got up for a minute, and shortly after their food came out. Nancy just sat right down and pretended to eat it. And let us capture photographic evidence. 

I now will come back more frequently. And sit in Nancy's section every single time."}
{"text":"OMG: Found on google maps.  SO GLAD WE DID. This is authentic folks.  Service was great, friendly and attentive. The food was fabulous, more than filling (we had enough for dinner later).  Generous portions of good, mouthwatering deliriousness....  Thank you for a wonderful first time experience.  IF YOU ARE IN THE PHOENIX AREA, THIS IS A MUST STOP FOR LUNCH.   I wish I had discovered for breakfast and dinner.  Such nice staff..........."}
{"text":"Really great little NY deli in Phoenix. And thank goodness we found it because we were really missing a good bagel:)"}
{"text":"I can't believe I had never been here before! New York Deli at its finest! The food is delicious and fresh, and amazing staff! They have a wonderful selection of bagels, knishs', and my favorite apricot linzer cookies! The Cubano sandwich was delicious, and will be trying the corned beef hash next! Cheers and happy dining!"}
{"text":"A Delicious Deli in Central Phoenix. Who knew? Apparently a lot of people, because Scott's Generations Restaurant & Delicatessen has been in this part of town for quite a while. And the quality of the fare and the service is probably why.

Scott's is a pretty standard New York deli, overall. I can't say that there are any really unique offerings here, but everyone in my group enjoyed their meals. Like any Deli, the food is plentiful, and diners will most likely be heading home with leftovers.

The server was awesome. Really friendly and quick. The staff didn't show any annoyance with my 3-year-old daughter not wanting to sit still before she got her meal. She wasn't loud or rambunctious, but was getting in the way some of the time. They just smiled and moved around her. A nice woman at the counter even came over and gave her a cookie.

The only negative I can think of is that Scott's isn't open for dinner. I'm not in this part of town very often during business hours, and it's a bit out of the way to just grab some breakfast or lunch. The bakery selections in the counter display also weren't overly tempting, but I didn't have any room for desert, anyway. Maybe next time. If you grew up eating Deli like I did, then this is a must-try restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg. MOLD, mold everywhere!!!! 

I bought two potato filled pastry's we get 3/4 through eating them and my boyfriend goes \"Is that mold\" we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold. This was hours after they were purchased! 

In about an hour we were both feeling sick, I threw up which was terrible. I'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got. I'm shocked. I eat out everyday and have NEVER EVER had an experience like this. 

I ordered Borsch off the menu as well, and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water (for $8.95) I have to say one word...

HORRIFIED!"}
{"text":"Scott's Generations is a real deal Jewish style deli ala New York. The only thing missing is the ready to eat hot dog grill. Sandwiches come with cole slaw and ample servings of piping hot french fries which tend to be over cooked at times. In general a delicious and delightful throwback to the New York of my youth."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are as big as your head and the bagels are always fresh! I come here as often as I can and I love the people! 

This is a great place and it's a fun place to bring the family and/or group. 

Best in town!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Scott's. Location is good, lots of seating. We had a meet up group meet there. Was able to seat 12 of us.

I ordered the Scott's Reuben with corned beef. Came with coleslaw, pickles and fries. 
I Loved it. the sandwich was huge and I took half home. The fries and pickles were great. But the coleslaw was amazing. I usually don't like coleslaw and theirs tasted Delish.

Service was really good also."}
{"text":"Love the Matzo ball soup!!!  My daughter got the kids chicken tenders with FF and for a selective eater she loved every bite!  Next time I will bring Pastrami lovin hubby to score the deli meat selection.  I was tempted by the bakery items and knishes which I will also have to give a try so I will definitely be back!  Clean, with courteous prompt service is an added plus to the great food."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were in the mood for a quick yummy lunch and he brought me here. Its an old school diner feel with older cute women that wait on you. To be honest, I wasn't particularly impressed with the layout and some of the deli choices (it didn't seem like the cleanest place to me) but the service was sweet and the food was ok. 

The decor is kind of funny, it definitely embraces \"generations\" as it has old wedding photos and family photos on the wall. 

We both had pastrami sandwiches but I had only a half with some soup and boyfriend had the whole. The soup was really thick with veggies and meat. The flavoring wasn't my favorite but boyfriend really liked it. The sandwich was good, but a bit greasy and HUGE. This is definitely the place to go when you have a hangover. We could have split the one sandwich since it was so huge. I was able to eat about 1/4 of it since they give you massive chunky fries and cole slaw.

I saw some other people getting different things and it looked good so I would come back to try some other items but this isn't my number one favorite place by any means.

I probably would have rated this a 3-3.5 but the older ladies were just so sweet."}
{"text":"A prompt, attentive service, and good Jewish deli will have me returning soon.
I discovered this place when I went to get something at Ace Hardware.
I noticed that they served breakfast all day, so I went inside the restaurant.
I was seated right away and within minutes, I was given a glass of water.
My server was friendly and accommodating.
I was in a hurry, and without carefully looking at the menu, I decided to order the vegetarian skillet.
It was okay, but I wish I had ordered something else.
I do not like potatoes and onions in my omelet skillet.
The restaurant is welcoming, and the walls are full of wedding and family pictures. It looks like it's a family owned and operated business. That's very nice and special.
I will go back and try something else, but next time I will read the menu."}
{"text":"I really want to support this long-standing neighborhood restaurant, however, I was disgusted by how dirty it is.  I watched a waitress rub her nose and touch her hair and then handle food (moved it around on the plate). I watched another waitress holding plates of food passed to her from the kitchen and it (the food) was touching the underside of the shelf which was filthy. I don't think the menus have ever been washed nor the walls.  Really disgusting.  And don't expect to be greated when you walk in."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  i had the pastrami Reuben, which was probably the best pastrami that I've had in AZ, very flavorful.  The fries and pickles were excellent too.  Fresh cut fries, can't beat that!

I also had a potato knish.  I haven't had a lot of knishes in my life so i don't have a lot to compare this one too, but It was good.  The only complaint I would have is that the potatoes weren't very moist, but it was still flavorful with a very nice flaky crust.

The only negative thing I would say about this place was that the day I went it was 90 degrees and out and they didn't have the AC on!  We asked the server about it and she said the owner didn't want to turn the air on yet.  I mean, it was ridiculously hot inside that place!  So hopefully that was an isolated incident because the food was so good I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I feel basically the same way as Stevey; one problem, we had a roach crawl across the table and behind the picture frame on the wall (although, it wasn't too bad... the picture was of a heavily mulleted Italian man circa 1981, though I see that being insult to injury to those less appreciative of bad 80's fashion) last time. BIG turn off. The man won't go there with me anymore. I can't find a better chocolate egg cream though..."}
{"text":"My buddy and I swung by for lunch to go. We were hoping for a quick sandwich, but the service was very slow. We each got the turkey over-stuffed sandwich. Because of the description, we were expecting larger sandwiches, but they weren't big. There was plenty of meat on the sandwiches, however. The coleslaw was tasty but was a little too runny for me. The Yelp deal really saved the day because I don't feel that the sandwiches warranted their $12 price. Anyhow, it seems like a fine place, but it's much slower than your standard deli."}
{"text":"Best corned beef in Arizona hands Down the sandwiches are big enough to share.  The place is what a typical deli should be and trust me I know delis. They have everything you can imagine on the menu.  The pictures on the wall are priceless and look like they have been there 30+ years."}
{"text":"I was craving some real NY/Jewish deli, so hubby and I decided to head over there this afternoon.  I'm so glad we did, because my cravings were all satisfied.

We split the chopped liver w/bagel chips.  I ended up eating most of it (plus taking some home), because it's just not hubby's \"thing\".  But, it was delicious!!  Unfortunately, the bagel chips weren't really from bagels I like.  Most of them were sunflower seed bagels, and I'd prefer just plain or onion. 

I had the brisket sandwich on an onion roll, and it was everything I could've wanted.  The brisket was juicy and tasty, so I didn't have to add anything to it.  Plus, I ended up bringing home enough of the extra meat to make another sandwich.  My hubby had the reuben, and gobbled it down so fast, I don't think I actually saw it on his plate.

I also ordered a side of kugel, which he'd never had.  And, it was warm, sweet and creamy.  I was surprised my hubby liked it, because he doesn't usually like anything with raisins.

To me, this is my comfort food.  It reminds me of my family back east, and I'm so glad my husband has embraced it like he has.

This was actually the 2nd time we've been here, and both times have been successes.  They're a bit out of the way for us, but sometimes, ya just gotta have your deli!!"}
{"text":"The food and service at Scott's Generations was excellent. We had sandwiches (corned beef, tongue) and soup. The sandwiches were very large and extremely tasty. The rye bread was nice and fresh.  I also couldn't leave without 1 of the black & whites in the display case. I've never had one so fresh and soft. Overall - best NY deli food I've had in Phoenix area (though Chompie's has a much more extensive menu and is open for dinner). 

Only 1 sour note:  They refused to honor the 2017 Entertainment coupon (buy 1 entree get 1 free, up to $14) until I put up a strong protest. The only notice that they will no longer honor Entertainment coupons (book or phone app) is a small piece of paper hanging at the cash register, and of course no one will see it there until they have finished eating, which is extremely unfair and essentially deceitful."}
{"text":"I love this place, we actually went twice this weekend!  

They have some veggie options on the menu which is nice, and they are happy to change anything around to make it vegetarian if you'd like.  The service is friendly and the prices are great.  

The meat eaters at my table said that the meats were fantastic and we all left very happy!"}
{"text":"I first started coming here in the early 90's. Used to come by once or twice a month for lunch.  The last time I was  here was some time in 2009.
Today my wife and I were in the neighborhood and the sign caught my eye. I was excited to come in again. \"WAS\"

Beautiful day so we decided to sit outside. Abouot 7 or 8 tables out on the patio. All were dirty, some still with plates on them. All had crumbs and small bits of food, most all had ashes on them. We picked the cleanest one and wiped it and cleaned it ourselves.  Waitress came and we both ordered good-rare roast beef. The kind we remebered from NY.

My kaiser roll was dry and crumbly-falling apart. Should have chosen the rye like my wife-can't beat it.  Went to put pepper on the sandwich and had to get a pepper shaker from another table that wasn't dirty. Found one after the fourth table.

Sorry Scott!  Used to LOVE coming here. Was very dissapointed. I'll probably come back, but no way I can get the wife back.

Great food, just need to \"clean up\" a little."}
{"text":"To be honest, their foods taste really good and the waiter are nice, but the big guy at front door cashier is not very nice and had no patient to the first time visitor!

So I give them 3 stars! I can tolerate bad foods once or twice, but I can't tolerate bad customer service!"}
{"text":"Dined here a few times for breakfast and lunch. Nothing to be too impressed by. The food is generally greasy, the tables dirty, and the service definitely lack-luster. 

The only reason I went in the first place was because my friend bragged about how awesome the place was. I left unimpressed."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Scott's has a matzo ball soup so good I can't imagine how anyone could ever hate the Jews. Best bagels in Phoenix, hands down. Take your Einstein's and shove it.
Scott's has an expansive menu that ranges across breakfast, traditional deli offerings, and a strong but semi random assortment of 'home cooking' type meals that your mom makes but you never see in restaurants. I haven't spent a lot of time in delis in New York, but Scott's reminds me of the \"New York deli\" I used to live around the corner from in Houston, down the street from the JCC - tasty, simple, and unapologetic, about anything. I love their soups, although their pastrami is not the best I've ever had. They have every flavor of Dr Brown's imaginable. The portions are huge - too huge, actually. I'm minuscule, so the prospect of a sandwich that is 3x what I can eat in one sitting is daunting to the point that I only go if I know I can take a box home. The service runs hot and cold, but I've never not gotten what I wanted the way I wanted it, and if the waitress isn't looking at me with vague disapproval, I feel like it's not an authentic New York experience."}
{"text":"The ruebans are decent, but not worth the 12.50 they charge.  Service is great though."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is exceptional, huge portions, and friendly service. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"New to the area so am trying out all the places near me. Scott's Generations Deli & Restaurant was on my agenda for today. Do I know anything about NY delis and matza balls? No. ( I cannot even spell matza ball). Do I know anything about ordering meats or deli fish? No. I'll just review what I know. And I know design, good service and breakfast food. Design of the place including the logo and menu...Stale and dated. Quality of the service...quite excellent. My eggs Benedict... Very average. After I got over the shock of a cheese slice somehow showing up sandwiched in between each English muffin and the hollandaise sauce, I did enjoy it and the home fries. Obviously not the best hollandaise, and I guess they know this already because it needed to taste more like cheese and less like hollandaise according to the cooks that probably should just remove this item instead of pretending. But what the heck...it was something different. Next time I'll order a Reuben and see if my 3 stars can become 4."}
{"text":"This is a deli.  It's a phenomenal deli.  Breakfast and lunch, it's always spot on.  Whenever I get a craving for corned beef or pastrami, this is my go to spot.  Great for breakfast too."}
{"text":"The food was all right. I had the Steak and Eggs for breakfast with toast and home fries ($12.95). The best part about it is the home fries. My steak was supposed to be well done and it was .. but only on half of it. The other half looked medium rare. The food was overall okay."}
{"text":"Fantastic food in a wonderful new space 
Locally owned for 28 years by three generations"}
{"text":"This is almost a 5 star.  The place was clean, quiet, well lit, and the rest room spiffy.  The server was very attentive and friendly the specials good but was not crazy about the taters.  The most unpleasant thing I can say was the grubby long hair on the one guy who looked like he rolled out of bed.  I am very surprised he was not asked to wear a hair net.    Will return hopefully when the long haired guy is off."}
{"text":"Scott, I was very surprised to  hear that the \"Coffee with a Cop\" meeting was to be held at Scott's Generations.  As a matter of fact when I inquired if Ofc. Michael C. Piazza was aware of the limited space he informed me that you have a large back room that is offered for meetings and groups.  How great is that:-)  Just goes to show that the Police Officers are on top of everything, LOL.  Hope you have a large turn out and especially for the coffee with a Cop.  A special thank you to all the police men and women that put their lives on the line ever day for us.  Be safe and remember any thing that looks suspicious might turn out to be just do not use the emergency number to report anything that might not be an emergency and let the non emergency officer taking the call decide if you are not sure. 

Coffee With the Cop

Date: June 14th, 2017
Location: Scotts Generations
742 E. Glendale Ave. #142
Time: 8:00 am--9:00 am"}
{"text":"I had the Pastrami sandwich. I think it's called the Scott-wich. It was delicious! Moist and a heaping amount of meat. Super stuffed! Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place before, and finally stopped in with a friend today for lunch. I'm on a deli kick as of late, and have been craving Gefilte fish like crazy.  I liked it over all, but I must admit, HOW DOES A DELI (THE SECOND ONE AT THAT THIS WEEKEND) RUN OUT OF GEFILTE FISH AND BEET BORSCT?!  HOW? WHY?

I have to say, that was all I wanted. Odd? not to me.  So, off I went scouring the menu for other items.  I will say, the waiter was extremely knowledgeable and explained that all that sort of stuff comes from New York and as of recently, there's been \"issues\" getting their hands on this stuff? Is there a gefilte fish strike going on somewhere? A beet farmer protest that I don't know about? SERIOUSLY?!?!?

Overall Robyn and I had a great time here. We really enjoyed our food, the service was great and it went really well.  I would eat here again, but I would insist on them having Gefilte fish before I go.....(ok ok I'm just kidding, but seriously, I need gefilte fish.....)"}
{"text":"learned about this place from Check Please, and glad I did. They are located in a strip mall that I normally wouldn't consider when looking for a place to eat out. It is a hole in the wall, but in the best sense of the phrase. 
On a Sun early afternoon service was friendly and very attentive.
Ordered the corned beef hash which is made fresh and the Reuben. Both were substantial portions...always nice to know dinner for that night is taken care of already.
Food was very good and priced competitively for the amount of food. Scott's Deli is serious competition to Chompies"}
{"text":"Scott's has the best deli in Arizona.  It's actual New York deli the way they prepare in NYC. I would know. I am a New York deli connoisseur. Scott's has it down perfectly to mentio the best service and best coffee!!!"}
{"text":"From the moment I sat down I was greeted with a great ice tea and amazing choices. I chose the Ruben hands down one of if not the best Ruben I have ever had. The flavor was second to none the portions were beyond my expectations. The Russian dressing was house made and was perfect it complemented the amazing brisket. The fries were the best crisp outside soft inside and so flavor full.  And to finish the meal a black and white cookie the was moist and so much flavor like a sugar cookie was paired with a cupcake. I wish I would have bought more. If you haven't been here you are missing the best food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best New York deli I've found in Phoenix, reminds me of Art's Deli in Studio City, Los Angeles.  Always spotless, very lean meats, reasonable prices, friendly staff and lots of easy parking.   It's consistently excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I was looking forward to a lox breakfast, but I don't eat farmed salmon.  So of course I had to ask if the lox was from farmed or wild salmon.  The server checked with the kitchen and it is farmed!  No lox for me.  I then asked about the chicken livers; \"are they organic?\"  I thought the waitress was going to burst out laughing but she quickly composed herself and just lightly shook her head.  Okay, I'm a fuss bucket, I just can't eat nitrates, hormones, preservatives, etc.  I ordered a bagel and wished I had just gone to TJ and picked up some wild Alaskan lox, organic eggs, organic bread, organic butter and I would have gotten it all for the price of their lox & eggs breakfast plate with plenty of quality food stuffs for 4 other meals.  I think this place is past it's due date, old school, no growth and just getting by on low grade food stock and laughing all the way to the bank."}
{"text":"I was craving lox so I made my first trip to Scott's Generations.  Got there at 12:30pm on a Sunday and it was super quiet, just about five other people in there.  The setup is classic diner/deli; leather booths, good American easy listening/classic rock playing in the background.  I can see how some people might say the place is dirty but if you've ever been to a NYC deli...it's not anything shocking or out of the ordinary.  Didn't bother me at all.

I ordered the L.E.O Special - lox, eggs, onions and a bagel.  The board menu can be a bit overwhelming with tons of options, so I was glad I took a look at the menu before I got there.  Ordered my food to go and it was ready in 10 minutes.  

BUT - the black and white cookies are fake.  The icing is that store bought crap just spread on the cookie.  Any true b&w cookie connoisseur will be able to tell just by looking at them that they won't taste the same as the real deal.  I tried just to make sure and was correct.

Overall I was satisfied with the food and experience.  Not amazing, but not horrible.  I'd go back - not a lot of places to find lox here.  And they have Knishes.  I'll try that next."}
{"text":"I called in an order last week for breakfast.  I ordered corn beef hash with eggs, potato pancake, and bagel.
They asked how I wanted my eggs cooked.  I told them fried with whites cooked but yellows dippy.
They got the whites mostly OK but the yellows were not dippy.  Had I been eating in I would have told them to take them back and cook them right.
I have had their pastrami sandwiches and they are delicious.  Next time I will go elsewhere for eggs.  But I will order my sandwiches there or \"maybe not\".
Also the owner, Scott, was not very hospitable.  If I were running a business I would be much more friendly and outgoing with my clients.  Everyone likes to be greeted with a smile and a \"how ya doing? and \"come back again\"."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ALL DAY breakfast menu in the Phoenix area. I went with the French toast and there wasn't a crumb leftover. Also, had to snag some Passover macaroons since they were only available at this time of year and Scott's has the best!! The owner exemplified amazing customer service and personality. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Got a hankering for NY-style deli, so I searched a Yelp, finding Scott's Generations.  Drove from Surprise to midtown Phx to give it a try.  I highly recommend this place.   I had a Ruben that was to die for..  it was truly enough for 2 meals, the meat was stacked so thick.  The better half had the yummy patty melt.  Their home-made coleslaw was xlnt, even better than my mom's.  (Sorry mom).  I like my fries crisp, and the wife like likes her's limply. Although they were more of a potato wedge, (vs a fry)they were piping hot & cooked each to our own liking.  We will definitely be back, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Had Scott's Special Corned Beef Hash, and an asiago bagel.

The hash was delicious! Good amount of peppers and onions.

Would go back."}
{"text":"Huge portions! A sandwich can feed 2 people if you're around the 150lb mark. Hence the $14 price point. Boyfriend and I saw this on YELP and went for it. It's GREAT. Staff was amazing and accommodating. Definitely recommend this
Place. Serves breakfast and salads and sandwiches. Thomas M was our server and I couldn't have been more please with our experience."}
{"text":"We came here based on a friend's recommendation about their corned beef hash.  Their recommdation was spot on!   It was absolutely great.

The place is very new clean and bright inside. The menu has lots of options and everything it's reasonably priced.

In short this place is real keeper!"}
{"text":"The food is fine, if you actually get the order you've requested AND it's made to order the way you've requested. I've tried to do this twice and both times, my orders were not correct and the owner threw a fit about doing requests that they clearly say they are OK with honoring. The service is awful, the employees are so rude, and they don't give change. They just expect a tip on top of their delivery charge. I will never deal with them again. They clearly enjoy telling the customer they're wrong and don't care about customer service."}
{"text":"I love Scott's Generations. When I am in need of excellent east coast deli food, instead of buying a plane ticket I go to Scott's. The food is wonderful. The staff is great.  The food is not just good for my stomach it is good for my soul.  I'm there every Monday."}
{"text":"Scott is here almost all the time. I've eaten at Scott's since they opened and have never been disappointed. Scott makes the best LEO (lox, eggs & onions) in Phoenix, has lox spread to die for, and is picky about his bagel supplier. I love the knishes and smoked fishes. He even remembers I don't eat meat. This is also my go-to place for a take-out brunch spread."}
{"text":"Not happy since they moved service not as good and twice now take out was cold and wrong.   Sad to see it going downhill , bigger not always better"}
{"text":"the only thing special about this place is that you walk in from Arizona and end up in new jersey. or staten island. it is essentially an average tri state area Jewish diner, complete with surly wait staff who fight over, in front of you, whether one of them had taken their table. i eat here when I really need a diner breakfast because I'm homesick. otherwise, the food is not great. the pastrami is sliced super thin and ends dry in the sandwich. and it came lukewarm. who cares if there's a lot of it if it's no good? the breakfasts are bland, and their home fries are mushy and tasteless. and their waitstaff need to learn to get food to the table while it's hot, because I've never received a hot meal here.

I do like their bialys, I'm not sure where else in Phoenix you could find those. even in new York, it's hard to find a place with bialys. save yourself the trouble and get one to go though."}
{"text":"One of the few delis I've seen that serves mish-mosh, which is basically every kind of Jewish chicken soup at once.  It was filling, but not the best: not enough chicken, and that mostly hiding in the bottom of the bowl.  While the noodles and rice were good, there was a bit much of them, and the matzo ball was both small and hard, and it had herbs or something in it, which doesn't really work.  No kreplach, so it hardly even qualified as real mish-mosh.

I came back another day in hopes of trying a sandwich, but it was closed for the day due to a death in the family.  Sorry to hear that.

One thing I liked very much: they serve their soup and other lunch foods at breakfast-time."}
{"text":"OMG the best Reuben in Phoenix hands down!! Owner is very attentive and it's family owned. Great authentic deli, love it!!"}
{"text":"I paid $26 dollars for two bagel sandwhiches with lox and the works.  Highway robbery.  They are good, don't get me wrong.  But this is outrageous.  At the most I can see maybe $7 or even $8 but my god....  Well it was delicious but I could easily just go to einstein bagels or all the rest and be just as happy, especially happy for my wallet, it smarts right now."}
{"text":"When it comes to being Jewish, I'm more ish than Jew... a fellow Heeb nearly dropped dead when I didn't know what a \"black & white\" was.  I can not-so-boldy tell you I have never had gefilte fish... and God-willing, I never will.  That being said, there are probably all sorts of layers to the onion that is Scott's Generations that I haven't peeled back.  And while I haven't embraced many Heeb traditions --- one thing I dig is the food.  And friends, Generations has the food.

If you're there during lunch, this place gets slammed.  There are roughly a bajillion types of sandwiches, some pastas, you name it.  I'm a half-sandwich and matzoh ball soup guy.

One thing: I can't get the feeling the service here is a little subpar.  Plenty of silver-haired, no-nonsense souls roam the dining room... and they're so nice (and old) that you'll feel guilty correcting them when they screw up.  We got a salad yesterday with no dressing and missing some key ingredients.  When we asked if dressing came on it, she said, \"Oh, you wanted dressing?  You didn't ask for any.\"

I'm not one to rip on service -- I think this is the first I've mentioned it in any review -- but c'mon.  Are we being high maintenance for thinking dressing should come on salads?  Are we rabbits?

Overall --- still the best Jewish deli in town and a great place to go when you need a little deli in your belly.   Calorie counters need not apply.

Bubbie would be proud."}
{"text":"Awful seating, like sitting with other people, and lighting is bad.  Then one egg is $1.75, asked for 2?Eggs, charged $6. Also, servers do not know difference between salami & pastrami, I wanted pastrami & eggs, I got salami. Service is Bad.True review,correct the problem. DO NOT INSULT the reviewer"}
{"text":"Awful place not the same.  Food was gross, they did not know how to make matzo ball soup, place is dirty and bugs in walls"}
{"text":"I just stumbled upon this place this Feb, I can't believe it's been here 20yrs, and I've never been. The place is kind of typical deli style, no frills kinda place. But the food is great! I been three times now, so far I've has locs and bagles twice (yep it's that good) I seen a lot of comments on the sandwiches, so that's my next order. 
Great please for breakfast or lunch. 
Solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Just a small local deli, but with everything you need. This is more like a place where you would pick something up and take it with you rather than sitting there and eating it, though they do have both tables inside and outside. I love their pastrami, and their bagels. Definitely a winner on a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"I have ascended to food heaven.  Dining at Scott's today was like a religious experience.  One that my waistline will pay for but so worth it.  This is hand's down my new favorite place for great deli sandwiches and bagels. No more will I buy my baked goods or luncheon meats at the grocery store.  

Deciding what to get was tough, but I've had pastrami on the brain for days.  The New Yorker sandwich filled that craving and more.  Ridiculously high piles of pastrami and corned beef.  OMG!  I didn't know how I'd ever get my mouth around it, but somehow I did and the flavors and textures exploded on my tongue.  The sandwich arrived with spears of pickles, cole slaw and the cutest french fries.  There was no way I was finishing it all and I happily boxed up the remainder for a tasty breakfast tomorrow morning.

While inside paying I perused the bakery case. Lovely Linzer cookies called my name loudly so I left with three!  The kid behind the counter offered to give me another for free but I thought about my waistline and graciously declined.

I look forward to my next visit however now I retreat to my room for a happy Jewish Deli induced food coma.  Sweet dreams!"}
{"text":"Scott's Generations is hands down the best east coast-style deli in the valley, particularly for breakfast. It's just as cheap as Denny's down the street and about ten times more satisfying and wholesome. 

Their baked goods and bagels are crisp, chewy perfection. No perpetrating steam oven biscuit bagels here like Breuggers or Einsteins.  And there's plenty of cream cheese options to schmear to your heart's content. 

I'm usually a pretty flexible diner, rotating through a menu to try new things, but here I get one thing and one thing only every time. Brandi's Breakfast Special for only four bucks: two eggs over easy, home fries and a garlic bagel with chive cream cheese.

I guarantee that meal will sink like a satisfying rock to the bottom of your stomach and keep you full for hours. With coffee and tip the whole thing will set you back about eight bucks.

Enjoy the surly granny wait staff that'll call you doll or sugar, and treat yourself to a black and white cookie on the way out. Trust me."}
{"text":"Holy mother of sandwiches. I travel to Chicago a lot, and was spoiled years ago by a place called Perry's Deli on Roosevelt and Clark. I only get to go 2 or 3 times a year but I have their hot Pastrami every time I go at least once. I have tried Pastrami sandwiches all over Phoenix and have never been able to find anything that touches Perry's. I went to Katz', another place on Central and Camelback, as well as a few others on the westside. Finally on a recommendation by a colleage of mine I went to Scott's and it was almost... almost what Perry's was. The meat was high quality and extremely generous, probably the biggest sandwich I've seen in these parts. Everything about the sandwiches there was perfect. My only gripe, and this is just personal preference is that delis/sandwich shops should not be waiter service. I want to order at the counter, go through a cafeteria line, and pay at the end, you know, east coast style. They also close at 8pm, so dinner is cut off early. I wholeheartedly recommend this place for lunch, its unreal how good it is."}
{"text":"I visited Scotts whenever in Phoenix and always loved the place. When I pulled up this time and it appeared closed, a little part of me died. Realizing they had simply moved a few blocks away, we headed over.

New location is great! Bigger, newer, brighter, just as delicious. KT always gets the Mish Mosh soup which was spectacular as ever (though I have to admit, we missed the big metal bowl in which it used to be served). The Chopped Liver plate w/bagel chips was exquisite, enough to make a meal; the leftovers were just as good the next morning. My Chicken Salad sandwich on rye was absolutely stuffed to overflowing; again, leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Service was solid. Owner is visible, working along with and supervising staff. And the table of old guys having lunch next to us took me back to my days working in NYC and visiting the local deli. Scott's is the real deal and couldn't be happier to see their improved location!"}
{"text":"Man, I love this old place. Conjures memories of the real deal delis that I grew up with in NY and Philly. 

Stumbled on Scott's when trying to find some good food near St. Joe's Hospital. I now stop just about every time I'm there. Makes dealing with doctors and the drive from Prescott Valley seem almost worthwhile.

KT would eat the Mish Mosh Soup every day if she could. The soup is fresh and hearty, and that broth is out of this world. We've had the Chicken Rice also and it's wonderful. The deli meats (I've had roast beef, turkey, pastrami and corned beef) are all beautifully done, and sandwiches come with a minimum of 8 oz piled high! A really nice touch is the option to select Extra Lean meat at no extra cost. The lean pastrami was absolutely perfect.  KT had the Scottwich last time and it disappeared in no time. And the Bacon, Liver and Onion platter transported me to a very, very happy place. 

Sides have been ok; I'm not crazy about the cole slaw, which is made with Thousand or Russian, I believe, but KT really likes it. Haven't yet tried any desserts, but have my eye in a few for future visits.

Service has been steady, place is certainly dated but clean, and they appear to appreciate the business. Scott's is already on the calendar for next months trip to the doctor."}
{"text":"I stopped by in search for a sub, and I've seen these guys deliver to the building where I work before. 

The service was bad. The waitress was an older woman who didn't greet us, or ask how we were or anything, she walks up says \"what you want to drink?\" and then leaves. I didn't know what I wanted, so I said, water. She brings back water and says, do you want something else? 

I order the #1 Sandwich. For $8.75, it was a 9\" sandwich with ham, turkey and pepperoni, but the ham was so overwhelmingly strong, you couldn't taste anything else.  The sandwich was dry. It didn't have mayo or mustard on it. I saw others ordering sides of mayo. I should have done the same. 

I ordered \"french fries\", but they were more like country potatoes. They were quartered potatoes about 1\" each, not crunchy, and not flaky. Severely disappointed. 

At the same time, the woman brings the check, drops it off, and I don't see any more of her again. 

I have to go up to the register myself and pay the guy at the counter.

The total came to $22.00, and after leaving a \"generous\" 10% tip, it was almost $25.00. 

$25.00...for two crappy sandwiches, and some under cooked potatoes.

Next time I'll go to some chain sub place, where they at least say \"hello\" as you walk in."}
{"text":"Likely one of the top deli's in the entire valley. I had heard this place had a great reputation, and they definitely lived up to it.

The pastrami and ruben are both amazing, even the fries are good. Plus, you just have to try their black and white cookies (I was too full and took one home). Service was brisk, pricing is reasonable, and the atmosphere is quaint, old-school.

Thank god for little gems like this surviving in the \"Tempe Marketplace\", \"Mesa Riverview\" chain megatropolis we live in."}
{"text":"I think it's hilarious that the only person who gave this place 1 star is some schmuck who was upset that the chicken livers weren't organic.  What do you expect?  Unlike lady Alaska, I am thankful that all of Scott's product comes directly from Brooklyn.  I really think that is the story behind this Deli's 21 years of success.  

Why have I never heard of this deli in the years I have lived here.  We went in on Good Friday and there wasn't a soul in the store.  We ate a full meal and still no one came in.  The wait staff and owner seemed relieved.  I think this place does amazing business during the day.  Not to mention, the lovely waitress told us stories of how she took 3 parties the other night.

The food here is amazing.  My wife and I shared the smoked fish platter (which is $10 less than chompies and almost twice the size) My dad had the liver and onions which to him is food for the soul.  I tried his and it was really good.  I can't wait to go back there again this week.  The prices are right, the portions are amazing and the quality is above standard for a Phoenix deli.  This place blows Chompies out of the water.

I am so thankful we get a slice of New York right here in Phoenix.  I wasn't a big fan of the mish mosh soup.  I'd stay away from it.  But everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"Used to go here all the time at the old location by Bashas. It was fantastic then and fantastic now! I like the modern new look. The service is always so good and the food tastes so authentic. I would love if they brought back an iced coffee station again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Reuben I've ever eaten!!! loving every bite of it, thx Scott's. Fast service clean restaurant awesome experience every time I come here!"}
{"text":"Many years ago I used to eat at Scott's Generations and it was the first place I ever tried a Monte Cristo and it was awesome. I got a notification from Yelp that they opened at a new location so I thought I would check it out. I kind of wish I hadn't. The new location is modern and it's a nicer space, which is pretty much where the positives end. The restaurant was pretty dirty and not terribly busy but there were people running around constantly but not seeming to ever clean up the tables or dining area. It was also a constant battle to get refills. The food we ordered wasn't even really mediocre, it was just bad. We all left feeling like we'd made a mistake and it was a disappointment from a place we used to love eating at."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since the old location.  The food has always been on point.  But I have to say the new location was a smart decision. It is a lot cleaner and brighter which in return brings positive energy.  Overall better atmosphere and still great food/customer service."}
{"text":"I moved out of Central Phoenix and had forgotten about Scott's Generations.  Back in town now and have enjoyed having breakfast there several times.  The portions are generous and the food is really good. I found the wait staff attentive and like seeing Scott in the restaurant.  I would encourage anyone that has a less than experience to take care of it while there and allow them the option of making things better.  They can't do anything about something they don't know about.  Like people, sometimes restaurants just have an off day.  #bekind #scottsgenerationfan"}
{"text":"My turkey club sandwich was bigger than my mouth. I'm still not sure how I was able to eat it, but I did and it filled me up for the rest of the day. My fiancee ordered a side of gravy for our fries, da-licious. This place is jumping at lunch time and the menu is just as big as the sandwiches are."}
{"text":"New location, really nice and well thought out.  The food remains the same, wonderful.  Great selection and very traditionally New York Style.  There is a picture of Scott's dad Gene and Scott just inside the front door.  Gene was a great man and Scott is true to the name Generations.  Wonderful family owned restaurant.  Try the pickles, homemade by Scott."}
{"text":"Food is great and our waiter was great but food trickled trickled out of the kitchen. If your planning on a quick meal this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"Christmas really isn't my holiday...it's more for the Beautiful Carin, and I try my very best to play along and do what I should to make the holiday \"joyful\"...not my strong suit:)

This Christmas is no different than 30 or 40 others that preceded it...it's the end of the year and that always bring its own peculiar brand of \"troubles\".

Today, I had to visit with one of my attorney's (I know, pathetic)...some trouble with some partners in a business relationship and I am trying to figure out what the best course of action is...this attorney is my Doberman...he will chase people to the bowels of hell and bring them back screaming to be returned to Satan's loving grasp...if the compensation is right:)

I don't Yelp him, because frankly, he scares me...a little bit:)

I was bemoaning the holiday season to him during our session today (believe it or not our \"chit chat\" is quite brief at $425 per hour), and his legal advice was that I \"sack up\" and get over it:)

To reinforce that, he took me to lunch (I must look like I'm going to be a gold mine to him!) at Scott's Generations:)

That did indeed put a smile on my face and prepared me adequately for my next meeting this afternoon.

I love deli...I get to NYC 2-3 times a year, and consequently I don't think very much of the deli's here in town...overpriced, under-sized...less than we should expect:(

Even Goldman's, who's been good for several years, has fallen sharply over the past year.

Scott's could change my perception of the deli landscape in PHX.

I had a hot corned beef on rye that was as tasty as anything I've found in Phoenix...and it was huge...a restricted flight softball of hot, moist corned beef, between two thick slices of rye (from Karshes, next door, with plenty of caraway seeds:)

Four salt brine pickle spears, and cole slaw, accompanied this behemoth:)

I couldn't leave well enough alone and ordered a side of crinkle cut fries to \"make the season bright\":)

$11.00 US money for the whole deal (no extra charge for \"extra lean\":)

Everything was well made, tasty and nicely presented by the sweet ladies that serve the all the customers...I mean 20-25% tip service by these sweethearts:)

I waddled out, with my mood adjusted back to \"non-grinchy\" (I'm sure this lunch will appear on the bill from my attorney, at some point...I just choose not to think about it right now:)

I didn't even have room for a Black and White cookie from Karshes, after lunch...that's packing in the corned beef!

While Scott's Generations is not, strictly (or even un-strictly) speaking \"kosher\", it is definitely in  the traditional \"New York Style\":)

No, I would not claim it's as good as anything in Manhattan...but I gotta tell you, it's as good as a lot of neighborhood deli's in Manhattan...and easily the best of breed for PHX."}
{"text":"Many times a 5 star review is written by me but usually only after a 2nd visit or more.  Scott's will be the exception!!  I went on the recommendation of physician who raved about it the whole time I was with her this afternoon.  She was spot-on with her review and nothing could have made me happier today!  

Upon arriving, I let the woman behind the counter know it was my first time and I wanted to check the place out.  She offered me a menu and told me to take my time and parouse the extremely large menu before deciding.  

The menu was huge, to say the least!  A Chocolate Egg Creme started my afternoon off.  Excellent!!  After careful review, I decided on the Reuben Reuben.  A massive pile of corned beef between two pieces of rye and some wonderful sauerkraut all grilled to perfection.  The order came with 3 pickle spears, sweet and tangy cole slaw and some of the best crinkle-cut fries imaginable!!!  They were skin-on and thicker than most steak-cut fries, cooked to a dark color.  Yummy!!  

My waitress was Nancy, someone who seemed to have been there for years and was a delight to say the least!!  Attentive but not bothersome.  She was there when I needed her and no where to be seen when I did not.  Just the way it should be.

Before departing, I decided to get a 1/2 pound of Chopped Liver to take home for the evening.  Its got to be one of my favorites when made right.  This was no exception either.  Creamy, flavorful and just the perfect texture. 

When you have the chance, you have got to stop here!  The prices are on the higher end of the fair scale but for what you get, beyond well worth it.  This is an oasis in the desert that cannot be missed, especially for a transplanted easterner like myself!!  I am already planning my bext visit back!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast...  Huge portions of food.  I flew into Phoenix from Seattle and this was the first place my friend took me to eat.  We went for a Thursday morning breakfast!  Get the Huevos Racheros.  My girlfriend got the Eggs Benedict and could only eat one of the eggs and a quarter of the potatoes; there was so much food!!!   Don't miss this quintessential Jewish Deli."}
{"text":"What a great lunch!  I had the pastrami sandwich on rye and it was HUGE and perfect--- I've had pastrami sandwiches all over the state and I think Scott's is my favorite, second is Carnegie in NY.  

I didn't order any sides but my lunch buddies did and the fries were good.  Fruit was so-so-- Scott's isn't really the fruit side kinda place.

Service was quick (which is great on a work day!), friendly and the place as busy but not overly crowded.   The deli cases looked really good on the way out too!"}
{"text":"These people were so unbelievably rude to me. They were rude on the phone, they were rude when I picked my order up. I am not going back even though the food was good, not worth being treated like you are the smallest person in the world. There are a handful of other delis very very close that are just as good.

Update: 11/22/14
I just saw your truck driving down 7th Street in the most reckless dangerous way. Wow, if you're going to drive like a jerk, word of advice, don't vinyl wrap your truck with your business on it!"}
{"text":"Just left with no food after waiting 35-40 minutes. I ordered a toasted bagel and a Ruben sandwich. At 30 minutes of waiting, I asked how much longer and was told 'just a few moments.' Ten minutes later I asked for a refund. The man that refunded me apologized and said they were backed up in the kitchen. It was not very busy so I am a little confused. Food looked and smelt good, bummed I didn't get a chance to try it."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. I ordered through postmates and was not happy with my order. I ordered an $11 roast beef sandwich. You would think the sandwich would come with standard cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato, etc inside a bun? My sandwich was meat inside a bun nothing additional. For $11 I thought they may include fries like in their pictures but they gave 2 horrible tasting pickles and a cup of coleslaw. I guess I just had more expectation for the price. I will say the roast beef itself was delicious though it was just the plainest sandwich I've ever gotten."}
{"text":"Uuugh...I went here for father's day again with the family this morning....I think this should probably be the last visit. It was fairly empty in there this morning (probably a pretty bad sign given that it is father's day). We sat at a large round table in the back of the restaurant. The service was actually fair today except the waitress forgot much of the food ordered and had to make several trips to get everyone their food. Speaking of the food, it was pretty terrible. I had the two egg breakfast with eggs over medium. The eggs were overcooked (closer to over hard) and everything on my plate tasted like burnt bacon. I did not order bacon. Turns out everyone's food tasted like burnt bacon because they don't properly clean their flat top or pans or whatever they cook on. The potatoes were inedible....soggy and flavored like....burnt bacon. My bagel was burnt on the side with the toppings and soft on the side that should be toasted. My brother, Scott O., had pancakes which he said tasted bland. The BF had latkes which were thick, burnt, and somehow not crispy. The applesauce that came with it was so watery...almost like apple juice. No one enjoyed the food, and we are Jewish (btw) so we are very familiar with Jewish food and Jewish delis. With so many good breakfast restaurants in Phoenix, there is no excuse to come here. Honestly, I would have rather eaten at home."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a 5 star, but we did not get to eat there since a previous review indicated that they do not accept the Entertainment book coupon. We asked as soon as we stepped in the door and were told \"We do not honored that coupon\", so we left. 
Too bad for them, I had been to this place in April 2017 and enjoyed the food very much and used a coupon, so I was excited to bring my husband there. They need to post a large sign on the door so people are not surprised when they go to pay."}
{"text":"French dip was just ok.  A bit of a wait, and a bit pricey.  It might have been better if I didn't have to drive back from home to get the dipping sauce that the server forgot to put the bag.  At $14 I expected a bit more."}
{"text":"How did I not know this existed?  It's within walking distance from home!
Went with Chrissy P for a New Year's Day brunch.  It's so freaking hard to find a good NY-style deli up in here!
Got there before her, so I grabbed a take-out menu.  Holy lox, Batman (I usually say \"Holy frijoles, but it's a Jewish deli, get it??) the menu is HUGE!
They have a full breakfast menu with omelets, Jewish staples like lox, blintzes and matzo brie.  There are huevos rancheros, skillet dishes to round out the breakfasts.
Many different smoked fish dishes, too.  
I had the egg salad sandwich on wheat bread.  *Real* wheat bread.  Though I think the egg salad was missing something, it was still delicious.  Also got a side of fries.  They were homemade crinkle-cut, with the skins still on them!  I love fries with the skin still there.  
Service was ultra-friendly and we never had to ask for a refill on our drinks.
I will definitely be back.  It will take forever to get through the menu, even for a pescatarian like me."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Central Phoenix, but I give it three stars because of the complete lack of atmosphere, the prices being a bit more than what I would expect, and the service being so-so. Still, great bagels and home fries, good traditional breakfast dishes, and an astounding tongue sandwich (which is, admittedly, a lunch item)."}
{"text":"Had the Beef Brisket Over Stuffed Deli Sandwich...It is one of the best damn sandwiches I have ever had. I'm all about the meat and they do not disappoint. I have never seen this much meat on bread in my life. I hate going to sandwich shops and having to pay for double meat because they skimp you. Meat was delicious, best brisket I can remember. I will come back, ALOT."}
{"text":"A REAL deli with real smoked fish and real pastrami; not the disappointing stuff usually found in places like Arizona.  And the staff is just wonderful.  Reasonable prices complete the deal. 

NOTE TO OWNER: In a response that you had made to another review, in which you said that you were adding new servers:  Please don't get rid of at least one of your just wonderfully crochety & classic, now elderly, waitresses.  She is just darling."}
{"text":"Went in over the weekend looking for a New York style breakfast. The meal exceeded all expectations. The bagels were fresh, the lox reminded of NYC and the ambiance was exactly what I was looking for. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the new location! Having grown up on the East Coast I miss great delis. Luckily I've found Scott's Generations. This is the best corned beef in AZ and the amazing rye bread makes it even better. Can't forget the sour pickles that round out the meal. 

And if you're in the mood for some lox this is the only place where you can get Atlantic salmon versus Pacific. Reminds me of home"}
{"text":"Valley classic, waitress's are like 100 year old honeys, as for real ones, go elsewhere this place is all about the food. Had the hash this morning and like always, fantastic."}
{"text":"I consider myself a pastrami connoisseur.   I experienced Scotts first time through Living Social, $5 for $10 worth before 11 am only.  I had \"hot\" pastrami, but the pastrami was not hot at all, not even warm.   Just room temp, but very lean, even tho I did not order extra lean.  It was terribly salty, and not much peppercorn taste.  I felt the price was quite expensive $10.95 for what you get, and the sandwich was not that big.  The rye bread very soft, the kind that compresses to dough on our meat, when you hold it..  Bread size is the same as an ordinary square loaf of sandwich bread.  The cole slaw was the tiniest serving I'd ever been served in my life.   Wimpy and translucent cabbage, just one tablespoon in one of those tiny \"dipping sauce\" plastic cups for sauce to go, barely wide enough to stick your fork into that tiny cup.  The only thing I really liked, was the  pickles.  
The waitress overcharged me for my sandwich, $12.50 instead of $10.95 it said on the menu.  When I drew that to her attention, she said she was thinking of something else, and apologized.  I'd rather buy pastrami from a deli, a loaf of rye bread, and make my own, even for the $8 I paid with tax and tip ($5 Living Social plus tax and tip).   Not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a place I hadn't been to so I saw this and decided to check it out. As we walked up to the door, some drunk lady was telling us to be careful not to trip over a hose. Well, thank you but where were you when I was 5? Anyways, it's old and dated and it shows. The table had a film on it as well as the menus. The waitstaff was all old school ladies who usually know what's up. Usually. We decided to share a sandwich and got the New York. As stated in the menu, it was piled high with pastrami,
thousand island and cole slaw. It had great flavor and was definitely big enough to share. It came with huge wedged potato fries, a bit more of slaw and a pickle. So far, so good....then....we ordered a bowl of chili. It came out and had onions and cheese slices (like Kraft cheese slices) on top. Ok, we're at a deli. You don't have shredded cheese? Either the cheese was cheap or the chili wasn't hot (both) but that cheese would not melt. We had to ask for ketchup, more tea, crackers, an extra plate and spoons.So....I won't go back there, mainly because it just doesn't seem like anyone cares."}
{"text":"Love this new location clean environment, friendly staff, delicious food what more could you ask for?

Food comes out on me fast timely manner

Lox and bagel sandwich are always a hit very generous portion of the smoked salmon I can't even finish it big enough to share. my kids love the scrambled eggs. I tried the Nova scramble and that's my favorite as of now,  Nice balance of the Salty Fish with the eggs"}
{"text":"We had been very satisfied customers of Scott's when they were in the Cinema Park shopping center.  Always enjoyed their breakfasts and bagels w/lox.  Friendly family staff and no frills.  We were sad to see them close.  Then we saw they gad opened up again in the Madison Village Center near us!  Yippy!  We went down and had a fine breakfast.  The hubby had their famous hash with a bagel and lox spread.  I went to \"American\" toast (aka French toast) with challa bread, butter and syrup.  The food was great just like it always been.  Very ample portion sizes, well prepared and well plated.  The service was great and the new place was clean and inviting.  It was nice to see a lot of local regulars who they knew by name come in and have a nosh.  We are really pleased they have reopened and are close to home.  We will be going back I am sure."}
