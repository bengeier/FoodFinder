{"text":"I Went there a couple of hours ago randomly, and I'm gonna keep this address in mind ! Great food, decent prices ( 22 $ for 3 courses. Salad, steak (incredible by the way) and cheesecake) and really nice waiter."}
{"text":"Saturday 5:30pmWinterlicious2014 seating. $25 prix fixe dinner menu. I chose mussels, gnocchi with lobster and bread pudding. My dinner partner had the lentil soup, stuffed chicken and raspberry bombette. For the price the portion sizes were generous. Very large bowl of mussels. The menu mentioned gnocchi with lobster but I could not find one tiny morsel of lobster meat in my entire dish. Bland and cloying and I could not eat it. The bread pudding was just the right amount of sweet but a little too hard around the edges as if it had just been through the microwave. My partner enjoyed the lentil soup and his chicken dish was tasty and moist. The raspberry bombette was a nice touch of sweet and tarte to finish off his meal. I am not motivated to return."}
{"text":"Do not come here with a large group of people. They can't handle it. We made reservations for a large group for lunch and we all had to wait over an hour for our food. All I ordered was an omlette aka. Spanish Frittata and after waiting an hour, guess what? It sucked! My mind is blown. How can a lame omlette take over an hour? There are so many better places to choose from on Baldwin that I doubt I will be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I stopped by with a friend for Winterlicious and the place was packed and noisy, since there was a large party taking up a third of the restaurant. There was one tiny table available, however, so we squeezed in and sat down. The wait staff were very friendly although it was hard to hear them and ourselves over the raucous party. I ordered the carrot and coconut soup, seafood risotto, and chocolate tarfuto. The soup was nice and sweet. There was a bit of a wait for the main to arrive and when it arrived it was a bit of a letdown. There were three medium-sized shrimp, which is fine, but very little seafood flavour in the dish. There was also a hair in my risotto which put me off. The dessert, however, was quite nice. My tarfuto, which is a chocolate ice cream ball, was cut into quarters and served in a glass dish. My friend got the pie, which was more of a pastry blossom, with ice cream, which she really enjoyed. We were both quite full at the end of the meal. For $15 it was adequate."}
{"text":"Dirty cutlery, undercooked food, miserable staff who need to find new jobs at better restaurants. Highly disappointing. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"So I just had the Winterlicious dinner menu, and what knocked my socks off (much more than the risotto, which was kind of tasteless) was the Cream of Wild Mushroom Soup with truffle oil. I came very close to licking the bowl clean. Sadly, the server said this is not a regular menu item. A shame, since I think I'd come in once a week, just for this incredibly rich and mushroom-y soup. The Grand Marnier crème brûlée was pretty fantastic, too."}
{"text":"3/5. Went for winterlicious. Beet salad and Brie option make great apps. Braised lamb shank was cold and lacked flavour and veggies were undercooked. Dessert options were amazing. Not bad for $15. Get the pasta dishes if you go."}
{"text":"Wow finally a place that offers quality food at a great price!

Came here for winterlicious 2017 and was not disappointed! For $18 the portions were gigantic. Great fried spicy chicken ravioli as an app. For the entree I had the seafood fusilli which came with a half tail lobster, salmon and a generous amount of mussels (10 or 12). I was stuffed but chose the lemon tart.

Service was very good because it's such a small restaurant. It's cozy, and cute. The only downfall is street parking but that's expected.

Will definitely be back for summerlicious. Hopefully they have a patio. They also have everyday prefixed menus which is very promising as well."}
{"text":"Went for a lovely dinner at Valens Restaurant last week.  My partner and I were looking for a location for our wedding rehearsal dinner and decided to check out their prix fixe menu.  The menu covers quite a variety of options at a very affordable price.  (The wine list was also quite reasonable!)
The portions were far more generous than we expected, and we enjoyed each course.  The butternut squash soup with gorgonzola and cinnamon was a surprising combo but quite tasty and we enjoyed our mains of steak and maple salmon.  Creme brulee for dessert was perfect.
Our server Lee was attentive without overcrowding us, and overall we had a very nice experience.  We look forward to our rehearsal dinner on the patio next month."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to eat at Valens today after looking at their Summerlicious menu online. We were so naive to not check out the reviews before actually deciding to eat there...

First of all, I came in and had to slowly walk straight in to the restaurant, past the tables, to the bar/kitchen area to ask a man who was cleaning glasses to be seated. From what I could see, there were only two people working (him, and our server). In the end, there was no greeting upon my arrival.

For appetizers, my sister got the Tuna Bruschetta and I got the Baby Mixed Greens with Goat Cheese, Dried Fruit and Nuts with a Maple Dressing. Our server wasn't exactly rude but she also didn't say a word to us at all. The bruschetta looked amateur with nacho toppings on toasted pieces of baguette. My \"baby mixed greens\" weren't baby mixed greens. It was limp romaine with one spinach leaf and two purple cabbage pieces.

For mains, I ordered the Pan-Roasted Chicken Stuffed with Butternut Squash and Fig Topped With Strawberry Creme. The chicken was dry but I didn't mind because I normally like dry meat (haha). The strawberry creme was visually unappetizing and also notttt good, especially with the chicken and herb roasted potatoes and grilled veggies. It was too sweet and creamy, and reminded me of melted strawberry ice cream. My sister's Pan-Seared Atlantic Salmon with Mixed Nuts Maple Sauce was literally an unseasoned piece of a salmon with the sauce on top (no time for it to marinate or anything).

The dessert was the \"best\" part of the meal but even still, it wasn't anything special. The White Chocolate Lava Cake seemed like a store-bought microwaved cake.

Luckily, for $15, even a mediocre three-course meal was bearable, but I'm glad we paid for a Summerlicious meal, not a regular priced meal."}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch. We ordered asparagus and goat cheese omelette and California eggs benedict. The food was just okay, acceptable, but nothing spectacular. The smoked salmon on eggs Benedict was a bit frozen. However, the side of potatoes and salad were pretty good. Would come back only if in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious lunch and was NOT impressed. First of all, we made a reservation but still had to wait about 20mins. It was cold and we had a large party so we awkwardly waited by the door and felt like we were in the way of everyone. 

If the food was good, I would rate them higher despite the wait, but unfortunately, the food was poor to average. 

Beet Carpaccio - Pretty good, probably the best thing I had there for the whole meal, slightly cooked beets which were not too soft topped with argula and shaved parmesan. Overall pretty nice.

Lamb shank - visually it looked pretty good but when you dig in the lamb was tough! Everyone who ordered this had a tough time eating it, needs to be cooked longer. The lamb shank came with chunky vegetables and roasted potatoes, all of which were SEVERELY UNDER-COOKED, the potatoes and veggies were hard still. How does a professional restaurant not know how to cook veggies and potatoes???? These under-cooked sides were also served with my friend's trout dish.

Trout -  as mentioned before, served with under-cooked potatoes and vegetables and was overcooked, but has a nice caramelized layer so was not a complete fail.

Cheesecake - your average grocery store bakery cheesecake, nothing to write home about.

Overall, service was ok, the servers were prompt and polite, although I had ordered Risotto orginally as my main and they got me lamb shank, a person from our group had ordered the risotto as well, and he got his, and visually the lamb shank looked better than the risotto so I opted to keep the lamb shank (mistake). The risotto from what I saw and heard was average, a bit overcooked, and the seafood they promise in the description is very limited in the dish."}
{"text":"Nice little gem. Server was pleasant and attentive. Food arrived quickly and pasta was very fresh. Really enjoyed the simplicity of fresh ingredients. This not a fast food restaurant, it is a local restaurant. They take pride in providing good food and waiting. I don't mind waiting a few minutes to have delicious food at a good price!"}
{"text":"First impression of valens is they try are a busy summer location due to their great patio spot along Baldwin. Super packed for Summerlicious patrons. 

The service was very quick and courteous, though we felt a bit rushed. Food arrivals could have been timed better as all the courses were brought out while we were still working on the previous dish. I'm not sure if these issues are common, but I'm pretty sure this was primarily due to the Summerlicious crowd. 

The food itself was good, starter of a simple salad with walnuts and cranberries. The main was broiled salmon with roasted peppers and potatoes. Ended off with a simple strawberry panna cotta. The dessert was the only let down of the meal as it was more syrup than strawberry and the panna cotta itself came off as being Pre packaged rather than freshly made  that being said the first two courses were delicious (well presented/prepared). 

Unsure if i would go again but I would not avoid either."}
{"text":"Ended up here after my bicycle tour. Had a salad which was pretty fresh. Excellent spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Situé dans le quartier sympathique de Baldwin Street avec ses cafés et restaurants, Valens est une enseigne qui propose un menu intéressant dans le style pseudo-italien. Nous y sommes passés pendant Winterlicious et chaque plat fut préparé avec soin. Le carpaccio de betterave, certes original, n'était pas à la hauteur de ce qu'il aurait pu être. Le linguini aux fruits de mer était particulièrement apprécié par nos amis. 

Le service était honnête et cordial. Quand nous avons demandé si tel ou tel plat valait le coup, notre serveur fut direct et honnête : \"il y a mieux que le plat X\". Merci !

Seul point d'agacement : pourquoi passer les tables avoisinantes à l'ammoniaque quand nous sommes encore attablés, certes nous avions fini de manger mais cette odeur agressive n'était pas la bienvenue ni par nous ni par ceux qui arrivaient..."}
{"text":"Just had lunch
The tomato soup was great
The fish of the day was amazing
Very nice service"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a small group of friends on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and took a chance on this place - best decision of the weekend!

They have a prix fixe lunch menu for $15 for 3 course meal.  You would think that the menu options would be very sparse but we were delighted they had quite a bit of selection for the apps, entrees and dessert (average of 3 options per course).  

I had the baby spinach salad tossed with roasted walnuts, banana chips, goat cheese and the divine dressing of which name I can't recall, but it was one of the tastiest salads I have had in a while - and I am not even a salad person.  

For the main, I opted for the chicken parmigiana with fettuccine and it was delicious.  The chicken was slightly on the dry side, but that was forgiven as soon as I tasted the delicious tomato sauce it came with.  My bf got the pork loins with mashed potatoes and bok choy, but liked mine much better.

For dessert, I got the strawberry cheesecake (other choices were vanilla ice cream and creme brulee). The presentation was nice, but the taste was meh.  I liked the creme brulee better and will be getting it next time.

The feel of this place is very cozy, it's small so ideal for a quiet date and they play relaxing music that slightly touches on lounge music but not yet there.  It also doesn't stand out much since it's nestled in along the strip of other restaurants in the area so make sure to look for it.

Can't wait to come back to this place again and try the items on the brunch menu."}
{"text":"I was passing by and looked at their Sunday lunch special. They have half lobster tail and shrimp pasta, in addition to delicious salad for$15. I didn't finish reading the menu. The food food was delicious more than what I expected from this little place. The music and service was excellent. Best decision ever. Very happy."}
{"text":"I came here for a Winterlicious and had a really solid experience. It's a a homey, comfortable spot if you're looking a home-style meal, huge portions and a decent price. I got the lamb shank from the winterlicious menu and would recommend it again to anyone. It was tender and flavourful and just what you need on a cold winter night. 

I went in thinking it would be mediocre, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dishes and combined with the price and portion size, I would give it a 4/5 and would definitely recommend it to someone if they're looking for a cozy spot."}
{"text":"Came for winterlicious. Food was good quality and delicious, the mussels came in a large proportion too. There was one waiter and he did a might fine job checking in with everyone. He greeted us immediately when we came in and nothing was delayed. Will come back :)"}
{"text":"Made reservations for Winterlicious, walked into Valens and we were seated promptly. The two servers working were incredibly friendly, helpful, fast and overall very pleasant. They would check up on us often and we were taken care of very well despite the restaurant filling up quickly throughout our meal. They were very knowledgeable about the menu and all the various components of the Prix Fixe options. 

The appetizer was fresh and delightful, entree was cooked to perfection and very tasty, and the dessert came out piping hot from the oven with a creamy delicious vanilla ice cream scoop! Ahh, it was all very lovely. We will definitely be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"3.5/5
We worked up an appetite after spending the afternoon at AGO (Art Gallery of Ontario). Took a gander in the cafe and Frank's restaurant, but nothing there peaked our interest. Me being vaguely familiar with Baldwin street and the restaurants they have to offer, we decided to walk there. We stumbled upon this restaurant, looked at their Winterlicious menu and it sounded good, so we got in. It's a quaint place and it was somewhat busy. I was worried they wouldn't be able to take my girlfriend and I because we didn't book a reservation, especially it being Winterlicious. We were greeted by a male waiter, who asked if we booked a res, I said No, and he said to wait for a couple minutes to see what he can do. Shortly thereafter, he seated us at a two top. The table was placed by the coffee station, close to the bar. We didn't mind at all. We were just grateful they were able to seat us. I got the Soup of The Day, which was a wild mushroom soup. The plate wasn't anything special to look at, presentation-wise, but the taste was outstanding. I wanted a second bowl! For the main course, I got the Veal Osso Buco. Which was served with roasted potatoes and steamed vegetables. Veal was tender, potatoes and vegetables were nicely seasoned. I've never tried Osso Buco before, so this was my first time trying it. I heard good things about it, but just never had the chance to try it until now. It was good. The bone marrow is what I loved most about it. For dessert, I got the Mocha Tartufo. I was disappointed with this dish, because it didn't taste much like mocha and there was coconut. I like coconut, but I wish it specified that. My girlfriend got the Warm White Chocolate Lava Cake with vanilla ice cream and she loved it. I should've got that instead. I'm rating this a 3.5/5 because the sauce I had with the Osso Buco was the same exact sauce as the main dish my girlfriend got, which was the Lamb Shank. You would think for two different dishes, they'd have their own distinct sauce. And the Tartufo was below average. Other than that, the experience, friendly service, and food were great!"}
{"text":"Servers and staff are friendly and nice. Beyond that I don't know how this place is still running? 

Save your $ and go to some of the better options along the street! Baldwin village is dotted with so many mediocre joints thanks to readily available business."}
{"text":"We went to Valens for Winterlicious. Although we made our reservations a month in advance they made us wait at the door (where it was absolutely freezing) for quite sometime till they figured out the seating arrangement. Once seated, we couldn't even take our coats off. Felt like we were seated in a refrigerator, the heating was on low. I looked around the restaurant and everyone was bundled up and shivering. Finally someone complained I think, so they turned the heat up. 

For starters we ordered mussels and carpaccio. Mussels were good, but the bread they gave us to soak up the broth was stale and cold. The carpaccio was a little chewy, very average. For the main course we wanted to order the lamb shank but they only had one left. So I ordered the veal, my cousins ordered the steak, seafood fettuccini and one lamb shank. Thank the lord for that because the lamb shank turned out to be the worst of the lot. It had a strong smell and wasn't close to melting off the bones. My veal was ok but the mashed potatoes were heavy and clumped up like glue.

Turned off by the main course, we were quite skeptical about the dessert. However that turned out to be the best part of the meal. We ordered the creme brulee and the banana cake. The creme brulee was delicious and the portion was large (not in the usual sized ramekin). The banana cake was moist and flavourful. I could actually taste the real banana pieces.

Overall I'd say if the dessert wasn't good I think I'd give this place a rating of 1 star. But the dessert made an impact on me so based on that I'm giving it a two."}
{"text":"Great food for vegetarians ans meat eaters. Could be a little pricey for students but the prix fixe menu is a great option. Wait staff are very professional and good humored."}
{"text":"Arrived shortly after 5:00pm on a Wednesday evening. Patio had room for 6 tables and we were lucky to grab one in the sunlight so we could enjoy the warm weather.

We each ordered the Valens burger ($12). The meat was very tender and it was accompanied by a large side salad (or fries if you choose).

Service was friendly, but we did find that it took a while for the food to come out.

Maybe not the first choice on Baldwin St. but overall good patio space and wide selection of  menu items."}
{"text":"Popular even on this slushy day, Valens is a smallish italianish mid-price restaurant that seems to be a go-to for nearby hospital and healthcare staff. We had a sumptuous prix fixe lunch ($22) that pleased all around. We sampled salads, soup, pasta, butter chicken, lamb chops and cheesecake; all get thumbs up.

I'll come back."}
{"text":"Stumbled here for lunch after some post apartment hunting exhaustion.  Sat on the patio outside.  Server and staff were SUPER friendly, attentive and welcoming.  I had a greek salad.  My meal was fresh and light and perfectly portioned for lunch.  DEFINITELY will return for a dinner service sometime soon."}
{"text":"I was there for brunch the first day it opened and I wasn't disappointed, but neither was it anything special. Their brunch menu save for their eggs benedict is served all week long.

The second time I went there with a group of friends, and everyone loved it. The cocktails are decently priced (7$), and their chocolate lava cake is to die for. A friend said their steak burger was a bit too fatty, another friend said the grilled salmon was delicious, the fries that come with their burgers are yummy, and I loved the rose sauce on my pasta.

The service is great and very friendly. Valens isn't anything spectacular, but it's a great spot for a variety of different choices at a decent price. I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Ordered from their $28 prix fixe menu. They have it all year round.
Got mussels, medium 12oz T-bone steak, and chocolate lava cake.

They do not skimp on the portions. You get this massive plate of mussels. Well, they are mussels I suppose so a full plate doesn't mean that much, but there were at least a dozen there. The curry sauce that came with it gave it a nice flavour.

The steak was alright. It was a cooked a bit more than I was expecting, and some parts were kind of tough or chewy.
The mashed potatoes and vegetables on the side were pretty good.

Lava cake was satisfactory.
Others had ordered creme brulee and it came in this massive soup dish, which was interesting to see.

Overall, I found it alright. If you're looking for a nice place to enjoy dinner this is an option. Then get more ice cream next door."}
{"text":"I knew I had to try this place right after I saw that the former restaurant \"Gateways of India\" closed down and signs for \"Valens - opening soon\" were put up. They had been opened for less than a week when I walked in for a meal. I'm a big fan of the general feel of Baldwin Village restaurants and had high hopes for this. 

Upon entering it's easy to spot that this meal was not going to be cheap, the place looks very nice and clean, not too large, Italian-like wall deco and a fully stocked bar at the end of the dining space.

Now to their menu, they have a big selection of food from all sorts of cuisine types! You can start off with a Hungarian soup, Italian appetizers and end up with Indian, Chinese, Italian or something off their salads/wraps and grill options! 

I'm always a little hesitant to be too excited by the large variety and this time I didn't feel any different. I went with their Soup of the day a beef goulash (the only soup option they have, also the cheapest appetizer item at $5) and their Shanghai Kung Pao noodle dish (both pictured) for $15. Most menu items were on the range of $14 - $19
I have to say that I was not overly impressed with either item. They were both good, but I was expecting more, and the main dish was in a bath of sauce. Very filling though I might add!

For being in a street that provides good food at a reasonable cost, Valens really needed to be great for it to stand out for me. But at the same time, Baldwin is full of restaurants stuck on just one type of cuisine, so a new joint that has a bit of everything (no sushi, but that's not a bad thing since it's Baldwin) might be just what Baldwin Village needs for those indecisive"}
{"text":"Was walking by in the rain on a Sunday and decided to stop in and try it. 
Definitely one of the better decisions I've made!!! 
Had the lunch special which was a 3 course meal. 
Lentil soup for starter, pork loin for main and creme brûlée for dessert. 
Sister had the salad, with banana chips and  the lobster penne and cheesecake for dessert. 
Huge portions! All of it was Absolutely delicious. 
The creme brûlée was beyond expectations and actually made me have a moment. 
The restaurant is small and cozy and the music selection was a nice mix of interesting  non lyric beats. The waiter was quiet the food was quick. 
I definitely will be back to try more and give their extensive martini list a go!"}
{"text":"This place is a cute small little restuarant hidden in the neighbourhood. The staff is super friendly. The inside is quite small so it can get a little too cramped. They have an outside sitting area. I got their escargot as my appetizer and it was made with cream of mushroom. The pieces were tender and so flavourful. We then got the tiger shrimp risotto and lamb shank. The risotto had lots of shrimp, figs, walnut, and squash. It came out so fresh and yummy. The ingredients gave it an amazing texture. My mom said the lamb was good but it could be braised a little longer. None the less the flavour was still good. Overall, the portions were huge, staff were friendly and tendative, and food came out hot. I definitely recommend making reservations if you come in a group of 2 or more."}
{"text":"We walked in here for a late afternoon meal the other day, more specifically for the steak sandwich that my friend had been raving about. We ordered said steak sandwich and it was scrumptious-- the steak was a perfectly cooked medium-rare and came with a generous side of fries. We shared the sandwich and fries, it was enough to feed us both and the price for the portion size was very reasonable. The atmosphere is very clean and hip, and the service was good. The waiter was totally cute and had an accent.  I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a late Sunday afternoon lunch.  The food took quite a long time to come out, but when it did, it definitely hit the spot.  I ordered the lamb shank, which had ample tomato sauce and tasted delicious.  My friend, who ordered the caesar salad, was quite pleased with her meal as well.  I also observed many interesting offerings on the menu that I wouldn't mind trying on subsequent trips."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to go for your summerlicious/winterlicious fix. For $28, the dinner portions should leave you full, although I found the taste to be really memorable. 

Something to note: my friend ordered her steak rare and pretty much got it 75% cooked. When we told the server, she was very accommodating and cooked it \"blue\" which was basically the steak seared on the bottom and top. Unfortunately, I forgot her name, but she definitely deserves a S/O! 

PEI Mussels: more on the salty end, but a very gracious serving! 

Free Range Supreme Chicken: decent chicken, nothing really memorable except that it was not dry. I really liked the veggies that came with it though. 

Tiramisu: also, not bad at all. Nothing that really pops, but a nice sweet end to a meal. 

Overall, I would say the food is a 3/5 - nothing that stands out, but hey, nothing wrong with it either. The extra star is definitely for the accommodating customer service given to my friend to make her dish just the way she wanted it; especially during summerlicious."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere (busy but not loud on a weekday evening) of Baldwin Street.  Almost all restaurants along the street have patios.  They are small but comfortable.  Picked Valens because its $22 prix fix menu attracts me.  I ordered the smoked chicken and sweet potato soup as appetizer, rack of lamb for main course and lava cake with whipped cream and vanilla ice-cream for dessert.  Ended up, I was very satisfied with my meal: 

- Very affordable price.  
- Very friendly and attentive service.  
- Good food though the portion is way too big for me.  The soup tasted good and was freshly made...very hot.  The lamb meat is very tender.  I have been craving for lava cake for a while and it did not disappoint me:)

I deducted one star because of the drink I ordered from the cocktail list.  The Blue Hawaiian is a bit too sweet.  The washroom located in the basement is clean and tidy but the deep stairsteps killed me while I was wearing high heels lol."}
{"text":"Made reservations here for Winterlicious with a friend for Saturday.  It was only a few days before, so I was happy they fit us in.  Sure seems like they messed up the reservations though, because when we got there they couldn't find the reservation.  Happily, they sat us anyway in the busy restaurant.  I saw a party of 2 come in later and overheard that they had a reservation but there were no tables.  Ours was a 4 top, so they ended up pulling the second table away so they could sit the other people.  Another large group had come in afterward that were waiting for a long time before they got a table.  They appeared annoyed after awhile so I'm guessing they also had a reservation and the restaurant screwed it up.

Despite being happy that they sat us, that happiness quickly dissipated  as we waited way too long to get a drink or have our order taken.  The waiters walked by and looked directly at our table and then would walk away.  A couples times I saw them looking around the room to see if anyone needed anything, but they did not come over to take our order.  I sure felt like we were more of a nuisance than anything.  Someone finally came by and brought us water (after a table that had come in after us got their water, placed their order and got bread).  We weren't asked if we wanted something else to drink though - it was just a quick, drop off the water and leave.  Quite awhile after that we finally placed our order.  

I ordered the salad - it was good, but nothing spectacular.  My friend got the soup and said it was really good, but only warm.

For the main I had been craving risotto and was going to get it and at the last second changed to the lamb.  Boy was I ever disappointed.  From looking at other people's plates, the risotto didn't look great, but probably better than the lamb.  The lamb was way overcooked.  The vegetables on the other hand were under cooked.  I was trying to cut into one as well and it was so under cooked it flung out from under my knife and got sauce all over my new sweater.  I was trying to dip my napkin into my water to get the stain out of my sweater.  I saw some of the waiters looking at me, but did they offer assistance, some more water or napkin?  Nope.  Just ignored me.  

Now with this awful review, some might be asking why I would give this place 2 stars.  While I was not pleased with my experience, nor would I come here again, for the amount of food we got, the meal was only $15.  More importantly though, the apple blossom dessert...that was the saving grace.  After a quite awful meal, that apple blossom finished off the meal with a smile.  It was nice and warm.  The crust was delicious and the scoop of ice cream on top was perfect."}
{"text":"A small restaurant located on Baldwin street a few minutes north of AGO.  I came here last Winterlicious and all those I invited really enjoyed their meal.  This year was good but wasn't as good as last year.  I reserved a table for 1:30pm on a Sunday and the table wasn't ready until 20 minutes after.  So we had to wait outside in the cold for a table to be free.  Once we got in the restaurant, it was packed like canned sardines.  Was hard to have conversations with others at our table because the noise was too loud with all the diners at the restaurant.  The staff looked overworked but were still attentive at providing service for our meal.  Food came out really fast around 10 minutes to get all our appetizers.  Entrees and desserts came out quick as well after each course.  They definitely didn't want us to stay too long.  Some food items were better than others but nothing I tried was memorable.  

Deep Fried Spicy Chicken Ravioli with truffle pesto mayo.  Had good flavours with a crunchy exterior and a hint of spice which I liked.  The ravioli filling seemed overpowered by the exterior seasoning and truffle pesto mayo. 

Wild Mushrooms on Garlic Crostini topped with shaved grana padano cheese.  Portion size was a tad small and tastes wasn't special unless you are an expert into the fine flavours of mushrooms and cheese. 

Fusilli Pasta with half-lobster tail, Atlantic salmon, mussels, and spinach in a rosé sauce.  I enjoyed this entree a lot.  The lobster was a little overcooked but tasted fresh.  Size was decent considering the price of the Winterlicious.  Mussels and salmon went well with the lobster.  Pasta was cooked to how I like it and sauce was more tomato than cream.   
Strawberry Cheesecake.  Was a standard cheesecake with strawberry syrup on top.  Not too sweet and crust was good.

Warm White Chocolate Lava Cake with vanilla ice cream.  Was cool seeing steam around it, but there was no white chocolate lava inside.  Tasted overcooked and seemed more like a chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.

Most dishes the portion size was good and for $18 it was good value. This is a good place to go if you are hungry and want a none fancy/casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious with a reservation for 10 people. They made us wait for a table, but couldn't get one together to fit us all so they split up the group. There was another group of 10 they seated together so was pretty peeved about that. 

Food was decent though - especially for $25. Three course meal, huge portions. Left feeling quite full. Would recommend for winterlicious. 

There are just a couple of details that keep this place from being better than it is. Besides not having the foresight to actually hold a reservation for a table, they also forgot to bring utensils and I had to ask multiple times, and their steak knives are duller than their butter knives."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2017. A delicious meal and we will be back!

Specifically we tried chicken ravioli (delish), mushroom crostini (OK...), fusilli pasta (good for seafood lovers), lamb shank and osso buco (well cooked), parmigiana (a hearty portion!).

For dessert we had tiramisu, very solid. Not the best, but hey, nobody is perfect, alright?"}
{"text":"4.5/5 but this place deserves better reviews so I have rounded up to 5/5.

I had the $25 prix fixe menu. The curry mussels starter taste wise was about a 7/10 however the portion was huge; I received about 30 mussels. My friend said his ceasar salad was great.

The lamb shank was a massive portion and it came out piping hot. The sauce was great, the side veggies and potatoes were standard fare. 8.5/10.

The banana chocolate cake was great and the portion was about what I would expect for a $25 prix fixe menu. 8.5/10

Overall the food was a solid four stars however the value for money and portion sizes are excellent. The server was friendly although she appeared a bit absent minded. 

I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It's a new restaurant on Baldwin Village!  Therefore I had to go.  Apparently, it's been here for quite some time - but I've never have seemed to notice it.

Anyhow, I found the format of the place to be very similar to Sambuca Grill next door.  They had a prix fixe menu, so I ended up getting the samosas, lamb rack, and cheesecake.

The samosas were fairly disappointing because it seemed like they just took frozen ones and cooked them.  The lamb rack was great with the panko crust and the mint sauce that complimented it.  The cheesecake was delicious as well -- but I was dying by the time I had to finish it because there was just too much food.  It's a great deal though - $22 for the prix fixe -- but definitely TOO much food.

Service was okay.  The waitress was nice in the beginning and for some reason had a bit more attitude as time went on. Perhaps we were getting loud?  I\"m not sure."}
{"text":"Review for their $28 Prix Fixe Dinner

Environment:
Located near Chinatown and the Kensington market, Valens is at a really vibrant spot near lots of restaurants and unique shops. 
The restaurant has a covered patio at the front and more indoor seatings at the back. The patio is only good for groups of 4 or fewer, and since we reserved for a party of 14, we ended up split into 2 big tables indoor.

Food:
I got the Mussels to start. I was surprised by how big the portion was when the server brought me my food and I really liked the unique paring of curry sauce with the mussels. 
For main, I got the T Bone Steak cooked medium rare. Once again, the portion was massive, but the meat was more cooked than I would have liked. Also, the meat was too tough that I struggled I cut the meat.
As for my dessert, I chose the Creme Brulee. It was the largest Creme Brulee I've ever seen! It was literally served to be from a soup bowl. However, the cream was thicker than I would have like.

Service:
I think the server got slightly annoyed of our big group lol, but that's understandable. She offered fresh pepper and cheese to be sprinkled on the dishes, and came over every once in a while to check up on us and add water"}
{"text":"Very high cost for food that is prepared very cheaply. We ordered a risotto and what came was more like a congee. The ingredients were not fresh. We also ordered a pasta dish and I believe the sauce was from a can. Everything seemed very cheap."}
{"text":"Great service! I loved the marinara muscles, my husband preferred the curry ones... Both the pasta and the steak were fantastic! Great fixed-price menu option. Love the neighborhood and the ambience, what a fantastic evening."}
{"text":"We went to Valens for Sunday brunch, and it was wonderful. Our server was super personable and attentive, and the food was awesome. I would absolutely recommend this place and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious. Good start with escargot, terrible risotto entree (all the flavors clashed and the dish came out too sweet in the end), and okay tiramisu. Husband had lamb that was decent. Most servers were friendly but one server was rude. Refused to seat us inside, and when it began raining on us, asked if we were staying. Not, \"Would you like to move to another table?\"  Literally, \"Are you staying?\""}
{"text":"The place needs a little bit of renovating. Restaurant is little bit old styled. Sadly, the washroom looks more updated than the main floor. 

Anyhow, let's talk about the food! The food here is great! Had mussels and escargot and they were really savory. For main, I ordered the rack of lamb. The lamb portion I thought was really small. Their osso bucco though was huge so I thought that was a little bit unfair. Booooo. Just kidding! Desserts were pretty generous too specially the brulee. 

Service was less energetic but I guess it's probably the weather."}
{"text":"I came here during the winterlicious event.  The restaurant is decently size for such a neighbourhood.  Close to chinatown on spadina and dundas,  this restaurant is located in a very boutique area of Toronto.   They do dim out the lights so it is dark inside.   

For the appetizer,  I ordered the salad with prosciutto.  Out of the whole appetizer menu, this was the best one to choose from.   It included melon, spinach and olives.   It was a great combination and almost felt full from it.  For my main dish,  I ordered the lamb steaks.   The sauce was nice and the lamb was ok as well.  It wasn't mindblowing but it wasn't bad either.  For the dessert, i got the fruit yogurt parfait.  It was a more artistic dish.   It was pretty good but it wasn't big at all.

I left satisfied for the price/food ratio.  I would visit again."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and had a pleasant experience both times. The first time I tried their prix fixe lunch menu and ordered a Caesar salad, chicken parmigiana, and cheesecake. The Caesar salad was absolutely delicious and was a very generous portion. I believe the dressing is made in-house, and was very tasty. The chicken parmigiana lacked some flavor, but still good. Cheesecake was a standard store-bought slice, but delicious nonetheless. For $23, it was very worth it. My only complaint was that the advertised price for some of their items were not the actual price. On their board outside the prix fixe lunch was priced at $20, with mimosas priced at $3/each. When my friend and I got the bills, the prix fixe was $23, and mimosas were $4/each. The waitress had said that there was an increase in price, and they just forgot to change the board outside (which sounded sketchy but whatever).

My second time there I ordered a pizza. Very decent size, but the flavor wasn't as good as I had hoped. Overall it's a decent restaurant if you're interested in trying something new!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty generous rating considering the experience. I came here for summerlicious lunch on a Sunday and called in to make a reservation beforehand. When my friend got to the restaurant they said they hadn't received my reservation and sat him at the worst table pretty much right by the kitchen in the back. When I got there I looked at the table and decided nope not happening and asked them to move us to a different table because I had made a reservation beforehand and they lost it, which they did agree to after.
The escargot starter was a great first impression but the main lamb shank and smoked salmon quiche were not a good followup. The lamb shank tasted like it was soaked in ketchup and the side of mashed potatoes it came with tasted like it came out of a flour packet. The smoked salmon we thought would be a piece of fish but it was actually a quiche as that part was written in tiny font at the very end on the menu. For dessert the creme brulee and tiramisu were also nothing to write home about.
Would not come back here again unless all the Italian places around baldwin suddenly closed down."}
{"text":"My brother and I ended up on Baldwin after not being able to decide on a place for dinner. We stopped to check out the menu at Valens and ended up deciding to try it (he'd eaten there once before and said it was good). 

We came in just before 7 on a Saturday and the restaurant was empty. Like other reviewers noted, it was rather empty for the entire time we were there. One other table came in about 10 minutes after we arrived and another came in just as we were having dessert. 

We both ended up going for the Prix-Fixe menu. I had the California Salad to start, which was a rather nice beginning to my meal. A little bit too much of the fairly sweet pomegranate dressing on a pretty plain salad but it was good just the same.

 I ended up having the rack of lamb as my main, which was excellent! The lamb was cooked very well, nice crispy and flavorful outside. A very cute little tower of mashed potatoes, plenty of super yum gravy and a nice mix of vegetables on the side. The main was one of those meals that makes you stop in the middle of eating and go \"wow\". I was really impressed with my meal. I was afraid I wouldn't be hungry enough for dessert but the portion was just right. My brother had the paella and I got the chance to try some and it was fantastic as well. Great flavor, some good heat to it as well and a really fresh taste. He noted that he'd had paella at a place in the city that was known for the paella and his meal at Valens was way better.

For dessert I ended up going with creme brulee and it was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but I liked how it was served, in a fairly wide bowl, giving a good ratio of sugar to creme. My main issue with it was that it wasn't a consistent temperature throughout. Part of it was rather warm and then it got cold again towards the middle. Odd...

We got very good service, the one server that was working had a good balance, not too intrusive but she didn't disappear for long periods of time either. I had a cocktail and my brother had two glasses of wine and our bill came to around $75 total. Not bad for a nice meal out with drinks. 

I'd definitely come back here, especially for a date (as Vivek suggests) or with people who may have varying tastes as the menu seems to have quite a bit on it. I did like how nice and quiet it was and how there was no sense of being rushed AT ALL. The excellent service and the lamb pushed this review to a four for me."}
{"text":"We made reservations and came here with a few friends from work for lunch.  We had our table waiting for us and although the service was slow considering they were very busy in there, it was worth the wait!  

Big portions, great tasting food, great price!

I had the spicy chicken ravioli appetizer (which wasn't warm or hot but it was tasty), the lamb shank main (sauce was delicious, fresh vegetables were great and lamb fell off bone easily)and the lava cake with ice cream (which was nice and warm and delicious).  

A few of the girls at the table ordered the seafood fusilli which they all loved.  The risotto was also very good I heard and the salads they ordered to start was good too.  

All 5 of us loved our 3 course meal and would return for sure!"}
{"text":"Valens Restaurant is a decent new(ish) (almost a year now, but new compared to the other Baldwin classics) restaurant with a variety of cuisines but an overall Italian feel. 

I went here for dinner on a Saturday night, and the place was surprisingly absolutely empty! Have way through our meal, another group came in, but that was it. Because of that, I'm not sure how much longer Valens will last...  

That being said, the food wasn't bad at all. I started with a lobster dip (oo so delicious and unhealthy), and had the Rose Fusili as my main. We has a few people make minor changes to our meals (mine, shrimp instead of chicken, another, no mushrooms in the paella), and they were easily able to accommodate us. The prices for the place seemed about right, with the app being $10, and my main at $14. 

The service and atmosphere was also quite nice, it looks like a nice, upscale place (without really high prices) and our servers were quite friendly and attentive. 

Overall, this place is good, but nothing special. If you're with an indesisive group with a large variety of tastes, it could be a great spot because it doesn't really have a \"focused\" menu, or if you're looking for a quiet place with no wait on a Saturday night. If you're in the area, you could do worse than Valens!"}
{"text":"A Winterlicious choice made by a friend and I unwittingly went along with it.

We arrived around 7pm to a very quiet dining room and after receiving menus, it still took about 10-15 min. before the one server came for our food order

We ordered the mussels appetizer, strip loin and seafood pasta mains and creme brulee desserts.

The mussels arrived first and were a very hearty size.  The sauce was delish, off to a decent start despite the slower service.  

Mains were also a generous size.  I had ordered my strip loin as medium rare but it definitely came well done.  For such a thin piece of meat, medium rare would have been difficult.  I found my main to be quite heavy on the salt content on the meat and mashed potatoes/veggie accompaniment.

Dessert was most impressive...creme brulee served in a soup bowl, not in its standard ramekin size.  Nice way to finish off the meal.

Service throughout was an issue here...there was only one server for 6-7 tables.  She spent a lot of time fixing menus in the back, rather than helping customers.  We arrived at 7pm and didn't leave until 9pm!  I don't think it was a meal that needed TWO hours!  

I'm not a big 'Licious fan to begin with and I always have lowered expectations.  I was hoping to be wrong about Valens and disappointed that it wasn't better.  Also note that they have a reg. prix fixe menu outside of 'Licious events."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during Winterlicious. I must give credit to Valens because their menu is on the cheaper end ($18 for lunch) yet they still offer lamb shank, veal, lobster w/ pasta--some \"high end\" dishes. Despite the nice selection, I found the experience to be very....meh.

I ordered the mushroom crostini with grana padano cheese on top. The flavours were there... but was nothing spectacular, and I wish there was a little more than 3 pieces. My friend told me they offered an escargot crostini last summerlicious; wish they hadn't replaced it with mushroom. I had a bite of my friend's Deep fried chicken ravioli. It tasted quite dry and resembled a chicken nugget more than anything.

For my main course I ordered the Veal Osso Buco with tomato sauce and red wine. I found it quite tough and dry, and the sauce did not have any red wine taste to it. It was pretty disappointing. I had a few bites of my friend's lamb shank (in the same sauce) and although it was more tender than my veal, I still felt it was missing that \"off the bone\" tenderness and yummy lamb taste. 

Lastly, I had the warm white chocolate lava cake. This was quite good; the white chocolate centre and vanilla ice cream really balanced out the sweetness of the chocolate cake. It was also very wam and soft, but it seemed like it was heated last minute in the microwave. It was still a nice finish to the meal.

Overall, the food was quite mediocre and since the tables were all very close to one another, I felt very cramped during my dining experience. Although they had a cheap menu, I don't know if I would visit again if they continue to serve this menu. Perhaps I will try their summerlicious next time since I've heard their mussels are quite good."}
{"text":"Had the prix fixe dinner with a friend. We got the mussels, steak, butter chicken, creme brulee, and some macha ice cream. We found the broth for the mussels was too salty but other than that, the food was delicious and portion sizes were on point. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious for it's appealing and cheap dinner menu - although you get a lot in terms of portion sizing, the quality isn't the best. 

They started with giving us some bread with oil and balsamic vinegar, but the bread was quite heavy and would have been better warm.

I chose the mussels, steak and creme brulee for my dinner. 
The mussels could have been cooked a bit longer, but the sauce was good and had hints of Asian spices. 
The steak was good too - my only problem was the lack of consistency. Three of us asked for medium steaks and only one was a true medium, the others were well done and medium rare. 
The biggest issue was the creme brulee. Although it's an extremely generous portion, it tasted more like curdled eggs while the barely carmelized top didn't pass the crack test. 

I really want to like Valens; the menu was promising but the delivery was lack luster."}
{"text":"We wandered into Valens this past weekend as it was a beautiful day in Toronto and their patio was one of the only ones still open. 

We were very impressed with the food and the service. I had eggs Benedict (which was Amazing!!) and my boyfriend had the chicken parmigiana which was also excellent.

The portions are huge and the pricing is also really inexpensive for downtown Toronto. Our server was also very friendly and attentive. 

Overall, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We went there for the $18 Summerlicious lunch. 

The tables were crowded inside. They had a patio area, but we sat inside. The washroom is single and the floor was wet. They should clean it before opening for service. 

Happy: The company that I had lunch with. So definitely not the food at all!!   

Soup - salty and warm. I like it hot (temperature wise). 

Entree - the risotto was sweet which was unexpected. I just ate the shrimp of it and left the dish untouched. It had a certain spice that I didn't like. My partner also didn't like it. The dishes were not hot eaither. 

Dessert - a plate for a creme brûlée???? I've never seen that before. The worse is that it was not soft and silky and the hard sugar on top was not great to taste either. The worse dessert in my life!! 

Verdict: Indeed I'm never going back!! Even if it's for free. Definitely was still hungry!!"}
{"text":"A rarely-busy resto in Baldwin Village. Use this to your advantage as it's a decent place to go on a date. The lighting is dim, the atmosphere is \"smoove\" (marble top tables, easy listening on the airwaves), and the service is just attentive enough. You won't mind if you're only one of a few couples in here. 

Valens's menu is centred around Italian fare but they have a variety of different cuisines represented. Their wine list is made up of options from mostly Niagara and California, and they also offer basic cocktails. I wasn't knocked out of my seat.

For dinner I enjoyed a lamb shank ($22) with mashed potatoes and roast vegetables a butternut squash and almond soup to start ($6). The name of the soup sounds better than it actually was. I felt like they might have even used a chicken stock as the base (can't be sure though). At any rate, it wasn't in my top ten butternut squash soups list. The lamb shank was meaty, tender, and a sizeable portion. Really enjoyed the peppercorn gravy it was served with. 

Other than that, I think Susan G nailed it in her review: \"a quiet place with no wait on a Saturday night\" that serves reasonably priced and good food.

Obligatory Title Pun: Table for TU, BRUTE?

Menu Readability: Very plain. Serif typeface. Probably Roman.

Need to mention: Valens (328-378), was a Roman Emperor who led his army to a catastrophic defeat in the Battle of Adrianople.

What this place teaches me about myself: It sounds weird to say I'm boning up on my Roman history, doesn't it?"}
{"text":"A cute family style Italian restaurant. We came on a weekday night so it was quite empty. Service is good, but the food took a little long to come. I had the seafood linguine and it was an amazing deal! It was around $20, but was a large portion with plenty of seafood. My friend got the 3 course menu - curry steamed mussels (huge portion, but the curry was not strong enough), a T bone steak (huge potion cooked beautifully with a generous side of mashed potatoes and vegetables), and a chocolate lava cake (the contrast between the hot cake and cold vanilla ice cream was pleasant, but the hot itself was a tad overcooked. There wasn't that oozing chocolate centre. 

This place is a hidden restaurant! The prices are cheap for the amount of food. $30 for a 3 course dinner with huge portions, where can you find that!"}
{"text":"Visited for dinner one evening while on travels in Toronto. Fairly \"classic\" Italian menu; well prepared risotto, pasta and fish. Sad part is the waitress belongs in a different profession and the manager was not on premises for redress. Overall experience was tarnished by the poor service--no water refills, \"how's your food\", no contact at all--incredible, really, given the compact space of this restaurant and the numerous times she passed by the table."}
{"text":"I was heading into my usual go-to restaurant, when I spotted this nearby restaurant, serving nice-smelling food to customers on their patio.  I did a U-turn and checked out their menu out in front.  I went inside, to ask if their gnocchi (potato dumplings) was made on the premises - and confirmed that it was.  Mmm... nothing like fresh gnocchi...

I ordered take-out.  Cutlery was similar to that of a fast-food joint, all sealed up in a plastic bag.  

The food itself was o.k.  I wondered if their cream sauce was the right base, for their tricoloured fresh gnocchi.  Maybe a marinara, or other light tomato base sauce would better suit this dish.  

Came with a side salad, with some nice dressing.

I remember the meal including some garlic bread, and asked the waitress if she could confirm that it'd be included for take out.  Some warmed up bread was, but it wasn't garlic bread.  Just a slice of warmed up toasted bread.

Service was generally good, but I wondered if my main server (it was her first day at Valens that day), was offended that I didn't tip since I was ordering take out?
She seemed decided distant after I gave her the bill.  Otherwise, she started off warm, chatty.

Wait-time for the food was reasonable.

Sure, I'd try this place out again.  At some point, if it worked out that way.

It's not my regular hotspot, but perhaps I'll land there on impulse again sometime.

 Lunchtime was busy, btw..."}
{"text":"Review for $18 summerlicious lunch menu

Recommend dish: anything for starter, lamb shank for main, creme brulee / lava cake for dessert

I went here for summerlicious because my friend highly recommends this place. However, I only find certain items on the menu worth the price.
I ordered lamb shank for main and I found it worth it. However, my friend order smoke salmon which has such small portion. Maybe ask the waitress for advice when ordering the dish.
The food here I found it is ok. I like the dessert the best. The creme brulee come in a big plate. The lava cake tastes pretty good.
I would recommend eating here for summerlicious if you order lamb shank for main."}
{"text":"Our friend took us out to this restaurant.  Server was sweet and helpful.  I had the veal chop wtih red pepper bourbon sauce.  Taste was excellent, tender bourbon texture taste, yummy.  Great area to eat,  very diversified restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"My friends mentioned that they had a good experience with this restaurant so i wanted to see what the fuss is about.  I went for their preset menu.  $28 for 3 courses.  
For appertizer i ordered PEI mussels with leeks and plum tomatoes in a curry sauce.  A large plate of mussels came pretty quickly after my order and i was pleasantly surprised by the generous portions.  Loved the flavours of the mussels in the sauce.  Highly recommended!
For my main course, i decided on their 12 ounce T-Bone steak with red wine peppercorn sauce that came with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies.  Everything was tasty.  Unfortunately the steak was over cooked to well done when i requested for medium.  My friends who ordered the same entree had the same issue. The wait staff did not come back to make sure how our food was, so we couldn't give any feed back.
For dessert, i ordered teramisu.   It was really good and you can truly taste the alcohol in the light mixed.  It could do with a little less sweetness,  but i guess that is the nature of desserts.  But still, i enjoyed it.
Valens is definitely on my list of revisit.  I hope somehow the chef will take more care with cooking the steaks in the future, and that the wait staff can be more attentive.  Other than that, Valens is good."}
