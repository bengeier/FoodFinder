{"text":"We ordered from here this evening and loved it. The food was terrific and fresh, service was friendly and the prices were very reasonable.  The chicken balls were more chicken than dough, which is rare. Everything was flavoured very well and the portions were generous!  This will be our go-to chinese place from now on!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout/delivery on the east side. After trying delivery from soo many places, this was the only spot that was delicious, consistent, and a good value."}
{"text":"I've been living down the street from this restaurant for like 4 years and didn't know it was here. I've been missing out on 4 years of delicious Chinese food. I tried it today and it was great. Reasonable prices, hot, fast service and friendly staff. The chicken balls were big and I loved that the batter was crispy. Also tried the chicken fried rice, beef with broccoli and wonton soup. It was all tasty. Can't wait to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I read all the other reviews before deciding to give this joint a try.  I will give them this: they might be the best Chinese food restaurant in east york...a notoriously under served community where Chinese food is concerned (note to enterprising would-be Chinese food restauranteurs...open here, deliver and make good food...you will have a captive market!).    The good: - decent prices  - quick  - chicken balls were good  The not-so good: - ginger beef was bland.  Like really really bland.   - Singapore noodles had no curry flavour, bland - fried dumplings,not so fried and bland - general tao chicken, boring bland and not good  - lemon chicken was not lemon-y....bland  - spring rolls.  Flavourless. Like frozen.  Bland.   - no fortune cookies in the bag!!! Whaaat???  I bet if you just ordered chicken balls and rice it would be just fine.   Not great.  But totally serviceable.    Now considering some of the other disasters in the neighbourhood - SANDY's at woodbine and danforth, eden on coxwell for example - this place was a welcome upgrade.   But it was not 5 out of 5.  No way.   It was ok.  Just ok.  Not good, not even average (Manchu Wok is average to me). And certainly not 5/5.     Why can't these places hire a qualified cook and buy decent and fresh ingredients and then make sure they do the service right (like why no delivery??? Isn't that a basic requirement for staying in business as a chinese food joint?).    Seems an easy formula."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area & was concerned I wouldn't find a new Chinese restaurant that I could trust with my food allergies. The staff have been great, they always remember my allergy & recommend changes to dishes to suit me.  I'm very happy with their service."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese place next door! Food is good, generous and for an affordable price.  Enjoy the daily specials for the best deals!   (Should add sesame chicken on the menu!)"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. We always order online then pick up and its ready waiting piping hot."}
{"text":"Ordered from them via JustEats this week and loved it. Great prices, tasty food, and the delivery guy was very nice. Will definitely be a repeat customer! (Mmm house special fried rice!)"}
{"text":"Hubby needed to take Chinese Food to his mom in the nursing home and even though it's in Markham, she didn't want authentic Chinese, she wanted old school Canadian style Chinese food... not available in Markham!  To make matters worse, it was Thanksgiving Day and many restaurants of this type are closed because their usual customers are eating Turkey.  Donlands Garden to the rescue!  Sweet & Sour Chicken Balls?  Check! Breaded Shrimp with Lemon? Check! Egg rolls, fried rice and beef with mixed vegetables?  Check, check, check!  The chicken balls were meaty with a good meat to breading ratio with sauce on the side so they don't get soggy.  The shrimp breading stayed crispy.  Beef was tender and veggies tasty.  Dinner for Two was a great deal. They also have lunch specials.  Looking at the menu they also have more authentic Chinese items as well as the old school Canadian style Chinese food anyone growing up before the 90's grew up on.  The staff were prompt and friendly, so we will definitely be ordering again especially since they are next door to Fresh From the Farm!  The place has changed owners and names a few times over the past few years, I hope they do well and can stick around.    East Yorkers give them a try for you Chinese Food takeout and delivery needs!"}
