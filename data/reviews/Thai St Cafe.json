{"text":"this does not even deserve one star....my husband and i got take out. very basic items, fried rice, thai beef salad and pad thai. the fried rice was terrible not sure how you mess this up, the thai beef was bland and the pad thai was worse than the time i tried to make it at home. we each had a few bites and threw out the food. we have never done this.   not sure how they have 4.5 stars. we will stick to archi's and le thai."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and just enough spice.  Definitely keeping this on my frequent ordering list"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. On the outside, it looks kinda shady. But once you go in, it's nice.  They have decent prices and most importantly, its open til 4am! Food is decent, especially considering its 1am"}
{"text":"Good prices around 9$ for huge curry or noodles. Very clean and spacious"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and cute place! Thai BBQ is bomb, and their chicken satay!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good value! Dish sizes are big so we couldn't even finish a single tom yum soup and yellow curry together with my wife. It was veery good!  Soup, second dish, coffee and water - 28$."}
{"text":"I don't usually post reviews but I LOVE this place. We come from California every so often to visit Las Vegas and we always have to make a stop here before we go back home. Their shrimp tum yum is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable, awesome Thai place.  Opens late and staff were wonderful.  Amazing food.  Wish you can open one near my house too."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the experience was very bad!!!!! The waitress herself added unusual amount of money as tip ! Should she do that? She has no idea that tip is given by customers based on her service! Her behavior was cheating! It was even worse since she said no tip was added after my wife, an account ant noticed unusual difference from our order! Even if 20% tip was added would not match cost. When we asked to re calculate based on menu, she immediately admitted added a wrong amount to the check! Really just a mistake?!   We don't recommend this restaurant! If you go anyway, examine your check carefully!"}
{"text":"A family and friends came from Pasadena this weekend and they were big fan of Thai food. So we looked up the nearest restaurant de      Café what's the closest one so we decided to give it a try when we arrive at the place we were all in shock me when you look around all you see is mostly adult adult entertainment and other stuff but High St., Café was located right in the middle which was interesting so we still decide to give it a try we went inside we where impressed by the Decore, you look very nice and modern and I decide to order pod Thai shrimp my cousin ordered the yard the drunken noodle yeah the service was real good"}
{"text":"This Thai food was the best I've ever had. The service was great I loved that they were open so late. The spicy level was perfect on all the dishes we ordered. When I come to Vegas next year I'm definitely coming here."}
{"text":"Very poor tasting food. Ordered Tom Ka soup and would not recommend it! In addition the tables were dirty and the service was not very professional."}
{"text":"If you want authentic delicious Thai food at a reasonable price, look no further than Thai Street Cafe  I lived in Thailand for 13 and a half years and I've had such a difficult time finding food authentic to the Thailand culture  Thai Street Cafe has come closer so authentic Thai food than any restaurant I have tried since moving from Thailand.  The ambiance is very pleasant, and the wait staff was extremely friendly  If you are a Thai food connoisseur, don't miss Thai Street Cafe, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Had a taste for Pad Thai and the images provided for viewing is exactly as it was served. Had the option of hotness from the scale of (1-10). Place is clean and served right away. I'm not sure of how busy the place is but there was no traffic of people which was exactly what I was avoiding. Their Thai Tea is awesome as well and due to the great food, service and cleanliness of the place I will be returning next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Me and my wife arrive here in Las Vegas around two thirty in the morning because traffic was so heavy coming from Cali. We check in to our room try to sleep but couldn't cause i was starving.So we surf the web and found Thai St Cafe was the closest and the food look really good so we gave it a try try, the place was pretty pack for the size of the restaurant so that means the food must be good here. I order a crab fried rice and my wife ordered a pad thai, it took about a good 20min for us to receive our food which was ok.but i must tell you it was worth the wait the food was so delicious i was speechless and it hit the spot.thanks i know one thing though before i go back to Cali I'm for sure gonna stop by this place AGIAN!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were very excited to try this Thai restaurant. First thing to know there is no alcohol license. You have to go to liquor store about 2 doors down to get alcohol. Unfortunately the service was so bad even before we were served appetizers that we just walked out! There was enough waitresses but no one paid attention to us. Sad experience."}
{"text":"Food is ok, my surprise was when the bill was brought to our table. Tip is automatocally included on bill, 18% will be added if 5+ dine in! It was my husband, myself, and my 3 children. Did not see anything in writing specifying gratuity being added.. Waitress warned me that if any refillable drink was shared there would be no free refill. My kids did not even finish one drink, I order for what I know how much we consume."}
{"text":"I ordered via eat24 and I am super angry with this restaurant. After I made an order, Thai St Cafe said that they are very busy so that will take one and a half hour to fulfill the delivery, and I agreed with that. However, I didn't get my food after 1.5 hours so I check through the app, the restaurant then updated order status to \"out for delivery\". After waiting for more then 2 hours, nothing came at all!!! I contacted eat24, their customer services called the restaurant and this restaurant said that they \"have some issue and not able to fulfill my order\". WTF? If you are not able to fulfill my order, you can call me at the beginning, instead of asking me to wait for 2+ hours, and telling a lie that you are out for delivery! I might not be able to comment the taste, as I am blocked from eating it, but I definitely will not recommend a dishonest restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! The staff was incredibly helpful and the food was delicious! The atmosphere was super relaxing and inviting as well. The restaurant is set up very cute and calming. I would definitely go to this place again and recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Not in the best of area in Vegas but what a pleasant surprise! excellent food and customer service... would come again !"}
{"text":"I drive for UberEats part time. I have gone to this establishment more than once for deliveries.  Iam ready to try the food on my leisure time.  Great smells.  This is short small review. Thank you for reading.  Thai Tea was delicious. (Had a tea while I was waiting)  Regards  CSG"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The food was very cheap and delicious - and much better and healthier than most meals you get in Vegas. The portions were large. The staff was very friendly and served our meals quite fast."}
{"text":"they have a \"C\" grade from the health department ..... Not cool at all!!!!!! I should notice this before we eat here    I was here many times before and I think they switch owners or cooks the food was super spicy today and we can't even eat it , level 4 to 5 supposed to be mild hot but not burning hot, to bad because they have just lost 4 great customers ."}
{"text":"Sol has a gorgeous smile that can brighten your day. She recommended the Noodle Boat which was delicious. Fantastic service and great food."}
{"text":"I received my order and everything was great. Except for the hair in my noodles. I tried calling to let them know but no one ever picked up."}
{"text":"Had the Tom Kha soup, crab rangoon, pad Thai, and drunken noodle. It was delicious!!!! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"NO UTENSILS. They delivered way after their expected delivery time which was an hour it took two and then they didn't include napkins or even one set of utensils. Where does one expect a person should get utensils at this time of morning."}
{"text":"Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! If I can give this place a negative rating I would. I ordered delivery, and the girl on the phone told me to come down to the valet drop off area. As I was waiting in front of the valet booth, the restaurant calls me and asks me where I was? The girl was so very rude, insisting that her driver was there, and I am at the wrong spot. Finally she says that the driver is at the shuttle bus pick up instead. Terrible, terrible, terrible service. The food is mediocre at best. Save yourself the headache and order somewhere else. I give this place a 1 star rating for food, and a negative 2 rating for service. The girl on the phone should be fired."}
{"text":":( I enjoy Thai food often and was disappointed with place I ordered crab ragon and pa thai and did no enjoy it"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery with them for the first time. Worst experience ever!!!' Suggest not order delivery with them. Paid five dollars for the delivery fee. The food came with it is not worth it. Seriously not suggest order delivery with this restaurant."}
{"text":"We found this gem on vacation. I wanted soup and was not disappointed.  We had the wonton soup and the drunken noodles, both were so good.  Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"This is prob my favorite place to eat Thai food in Vegas and I have tried many super clean contemporary style restaurant food quality and appearance is great enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and no doubt is one of my favorite Thai spot in Vegas, it's open very late and everything it's fresh and delicious !  Don't miss out if ya in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Their food is 1-2 star. Not sure why people rated so high for this restaurant, but my wife and I got some stomach-ache after eating at this place. We had Pad thai Pad See ew Tom yum soup.  I recommend going some other thai restaurant seriously.  This place's foods are very blend, salty and not fresh."}
{"text":"This is an excellent choice for authentic Thai food. Generous meat portions, fresh ingredients, reasonable prices and friendly service. For those who are heat intolerant, mild spiciness is available. The decor is modern and fresh, and the staff are very helpful with menu choices. Our server, Sol, was very welcoming and friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very tasty lunch and at a fair price. I would have liked a little more chicken in my dish, but overall I was very pleased. The resteraunts location is in a slightly seedy strip mall, but once your inside, it's a very comfortable and modern atmosphere. I'll be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the food for an hour. That's crazy. Food is very tiny portion and over priced! Service is terrible. I won't come back here"}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic choice for late night cravings. A couple of things that stood out:  1. We ordered online through yelp. It was easy to navigate and complete. Pretty seamless process. Some dishes had photos.   2. Price was absolutely comparable to local non-tourist places.  $9-$14  3. Delivery was fast and ahead of time. They delivered exactly to where we requested.   4. For being a late night place, the quality of the food was  surprisingly delicious. We were so thankful that something else was available that wasn't pizza or sandwiches.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Their free Thai iced tea came with check-in is so good. The food is very good if you don't want to eat overpriced food on the strip. Definitely coming back if I visit Vegas again:)"}
{"text":"WARNING: Sunday ~12:30 p.m. The restaurant was understaffed; there were two waiters and one, maybe two cooks. I say cooks because the people in the kitchen are not chefs. The tom kha was too sour and salty. The deep fried catfish was not crispy. Ample seating room, however the wait for the food to arrive took very long. They also did not give us a menu while some parties that arrived after us were given menus. There were people complaining about the long wait for food to arrive. This girl I saw had to walk around the restaurant to get the sauce tray. We ordered water when we were seated, but the water did not come until I asked for it for the third time and half way through my meal. The soups do not come with rice unless it is their lunch special(excludes weekend). If you are from California, just wait until you go back to California for some better Thai food. Probably the worst Thai restaurant in California is better than this place. One star because I feel bad for the inefficient waiters who haven't been properly trained, and also because I cannot give less stars.   In conclusion, this place should pay its customers to eat here because time is money, and you will be spending a lot of time waiting for your food.  You are welcome. Hope this review saves you time."}
{"text":"They actually have Khao Soi! I had to give it a try having just come back from Thailand. It was quite tasty although not the best I ever had. If I had to nitpick, I would say that the curry in the dish could be richer and perhaps more spicy. The place itself was nice enough and the staff was friendly. I recommend stopping by if you're in the mood for some Thai food!"}
{"text":"Despite the location away from the Strip, the food was very flavorful and authentic.  The interior was clean and modern with unique decorations.  Service was good; they also offer delivery. Enjoyed the meal- food here is worth a try!"}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit and this is by far the Best Thai restaurant. The Food was seasoned perfectly.  They served the soup on the coolest burner ever. The food stayed piping hot.  The service is awesome and the decor was excellent.  The price and the quality of the food is awesome. If the place was on the strip we would pay double the price."}
{"text":"We were craving for Thai food during CES 2017.  We saw this restaurant had good reviews and decided to try it.  When we pulled up outside the restaurant, we hesitated because this restaurant is sandwiched between some \"adult\" establishments.  We peaked in the restaurant and decided to try it.  We ordered food and within few minutes the food was served.  Spring rolls, pad Thai, Panang Curry, Thai Fried Rice.  Every thing was awesome.  The servers were very friendly.  The restaurant was clean and service fast. A jem!  Definitely on the list we we visit Las Vegas next time."}
{"text":"The service is very nice! The food is even better! We ordered crispy roll for appetizer, which was very good. For entree drunken noodle with shrimp, the best thing ever! The food comes very quickly, looks like on the photos and tastes wow good! Everyone should go there to eat for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was 30 min late -- although the order was placed early on, before the restaurant opened -- and there was plastic in my daughter's order. She could have died from the plastic and/or disgust."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!! And prices are reasonable. Just be aware that it's located by strip clubs. The restaurant itself had good ambiance and friendly staff"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery.  I have my credit card information and they even called me back to ensure that I would have my ID and credit card ready for their perusal upon delivery.  They were supposed to deliver within 20 minutes.   An hour had passed and I had not received my order.  I called to inquire.  They claimed the order was for pickup, which was inaccurate.   More noteworthy, they proceeded to argue with me, about the order being a pickup order.  They argued SO much I politely decided to cancel the order.  This is terrible customer service.  Of particular note is that they still have not refunded my money.  They charged me,  did not deliver, and did not credit my card for the canceled order.  Thus, the item is now disputed.  I would not do any business with this restaurant , the service is extremely poor and apparently they engage in criminal behavior."}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle and stopped by pretty late, midnight. My family and I have been craving Thai since we came to Vegas and this was close to the strip, but not on it. Perfect location. Ambiance was great. Nice decor. Very modern design. I liked it.  Up until we ordered. She didn't ask how spicy we wanted any of the dishes. We ordered Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, Pad Thai, and the chicken wings appetizer. Each dish was very sweet, no spice.   Chicken wings - good sauce, decent serving size Pad Thai - too peanuty Panang curry - didn't even wanna try it, but my family said it was decent. Looked a little watery, not creamy enough Pad see ew - VERY bland  Not only was the food EH, it definitely wasn't worth the price! The customer service was terrible. We didn't get water within the first 10mins. Mind you, they only had one other table to tend to. And this place wasn't closing any time soon.   Decor/ambience - 5/5 Food - 2/5 Customer service - 2/5  I would never return to this place even if I lived in Vegas, sorry not sorry!"}
{"text":"This thai food is delicious. We had the pad thai, drunken noodles, beef salad and pad se eww. It was all delicious! It rivaled our favorite place in Seattle. It was also pleasantly surprized at the low price of it all. The only downside is that the restaurant, although classy inside,  is in a sleezy part of town."}
{"text":"I decided to try from yelp reviews.  We had the chicken satay and the beef pad Thai.  The chicken had good taste but was pretty dried out, same with the beef in the pad Thai.  Overall it was ok but for the price I expected more fresh"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Traditional authentic Thai spice . They offer a range of spiciness from 1-10 on most of their dishes. I got the basil fried rice at an 8 and it was the perfect level of spiciness. It was spicy enough to make me sweat but I could still taste the beautiful basil notes within the rice. Perfect. I also ordered the chicken satay and it was tender and succulent . The three ladies joining me also enjoyed their meals thoroughly : the crying tiger wrap, Thai style sweet and sour chicken and basil chicken. The restaurant atmosphere was relaxing and natural, yet clean and tidy. The staff was friendly and even offered recommendations on what to order.  Have a meal here, I promise you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I wish we could give 0 stars. Do NOT order from here they gave us a papaya salad and it had a fly in it."}
{"text":"Would make it 0000 stars if it was available. The customer service was terrible.  They do not support their statements made over the phone and in person.  We called in advance to clarify pick order and time.  They did not make food until we got to the restaurant to pick up and pay. She lied to us straight in our face and said 5 more minutes. In reality 30 min passed and we still were waiting. Lady Didn't even apologize. Very rude and unprofessional over the phone and in person. What's the point for the \"pick up\" option."}
{"text":"Orange chicken sauce is too strong, I wouldn't recommend that.. But the pineapple fried rice and chicken wings are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and food reached our hotel room along the strip in about 35 mins on Thursday night.  Yellow curry- Flavourful, plenty of chicken slices and satisfying.   Pot stickers- Average.  Pad Woon sen- Had the seafood combination version. Came with lots of vegetables and prawns were fresh. Good enough.   Complimentary Thai iced tea- superbly refreshing.   3 stars for the above average food. 1 for the convenience and speed of delivery.  Tip: go for spice level 2."}
{"text":"This was a great find, away from the Vegas strip. Nice calming music and atmosphere. Excellent service from friendly staff. Extremely yummy food with a flair on the hit side, so choose lower number unless you like it extra spicy. The calamari had a beautiful presentation. The pork pad Thai was the best I've ever eaten. Lots of meat, bean sprouts, cilantro, and green onions. This is the one place in Vegas I'll continue to crave long after our vacations over. Loved the art and creative restroom door deco."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch or dinner. Great value for your money. Pineapple curry is delicious."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while on trip to Vegas......good ambience, food was delicious and very affordable..... And May, our server, she was very sweet and friendly.  Will definitely like to go back.... Cheers"}
{"text":"great thai food! And nice service. Love the Thai Ice Tea very authentic flavor. Must go place on late night party!!!"}
{"text":"The best yellow curry chicken in Las Vegas. Bar none. Beautiful coconut milk luxurious subtle exotic spice nodes. Of course white filet of chicken, sliced carrot celery  Served in a Thai style makes you feel so great  Service is of Thai descent  Sol is simply beautiful , serves with warmth and happiness Ambience is sexy romantic low lit Great experience Thank you !"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad. I like the decorations and the service is pretty good too. Tastes pretty authentic and prices aren't that bad for being near the strip. We also like that it's open pretty late, but the area is a little dead late at night."}
{"text":"I had a party of 7, and we arrived at 7 pm go the establishment. Here's my breakdown:  -customer service was horrible. Staff did not bother to check up on my party / table until we waived them down.  -gratuity was applied to my bill even though my party was split into two tables.  -Water was not served because we ordered a Thai tea and there weren't enough cups. Staff said something along the lines of, \"I'm afraid of you request for water, you might get a dirty cup.\" -we had to go up to the front counter to pay, as I had also mentioned before, staff did not check up on me and my party.   One positive thing I can say about this joint is the food is great. Get it delivered or take out. Do not dine in. You'll face such a horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Exquisite food ! I'm a huge Thai food person and i am very impressed with the dishes on this menu . I ordered a seafood dish with squid,shrimp , basil, clams and vegetables . They made it extra spicy for me just how I like it . The interior is very trendy and modern , gives it a industrial feel to it . Service was great - highly recommend . Not bad for a first time"}
{"text":"I ordered through Ubereats and the food came pretty quickly. However my drunken noodles was soggy amd soaked in oil and completely bland and flavorless. My boyfriend's pad see ew was terrible. The noodles were overcooked and again soaked in oil to the point where we couldn't eat our food. The so called crispy calamari was bland and soggy. I can't believe that they would serve this food to people. I would never order from this place again. This is not authentic Thai food. This is food for those in a state of drunken madness!"}
{"text":"We visited this cafe while on vacation , as we are hungry we searched for a near by restaurant in yelp with positive reviews ,and decided to dine in here . The name and the outer appearance made us doubt to dine in this cafe, although with all positive reviews it scored .The location is really overwhelming which made us almost walk out but some how we decided to walk in to check the ambiance and are glad for doing it . Service is real prompt , and the ambiance is unique . We ordered tom yam soup along with pineapple fried rice and thai red curry . All the dishes are delicious and are beautifully served .The spice level is even well balanced just as we ordered. In exception  to the the location of the cafe overall it is a tasty experience .I would recommend this cafe for real thai food."}
{"text":"This place has great Food!  I always try the pad Thai and pad see ew when I go to a new Thai place, and this was one of the better ones in Vegas. If you're a visitor or a local, give this place a try...then you'll thank me and come back for more."}
{"text":"The beef salad was pretty good, the phad thai was also good. We ordered our food at a 5 in spicyness, I would probably order spicy 4 next time. Location is a bit shady due to the strip joint next door. I wouldn't recommend coming to late at night with children."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Jan 6th while I was in Las Vegas and the delivery took an hour or so around 2am, which is average in my opinion. The food was great and I love their Thai tea. We ordered one with tapioca which cost $1 extra and there wasn't much tapioca in the drink, and one was free because we had an order of $25 or more. But at the end we got 3 Thai Teas, which I wasn't sure why, but was happy. I did request half sweet and no ice on both drinks, but all 3 had ice and it tasted full sweet. When we received our drinks they were wrapped in a plastic bag because I guess they did't want it to spill when the driver was driving... but sadly the drink still spilled and leaked as well. The tapioca was hard and not chewy or soft, so I don't recommend it unless the batch that night was made bad.  Overall the food was great and I 10000% love their Thai Milk Tea. I don't think I can find one as good in Canada."}
{"text":"Oh...my god... waiting more than 30mins for pad thai and pad see mon?? Even surver didn't explain what's going on and no apologize... food is soooo salty !"}
{"text":"They took two hours to deliver and when the food finally made it, it was horrible. I will not be ordering from this Thai St. Cafe again ...UNLESSSSS I'm drunk desperate for food and don't feel like driving."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Thai restaurant. Service is very poor. Our appetizer took 30minutes to come out and it was only potstickers and calamari for 3 people. Our waitress told us they were very busy but they only had about 10 patrons in the restaurant. Please don't order the crab fried rice...it was very bland tasted like rice and soy sauce. No flavor. It barely had any crab meat in it. We hardly touched our food. The manager was nice enough to take 10% off the bill. Please do yourself a favor and save your money."}
{"text":"This was my first (and will be my last) meal with Thai St Cafe due to such an extremely disappointing experience. There were several problems outlined in my visit: a) Horrible delivery service      1. They delivered our food to the wrong hotel (went to the Mirage instead of our actual   hotel      2. It was nearly impossible to communicate with the man delivering since he spoke little to no english b) Wrong pricing - over the phone they told us it would cost 38 dollars when it only costed 34, so we ended up paying a total of 10 dollars more when counting tax and tip and the delivery person left before we realized the pricing mistake c) They got our orders wrong - we ordered a Vegetarian Pad Thai with spiciness level 10 and a Chicken Pad Thai with spicy level 2, but they switched the heat, leaving us with an unbearable spiciness on the Chicken Pad Thai and a heat-less Veggie Pad Thai  The food itself was decent, but I would like to see better service and responsibility before I bring my business back."}
{"text":"Pad see ew was good. Service was good. Not crowded at all; seated right away. Worth the walk from the strip. Great value especially if you want to get away from the high prices of the strip. Cool decor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the food is just the best! It's nice and cozy. The food is nicely flavored and cooked. It's authentic Thai taste. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The place is situated in the middle of nowhere, but don't let it scare you. We arrived around 3:30pm, it was pretty much empty. Ordered dumplings appetizer, very good, and drunken noodles with the chicken and shrimp mix. The food was tasty, noodles portion was substantial and the service was great.  I gave the place 4 stars because the food was good, but not the best Thai I ever had..."}
{"text":"Ok DO NOT EAT HERE. If you want to ruin your Vegas Vacation this is the God forsaken place to choose. The shady location next to porno shops should have been a warning sign. We ordered a meal at 12:20 pm. People came after us, had their meal and left. She did not inform us that the order will take long. When asked she said she is going by queue but a family that came after us was already eating. She said she will get us a papaya salad complimentary for the wait and finally served something at 1:15 pm. That's right, waited 55 minutes to get a papaya salad. RUDE STAFF, BAD FOOD, PATHETIC ATTITUDE. WE WALKED OUT OF HERE! I am pretty sure by the time we visit Vegas next this completely unprofessional place is going to go out of business for the terrible business that they conduct"}
{"text":"Basil fried rice was good. But was too hot n spicy. I have pretty good tolerance for spice and I only gave 5/10 in this place as I was trying it for first time. But was burning hot. May be yelp's spice scale is different from the restaurant's spice scale.  The crab Rangoon was only partially fried. Had to throw it away."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Authentic flavor is everything I look for in Thai food and they hit the spot. Service was great and the inside decor surprised me, it's really cute in there!"}
{"text":"Spicy basil chicken... Pineapple chicken curry.... One word: awesome... Best Thai I've had in Vegas.... Come.. U won't be disappointed!:)"}
{"text":"If there was an option of negative stars , i would have given them the worst. This review is not based on food but the worst customer service. We ordered the food online through eat street and recieved a confirmation email from the restraunt stating our order will arrive in 45-50 mins. After waiting for 1 hour we tried calling the restraunt which was not reachable. When finally we got them, we were ensured that our food is on the way. After another 35 mins when we called back, we were told that our order is cancelled long time back. So we waited for almost 2 hours with no information and the restraunt guy was terrible in communication too..Never had such a worst night ..:Thanks to THAI ST CAFE"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the food is awesome!! My boyfriend and I came for the RiSE festival and was looking for a restaurant that was open around 2am. We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a shot, long story short the food was so good! My boyfriend had the Thai boat noodles which was so flavorful and I got the pad Thai which was amazingly good and full of flavor a as well! Must try this place if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. Wanted Thai food and tried to order from my go to place only to find out they went out of business. Time for a new place and this one had great reviews.   Same order I paid $65 for at my normal place was over $90 at this place.   My crispy egg rolls were soggy.   The dumplings I requested fried crispy were also soft and soggy.   Thai tea was way too strong.   Curry dish was ok but a little bland.   Chicken dish was thrown away. No one would eat it.   Fried rice tasted old.   Even the dessert - sticky rice with mango - was lacking. How do you mess up rice and fruit?! Well the rice was over cooked and mushy and the fruit wasn't what I'd call ripe.   Worst value for the money I've experienced in quite a while."}
{"text":"Food was great. Server was very friendly and great service. Small place to grab a quick bite. The Thai Iced Tea was perfect. Defiantly going to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very neat and had professional service though located between adult clubs. Don't get fooled by the surrounding area. I had tried pineapple fried rice and tom yum soup. Both are top notch and delicious. I've tried many thai restaurants and I can confidently say that it belongs to top league! Unfortunately, its quiet far from strip and you cannot try this food as often as you want when you visit las vegas. But, give it a try once."}
{"text":"We love this place, we coming after clubbing if you want to taste real Thai food come and enjoy at this Street. I love thai Tea, the staff is very friendly, food amazing, restaurant is very clean. Oni our server tonight did her best to make us happy"}
{"text":"Had to write a review because their yellow curry was bomb. I ordered through ubereats and the food was prepared pretty quickly. They gave me a good amount of curry and rice. Quality and quantity is perfect for the price. This is going to be my go to spot when I go to LV for a trip."}
{"text":"Sooooo bomb! I've enjoyed many items on their menu, but always come back to fried rice or pad thai. Their staff is friendly, the food is great, and the service is quick. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price, and fast service. If you don't know what to get, go for the red curry, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great lunch service. A good quick lunch menu on the back of the menu and a mega Thai tea BTW."}
{"text":"hands down my favorite thai restaurant! this to me is the most authentic place i've been to as far as thai foods. almost like my momma  i would recommend the calamari, pad see ew, chicken larb and TOM YUM WITH SEAFOOD. yeah it's heaven  the fact that it's open till 4am is even more awesome cause late night thai food is the best"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. They are fast, the restaurant is well designed, and most importantly the food is legit. Also, the spice levels are pretty tame so don't be afraid to kick it up!"}
{"text":"I recommend this establishment for Thai food. Everything we had for our meals was delicious. Great flavor and pricing.   Drunken noodles with chicken, tofu basil fried rice, yellow chicken curry are items I recommend.   Crab Rangoon was a bit too cream cheesy for my liking.   Beef pad Thai was decent. The beef was a bit chewy."}
{"text":"First time visit---I will return!! Ordered the pad see ew and it was fantastic! Try this place if you're remotely nearby- you won't regret it. The atmosphere is very nice and clean and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 3 mostly for their location. Back when uber eats had free delivery promo going on, this was one of the options available and as a student at unlv late night studying this was a great Thai place!   I am a huge fan of their pad see ewe (chicken) and my friend always gets yellow curry. I also have noticed that this is one of the only Thai places that I know of that stays open fairly late.  The staff is super friendly and isn't pushy at all. Everything is made to order and you can taste the freshness. I haven't had the opportunity to come in for their lunch specials but their normal portions are very generous and worth the prices so I can only imagine the lunch portions being plentiful and decently sized as well."}
{"text":"A friend and I are visiting from San Diego and we are Thai food snobs, this place is great!! We loved the food and the service was amazing. We had the nicest waitress and the food came fast! Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"This place is great!  We had the pot stickers appetizer, pad thai with chicken for the entree, and mango sticky rice.  Its really hard to find mango sticky rice that is good since at some places it may not be in season.  But they had it and it was great!  The pot stickers is good The chicken was juicy.  You can have it spicy from a scale of 1 - 10 My girlfriend asked for a 1 she said it was more sweet then spicy I asked for a 2, it was slightly spicy"}
{"text":"Great service Great food and drinks...beautiful setup and clean environment...definitely quality place and food!! Super legit...must stop by for Thai food"}
{"text":"This place has one of my new favorite dishes. So while I've only eaten there one time, I had to share my experience with this new spot. They have a soup there, Boat Noodle Soup, where I can taste the richness of the bones and different parts simmered in the soup. It's got a unique, rich flavor that I haven't tasted in other restaurant broths. Okay in fairness, it doesn't have the same flavor profile of other Thai soups I had. But I know enough to know what I DON'T  know about Thai food. While I eat it regularly, I am no expert. What I DO feel expert in is identifying rich, flavorful stocks. And man, this soup is so good.   Yes, I tasted some other dishes and was pleased with everything I ate. The drunken noodle, wings, and basil fried rice were all nicely flavored and comprised of quality ingredients.  I wasn't as blown away by these dishes, but they were certainly solid.   I am heading back to  Thai St Café now for my second experience and plan to have a third very soon. I will update my review after having more than one experience with this small place. But after MANY disappointing Thai food experiences in this town, I was pleased to stumble on a place that is putting out tasty food and delivering it to boot. I'm always willing to give a Yelp score based on a single dish.  And that Boat Noodle Soup is a new go-to for me. Most places can't get one dish correct, let alone a homey and simple/complex soup.  So yeah, I'm a fan.  EDITED to ADD: Well, after two more bouts with the soup, mango, and noodles, I am changing my review. It was still tasty and I was pleased with my food, but the exceptional flavor profile just wasn't there. The soup, in particular, was less a subtle configuration of layered flavors, and more a warm, well-seasoned stock. Good--will be ordered again--but not exceptional.   It feels more like a consistency issue than a quality issue. I don't think one stumbles into soup as amazing as what they served me few months back. Two mediocre experiences out of three is a little disappointing. But I have a feeling about this place. I will be back. And I am hopeful."}
{"text":"Finished the RunRockNRoll Half Marathon for 2015 and was looking for some good soup!  Thankfully another thai resto on the typical chinatown area was closed for an event and I found this HIDDEN GEM on YELP!!  The drive to the place may be a bit dodgy, and more so when you realize the complex it's in --BUT!!! It absolutely is THE BEST THAI SPOT YOU COULD EVER DINE AT!! Great selections, Service was sweet & prompt & the Food was worthy!! Very authentic and surprisingly loved the decor.  Definitely a Hidden Gem but not a Hole in the Wall at all!!  Worth the Drive! I wouldn't go to the asian area for Thai food again!!  We happened to take our meal \"To-Go\" but will definitely eat in next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband brought us home this for dinner late one night. He brought the chicken fried rice, curry puffs and jerky. All the food held up well for his 1/2 hour trip home. The rice was very fresh and not greasy. It had whole vegetables and the chicken was moist. It had a nice hint of sweetness to it. The curry puffs and sauce were amazing. They are hand made and were cooked to perfection. All of the taste blended together nicely with just the right amount of heat. The jerky was good. It wasn't the staple I thought but it was good and I can see how one would come to crave it. All in all I enjoyed the take out. My husband was impressed with the cleanliness and his service. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Our 'go to' restaurant when we're in Vegas. The food is sooo good here....can't believe they do NOT use MSG!!"}
{"text":"about the best Thai restaurant I have ever been to! service started out a little slow, but once things got going the angels started singing......tried several things so i would have leftovers to take home and i am glad i did...the Panang Curry was fabuloso and the pad thai great and the papaya salad great but maybe a little spicier than i had hoped but still great!!  go there or have them deliver to your hotel   great value!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Thai Food! It's clean, food is very tasty and service is very good with friendly smiles."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas and after a couple of days of nothing but buffet food, we decided to look for something more comforting.  The restaurant was located in a risqué area of town.  The food was just at best just ok, actually a bit on the disappointing side.  The food portion were smaller than average and the wait staff was not very tentative."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here while at a conference at a local hotel. The food arrived hot, earlier than the initial proposed time, and was mostly perfect! The egg rolls (you get 5!) and beef pad see ew was great! I also got a free coupon for Thai tea (but no straw)-- thank goodness I was in a hotel and could get one from the lobby shops. My only complaint is that the chicken skewers were undercooked and I was unable to eat them after the  first bite that I took. A waste of $8 sadly.   I didn't realize how much food I would get and now have lunch for tomorrow. Yum!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night, and, boy, were they busy. I did not expect such a crowd given the location, but there were a wide range of people both dining in and picking up food.  While the staff was friendly, they could not keep up with the number of customers. We waited quite a while to place an order. Our water glasses were also often empty, and I saw food sit in the window for some time. I felt for the staff because they rarely even had time to answer the constantly ringing phone.   With this many customers and this much waiting, you would think the food would be amazing. The fried rice dishes and the soups were presented beautifully. Unfortunately, I ordered a noodle dish, and it was just okay. I ordered a 10, and it was not spicy at all, which is always a huge disappointment for me. There were also a large number of onions, and some of the pieces of chicken were just fat.  Overall, I won't be back, since Thai that isn't spicy, just isn't for me. The restaurant is beautiful, though, and I wish them the best."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and it was here in 35-40min from ordering. I got orange chicken,  crab Rangoon  and crab fried rice.  It was SOO good! And hot.    Orange chicken - sweet, tangy, crunchy Rangoon -crunchy with creamy filling Crab rice-full of egg and crab lumps  I took a chance and I'm glad I wasn't disappointed! I will order again and try new stuff."}
{"text":"Ordered from Eat24, pure disappointment. The food was very dry. Besides that to speak on their delivery service I left very explicit but easy to follow directions (enter on this road, turn here, this is where the stair are, etc). They completely ignored every second of it. They called me to give them the gate code (they went to the wrong gate on the wrong road). Then I told him I would step onto my balcony so I could tell him where to turn since I have full view of the parking lot; instead he says yes thank you and immediately hangs up. He parks and ignores the directions again going to the out of service elevator, he walks back to his car and I'm waving at him with the light from my phone and whistled at him. He looks at me, stops... then walks to his car. Then I get a call asking me to come down because he can't find the entrance. At this point I think to myself that maybe he didn't get the special instructions I detailed. When I got down there I look at the bag and in big bold font it has all the instructions I detailed... why even bother if you're just going to ignore it anyway? I show him the directions that would have told him right where to go and he just smiles and says sorry. No effort given at all, I've been a delivery driver, those directions are there for a damn reason. Such minimal effort."}
{"text":"Delicious simple street food.  Good portion for the price!  Tried the chicken spicy basil & pad thai... yumm delicious...   Be careful of the spicy level. Don't go above level 7 if you're not used to eating spicy hot food."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in an un suspected location.  Right near the Can-Can room and other Adult stores, this little place is tucked in between.  The food is excellent and prices are good.  The curry is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not what we were expecting. Everything we ordered was extremely salty. We had pad se ew, Thai boat noodles, Thai fried rice, and pork ribs. If the taste of the foodwas actually good, we couldn't tell because we just couldn't get past the salty taste.   Other than the extreme salty issue, the place is clean, food was presented well, dessert was OK. Service can be improved."}
{"text":"Very good flavor.  Thai ice tea is delicious.  Pad Thai is very good.  Spicy basil rice is the best we had.  Cafe style setting, very modern feel. Clean. Don't let the building exterior turn you away.  Free wifi. Strong signal. Fast.  Good music.  Staff is helpful."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little gem that's unfortunately not in the best of locations. Surrounding area is pretty sketchy. Luckily, the restaurant itself is inviting and has a spunky vibe to it. Our server was about a 75% on attentiveness, so not terrible overall. Menu was pretty inexpensive and had all your typical Thai dishes. We liked every dish we ordered but was less than impressed with the mango sticky rice. Bummer as we are big dessert people, but understandable since mangoes aren't in season. Would definitely come back, just maybe during an earlier time of day next time."}
{"text":"Besides this place being on a sketchy street (I walked here during night time and was creeped out) the food and service was great. We got the Thai iced tea to start which I thought was more milk than tea and too sweet. Other than that, the food was really yummy and cheap. We got pineapple fried rice, yellow curry, and the Tom kha soup. I like my food with a little kick but not too spicy so we got every entree a level 2 (out of 10) which is considered \"mild.\" I wish I had gotten a 4 or 5 because to me everything just tasted too sweet. I like that they keep the soup heated for you. Nice, spacious, affordable spot that was not crowded around 10pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Good place for delivery, take-out or late night supper open until 4am, located in adult stores neighborhood. Drunken noodles good, though relatively small portion. Panang curry deliciously rich and spicy. Overall reasonable price, nice pleasant interior decor."}
{"text":"This is such a convenient Thai restaurant especially if you work on the strip! I went inside today to order take out and it was so quick! Prices are reasonable too!  Try the Thai iced coffee!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place made it to 5 star. TOM YUM seafood was pretty sad the shrimp still wasn't deveined. The mushrooms they used aren't the normal asian mushrooms large button mushrooms for your american steak or salad. Mushrooms should have been Enokidake aka Enoki. Sticky rice was hard as a rock, I'm guessing it was from yesterdays or the day before. Crying Tiger Wrap ?  Sorry we have no wraps today, after I waited 10 minutes for my to go order. OK I will take the order with no wrap, but wait theres more the beef was raw and not cut up correctly long fat pieces with gristle, Strange the menu pictures and decor dont match the substandard food coming thru the window!  No return visit for my Team J K KUHL.... Order# 13699 10/21 11:26am $27.95 complete waste of money."}
{"text":"I don't get what all the hype is about, service sucked and food was mediocre. Definitely wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here late one night after reading some of the reviews. The neighborhood is really sketchy and we were unsure at first as to whether we should eat here. The restaurant turned out to be very clean and had a nice ambience. Our service was exceptional, the waitress helped with our entree selections and recommended some of her favorites. We had the beef panang and it was very good. We also liked the music playing in the restaurant, calming acoustic covers of songs. Definitely coming back next time we are in vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Friendly employees. Reminded me of this Thai restaurant in Hollywood,ca. Called sanamluang cafe. Thai st. Cafe is nice and clean. There Tum yum medium spicy is what you call spicy. There Thai tea with boba is so worth having even with out the boba. The funny part was the location it cracked me up it's next to strip clubs. But totally worth going."}
{"text":"This wasn't at all the worst Thai I've ever had, but much about my experience was rather \"meh.\"  Like another reviewer said, it was very Americanized. My 5 and 6 spicy levels in my Thom Kha soup and Green Curry weren't spicy whatsoever. Everything tasted really watered down in the flavor, like it was prepared for Americans who are used to eating take-out Chinese food. My boyfriend also hated his orange chicken.   The weirdest thing was the rice. We didn't eat it at all. It smelled like it was boiled in toilet water. My boyfriend took a bite and exclaimed, \"This tastes like poop.\" I'm not sure whether to blame the restaurant or Vegas water on that one."}
{"text":"I ordered tomyum noodle and beef salad. Look at the photos you will see the ground pork and chicken stick together and taste bland, like it has been cooked a few day ago. Tomyum soup tasted nothing like tomyum, but sour . Salad beef looked totally different with the sample image , it's well-done beef instead of medium rare, chewy like bubble gum."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find good Thai food in Vegas but was pleasantly surprised by this discovery. I now consider this one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever experienced--fresh, flavorful dishes well prepared at very reasonable prices. The decor is also very inviting and contemporary, with somewhat of a hipster vibe. Our server, Sol, was very friendly and provided excellent recommendations from the menu. Would definitely come again the next time I'm in Vegas. It's a nice alternative to the now extremely pricey casino buffets!"}
{"text":"This place blew my tastebuds! I have not written a review in a long time. I haven't written one in a long time because I don't want alot of people going to all my favorite places. But this place deserves it! Very well deserved because the food and the atmosphere is indescribable! The food taste like it was made my heavenly Thai angels. :) Oh gosh I ordered the hai jar for the appetizer and for my main course was the boat noodle soul! Woooo!! The broth taste like it was from a well of holy beef broth! The portion was perfect. For my drink I ordered the Thai tea. Wow it was amazing grace. Hahaha xD This ended my night well. Being a bellman we are very hungry and need good food afterwards. Especially dealing with crazy tourist! This place really hit the spot and I will definitely be back. This will be the new hangout spot after work! Yessss!!! A true orgasm for my stomach!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning thanks to Yelp!  We ordered crab fried rice, panang chicken curry and Thai tea.  Crab fried rice - if you love crab they put big pieces of crab in it and there was a lot of pieces. No being stingy with them!  Panang curry - just as it should! It was good! Now try it!  Thai tea - who doesn't love it? It was good as always.  If you are in the hood, give them a try. They are a must try if you love Thai. OH and there do not use MSG! YAY"}
{"text":"The food is alright! But the service is totally bad!! They always forgot what you have ordered! They are not professional!"}
{"text":"Came here two days ago with the hubby and the girls. Awesome food!!! Behind fashion show mall, kinda weird location, but I'm assuming cheaper rent. Decor had a vintage look, loved it!  Had pad Thai and spicy catfish and egg rolls. Great taste and best part, no msg!!! Husband usually passes on pad Thai, but he said this place had a good tasting one that he ended up eating it all. Need more places like this!"}
{"text":"We ordered several dishes. The grilled beef salad was excellent, but the pineapple fried rice and crying tiger noodle was missing the wok chi flavor,nothing to WOW about. Will return if I am craving for their grilled beef salad. Service terrible , we had to go up to counter to ask for several things."}
{"text":"8.14.16: We weren't hungry but since we had a long drive back to SD, we thought we should eat something before we left. The reviews here were so mixed up but we thought what they hey. So went to look for this restaurant. Ummmm..wth. are we lost? There were advertisements of girls girls girls and store for strippers and we were thinking where is this place?   This restaurant is located in that plaza where all the girls girls girls stuff are..YIKES. So ODD. The lot was empty pretty much, we walked in and the restaurant was nice. The layout is really roomy. Wood floor and wood walls with sleek looking black furniture including the booths. Nicely decorated which makes the place looks big and clean as well.   We sat in one of the booths with 5 people instead of sitting at their super duper large tables. We ordered a few items such as their curry, noodles, fried rice, and pork dish. The curry was everyone's favorite there was so much flavor in their curry. I really liked their pork dish as well. The service was normal, they weren't busy at all but they were busy preparing to go orders here and there. We had to flag them each time we needed water refills. It was a bit spicy for me but luckily for me I ordered their Thai tea and that helped tamed the hit in my mouth..Hot Hot Hot.  Overall I was simply surprised by this place. There were so many mixed reviews that I just thought at least we get to eat. But it wasn't that way at all, we were all satisfied and liked the food very much.   YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant in Grubhub because I wanted to order delivery to the hotel since the kids and I were really tired and not used to the time difference.  The food was good and very authenticate Thai food.  I do not recommend this restaurant if you are not used to eating traditional Thai flavors.    The delivery person called me when he was 5 mins away.  They cannot deliver the food to your room and will need you to meet them outside by the passenger drop off.  This was my only complaint.  If I realize that I needed to venture out then I might as well pick up something from the hotel lobby instead of ordering.      By chance, my lyft passed the restaurant on the way back to the hotel.  It is located in a very shady strip center filled with adult entertainment stores.  I guess you can't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service! One of my go to spots for a quick bite after work. My favorite is the Spicy Catfish, and they make an authentic Thai version that uses krachai, a type of root similar to ginger. Crab Fried Rice is great too! Highly recommended for a quick affordable, tasty meal."}
{"text":"Express Dine In?!?!  YESSS!!!   Order online for express dine in and instead of doing Take Out ,you can arrive and immediately get served without the wait.    For about 8bucks you can have a delish chicken curry w rice veggies salad and egg roll.  For a limited time they are also offering a free soda w lunch.     Let me tell u again... EXPRESS DINE IN  Why cant everyplace do this?"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Service was excellent and the food is always good!!! Usually i order the curry but this time i tried the crab froed rice and the tiger wrap....nothing short of awesome!!! Topped it off with coconut ice cream over ro ti sooooo gooood!!!  One of my favorite places in veg as! !"}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered the red curry, basil beef, and pad Thai and enjoyed them all. Service was a bit slow and the \"crazy hot\" wasn't very hot. Either way, we'd go back."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Actual authentic Thai food in the Americanized slew of mediocre/bad restaurants that is Las Vegas. Just a quick ride from the strip, this place is ready to get to. Lovely ambiance, nice wood paneled walls with tasteful artwork. Super friendly staff that provide excellent recommendations and provide great service. The food was fantastic. We ordered Pork Larb, Tom Kha soup, eggplant, and Pad See Ew. All were excellent, especially the soup and eggplant. Topped it all off with a big Thai iced tea. Overall, the best meal we had in Vegas, and a great little place to escape the sensory overload, cigarette smoke, and constant noise of the strip. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This review is actually 4.5 stars. Thai food is probably the greatest cuisine in the world. When someone mentions 'Thai Street food' in America, for most people the images of Pok Pok in Portland will stand as the measuring stick for anyone that claims to be doing this style of Thai food. There are good versions of this style of food in Vegas, as well as bad ones. Fortunately, I'm happy to say that Thai St. Cafe is one of the good ones. (And Chada Street is one of the 'not so good' ones :) )  So let's backtrack a couple of weeks prior to coming to Thai St Cafe. I was at Chada Street, the bigger name restaurant that was proclaiming to have the 'street food' of Thailand. Suffice to say, I couldn't see it. All I saw was Chada Thai and Wine #2. Not only that, the portions were smaller, and the prices higher. I was really disappointed with this spot.  Looking at the pictures of Thai St. Cafe, my hopes were definitely pointed towards the upward. Upwardian, you might say. So I came by on a dark and mysterious day. It's located on a shady part of town. But, isn't all great food, really. Walking in, I got the interior, it screamed Thai street. Lost were the pretense I felt at Chada Street. After sitting down, things kept on looking good.  Khao Soi. It's an underrated Thai dish. When one thinks of Thai 'street food', Khao Soi automatically comes to mind. And there are only a few restaurants doing this dish in town. Thai St. Café does it exceptionally well. Great curry, with wonderful egg noodles, just a winning dish. My only concern would be the raw red onion slices that they put on top. They were quite astringent, and they slightly overwhelmed the dish. Perhaps if they used pickled red onions, or roasted them, then it could have helped take away some of the sharpness or \"onion-ness\". But as a whole, I really liked it.  The Drunken noodles were spot on. I requested 'no tomatoes' in my dish (like always) because I feel that they do not belong in Pad Kee Mao. And you can disagree with me all you want. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it. It was well cooked. As was the Red Curry.  The service was good. Our server made sure our drinks were filled, and was very friendly and helpful.   On a small side note, I think what was missing on this Thai street food menu was Khao Man Gai a.k.a. chicken over rice. If you call yourself a Thai street food place, you must have two essentials, Khao Soi (which they do) and Khao Man Gai. This, too, is my story and I will be also sticking to that.  I would love to come back here and try out more of the menu, particularly their boat noodles and lunch special. Michael K. out."}
{"text":"Good food. The tom ka soup was a bit too americanized, but still tasty.  The pork entrée was cooked perfect! Service was ok. Nothing special. Overall, this place is good, but not my favorite thai food place in vegas"}
{"text":"my hangover cure! never been to the actual location but had them deliver to me a handful of times. super yummy! and they deliver all the way until 4am for us night crawlers  fast, delish and only a $15 minimum. loves it!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food.  Location is a bit sketchy due to surrounding businesses around the restaurant.  But if the location makes great food at great prices, that's totally fine.  Will definitely be back more often."}
{"text":"Why am I even writing a review for this place. I did not like the food here. Very clear about it. I got this noodle soup which was very sour.  I also ordered the Thai iced coffee but it never showed up and they charged me for it. Not like they kept my money but they were a very careless set of people. Never going back here."}
{"text":"Alright, here's my 411 based on my take out order and pick up via Eat24 on Yelp.   I was craving thai curry last night while studying, and Thai St Cafe showed up nearest on my yelp search. It was during a study session so I wanted to do take out and get my thai curry as quickly as possible.  This is when I first discovered that Eat24 was available on their yelp page! YES! I love having my orders ready for pick up.  So for the ordering process, I clicked on \"Order Pick Up or Delivery\" which led me to their menu with thumbnail pictures next to the name of each item. Their Panang curry was labeled with a star, so I figured that was a popular choice right? So I added 2 of the Panang Curry items, added Chicken, No Spice level, and from there I reviewed my order and checked out. A confirmation email was sent immediately showing me the approximate time of when my order would be done. The ease of ordering thru yelp was a 5/5.   I quickly drove to the place because, obviously I was that hungry that I arrived inside Thai St Cafe 10 minutes from the estimated order completed time. The woman behind the cash register welcomed me and told me my order would be completed soon and sure enough, it was done 5 minutes earlier than expected! The pick up process was easy and quick. And the customer service was great! Even a worker from the back bringing silverware to the front asked me how everything going.  I can say the inside of Thai St Cafe was definitely a lot more cleaner and decoratively designed than the area it's located in. I was impressed! Anyway, the pang curry came with rice and it was SO FULFILLING! My cravings has never been so satisfied. It was rich and I understood why there was a gold star next to its name on the menu list. This place is definitely a hidden gem and I recommend it to all food lovers! One of my friends also compliments their Pad Thai to the max, so try it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so bad. When you finish order the food you want. That waiting time is bullshit. If you want to wait almost one hour, go ahead. Save your time, save your life."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Thai Street Cafe. I chose this place because it was a short drive from the strip. I had family from out of town and wanted Thai for dinner.  We ordered the typical spread of food such as egg rolls, soup, shrimp pad thai, orange chicken and 2 different fried rice. I must say, with the abundance of Thai restaurants around town, this place did not meet my expectation for taste. I prefer my usual Thai places I frequently dine at, which are located away from the strip. The Tom Kha soup is my favorite Thai soup. I like my broth w/ a more coconut milk taste. This soup did not deliver. On the other hand, the wonton soup was pretty good. Both soups were served in smaller pots compared to other places. I preferred the taste of the chicken fried rice over the pineapple fried rice. We ordered 2 orange chicken. This was unanimously the least liked dish. The orange chicken sauce was too strong. Shrimp Pad Thai was ordered mild (not spicy) but it still came out too spicy. The same happened with the Tom Yum noodle soup.  This place is conveniently located near the strip and prices are decent. While this is not my first choice when I think of Thai food, the atmosphere and service makes up for it. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but we all know it's not possible on Yelp."}
{"text":"We will not be visiting this establishment again. They were featured on Channel 13 Dirty Dining and it was pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food in Vegas. Will recommend to give a try. Customer service is good too."}
{"text":"Huge portion. Split for a next day lunch too. Got my red curry, spicy just enough. Portion is 2 times bigger than in the Lotus Of Siam also less crowded. Waay less."}
{"text":"Awesome menu and even better food!!!   Ordered from here while on vacation in Vegas and the food was great.  Food this place on Yelp and had to order from here. My lady was tired of the hotel food and prices so we got something different. She placed the order and I got the DRUNK NOODLES, spicy 10.  I had never been asked that question before back in California when ordering the DRUNKEN NOODLES but I was excited for this meal. The only issue was that they would not be able to deliver the meal to the room, hotel regulations against double parking in entrance!!! I get it though!  The food did not take long to arrive. It took about 30 minutes at most. After bringing the food up it was time to EAT!   The food was already smelling food before it even opened the plastic top. THAT IS HOW GOOD IT WAS! Once I laid out the food on the table and grabbed my fork I was ready. BOOM....spicy spicy and sweet. Not sure what other spices were added but the places that I have been to in San Francisco do not even match this spot!! The level of spicy is CRAZY good. Seriously, if you like spicy then this place when get it POPPIN all off in YO MOUTH!!!   Great dinner, great meal, fireworks of spicy flavor in my mouth and belly!  #spicy #hot #wickedgood"}
{"text":"Very fresh and authentic thai place. I came here twice while in Vegas, the first time i had the noodles chicken that was delicious with lots of veggies. The second time i got the red curry shrimp right on point with the sticky rice. Everything was made to order and fresh."}
{"text":"When arriving in the Vegas on afternoon on Saturday, we thought let try this place out.  We ordered Boat Noodles and Yenta Foo Noodle which is very good.  If your heading to Vegas and wanted to try the Noodle Soup try this place out."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner here. I don't want to overstep my bounds, but this seems, at least to me, like it's better served as a late night spot than a good dinner restaurant. I hope that makes sense. So, if I was out late and hungry for Thai, I'd go here. But if I was hungry for Thai and it was dinner time, I don't think I would back. That's not a shot at the food, just my overall feel for the environment. Waitress was attentive, and dessert heart thing with the mangoes was really good. 3 out of 5 is A-OK, and that's what this was."}
{"text":"Really good food. The Panang Curry, Yellow Curry and Basil Chicken were very good. My favorite was the Pad Thai Shrimp ... Don't be afraid to order at a 4 on the 1-10 scale for great flavor and not killer spice."}
{"text":"Great food, Hands down. Perfect spices and heat. Very close to what I have tasted ?n Thailand. Service so so.., hence 4 stars otherwise will give 5."}
{"text":"Great new place I found.Very cute, clean and the food is very good.Love the thai tea, it's tall and good. Never would have found this place without yelp.Very tucked away in a small plaza on Industrial Rd, next to the can can room strip club.But you can't judge a book by the cover.Staff is always nice and attentive to. They just need to advertise more."}
{"text":"First time here and got the yellow curry pork. Wow, it was so good! I didn't let the shady area stear me away. Once you step inside, it is clean and the staff is very friendly and fast. I got the heat level at 5 and it was perfect. Clean bathrooms and easy parking! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I always order the Drunken Noodle w/Chicken to go and its one of the best in town, consistent and perfect spice level (6-7). As other reviewers have said, a gem off the strip."}
{"text":"I went to Vegas as I usually do and I really have not tried their Thai Food. So when my family and I went back to our resort hotel we were not feelin room service so I was the only one wanting Thai so I took the trip to go to Thai St Cafe since they had good reviews on yelp.  They had Thai Chicken Basil grounded and I was so happy. This place is so pretty on the inside, however the outside and the area appears to be shady. A few establishments down is a gentleman's club so there was A LOT of men roaming around up to no good. I was hesitant of getting out of the car due to that fact but I was like what could possibly happen from my car to the restaurant in 5 feet.  So I ordered my meal and waited a good 10 minutes. I got into my car and left. My sister was with me and was happy we were leaving the area, maybe day time is better...who knows.   So when I got back to our stay, I opened up my meal it was not what I ordered and they gave me the wrong meal -_- it was some type of noodles that was good but was not my Thai Ground Chicken Basil. I was disappointed due to that but the noodles and chicken were good.  Make sure to check your order before you leave!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It wasn't too crowded on a Saturday night. It took a long for our order to make it to the table. I was fairly upset it took so long but after one bite I forgave them. It was the best Pad Thai I've had in a very very long time. Possibly ever. Portion size was great. My daughter got the potstickers and loved them. And the price was excellent."}
{"text":"So the restaurant is in a pretty kinky neighborhood next to a row of sex shops and liquor stores. Look for a strip joint called \"can can\" for parking. My husband was embarrassed to bring my mom here like \"Well, it wasn't me who yelped this place\"  The bottom line is, the food makes up for it all. I recommend Tom Ka (might not be the right spelling of the dish. It's a coconut soup) and bees noodle salad.   ?????????10????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????10?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very good Thai!  They have a decent menu and very delicious curry. I will return every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is really misleading as it's tucked away in a somewhat questionable strip mall on Industrial. If I didn't drive by it every day for work and finally take the time to research it, I would have never gone. But I'm glad I did! A cute little place with good food. They have a great $7.99 lunch special which comes with a lot of food and multiple choices. I've gone for lunch quite a few times and pick up dinner to-go regularly. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Big portions and very flavorful! Got the yellow curry and it was awesome. Friend got the drunk noodles those were great too."}
{"text":"I had requested them to deliver spicy basil entree and veg basil fried rice without tomatoes and lemon. But the first thing I saw after opening the box was tomatoes. I called them up to inform that my order was not made per the instructions and the lady on the phone put me on hold for like 15mins to check with the chef. After 15mins, I disconnected the phone and tried calling them again. However, the phone was engaged all the time and I couldn't get in touch with them. I have never experienced such a bad customer service. They had my phone number too so if they would have wanted to take responsibility, they could have even called me back. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place when you're craving for some really good Thai food. I got the spicy basil with chicken and rice. It was really tasty and delicious. Just the right amount of flavor and spice. Also, the restaurant itself is really nice and the service and staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Sexy neon Thai lights awaits you friend...  No, really look for the neon lights on the exterior. If you have driven in and only see gentlemen's clubs, you've missed the one way lot north of this area.  Bomb wings and pad see ew. Industrial decor on every inch of the place. Add a lil decorative wheat and you've got the look of a brewery.   They also have a huge selection of spicy condiments on a lil lazy Susan for you. Sweat out those carnal desires here."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a week with my family .  With help of Yelp I found this place and wanted to give a try. Place is pretty cool and they are open until 11.30 another big plus point. We ordered chicken satay , tom yum soup, drunken noodles , crab fried rice , red curry and Thai tea for drinks.   First of all let me start with appetizer . Chicken satay was pretty good with peanut sauce on side .   Drunken noodles amazing I loved it . Crab fried rice had lot of meat in it and had a aroma which was so good. Over all we enjoyed the food and the service was the reason I gave four stars . There were only two people working and they will need to take care of billing , ordering and serving food. On Saturday evening it's little difficult for two persons to manage that big place . Other than that everything was great"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Thai food place when in Vegas. The service is always great and their portions are huge! We usually get the Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice. This time we tried the calamari which was crispy, thin and delicious and we also tried the Pad Prik King and oh boyyyy that is my new favorite Thai dish! We got this with chicken and tofu and it's stir fried with a red curry paste and every bite has the most flavorful lemongrass kick to it. I wish I knew about this dish when visiting Thailand, but I am glad we discovered it here. This place is truly authentic & we will be coming back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Nice interiors. Good prices. The pots stickers were outstanding, not so keen on the curry puffs, though my friends rated them. Loved the service too. A heated soup bowl was a dinky touch too. I recommend them however don't walk there from the strip, it's too hot and you'll tire yourself out! Also, we were super full after our order was done, but ordered mango and sticky rice and coconut ice cream to share. The ice cream was super delicious...and recommended."}
{"text":"Definitely do not be turned off by the location of this place.    We were pleasantly surprised and glad we gave this place a try!  We tried their Tom Ka Soup which was good, a little on the sweeter side but still good and nicely presented. We also had their Pad See Ew with beef and their Panang Curry which were the star of the night.  They were both so full of flavor and enjoyed them to the very last bite.  We ended the night with their sweet Roti drizzled with condensed milk and in the center some powdered cocoa as well as their Sticky Rice and Mango, and lastly their Coconut Ice Cream.  All were delicious but my favorite was the coconut ice cream!  The staff seemed a little overwhelmed but I think it was due to a very large party at the time. Overall a great Thai dining experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Very nice place as soon as you walk in. Great music and just overall feel. The food was awesome. Ordered the veggie dumplings, pad Thai, soup, and banana wontons for dessert. Everything was so good!"}
{"text":"Good food....horrible service. When my wife confronted the server about it, her response was fake and her attempt at improving the service seemed disingenuous. Don't think we'll be back..."}
{"text":"Although the street seemed sketchy, the restaurant was actually clean and welcoming.  The tables were quite large and efficient for sharing food.   The food overall was really good but the portions were a bit small.  The pad thai was good but the additional $4 for assorted seafood was pricy.  There wasn't that much added in so I would just stick with shrimp only if you want seafood.  The chow mein was a bit too oily and the flavor was primarily egg like, strangely.  The papaya salad was alright, the portion was decent and it was refreshing.  The beef salad was really good, the beef was tender.  The seasoning wasn't overpowering and the spice was reasonable.  The eggplant dish was savory and although some pieces were a bit tough, it gave a different dimension to our overall meal.  Highly recommended.  The calamari came out hot and crispy; it was perfected seasoned and the sweet sauce surprisingly complimented it.   The drinks came in tall glasses.  The thai tea was good, not too sweet but the lemonade tasted diluted.  The large amount of ice in each glass could have contributed to the lessening of taste.   The pricing was reasonable and it was a good stop for a late dinner.  The servers were friendly but there was some difficulty communicating.  Despite the barriers, their hospitality was apparent."}
{"text":"Had pad sea eew for lunch.  It was very delicious.  The service is amazing; they kept checking on us to see if we need anything else.  *thumb up*"}
{"text":"Put blinders on the kids! Strip club on the left, adult film studio on the right...I need to visit this area without the family next time.  But once you get in and look beyond the smoky interior, its quite comfortable.  Orange Chicken - yes, probably not the dish you'd want to order at a Thai place, but it was good!  Neon orange crunchy candy coated fried chunks of chicken.  If that is your type of thing with a bowl of white rice, then you'd be in heaven.    Pad See Ew - also pretty good here.  Of course we had to get everything with spice level 0 for the kid but the ingredients all had good texture and felt fresh.  Neighboring businesses probably scare some of their potential customers away but they're just missing out on some good food."}
{"text":"Found this place and it's great for a late night snack after work since it's open until 4am. The parking and location is in a small area and it looks a tad seedy (near strip clubs) but the restaurant itself is nice.  Food - I tried their drunken noodles and mango sticky rice. The food was well seasoned, cooked nicely, and came out very quickly. I'm excited to try their other items and their menu is diverse but not overwhelming. The size was very fair for the price point.   Service - service was a bit slacking here but what service I did get was pleasant and nice. I requested no onions on my dish but it showed up with onions... oh well. lol but it wasn't so bad to the point that I wouldn't come back.   Overall, I think I found a new favorite late night Thai food spot. Really enjoyed the overall convenience, hours, and food."}
{"text":"Don't let the location and the look from the outside fool you. This place is close to the Encore casino which is convenient for me to get lunch from. It's not like Chadas or lotus of Siam but it's still good with fair prices.  Now to the food, I tried a couple of different dishes. I tried the crying tiger wrap which was interesting to have Thai food in a burrito. It was pretty good and the sauce is really good.  I tried your normal pad thais, pad see ewe, and drunken noodle entrees and they were good as well. Not dry like some other cheap places. The presentation of their menu is nice because you can see what all their dishes look like."}
{"text":"Long wait time on food (over 20 mins) when the restaurant only had a few tables seated. Staff were friendly though.   Food was decent, but nothing to write home about. Too much coconut milk in panang curry. Would have been fine but it seems they poured pure coconut milk on top of the dish for presentation and diluted the sauce.   Pad Thai was alright, didn't have the vinegary taste I like, it was very sweet and sugary tasting.   Best part of the meal were the chicken puff pastry appetizer. Really good."}
{"text":"Looking for excellent Thai food, where the menu is not all the usual fare? ... this is the place to go. Wonderful flavors and taste with a really friendly staff. This is a hidden gem off the main strip close to the Trump hotel and well worth trying out."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. The food was genuinely good and tasty. My dish was drunken noodles, my company colleagues had Pad Thai and Pad See Ew.   The problems with this place are below:  1. It is in a plaza that is very indecent  2. We had a hair in one of our dinners and told two of the staff and they laughed and asked if we wanted a box   On the positive: 1. Food is yummy 2. People are kind 3. Very affordable   Hence my mixed review- I really enjoyed my dinner just not the experience."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food but claims vegan options yet when we asked the curries had fish sauce in."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night and there was no line.  Exactly what you would expect - Clean place with friendly service. 4 Stars for the price. The drive up is a little off-putting but over all good food and service."}
{"text":"Pretty good and fast for pick up so I'm rounding up. It's nice and clean inside despite the seedy strip mall location. I ordered a pad kee mao spice level 4 and they were not shy about making it spicy. The pork was actually pretty tender which isn't always the case with this dish. Prices and portions are very reasonable, especially compared to Strip prices."}
{"text":"Very accommodating. They delivered to the hotel. Communicated well about our delivery. Ordering was simple. Food was perfect! Spicy though! Boba with Thai tea was excellent"}
{"text":"We were looking for something good to eat on a late weeknight. This popped up with great reviews so decided to check it out. Definitely did not disappoint. Our server \"Honey\" was great and we enjoyed our meal. Crab fried rice was bomb.com!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Thai restaurants in the city and there are quite a few. Most of the dishes, particularly the appetizers, are smaller portioned but taste great. The combination of sauces and spices is remarkable and the staff is attentive and welcoming. One quarrel I did have was that the spice rack was taken away without asking before our meals were even close to being finished. The location isn't particularly inviting but the interior is spacious and welcoming."}
{"text":"Really modernized place! Opened until late hours so nice for the late night crowds. Food was super tasty, spice levels are no joke for the spice lovers! very clean and food presentation was appealing. Favors were on point, service was quick! Overall, great place. Would totes come back with my friends!"}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 star rating.  It would've been 3 but their customer service made it 3.5 The restaurant itself is called Thai Street Cafe. So one would presume authentic Thai \"street\" food. But it was far from it. Very Americanized modern flavor, which is not bad in itself because I love Americanized Thai food too. But this place, as far as flavor and spices-were just average...even their Thai iced coffee was very sweet, tasted like heavy chocolate syrup. The best thing they had was their pork jerky! Perfectly seasoned and tender! Their house made sauce went perfect with the flavors. Most Thai places only have beef jerky. So when your restaurant has pork jerky that's also a huge plus!  Also they did not have an option for Laos Style Papaya Salad! Most Thai places do not....BUT if your Thai restaurant does have it or can make it that's a HUGE plus-extra star;-)"}
{"text":"I expected to really like this place, but they lost their good graces with very poor service.  We were promptly seated and served quickly, then our server completely disappeared...we may need to put here on the side of a milk carton...she never returned.  Another server visited our table,,,to take away our condiments and give them to another table. I had to ask for water and a container for our soup and put the soup in the container myself.   Finally, I had to go up to the front and ask for the check and after five minutes of more waiting, I had to go up and stand there and wait for it."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. Nothing special, not bad either. I have eaten here several times because it is very close to my office. The low rating comes from the consistently slow service. Today was the final straw for me. I waited more than 20 minutes for my food after ordering. They were not busy, but three other groups arrived after me, finished their lunches, paid and left while I was just starting to eat. I asked someone other than my server for a to-go box and extra rice. He did not bring the rice, so I asked again when he came back. My server heard me this time, as she was approaching with my check. I reviewed it and gave her my credit card. When I got it back, she had charged my card $1.95 more than the original amount (for the extra rice) without my approval. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Oh my Gawd!! I am so in love with finding really cool places amongst a seedy strip mall.  And i mean HUGE fan. I feel like it keeps the hidden gems just hidden enough that the masses don't ruin a good thing.  It's hidden in the strip of exotic dance wear shops and next to the can can room.  In between Deja Vu and Sapphire.  Yaaas queen.  Work that pole then get your panang on! I'm also going to highly recommend the Thai burrito. It's called a tiger wrap I think.  So delish.  I only ordered food to go,  can't wait to dine in next time because the ambiance was stellar"}
{"text":"We wanted some delicious Thai food and ended up going to a fancy restaurant on the strip the day before where the food wasn't that good.  This place is the best find in Vegas. If you're into Thai food this is a must. They do pickup so you can take it back to your hotel room and enjoy it. I got fried rice but regretted it after trying my friends curry.   The portions are a decent size and won't leave you hungry."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!!!  Had the beef jerk appetizer, steak salad, and a fresh coconut. Was asked how hot I wanted my food 1 out of 10.  I chose 10 and honestly it was the hottest food I have ever had, I was sweating and had to take breaks between bites but seriously delicious food.  Bathrooms and restaurant were super clean!  I rarely give out 5 stars but this place deserves it.  I walked from my hotel Flamingo it was quite a walk, will probably drive next time. But will go back again!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place is top notch. Don't let the surroundings distract you from an authentic Thai experience. Clean, smart and very close to the strip. Loved it. Came back again multiple times."}
{"text":"Cool place, the atmosphere is really relaxing, I like the staff !! Very helpful and smile a lot :) definitely coming again !! The food is affordable and the place I not far from the strip! I would recommend this place for cheap and good food!!"}
{"text":"Amazing off the beaten path food! We loved it so much we made sure to order some to go as our last Vegas meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to hit up when I am in Las Vegas. Great Price. Great Food. Service can occasionally be slow but the food and price make up for it. Its not too far off the strip either."}
{"text":"Not in the best area in town, but once you enter, it feels safer, although the decor is more contemporary than Thai.  No alcohol,  but you can buy from Liquor store next door and drink in here...but get twist off beers, for the have no bottle openers,  and it not legal for them to open with no liquor license.   The appetizers were mediocre, we had Chicken Sate and Beef Jerky.  Sate was good, (but hard to mess that up), Jerky was dry.   We ordered Phad Thai and Drunken Noodles.  We had #5 on the spice meter, and it was way too spicy.  I think that was more of a 8 or 9.  We asked to have them replaced at #2, and they just added a bunch of vegetables to it instead.  Drunken Noodles was more of a Chop Suey. Last we had Thai Fried Rice, which was less than average.  For dessert, we tried the Ro Ti, since there were some exciting stuff written about it on Yelp.  Big disappointment.  It was like a flour tortilla with condensed milk and some cocoa powder.  The coconut ice cream was nothing special.  Then we got our bill and they charged us $3 extra for the vegetables they used to try to fix the noodle dishes, instead of just making new ones.   Still searching for my Thai place in Vegas.  Miss my Thai places in LA, and I don't think we will come back to this place.."}
{"text":"Each dish was flavorful and delicious!  I will definitely come back!  The drunken noodles with a spice level of 5 was perfect for me. The Tom Yum soup was great too.  The restaurant was very clean!"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck Thai food place in town! Makes the other Thai places feel expensive. They don't sacrifice quality despite the more affordable prices here. Some advice - stay away from noodle soups. It wasn't super delicious; it was just plain good. I'd recommend the basil fried rice with an entree + Thai iced tea. This place looks upscale too with nice furniture and cool music."}
{"text":"Very Unique Place. Great Food, Fast, Friendly and Inexpensive. You Can't Go Wrong with it."}
{"text":"Wanted Thai food and this place stays open late so I thought why not. I ordered online and when I got there to pick up the food, first thing I noticed walking in was how cute the place was. It's small but the tables are spaced out very well.  We had to wait a few minutes since it wasn't ready but that wasn't a problem at all. We got the Thai tea with boba. Oh my gosh. First sip and I thought I was just drinking sugar. I know all places make Thai tea different so I always expect it's either a hit or miss. With that in mind, I just thought I could just water it down a little, no big deal. Then I got to the boba, and now I'm regretting the entire drink. It was the hardest boba I've ever had. I worked at a boba shop a while back so I know that their boba was not even close to being cooked. They were very understanding and friendly about it though. They just remade the Thai tea without boba and gave us an extra one. I didn't really care for more super sweet tea, but that was sweet of them.   I got the beef salad and the beef was just chewy. And it was more sour than having that spicy, salt, and lime balanced taste. I didn't even make a dent in my beef salad. I ate more of the plain white rice I ordered on the side.   The boyfriend ordered their crab rangoons and those were really good. It had an extra taste to them compared to all the other crab rangoons I've tried.   Even tho I wasn't a fan, I do plan on giving them another try. Maybe dining in next time will be better."}
{"text":"Service was 3/5 the guy was nice but they were very discouraging about eating here since they closed in 2 hours which I don't understand. They were supposed to close in 1 hour and a couple came to eat and they were turned out because they were closed... ¿?¿??  Food tasted 7/10 it says no msg on the door but it felt like there was some msg in the food.. Not completely sure. And the tom yum I ordered, was delicious but not level 7 spicy as I asked for.  I didn't want to ask them to take it back and fix it because at that point I already spilled my water and the workers were irritated and had to move our tables and do all this extra work (which I felt bad about) so I didn't say anything.  Anyways, we Also ordered crying tiger 9/10 , wonton hot pot 9/10 (tasted somewhat healthier than the tom yum)  And drunken noodle 3/10(my friends opinion) he said they didn't offer enough for the price paid for.  The sweet sticky rice and mango also came with green rice which actually wasn't that sticky and $6.95! So expensive. Lastly, I'd have to admit. If you want the best bang for your buck don't come here, there's secret hidden costs everywhere and it's so expensive for mediocre quality food and they don't even offer enough to satisfy your hunger. I ordered side noodles for my soup; $3.95 Side order rice; $2.50  Tom yum soup is supposed to come with a meat any extra meat is extra cost. I didn't order extra meat just the meat that comes with it.. shrimp; $2 Drunken noodles about $9 for a pretty small plate.  I mean the inside is cute though and nicely decorated and fairly clean. It's just that this shop is set up in a plaza full of strip clubs and it's a little far from where I live. The only good thing is it opens late but even then they still don't let you come in at 3 when they close at 4!  I truly want to give this place another chance and think maybe their tom yum has potential to reach its ultimate spicy goodness! And that maybe we came on a bad day, hopefully they can redeem themselves I don't know. But their price point is still pretty terrible. 2 stars for now!"}
{"text":"Ordered pickup when I was in vegas for one night and was hella hungry. it was fresh and super tasty."}
{"text":"I searched up hot new businesses one night and happened upon this place. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and suggested going. He seemed a little hesitant about the place cause of the neighborhood but was open to trying it out.  And he actually went there before me on a lone venture a couple nights later. He enjoyed the food and got me pad see ew to go as a result. We went the next day together.  The restaurant really is small in area/seating space but it wasn't too busy the day we came in for lunch. It's a very casual setting. We were immediately greeted by the lovely server who remembered my bf the previous day. She was the lone server and delivered excellent hospitality and was very attentive our whole stay.   I love that the water came in a bottle and was ice cold. We got the free Thai tea with yelp check-in which was quite sweet but hey it was free x) not to mention was in a tall glass.   We chose the chicken satay as our free appetizer. The chicken was cooked perfectly and didn't turn out dry. The marinade on it wasn't overly salty or over seasoned.  The accompanying peanut sauce was delicious as a dipping sauce and the pickled cucumber salad which wasn't too sour or sweet complimented the satay very well.  My boyfriend ordered the drunken noodles with chicken.  He got it with medium heat which was quite spicy but manageable. I suggest getting it mild. Noodles weren't overcooked or mushy and it wasn't too saucy; just right.  I got the pad Thai lunch set with shrimp (as suggested by our server) and it was a nice portion of food. It included an egg roll (with a delicious dipping sauce different from sweet and sour), salad with a peanut vinegrette dressing, and scoop of rice which I didn't touch cause I had noodles as a main. It had the right amount of spicy; not too much to the point I couldn't handle the heat. The lunch set is a pretty good amount of food and I didn't finish anything on my plate except the egg roll lol but I took them to go.  I am actually eating my leftovers as I type this review and the pad Thai is still as good as yesterday. Lost some of its  moisture as expected but the flavors are still there.  Food didn't take too long to come out and you could tell they took their time to cook it to order.  Our visit was not complete without our souvenir pic with the cardboard taxi haha. And lucky for us the previous patrons already left so we managed to take a couple pics with no one around lol with the help of our server too. Don't forget to take one with it as well!   All in all, would definitely be back. Must try their desserts and curry.  Love that they are open till 4 am and that they aren't located right on the strip. It didn't  bother me that there are strip clubs and adult stores in the vicinity either haha."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from yelp which was aweeeesomeeeee!!! We didn't even have to leave the hotel room and for only $5 delivery fee , sign me up !! Although on Yelp it's says $3.50 delivery it was actually 5. We had drunken noodles, yellow curry , larb, chicken cashew, basil fried rice . Thai tea was free which was nice . Every thing was full of flavor and oh so nommmmms. I must say portion size was small, I'm so used to bigger portions lol . But flavor was there so I'll overlook the small portions, they did however forgot my chicken cashew so I had to call the restaurant and ask them to come back n drop it off, the staff however didn't offer anything to make up for that so I bluntly asked for a free side of pickled cucumber salad which after a minute of hassling she said ok . So thanks for the free cucumber since ur driver forgot my chicken cashew ."}
{"text":"The area is shady as s***. But please do not be fooled. The food is awesome. The service was great. The only downfall was they do not serve booze. Although they do allow for you to bring your own."}
{"text":"Just come back from holiday in Las Vegas ., this is one of our favorite food there so far ., like the Thai country's style , remind me of home and then the yummy taste of all food , just WOW ., Som Tum here is the best so far ., taste great with level of spicy to choose , I ask for 8 and that was just right ... my Yentafo noodle is wonderful , good taste , thumbs up from all of us , will drop by again when we go to Vegas next time"}
{"text":"This review is for take-out / delivery ONLY. I'm sure the food is much better if you're actually there and possibly Vegas drunk.   I had Thai St Cafe delivered to my hotel after a super long day of walking. My boyfriend and I decided on thai food over sushi and we didn't think we would regret our decision so much.   Food: Pad See Ew: I ordered a 2 on the spiciness for the pad see ew after reading that the spicy ranges from 1-10. I expected the spiciness to be slightly more spicy than mild but it was SO spicy that I threw it out after eating a few bites. My stomach was unsettled for the rest of the night. It was completely flavorless aside from the extreme heat. Usually pad see ew is rather sweet and savory but this one was dry, bland, and just way too spicy for what I ordered.  Pad Thai: My boyfriend had this one and he finished most of his. He ordered 8 on spiciness and he thought it was really spicy. But that was what he wanted so it was fine. It wasn't that flavorful aside from the spiciness either though.  Chicken wings: I thought maybe at least chicken wings wouldn't disappoint me but I was wrong. The wings were pretty dry and spicy even though the sauce was advertised as sweet chili. What happened to the sweetness?   I was so disappointed that I wasted a meal in Vegas on this."}
{"text":"Just look at the menu, meals come out just as per photos. Ate there a number of times. Always delivered above my high expectations. Great price."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here.  We had chicken panang curry and glass noodle salad with shrimp, ground chicken, tomatoes, onions, peanuts, cilantro in a spicy lime dressing.    The curry sauce was delicious with tender chicken and the salad was better than expected.  It hit the spot and is open late.   Prices are standard and the portions are big enough to share.  Def. recommend."}
{"text":"0 stars for crappy staff. 0 stars because we basically walked out pissed.  Came in after work because of the 4.5 stars. Pictures looked enticing. Walked in, and no one approached us about seating. The staff just had tunnel vision and just looked down the whole time.  Once seated, took her 20 minutes to take our order. Ordered the Tiger Wrap, which she told us was unavailable. Ok, now if she would have approached us sooner maybe we could have had a back up dish. She put in our order for papaya salad, which 5 minutes had passed and we still hadn't received our waters.  There were only two of them on the floor and I noticed most of the guests had looked irate for constantly waiting and trying to flag down for service.   With such a long wait for just anything in general, and lack in service, and honestly no apologies on their end. We just gave up, she never returned back to complete our orders, give us drinks or anything for that matter. We gave up, cancelled whatever order we had and walked out. That is something I had never done before especially being in the industry myself. I had just never received such shitty service in my life like that, and we're usually understanding with these situations. They just lacked common knowledge and any kind of hospitality."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, perfect taste and best this boba tea I've had. Plus Sol was the perfect waitress, she's so sweet!!!!"}
{"text":"The pad thai was not very good.  That's usually my indicator if a Thai restaurant is good.  It was very sour, and didn't have the subtly sweet and savory notes most pad thai usually has.  The red curry was pretty good.  Large portion of curry with a little ball of rice.  And the thai iced tea portion was pretty decent too.  Overall, good prices, but the food was not that great."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my job. That's the first thing that I loved about it before even trying it. After I tasted the food, I really love it and recommend it.  The food is so delicious and fresh.  Thai tea is the second best I have had. The people working there are so attentive to your needs and also very friendly. The location is clean and dark but relaxing. I had the chicken pad see ew and like I said it was delicious. I will for sure go again when I'm at work and also take my family to try it as well. Try it if you're looking to have a great Thai dish.  You will not be disappointed. If you are, well then we just might have different opinions about the place but as for me, I loooved everything about it.  Even the price is okay considering you're getting fresh and quality food. If you try it ENJOY!!!!!"}
{"text":"I guess most Yelpers do not know Thai food. We came here because Chada Street was closed for a holiday. I am half Thai and was excited to try this place and surprised I didn't hear about it. Well, no wonder. It took like 15min for her to come to our table to order drinks. She didn't write anything down and I was nervous but she did remember everything. Everything tasted like frozen food. No special or unique flavors. I tried a different soup, Kao Soy soup, than I usually get at other places, Tom Kha, but was very disappointed. They didn't ask us what spice level so everything was really plain. The Thai iced tea was really tall so luckily we only got one. The coconut water might've been the best thing. The place is nice-looking inside though."}
{"text":"At Fashion Show Mall with my woman and she says she wants Thai, a quick search on YELP and shimber me timbers, Thai St was moments away. Easy to find from Fashion Show and the awesome drunken noodles. We also had the Tom Kah soup and the spicy mint chicken. First time in and won't be the last. Honey was our server and wasn't she just. Saw a stage but did not ask what goes down but it is there. Very clean and smartly put together it was win win all the way around. Sa Wad Dee yo."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Food seems great price, menu sounds delicious. Ordered delivery, beef pad Thai I specified spicy and it was not spicy. The young man who delivered was rude when arrived. Thai tea thankfully was delicious. But overall not what I expected considering all the reviews I seen here"}
{"text":"This place is not on the strip and that is one of the best parts about it. We were craving for anything non-ameican food and their food was really amazing. We had yellow curry and rice. Amazing taste and quick service. One tip: we ordered a take out from Yelp and yelp said it will take 60 minutes and it actually took 30 (including driving time). So call and ask them and ask for actual time."}
{"text":"I love it here.  I've been at this restaurant a number of different times and have never been disappointed. Service has always been excellent and the food is perfect. Our entrees are always hot and fresh.  The staff is always kind, considerate, and actually grateful of my business. This is my favorite spot for some Thai"}
{"text":"I had midnight munchies and this place was walking distance from our hotel. It's located in a seedy area of town with strip clubs all up and down the street, what do you expect from Vegas. I ordered from the super friendly waiter my favorite dish Chicken Pad Thai. They have heat levels 1 through 10, I asked for 7, just in case it wasn't too hot. The food was delicious, it was so delicious I brought my wife and daughter the next evening for dinner, my wife ordered heat level 8. Both of them are picky eaters and they loved the food."}
{"text":"I really like the price, and food quality normally but today was the 4th time they gave me the wrong dish I always order the spicy basil chicken and now I verify by pointing. They have gave me basil fried rice instead for the 4th time today and the spice level was non existent... normally I wouldn't complain but 4 times is unacceptable. I doubt I'll be coming back again... the other 3x I told them they made a mistake and they not once offered to correct it complimentary... I do not feel it's my job to ask them to so that's why I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from friends- it's not an area I usually venture out to, but I was intrigued by the idea of Thai street food in Vegas. Unfortunately, aside from the wraps, they have a pretty standard menu.  THAI CHICKEN WINGS: Good flavor in the sauce but otherwise a bit on the dry side, price was okay for the portion but this didn't stand out as something I'd get again. CRYING TIGER WRAP: grilled sliced beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, mint, cilantro, and rice wrapped in a tortilla with a spicy lime sauce. I really enjoyed the sauce and the tender meat, but there was no rice in my wrap. It was mostly stuffed with lettuce, which made it lighter than the burrito-esque food I was expecting.  Staff was friendly when I went to pick up my order. They did inform me that the curries were popular, and they were likely removing the wraps from the menu. Despite the seedy area, the interior was nicely decorated with dark wood and large color photos of Thailand street markets. Disappointed that they don't actually have anything resembling street food here.  NOTE: Pricing is a little high for the area, such as $10 for an entrée without rice (additional $3) and all apps seem to be about $8. Not super high or anything, just not consistent with expectations for Industrial Rd."}
{"text":"Worst online order and phone call service!!!!! They CANNOT understand anything you say!!!! They ask me if I want rice to start the conversation.......Just stopped talking on the phone in the middle of an order and start talking to a walk in customer...... Unbearable experience"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food. We had the pad see ew, garlic wings, and pineapple fried rice. All very delicious. The staff was very friendly as well. Will definitely come back to try more out."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, i would.  My boyfriend and I were visiting Vegas for the weekend and I had the biggest craving for thai food. We looked to yelp for a good place and it led me to this restaurant,  it had great reviews and I was really excited.  We got to the restaurant at 3:15, upon entering we were not greeted, not acknowledged. After 5 minutes we finally got acknowledged and seated. Maybe 15 minutes in to waiting,  the waitress FINALLY came over.  There was 1 waitress, probably 1 person cooking the food in the restaurant,  and 1 really clueless looking waiter. 3:45 rolled around still no drinks,  no water,  nothing.  At 4 o clock,  still no drinks,  no food, so we just left. Honestly the wait for the food would have been no big deal if i could have at least been served a water. Thanks for ruining my last dinner in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was really good! We got the tom yum soup, chicken yellow curry, and sweet and sour chicken. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because the wait time for our food took way too long. We were even watching Netflix on my phone waiting for it lol. Other than that, it's legit!"}
{"text":"Went in, they sat us, there was one other table..  after about 15 minutes of looking at the menu no one acknowledged us, no server came to the table, a busser was bussing the table that just left and the other employees all talking by the cash register.  So we got up and left to go somewhere that actually wanted you to dine there.  They even told us to have a goodnight as we left, mind you it was 6 hours before their 4am closing time.  It's probably why there was no business, poor service will ruin a restaurant, it's a shame to see!"}
{"text":"I looked for places open late since it was 2 am and found this spot on yelp. It wasn't in the best area but I figured I would give it a try for some reason. The place was empty so I knew I would getting my food fast which is always a plus (forever a fatty). I went with the chicken Tom kha soup with a side of rice. It was a big portion and presented nicely considering it was only 8 bucks I think? It came on a wooden square with a heat source underneath to keep the soup nice and hot. It was the perfect temperature for me since I have a cough and cold at the moment. There was an evenly distributed amount of chicken and vegetables which I appreciated because I feel like it's never like that. I got it mild and the amount of spice and flavors were on point. I can't complain and I do wanna go back and try more."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pickup. Very tasty chicken pad see ew. I also got the spring rolls and dumplings. The spring rolls were great, the dumplings were so-so. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So I came in to eat I was very hungry I was working all day. I was Cravings Southeast Asian food. So I came in alone after work and order some potstickers, Thai Boat noodles and Pad Thai. Potsticker had great flavor except it was an as steamed as it should be more crunchy than anything else. The boat noodle was good and when I got to the pot Thai Flavor was a a bit Bland so I try to add some fish sauce and more spice I took a couple bites and when I kept mixing it through I found a bee... yes an actual bee in my Pad Thai. I ate some of it which disgusts me more than anything else A and it was a whole bee. I'm sorry Services mediocre I am probably never coming back and I don't recommend anyone else. First time trying it and my last time."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  I always order the curry puffs which are delicious.  What I like most about it is they do a good job with traditional dishes like Pad See-ew and Pad Thai but they also have a lot of unique dishes that other Thai restaurants typically don't offer like curry puffs and the wraps, etc.  I always order delivery and cannot comment on the in-dining experience."}
{"text":"My food has not arrived the restaurant called me 30 minutes after I placed it to say they didn't have an item, then when I checked the order status 30 minutes later it stated the order was in route. I just got off the phone with the restaurant and the driver forgot an item and had to go back.  Not organized at all! I worry if my food will ever arrive!"}
{"text":"Though their location sucks... between strip clubs and stripper supply companies, once you get in, the small location is well done and the food was great. The service had a nice Thai authenticity to it.  The food will impress. They played rap music which flew in the face of the theme. May seem odd, but the 1 star penalty was for location and crap music, but not for the food."}
{"text":"Very bad service! The food come after 2 hours  the delivery guy told us to make it warm in the microwave lol....we give him beck the food and call to the restaurant and they didn't spoil us and some women that unsure to us was very rude ! Don't make this mistake like us! Enjoy...."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai Papaya Salad (No green beans with extra papaya) & beef Pad Thai.   Their papaya salad wasn't my favorite, I wouldn't get it again. It's a little too salty for me or maybe they just put a little too much crab or shrimp paste.   Now the Pad Thai here is definitely on my favorite list from a number of the Thai restaurants I've been to in LV.  Service was fine. It was empty when I got in so even better."}
{"text":"I  soooo glad we went off strip for this one. It's clean, modern, and OMG!!! The food is amazing! I went with the red curry, pad Thai, chicken satay, Thai fried rice, and spring noodles. I know a lot of food. Split of with my buddy!! The server was kind and considerate. What a great experience! We ate Thai at the Restaraunt in the aria (I think it was called lemon grass) the next night. It was a distant second to Thai street. We'll be back soon. Thx!"}
{"text":"Don't tell me your restaurant is open when you're not going to be open. All the chefs were eating and they rudely said were only doing \"to go\". Very rude- if there food is any reflection of their attitude steer clear. I'm from Los Angeles where Thai food is amazing and the people are nice. LATE."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes without water and waited to order, there was one waitress who did not look at our table once. Complete disappointment.  The place was only half full as well... There should be no excuse."}
{"text":"Portions are getting smaller and they now charge for easy ice in their Thai tea. The servers around midnight aren't as attentive even though were the only ones in the restaurant and about 3 servers not including host and cooks.."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is super hip and cute. The waitress was super nice and attentive. I got the chicken pad thai at 7/10 spiciness. Holy, spicy! So be careful of your level. The noodles and chicken were perfectly blended and I would definitely order it again.   Overall, this place is a gem hidden in the rough. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Good curry. Came out fast. Both our tables were wobbly and there was one fly that wouldn't leave us alone. Apart from that it was fantastic"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious. It was so good we wanted to bring the leftovers home with us, but we're staying in a hotel and didn't have a way to reheat them. If you're looking for good Thai food, the short trip off the strip is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Authentic high quality Thai food that is reasonably priced. Portions are generous and staff is friendly. Restaurant is clean and modern in the inside."}
{"text":"Iced tea: really really sweet. I had to ask for more milk. It is really big though :)   Pad thai: it was ok. Asked for vegetable pad thai. Didnt really have variety of veggies  Had high hopes but it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in a while. I got the yellow curry lunch special. She said 10 minutes but it came out in a flash. Curry was insanely delicious, well balanced and creamy. It tasted like it was simmering all day yet the veggies& chicken were not overcooked. Chicken was sliced thin & very tender. Boba tea was great too!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. The curry was water mixed with spices. Nothing else. The tofu was thrown in there as an after thought. It wasn't seasoned. I felt like I was eating spicy, mushy rice. The delivery container it came with mixed the watery curry and tofu half haphazardly all over the place. I'll post a picture. The whole thing was just a mess. This is the worst Thai food I've ever eaten. Save yourself some time and go to Archie's or ANY where else really."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside appearance scare you away as this diamond in the rough is in an outdoor strip of retail and gentleman's clubs that needs to get cleaned up.  The food was fresh and amazing, no NSG, and we will definitely return. They will delivery to Westgate Hotel also. We went st midnight as they are open super long hours."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Very clean, prices are in line for good Thai food.  Service was great.  Only downside is no wine.  My work partner and I travel to a city every week for sales calls and this is by far the best Thai we've had in a year."}
{"text":"So I've ordered a few more times here. I can say with experience now that weekend orders simply take longer, budget about 1.5 hours on average. Weekday orders are actually pretty quick though. I've had a mixed experience with their drivers, some simply show up with my food, no problem, and others require a hand holding via phone. Not a big deal, really, and the food has always been very good."}
{"text":"Came here late at night since they close at 4am every day.   Food was tasty: got the garlic chicken and the khao soi (pretty sure there was almost half a chicken in the khao soi )  The waitress was really friendly and the service was efficient!  Decor inside is pretty cool with lots of reclaimed wood. Plenty of booths and several large tables for bigger groups. There's also a corner with a karaoke machine but no one was singing when we were there (not sure if that's a good or bad thing).   For all day or late night grub, Thai Street Cafe is the way to go!"}
{"text":"The food was great and delivered earlier than expected. I was especially pleased that the delivery guy stayed so long when i couldn't hear him knock. A lot of places would have just left, and he was still super nice, although I'm sure it put his schedule behind. Great customer service."}
{"text":"What a great find close to the strip. Clean, great food, and super nice service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Fast service and they have the option for delivery or pick up! Very clean and trendy place, definitely coming back on my next trips to Vegas or have them deliver! Also the staff was very friendly and had a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Delicious and a life saver on a Sunday night when you're over all the over roiled, under serving restaurants on the Strip. Delivered right outside my hotel lobby. Watch out if you're not used to Thai level spicy. I ordered my food at a 7 and it felt like a 10+! Still amazing though, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"One star for service, another for effort. Decent looking place. Ordered Bãsil fried rice. The rice was under cooked and was hard to chew/swallow."}
{"text":"The foods is okay, but the service is bad. A lady took our beverage order and 10min later, she come back and ask us again the same question. Then when we order our food, they let us sit there and wait for 1 hour until they bring our foods. (Wait for 1 hour in order to eat 4 foods) Never come back again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!  I would've never thought this would be so close to the Strip.  Thai St Cafe is less than a mile away and down the street from Encore.  The decor is modern and industrial looking.  I like the clean look of it!  The menu was really helpful because it included photos of each item so you can get an idea of what is in each dish.    The service is quick and our server was very friendly.  The food is sooooo good!  It was so good that we came back the next night and ordered 'to-go.'   FOOD -  Spice Levels:  They are Thai spice, not American spice levels.  So be cautious when ordering your food. -  Pad thai:  Spice Level 3.  This was so good!  \"3\" was a good level for me as I do like spicy food, but not too much that I can't enjoy my food.   -  Boat Noodle Soup:  YOU MUST TRY THIS!  I ordered Spice Level 3.  This soup exploded with flavor.  It kind of reminded me of Bun Bo Hue (spicy pho), but with a lot more flavor to it. The beef shreds were so tender and juicy.  The beef balls were just as good!  I normally can't finish a soup bowl anywhere I go, but here I cleaned that sucker up!  Definitely give this a try!  I'm happy my fam found this place.  I can now add another food place to my list of Vegas eats!"}
{"text":"Thai St. Cafe was a hidden gem until we stumbled upon it at 2 A.M. Open late, this place will not disappoint- I really liked the yellow curry!   Reviews on here that are 1 or 2 star (and that are delivery related) shouldn't be directed to Thai St, as they're run through a 3rd party delivery service.   Cheap prices, great food, close to the strip. I'll be coming back before my trip is over"}
{"text":"Craving some Thai and was too lazy to drive, so Yelp and Postmates to the rescue. Got an order of tofu pad Thai at a level 2 spice, beef pad see eew and beef noodle soup. Everything came as ordered correctly. The pad Thai was delicious! I'm usually very cautious when ordering things at a certain spice level when I'm not familiar with the establishment and with this dish, I think the level 2 was perfect. The noodles were al dente and tofu was fried perfectly. The pad see eww had a mix of broccoli and Chinese broccoli. I'm a fan of the Chinese broccoli to add for authenticity and slightly bitter flavor. My sis enjoyed the variation of the veg. The dish, overall, was yum! The beef noodle soup was soo rich in flavor that I hate to complain about the portion size and beef. The beef meatballs were typical, but the sliced beef seemed overly dry... as if it were cooking for way too long? Regardless, I'd be back to order more food from here and probably stick to just a meatball beef noodle soup. They also included some dried chili flakes, which was much appreciated since I forgot to ask for some when placing my order."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem.  It is in a \"unique\" location.   I order the Pad Thai, Red Curry, Chicken Eggplant.  I had a 5 out 10 on the spice level, just know they are heavy handed cause it was SPICY.  I thought the food was great and worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Delivery 5 stars Price 5 stars Taste 1 star Accuracy of order 1 star  I was looking for a Thai food restaurant that delivered. I went with Thai St Cafe due to their reviews.  The delivery was quick. The prices are decent. I wish the food was as good.  I ordered: Red chicken curry with no sugar Basil beef with no sugar  Side of steamed vegetables   Both entries that were suppose to be sugar free had sugar. Warning: The Basil beef was a plate of ground beef with a few green beans. What a big disappointment."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE.   Initially I was going to give this place a four stars. The food was really good and the environment cool- but the service- TERRIBLE. First the waitress didn't bring us water or drinks or plates. The food comes out and we ask another waiter for drinks and everything. He comes and beings it over. Food comes out fast and good.   Our waitress didn't come to us at all until the bill comes. She brings me the bill with gratuity already added when there are only four of us. I told her and she said oh that was her mistake and that she'll adjust it. I could tell she tried to sneak it on there so when I left cash I intentionally left the tip off. I don't give money to scammers.   As we pack up and leaving she comes over to me and tells me that I didn't leave her a tip and \"why- was the service bad?\" I said honestly - yes and told her why. She didn't check on us once, didn't bring us our meals. Etc\" she snaps and says \" oh ok you should take your penny change- you keep it\" at that point- I was pissed and told her to keep it. As I'm walking out she says \" keep it. You can save it for your baby.\"    I have a seven month old son. If anyone reading this has kids- you could understand how insulting that is. People like that don't have any decency or respect even for themselves- that's why she's at where she's at in her career.   I told her she can keep the tip and left. I didn't want to turn the place into the last 48.   As we were packing the car- her friend/coworker comes out and says something to us. I confront her and she said she didn't say anything - wanting to be slick and avoid any trouble.   We left. I recommend any place but this one. It's the tallest manly looking waitress there. You'll know who she is when you see her.   Also triple check your bill."}
{"text":"I'm really conflicted because the food is delicious but the service is extremely lacking.  Placed an online order with 3 items, get there 15 minutes later to pick it up and the lady at the counter never bothered to check the printer.  She asked for my name and then realized that there was an order sitting in the printer.   I stood there with my worker waiting and we were not even acknowledged. I asked if it was ready and I just got a state.  I asked again if it was ready and she responded by saying, No\".  30 minutes later I'm still waiting and no order.   We inquired how long and the only response I received was \"waiting for pad Thai\".   There was no apology, no acknowledgement of the mistake, nothing offered while we waited, NOT EVEN WATER!  I would suggest you go to a great Thai place like Kung Fu where the service is impeccable and the food is DELICIOUS!  I will not be back to this place unfortunately and will share my unfortunate experience with my colleagues and friends."}
{"text":"Sorry for the the one star only but i can't give it no stars! 2 hours + additional 30 minutes for a simple order and the location of delivery in 2 miles? I don't care about how busy they are, they could just have give me a phone call and let me know it will take 1 or 2 or 3 hours and then i have the choice of keeping the order or not."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The Thai tea was phenomenal and the food was absolutely to die for!  My girlfriend and I have eaten at many Thai places and we thought we had our favorite, but this place absolutely outdid every other Thai place!   The food has an amazing flavor and very juicy meat! I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Thai food, or even if you have never wrote eating thai.   Definitely 10 stars!"}
{"text":"We wanted quick food during our lunch break, so we found this place -- 1.5 miles from the strip -- to fit this in an hour lunch. Parking was slightly difficult because half the spots were \"Reserved\" for specific people or stores or time slots.   We went into Thai St and first thing noticed was the cleanliness of the space. We were the only people who were there at the time, immediately placed our order, but it took about 20-30 minutes for the food to come out. An excessively long time for the food to come out...   We ordered a pad thai with shrimp: average thai. Good spice, good quantity. We also ordered the red curry -- great quantity and was on par with a decent thai restaurant. Lastly, we ordered a thai beef salad -- a little simple, only the beef and some lettuce leaves (probably wouldn't order this one again).   Only big qualm about this place is the slow pace of the restaurant. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Stop by here after Rock in Rio event on Saturday since m boyfriend and I were hungry. I was craving Thai food so I decided to go here. I thought maybe thai food in vegas is better than in LA. It wasn't too far from our hotel which was perfect plus they closed at 4 am.  We arrived at the restaurant, it was pretty hidden in a small plaza. As we went into the restaurant, it was empty with not even one customer inside. So we sat down. The server was really nice.   I order the usual thai dishes I would order in LA which are pad thai shrimp and tom kha soup. I also ordered Thai Tea. Our food took a little long to come out but it was fine. The thai tea was really good. I enjoyed it but when we got out food. The tom kha soup was way too sweet in my opinion. It just didn't taste like the tom kha soup that I usually eat. It taste like sweet soup. The pad thai noodles were thin noodles and also too sweet. Pretty disappointed. Maybe I came at the wrong time.   Though it's not the best thai restaurant I've been to but the atmosphere is nice and their thai tea is really good."}
{"text":"3.5*** Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. My boyfriend and I ordered the basil fried rice and the Tom yum hot pot. They were both good but the Tom yum was a bit too bitter. The hot pot came with squid, fish, shrimp, mussels, and some veggies. The Thai tea was pretty large and we were able to add boba. Service was a bit slow, forgot some of my things but they were very friendly. I'm not from Vegas and I have nowhere else to compare this place to, but overall it was just alright."}
{"text":"Got our order in less than 45mins. Been ordering here for the past two days. Delivery guy was really nice and food was the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Skip this place. We stopped here for lunch on our way to the Hoover Dam. It was about 12:30pm and there were only 2 other customers in the restaurant. There were two servers in the restaurant - one a skinny lady who was really sweet & the other a bitchy piece of work (whom I'll be referring to PoW henceforth).  So PoW took us 10 minutes to get water. Took our order. We got a red curry because its easy & quick and we were ready to go on with our day. Fast forward 30minutes, we are still waiting for our order. Meanwhile 3 other customers come in after us and get their orders. We ask how much time its going to be and PoW snaps \"we can't tell you how much\". eh, what?  We wait 15 more minutes (We are in the restaurant for an hour at this point). People who came after us have ate and left. We ask PoW again and get the same answer. We want to cancel the order. Sweet server walks in, apologizes and offers a free papaya salad while the order is cooking.  PoW goes behind her back to make papaya salad EXTREMELY spicy (I am Indian, I can take spice) & cancels our red curry order.  What the actual fuck? We leave after an hour, hangry and confused. Skip this place. There are better places to go to on and around the strip."}
{"text":"I got Pad Thai - Spice level 8. Big mistake!! I couldn't feel my tongue as it was insanely spicy. I think if it was maybe 6 or 7 - it would of been perfect.  Reason why I couldn't give a 5 star is due to delivery. my food was not hot and a bit juicy when arrived. It was not cold but barely warm and the food was all stuck together."}
{"text":"Food was delicious & not overpriced! Restaurant is in a weird location surrounded by adult stores but the restaurant itself is nice and clean. We went with 3 adults and 2 kids & paid $93... definitely will return on our next Vegas trip. Also FYI you pay 50 cent extra for no ice and if your sharing a drink there is no free refills."}
{"text":"1st timer late night good eats!! Crying tiger wrap, papaya salad, and thai fried rice OMG so yummy quick delivery and good customer service i MUST try!!"}
{"text":"By far in my life, the best drunken noodle can decide on beef, pork, sea food for additional bucks.i like the sea food the most. Price is more than reasonable considering its vegas. Service is nice. Why go expensive thai place in the strip? I like everything here!! Will definitely come back again for my next trip."}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly staff.  If your into Boat Beef noodles.... Very flavorful. On four day trip here in Vegas this place is my favorite of three. Lotus is too pricey (fancy because of their wine cellar) and food was good but the service sucked. Lucki Thai, it was good. But Thai street Cafe, food is pretty good and fair prices."}
{"text":"Awesome thai at reasonable prices. Spice level is true to a t  Best drunken noodles in town"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but they dont deliver on time. Be aware the delivery will be delayed. So keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This place is super cute inside - just get past the fact that it's on industrial road next to the strip clubs. Or enjoy that and the fact it's open until 4 AM. Welcome to Vegas!!  I've had the vegetarian eggplant dish, vegetable egg rolls, pad see ewe and pad Thai here. Everything was good - while the eggplant dish was great. Every time I've gotten the eggrolls they've been just slightly undercooked. Good, but they could use another minute in the fryer.   Overall still one of the better Thai spots in vegas."}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend because of all the Yelp reviews. Definitely a pretty good Thai spot, but there are a lot of others out places in Vegas that I feel are superior.  First let's talk location. This place is in a funky building with the Can Can room next to it and Sapphire strip club down the way....  Inside is actually very well done. Nicely decorated.  Service was good and fast.  We ordered everything:  Hoi Jor - Really good! Huge portions  Crispy Rolls - Ok - but huge portions  Thai Dumpling - Very Good! Huge portion  Chicken Panang Curry - Good flavor. Very thin in consistency. I like when they are thicker  Chicken Green Curry - Good flavor. Still too watery   Chicken Pad Thai - not very good....no flavor  Chicken Pad See Ewe - Good, good flavor  Chicken Drunken Noodles - Ok-noodles we over cooked. Not much in flavor  Kao Soy - Good flavor! If I wasn't so full - this could have been a winner. Still very watery.  Orange Chicken - Meh. Sauce was good but the chicken was overly breaded.   Beef wrap - good. Different  Spicy Catfish - Pretty Good.  Pineapple Fried Rice - Bomb  Sticky rice - good   Good spot overall. But there are plenty of places out in vegas that I feel are superior."}
{"text":"Basil fried rice tasted really good. The thai ice tea was nice. The highlight was ro ti. Its basically like flour tortilla with a sweet syrup. It was just amazing"}
{"text":"Just finished the most delicious lunch this afternoon! Every single dish we ordered was flavorful and had an authentic taste which we wanted because we are Thai :)   Highly recommend dishes: 1)woon-sen pad Thai w tofu 2) crab fried rice  3)yen ta fo noodles is a \"must\" if you love soup noodles  The service was excellent. The atmosphere is clean, simple modern decor!"}
{"text":"Best thai within a mile of the strip. I've returned 7 times now... always fresh and cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"Newly opened Thai food place...this is kinda refreshing... I like this place... Food is great and the prices are reasonable... Had the Thai beef salad and papaya salad with pad see ew and chicken satay... Really good"}
{"text":"Me and my bro were looking something to eat and find this thai restaurant in yelp, so we went and try it. The food is really good, I end up try the drunken noodle and my bro order the noodle stew and fried calamary. They also have the fresh coconut drink, excellent. We will come back again. :)"}
{"text":"The portion are good sizes . Very fare prices. The workers are really nice. Over-all  we came back so that's  it."}
{"text":"Good and fresh food. They have different varieties of food and drink with high quality. Service is nice and fast. It is not too expensive for what they serve. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"They have fantastic food my favorite is their Panang curry and it's amazing! I got it delivered a couple times and they were surprisingly fast in making the food and delivery. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants Thai food. Their crab fired rice is awesome as well but I'm sure anything on the menu is great as well!"}
{"text":"Had them deliver the most delicious Thai food I've ever had to the Aria Hotel. Their service, phone customer service, quality of food was superb. It is a change from eating a buffets and other stuff in Vegas. Good healthy Thai food that is made with fresh ingredients as you can tell from the first bite to the last. Every time we come to Vegas we order from this place. They are by far one of the best Thai food we've had in a long time. Even the driver that dropped off the food was spectacular and super polite. Thanks again Thai St., Café for everything you do. See you next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. After a long trip from Houston Texas, we decided to stop by for dinner. Friendly service and great food, I can't ask for anything more. I ordered the tum yum noodles soup, love it. My wife and sons ordered the crab and pineapple fried rice dishes, amazing!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! It's a short walk from the strip - took me about 15 minutes from the Wynn, but the food was tasty and very affordable! The lunch specials are $7.95 with good portions and lots of food!   A spice level 5 on the spicy basil left some lingering heat, but was about what I expected.   Clean, cute interior, and very friendly service!"}
{"text":"So so so affordable. And tasty! Probably my favorite meal we've had in Vegas. I guess I'm not about glamour but about good old fashioned cooking.   I have no idea what their restaurant looks like because we ordered delivery via yelp's Eat24 service. Only $3 for delivery! And who wants to walk outside during 107 degree weather? Not me!  Their pad see ew noodles were excellent. Papaya salad could've been crispier/cooler but it could've warmed up from the sweltering heat. Who can blame that poor little papaya salad then? Not me. I wilted from just sticking my head out of the hotel doors.   Pad Thai a little too sweet for me, but still good.   And did I say this place was affordable? Fed 4 adults and 2 kids for $58 after tax, tip, and delivery. And we had leftovers. Unheard of in these parts. Thanks cafe Thai for keeping it sane here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Another surprise in a random place... Near a strip club, adult stores and nail salons. The location itself is relatively compact, especially in comparison to a standard restaurant, but make no mistake - this is restaurant quality food. The menu is concise yet carries enough variety to give the quintessential consumer enough to chew on (literally). The pictures are deceiving; don't be fooled, although the menu items seem rationed to small portions, the dishes are surprisingly plentiful. My boyfriend and I ordered the DRUNKEN NOODLES and the BASIL CHICKEN. Both were GREAT. I've only had Thai food twice prior to this and can say this was by far the best quality yet.   Summary: Considering we walked in with raging appetites and parted from the restaurant with leftovers, I would say that the food was more than satisfying in terms of portion and taste. Overall a great experience. Oh, by the way, they deliver for only about $3 to your hotel ($20 minimum)."}
{"text":"I have tried this place 2x, I am fan of boba :) and I must say their thai tea is good. Hopefully they will have more variety of boba in the future...  I always get the Chicken Yellow Curry and so far so good.. Will try more next time.."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Like everyone says dont be discouraged by its location, this place has great food, great service and the price is very reasonable, this is our new thai place in vegas!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Google Search when looking for some good cheap food. The reviews here did not lead us astray! It was delicious and reasonably priced! When I'm back in vegas I would totally come back ehre."}
{"text":"First visit here because I was craving Tom Kha soup. Presentation of food is great. Bf had the panang curry and it was yummy"}
{"text":"I order using the app that Yelp has. The order came with a $52 and I thought was a fair price. The app allows you to get notification when your orders is out for delivery.  I got that notification over an hour and 45 minutes ago. I'll call the restaurant 3 times only on the third call did they tell me the driver couldn't find hotel. The lady who answer the phone recommended cancelling the order. Now I'm ordering Dominos."}
{"text":"This place had the worse service, they had a sign in font of the door that said no dine in takeout only. Some ass hole that was rude booked the restaurant for his family. We ordered our food and the girl said it will take 30 min.. I went back in and the guy yelled at us saying no take out I told him I ordered already. The girl told me to wait another 30 to 40 min.. unbelievable I have never experienced this bad service in my life hands down this place socks I hope they go out of business I'm glad I live in Los Angeles and there's better Thai food over here anyways. I wish insteegram of stars I can give them all middle finger. Please don't come here I also saw rats"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, bright and clean space inside a dingy strip plaza. The menu is fairly short for a Thai restaurant. Nice dumplings and basil rice. It's good to have the 1-through-10 option of increasing the heat of the food, though I'm not clear on whether that reflects the spiciness before or after I dumped the little plastic container of chili sauce into my rice. I'd asked for a 6 and found that extra heat was needed.  This is a very good meal option relatively close to the Strip. I walked over from the Palazzo and, while it's not very pleasant, it didn't seem unsafe - there are sidewalks and signalized crosswalks along Sammy Davis."}
{"text":"LOVE ITTTT! Vibes are on point. Service is on point. And most importantly, pad Thai is on point and affordable. Good portion size and good spice level according to what you give them!  Looooooooove.  Also, they have wifi, so that's an added bonus"}
{"text":"Pros: Nice decor and spacious. Good service. Cons: food quality is questionable. Poor tasting food. Location is horrible.   We purchased the orange chicken with steam rice and it was horrible. The rice was not cooked all the way through. The orange chicken tasted like it was old sauce and it was an orange chicken taste. It taste more like lime sauce. Also for the pineapple fried rice with shrimp. The shrimp was cooked very well and tasted great. The fried rice was pretty good. I asked for no raisins and it came with raisins so the waitress quickly took it away but they did not recook my order, they just took out the raisins. I know this because I notice two of the shrimps looked the same - cut shrimp and the rest were whole. That was disappointing.  I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really cute Thai food place off the strip! It's right between two strip clubs (HAHA, kind of uncomfortable going there with my dad..), but the food was pretty good. The ambience of the place is really nice and classy, which was super ironic, but the servers were really nice and friendly! It was a bit on the pricier side though, which was why I only gave it four stars. It was really good, but the price/deliciousness ratio was a little off, you feel? Overall though, I really enjoyed going there. Will definitely go again!   TIP: The noodle portions were significantly smaller than the rice portions, so if you're extra hungry, maybe you should get fried rice?"}
{"text":"Wow, just a little \"hole in the wall\" from the outside, but inside the ambience is warm and welcoming. My boyfriend and I ordered Tom Kha soup and red curry, both of which were bold with flavor - outstanding! Excellent service, too. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"What a keeper.   The hours are just amazing. The food was really good, too, and we eat a metric ton of Thai food. Prices & portions were on point.  They were super accommodating to us vegans & really helpful making my order. Most dishes can be made without fish/oyster sauce, egg, and subbing tofu for meat.  We got Pad see ew & Basil fried rice, both were yummy af.  So glad we found this late-night option. Can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"My daughter and my wife are huge Thai food fan. We came here today for lunch. Pulling to the parking lot of a small strip mall dos not give me much confidence. However, as soon as I entered the spot, everything changed- very cool and trendy restaurant. I am not going to describe the food; my wife and daughter believe this place is the best. Kao Soy is amazing- this is the first time I had it."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, really a hidden gem! Our server, Bobby, greeted us at the door with a smile. As he showed us to our booth, he recommended the Thai coffee and the Thai tea which were both wonderful sweet treats. For our appetizer, we ordered the chicken wings. These chicken wings were nice and crisp, really cooked perfectly, with a side of sweet chili sauce. I ordered the pad Thai spicy with chicken and my bf ordered the yellow curry with chicken. These dishes were excellent and cooked to perfection. So spicy! Just the way we like"}
{"text":"Great Thai food- best and cheapest meal we had in Vegas, $50 to feed a family of 4, and we couldn't finish it. Food was so good and fast- excellent service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There is a range of how Americanized Thai food can be, and Thai Street Cafe ranges a little more on the \"Americanized\" side than a lot of Thai restaurants in Vegas.  They do it fairly well, but for me this place just doesn't have very exciting food.    I ordered the green curry, something I tend to do on possible falsely rated restaurants on Yelp.  It came in a very strange sort of serving tray, split into fours and accompanied by a salad, white rice, and a veggie egg roll.  I had no place to pour my curry on the rice, so the serving style is definitely catered for Americans, which is fine.  I have to say though that the egg roll was my favorite part.  Not because it was particularly well done, but because they use honey in their sweet and sour sauce.  Yummy!  The curry, however, was a bit of a let down.  I ordered beef.  The beef was the typical strips, not particularly outstanding, but not tough and overcooked either.  The curry tasted like they add a lot of milk based cream.  I couldn't really taste any coconut.  It had the consistency of Alfredo sauce, which makes me believe cream was used (authentic Bangkok style Thai curry is soupy).  There's nothing really wrong with that; coconut milk is expensive.  But I want my curry to taste like Thai coconut curry, not weird Alfredo sauce.  The zucchini that they used gave it a nice touch, along with the traditional green and red bell peppers.  Overall though, the curry was a little too sweet and generic tasting, and very heavy.  I ordered a 7/10 heat, and it tasted more like a 2/10.  Yes, the heat levels are Americanized too.    Very nice service, and very nice atmosphere (minus the strip club parking).  The food, however, isn't worth traveling to for me.  It's definitely Americanized, and while not offensive in any way, just not very exciting."}
{"text":"Awesome decor!  Yummy food!!!  They changed their time to close at 11:30pm. Really liked that they used to stay open until 4am.  Pad Thai is good.  Could use a little more flavor.  The fried rice chicken or shrimp is really good!  The yellow curry is delicious!  Can sometimes be a little bit on the spicy side.  The heat changes every time I get it.. Tried their Thai tea for the first time tonight and I've had better.  The sauce that comes with the egg rolls and crab Rangoon is soooooo good!  Wish I had the recipe!"}
{"text":"This was surprising delicious! Found it through yelp,...a little after midnight, wanted Thai from a smaller shop, not inside one of the casinos. Very cool interior space, situated in a scuzzy strip mall with strip bar next door.  A very Vegas experience.   Food was delicious, and the wait staff was great."}
{"text":"Its my second time here this week. The noodle dishes are great but you can get anything as long as you also get the beef jerky."}
{"text":"It gave me life two years and it didn't disappoint me or my friends last night. Even though they forgot my friend's brown rice, she thoroughly enjoyed her yellow curry!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering delivery from here late night at work.  Although Yelp states they don't deliver to our area (Desert Springs Hospital) I called anyways and they were willing to deliver.    The food we've tried has all been consistently good and tasty.    Pad see ewe w/ Chicken.  Flat noodles with meat and broccoli.  Delicious.  Drunken Noodles w/ combination meat ($3 more) -  Nice sized shrimp, beef, and chicken.  Thick flat noodles with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions.  Very Good.  Red curry (first time with chicken, second time with shrimp -$2 more)  Shrimp is large.  The curry is very, very good and comes with a side of rice.  Spiciness level can be customized from 1-10.   Not much a difference from a 2 to 4 in my opinion.   4 could be considered hot to people who dislike spicy foods.  Chow mein w/ Beef-  Seemed to be a favorite from my co-workers.    Thai Iced Tea-  WORTH $3.95.   So large.  So refreshing.  So tasty.    Also, ask for a free small thai iced tea with Yelp check in.  Papaya Salad-  Good portions, does not come with any meat.  Had it spicy level 6 and had a very nice kick to it.     Chicken Satay- 4 sticks and comes with peanut sauce.  Pretty good.  Delivery service was fast.  Ordering might be the hardest part.  The first night an older Asian man answered the phone and his accent was very hard to understand when ordering by phone.  The lady that answered the next day for more delivery spoke much better English.  The entrees all are around $8.95 for a decent portion and they are open til 4 A.M.!   Perfect for us night shift people who get super hungry in the middle of the night.  Will be ordering from them again, I'm sure of it."}
{"text":"This place is sooo cute , it was me and my friends first time eating here and it was so good . It's right by my house so I'll definitely start going here more often !"}
{"text":"They delivered to our hotel. The Thai tea was perfect!! I had the Crying Tiger wrap and it was spicy and delicious. I loved it. Very filling. I could not finish it."}
{"text":"Great off the strip Thai restaurant. This place is located in a strip mall with a bunch of seedy shops but don't let that dissuade you from trying out the food! Came on a Sun for lunch and it was empty.   For food we ordered the spring rolls, Kao soi and cashew nut chicken. The spring rolls were standard so worth getting if you like that.   Cashew nut chicken came out first. My bf always gets that so I've smoked a fair amount and this was up there.   Kao soi was a big bowl of yellow curry, a heaping amount of chicken and bean sprouts. The broth was really rich in flavor. Highly recommend this dish!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery again and for some reason, the food was NOT the same. Hit or miss for sure but when it was a hit, it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Don't let the area disuade you from trying this hidden gem.  We were reluctant to eat here when we pulled into the parking lot, but so glad we stayed.  Flavorful food with nice presentation.  Clean and friendly atmosphere.  Recommend for casual meals."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I have ever had! We had Poh tak soup and sticky rice Mango also and everything was amazing. Would definitely recommend! They had A Grade..but I never care because food make me feel better...must try.."}
{"text":"Food is great but customer service is horrible. Waited 20 minutes for some damn water. And when we ask for water the worker just says she's getting it for us but she's just talking on her phone in front of us...how rude..also the servers don't even provide us with silverware. We have to ask when we already have our food on the table. We don't even get napkins either."}
{"text":"We ate here 2 times during our stay and would highly recommend this place. Service was 5 star and food was always delicious."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Vegas. Everyone who works there is so nice and the food was very flavorful. Ordered a pad see ew and i highly recommend. Great place"}
{"text":"I love little hole in the wall restaurants and I will add this one to my list. The food was very authentic tasting..not like those greasy fast food places. I had the drunken noodles and they were amazing. I wish I could have tried everything on the menu because it all looked so good!"}
{"text":"I've had quite a bit of thai food in this city. Also had a Thai roommate that cooked often.  This is the best I have had yet!  Wonderful flavor the heat index scale is accurate, and good prices! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Oh dannnggg okok thai st cafe i see you. First off as a thai american :) I totally approve this restaurant. Price is cheap :) portion is great. Not to mention they also add rice rice!!!! For free not many thai restaurants do that . Food is yummy, taste like home.The appetizer currie puff very legit ... taste like home again ..please try this place and the open late !!!"}
{"text":"Drunken noodle can chicken curry is magical. Delicious, generous portion. Definitely get your money worth here. I got level 6 spice and it's perfect for me. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice, and had delivery once. Great food and good service. Large Pad Thai servings with generous meat portions. Their \"Rips\" fried ribs appetizers are good. But, watch out for slivers of bones! We look forward to our next visit. Delicious dishes! Atmosphere is a little plain, but clean. Fast delivery, too. You'll be glad you ate here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Egg rolls are delicious...and I'm picky bout my egg rolls. Great atmosphere, as well"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Thai food, you have to try this place.  Pad thai - amazing  Any curry - amazing  Drunken noodles - straight money"}
{"text":"Pad see ew was pretty good, pad Tai was pretty disappointing though. There were 11 of us and we dat pretty quickly even though it was packed."}
{"text":"Good thai food. Go easy on the spice. 8 was really hot. We tried basil fried rice, thai green curry, pad Thai. Liked all of them."}
{"text":"Food gets 5 stars.  Standard Thai food done really well.  Service (with only one other table when we arrived) was slow.  We had Tom Yum chicken, beef salad, and pork with oyster sauce.  My husband said he was full then had 2 more helpings.  No to-go this time!"}
{"text":"One of the better Thai restaurants in Vegas. The quality and quantity of the food for the price makes this Thai restaurant a winner. I had the crab fried rice ($13.95) and Panang curry with beef ($9.95). Both dishes were seasoned perfectly. It's only about a half mile west of the Wynn, it's not the best part of town, but it's clean inside and it's open 'til 4:00 am. Check it out...I think that you will be happy that you gave this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times and it's always really good. The servers are friendly and the wait times are reasonable. This time I got takeout. The Thai dumplings and the spicy basil entrée were both great, especially the dumplings. I really like Thai St and I'll keep going back.  Damn!  Went there yesterday and it took me no time to get my food!! This place rocks!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy this is what is great about this place you choose from 1-10, this is a great option.  We chose 5 and 6 this is a great level to enjoy the food. The waitress was very accommodating at all times. It was 6 of us and we spent $80 including tip!!!  Not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"It was EXTRA good but the noodles were just a bit spicy. I would order again when i come back to Vegas. Oh did i mention they delivered!!!! Sooo amazing!!! I would come again and again!!!!"}
{"text":"Thai St. Cafe is yet another very solid Thai spot just off the strip near Industrial and Desert Inn. You will actually find it very near the Can Can Room on the west side of Industrial Road.   Items Ordered:  - Pot Stickers ($6.95) - Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken ($8.95) - Boat Noodles ($10.95) - Pork Laab ($8.95)  Pot Stickers (4/5) (6 Pieces per order) Tasty dumplings served with a sweet soy sauce. Plenty of meat and tasted great bathed in the sauce!  Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken (5/5) Tasted very authentic and plentiful in portion size! (I was actually telling my friend that the way they cook their chicken and their rice greatly reminded me of this little hole in the wall place we went to a few times, just a block away from the Grand Palace. Ahhh, I miss that place!) The fried rice included ingredients you don't necessarily find in some more Americanized Thai spots like raisins and cashews. I look forward to other variations of this dish in the future. Maybe some duck fried rice will be next!  Boat Noodles (3/5) I've never had boat noodles before so I honestly don't have anything to compare it to. The broth was a bit sweeter than I probably would have preferred, but was still quite delicious! Again, no complaints about portion sizes here! They serve you the boat noodles in a big ole' bowl! Very filling!  Pork Larb (4/5) For starters, they give you almost 3 times as much larb as what I received at Lotus of Siam a few weeks ago. The spice level was on point and made it much more satisfying this time around! Definitely having this again!  (+) No MSG!  (+) Enjoyed the decor and got a good chuckle out of those bathrooms signs! Reminded me of the ones I would see at some of the nightclubs/bars in Bangkok (-) Service was spotty. The staff was nice, but we had to hunt the waitress down to get refills for our drinks and to get our bill. There was only 1 other occupied table besides ours, so I didn't quite understand why that was the case. It wasn't terrible though and it certainly won't deter me from coming back. (-) not much available in the way of parking. Luckily we went during a slow time.  I really enjoyed my meal here today and I think I could even say it is in my \"top 3\" Thai places here in Las Vegas for the time being! I will certainly be back to try some more menu items!  Yay! I'm a fan!  4 stars."}
{"text":"Had the spicy ground pork basil (2-level spice), hot wings, and house-made coconut ice cream. I absolutely love the food here, but the service and ventilation leaves a bit to be desired. If those 2 items could be improved on, this place would easily be a 5-star joint.  Between irritated servers and unintentionally smoky atmosphere, I can still manage to put this at a 4."}
{"text":"I ordered food from ubereats and this place was very good the Tom Kha was awesome and the chicken laab was good I would definitely do this place again if I ever were in town!"}
{"text":"great CURYS AND LEMONADE. service was excellent. definitely coming back before 4 a.m lol"}
{"text":"BEST's Thai delivery that is open until 4am. Having a late night craving for Thai food and don't want to leave your hotel room. Look no further. I was a bit hesitant at first. But took my chances and I scored. The portion here are pretty generous.   - Curry puffs is a must! Worth trying. They sometimes run out. So get it if they have it.  - Pad se Ew I usually get beef or chicken.  - Crab fried rice had SO many crab lumps.  - Green curry was on point."}
{"text":"Driving upon here, you might double check if the address is correct. Yes it is and it's right next to the strip club! ;)  Food here is great, service started pretty badly off but the girl server saved the rest of our meals service. We had to keep reminding the guy what we had ordered, and what did not come out yet. This place can get pretty busy and they seemed understaffed. As for food, tasty, inexpensive and spicy!!! They let you order your dish's spice level 0-10. I can eat spicy but a 1 spice level had a big kick.  We ordered -Hoi Jar (not bad, sweet sauce was good) -Crab Rangoon (rarely any crab meat) -Tom Yum Soup with chicken (Chicken was really dry, soup had excellent flavor) -Pad Thai (tasty and savory) -Pineapple Fried Rice (not the best one I've had) -Drunken Noodle (has a nice kick and depth, but was ok) -Yellow Curry (not too bad, a little bland) -Mango Sticky Rice (was really good for the price) -Thai Tea were huge! You can add tapioca too.  All the entree was mostly priced under $9-10! Which I thought was a great deal for the portion and quality!"}
{"text":"Ein super Laden! Leckeres Essen, sauber, guter Service und von den Preisen her für Las Vegas ein Traum! Der Weg dorthin nimmt zwar 10 Minuten vom Strip in Anspruch ist es aber wert. Ich hatte eine Nudelsuppe und meine Freundin ein Curry - beides war schmackhaft. Würden beim nächsten Vegas-Besuch wieder hin."}
{"text":"Went there two nights ago to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Ordered a LOT of food.  Ate, shared laughs, enjoyed the ambiance, all with a delightful server! I can't remember her name, but promised I'd write a review.  Great food, great service, good atmosphere, open late, good prices! Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Although this place isn't located in the best spot. My boyfriend and I eat here often. The staff is great and The food is always so good. We've actually been there 3 times this week! Lol"}
{"text":"- recc: papaya salad, green curry - Thai iced tea is a bit too sweet for me - delivery on a weekday is about 30-45min (online delivery estimated 90 min)"}
{"text":"Delicious food- pineapple fried rice is my favorite! Glad that this little treasure is around! Definitely a must if you like Thai food! Not only great food, but clean! Good vibes all around! Will definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Tried to order for delivery twice from our hotel treasure island; there something wrong with there phone kept cutting in and out. They wouldn't take my order because I couldn't give them my cell number (I'm from Canada). They wouldn't accept the hotel number plus my room number either. I tried to order on the Yelp delivery but that wouldn't work either!  they really need to get there delivery system fixed and there phone.  We ended taking taxi here which sucked. Only came because my boyfriend really wanted too!   The restaurant was in a shady area but inside it was clean and open. Our server was polite and friendly. Food came out quick and the portions were big. We had the  hoi  jot (3/5 crispy but not much flavour just meat) , curry puff (2.5/5 crispy but the outside she'll was too thick and hard), spicy basil 7 spice (4/5), panang curry (4/5 the broth was nice and creamy lots of chicken and mixed veggies) and the Thai tea (5/5 rich and creamy perfect amount of sweet)   Overall the food and restaurant service was good but the delivery system sucks!!! I would have given 4/5 if I had it delivered."}
{"text":"Pro: nice and spacious restaurant, friendly service, clean bathroom, right next to fashion show mall  Con: weird location (I don't think I will go there at night), ac wasn't working right so the room filled with fried oil smell, the food is so so ( I was disappointed since the rating was so high!) We order medium spicy on pad Thai, spicy basil meat and pad nang curry, and only the spicy basil I would call mild spicy and tasted good. The pad Thai is so sweet, the pan nang curry is so sweet too... We ordered fried tofu but it came with regular tofu. For the appetizer, it was the first on the menu, fried wenton with shrimp and pork inside. Fishy but crisp. The serving size is not big. So I think it's a bit at the higher end on the price."}
{"text":"Sol is very friendly. She gave excellent suggestions as to what kind of meet goes with a specific thai dish. The place is very clean, pleasant to look at. The menu attractive. We will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a stop in Vegas that my husband and I thoroughly enjoy... usually. Last night, 8/22/17, unfortunately we were disappointed. 1.  Don't get egg rolls to go (I should have know this... by no fault of the restaurant) but they soggy by the time you get home. 2. we ordered chicken and shrimp in the pad Thai and also spicy basil. $4 each dish and got 3 shrimp each. .... seems a bit steep. 3.  The spicy basil was ladened with oil. 4.  We got a 1/2 carton rice.  One not so good time out of 15 will not stop us from going back... I'm hoping we had the B team in the kitchen last night and it goes back to our regularly schedule meal."}
{"text":"Thanks \"Yelp\" for pointing me into the direction of \"Thai St Cafe.\" I think I'm a pretty good judge of Thai food. It's one of my favorite cuisines and I've eaten Thai food all over the world (unfortunately except Thailand). Up until eating here, my favorite Thai food was served at this tiny little Thai Cafe at the bottom of my street in London, run by an immigrant Thai family serving truly authentic thai food. Thai St Cafe is as good, if not better. The food is stunning. The portions are plentiful. The staff are lovely and friendly. The hours are 11am to 4am!! They serve Curry Puffs!! NOBODY SERVES CURRY PUFFS!! These things are delicious!! Anyway, I digress. \"Well, if it's so good, then why only 4 stars,\" you might ask. Well, the service is pedestrian to say the least. If you're in a hurry, do not go. Actually, the food is so good, you should wait! That is my only negative thing though. Slow service. But everything else is top, TOP notch!! My fave Thai ever!!"}
{"text":"This place is really great! The decor is nice, modern, and clean. Very accommodating for large groups (6-8 ppl).  Pad Thai (seafood combo) *spicy (5/5) was very delicious! The spice was a perfect blend to the sweet pad Thai sauce. The seafood was cooked to perfection, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. This goes for the chicken pad Thai too. It was amazing. One of the best I've had.  Pork spare ribs: 3/5 it's not what the picture looks like. I thought it was going to be whole ribs but it's ribs cut into bite sized. It was a bit salty. Not what I expected but flavor is good, just salty and a bit over powering   Beef egg plant: it was good. I'd give it a 4/5.   Pad see ew: good too, 3.5/5   Thai teas are huge so I'd recommend splitting it lol. And this was really good too, doesn't taste watered down or overly sweet. Perfect.    Note: they had us move to another table after we ordered Bc they got a call in for a bigger party and we (party of 6) were sitting at the table for 10+ so they had us move to another table. As an apology they gave us a young coconut drink which was nice. I don't care too much for the freebie but I really appreciate these types of gesture."}
{"text":"Well... We came in here one night after ordering on line. We were on our way home from studying and decided a Panang curry, basil fried rice, and a papaya salad sounded like a good idea.  The area is well lit... And located amongst adult stores and down the street from a few strip clubs. The decor is cute... And the restaurant is a decent size. It appeared that there were more people waiting for take out than dining it... But it was also almost 1am so it made sense.   Being a vegan, there were some modifications to our order... Like no egg/butter in the fried rice, no shrimp Flakes in the papaya salad, and No shrimp paste in the curry. We were informed when we arrived that they saw the modifications and they didn't use shrimp paste in the curries... Yes! We sat down and waited... And waited... And waited... We went back up to the counter around 1:30 and asked for an estimate time... We were told \"soon\". Not wanting to piss anyone off and have something happen to our food... We opted to not mention the long wait time and sit back down. 18 min later... We walked back up to the counter... We placed our order online before we even got to the restaurant. From the time of arrival, we were had already been waiting 50 min.  I was basically ready to just ask for our money back and go to vickies diner. 2 min later our food appeared in the window... And she gave my friend a Thai tea for waiting...   We checked the order before leaving and noticed the fried rice had egg...  Not wanting to wait another hour for them to fix it... We left. The food is good. The service is horrible... And the wait time is awful. Would I go back? If I was desperate for Thai food and nothing else was open... Yes. Would I go out of my way to come here? Definitely not."}
{"text":"Came in here for the first time yesterday (11/03) around 11:00 pm. The location is kinda weird but the atmosphere at the restaurant itself is very clean and laid-back. It wasnt that busy but its steady.   The food was great!!! The soup was presented well and very tasty. Crab fried rice is a must and good for 2-3 people. Mango sticky rice was served warm and it was delicious!!!    I gave this place 5 star instead of 4 because of the service. Everyone was very attentive and have a lil humor in them. Our main server was wearing glasses and he is the best server ever!!! Funny and fast service!!!    Definitely will come back here!!!"}
{"text":"I had the drunken noodles with shrimp, level 6 spicy. 6 is spicy, don't underestimate the heat here. My friend had the yellow curry with beef, also level 6 spicy. The place is fire, highly recommend! ;) I almost forgot to mention the crab rangoons and those are not to go unmentioned. The sauce that comes with the rangoons is very good!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai and wanted pork through uber eats. When I received the order it was tofu and it said pork on the receipt. Lastly I said no spice and it was super spicy. The cucumber salad was good except they should have put it in a different bag because it got warm by the time it arrived being in the same bag as the hot food."}
{"text":"Why am I always parked outside of strip clubs and liquor stores? I never go to those places. I'm likely just eating at a nearby hole in the wall location like Thai St Cafe!   This is a nice little Thai spot and I'll be back for sure.  Location is on Industrial Rd, close to Fashion Show Rd. It's beside the liquor store and strip club but it's well lit with lots of traffic so I felt safe.   Real nice inside though, clean tables and quality dishes. Fun decor, laid back jazz music, and good smells made it pleasant inside.   I was quickly greeted, seated, and served a drink. I wasn't ready to order when he came back with my large excellent tasting ice tea. The gentleman was quick to come back and take my order.    Service could of been better though because he didn't come back to check in. I was the only one in the place at 1am but the employees with heeps of plates of food got more attention than me. I get micro portions compared to their plates!  I ate every bite of my meal and no one checked in on me but instead brought me a check. Lol really.  I only got an app so might of ordered more food or dessert, I should of been offered or asked if all was well before bringing my check.  Check your bill before paying! I asked for an ice tea to go since mine didn't get a refill towards the end and was empty on my table. Without saying anything he tried charging me $2 or more for the to-go cup of tea. Doh. Did take it off after I pointed out my displeasure and empty tea at the end. Do they normally charge for the to-go Styrofoam dishes for food, or just tea?  I rate them 4-5 stars for now and look forward to trying them again soon.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best value. Great taste and enough portion(not like small one of hotel restaurants). Interior was clean and neat unlike unconvincing exterior. Dessert Ro Ti was surprisingly good. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Utilized delivery feature. The food arrived in 40 min and was warm. Ordered a soup (coconut base, vegetarian) and it tasted pretty good. The pineapple fried rice didnt look good not did it taste good. The food was very average. They gave a free Thai ice tea which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Came with a coworker that was raving about the place, so I don't doubt that at least some people think it's good. Decor was very nice and cozy, especially given the area. Waitresses were all nice as well. I ordered the chicken larb and my coworkers had the regular sized yellow curry, lunch special curry, and Panang curry. The lunch portion was slightly smaller portions than other places in town. In all three curry dishes, there was a lot of curry and not very much rice provided. One coworker tried to order a spicy level of 10 and was talked down to an 8 but found that not to be spicy enough. As for my chicken larb it was probably the most bland larb I've ever had. I had to douse it with chili paste and jalapeños just to taste something. Service was also slow even though I know it was lunch time and we didn't order lunch specials. For some reason I was really put off by the cafeteria style plates that were pictured on the menu for the lunch specials. Overall not terrible, but I've found many other better hole in the wall Thai places in Vegas, especially with Chinatown so close by"}
{"text":"After a weeklong road trip we just got to our last stop before home and we're so tired so we ordered delivery from here. It came faster than projected and it's all good - yellow curry, pineapple fried rice, lemonade. I also appreciate that everything was packed with care. Very efficient and friendly delivery people.  Update: found a hair in the rice or curry :/"}
{"text":"Good authentic Thai food at a very good price. Place is clean, service good and fast. The outside of the restaurant could look better but the inside is very nice."}
{"text":"Fast and quick service . Greets all customers on arrival . Very clean & nice on the inside . My was pad Thai & Thai  fried rice .  The orange chicken has a strong orange tang taste if you love the natural orange taste it's a must you try it. Also the spare ribs has so so so much flavor .  Prices range from 8-12$ for those items ."}
{"text":"Great food and cheap prices. Right off the strip and next to a few strip clubs/massage places but don't let this scare you away. This place is nice. Pineapple rice and red curry with two Thai teas, was only $25! Much better than the chain places around here or grabbing fast food. I would easily pay double for this food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's so good!!! The thai food are well balance with spice and aroma. The servants are also very considerate on the spiciness. At this place is where real spiciness happens. LEVEL 10 ALL THE WAY!"}
{"text":"Really good food at a great price. And the service was excellent. Definitely recommend it if you are looking for good Thai food."}
{"text":"Awesome thai food. It's a very clean place.  portions are decent. A good cheap escape from the Strip that doesn't hurt your pocket but keeps the good taste !"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time Sunday evening. Very nice interior. Clean and modern. Ordered curry puffs and crispy rolls. Excellent beyond belief. Fresh out of the fryer, almost too hot to eat. Sauce was sublime! Then had pad see ew and Penang curry. Pad See Ew was delicious but Penang curry was better than Lotus of Siam. Dinner came to $34 before tip. Do yourself a favor and try some fantastic Thai food. No msg."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in town. The restaurant itself is very simple, simple is always great. Food: amaziiiinggg! Best Thai Tea with or without tapioca. I always get the Pad See Ew w/chicken, spice level 2 (somedays their spice can slip a little & be a little too spicy than what you asked for, but like spiciness is always great so who cares!!) Oh & make sure to try their Crab Rangoons that comes with a side of plum sauce, delicious. Their service sometimes can be very very, I mean like veryyyy slow (that they'll send drinks after waiting for like 10-15min & send over an order & 10-20min send out the rest), so if you're not a patient human being, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located  1 major street behind strip.  So if you are craving for good thai food you should try this place. Prices are reasonable. Had the pad see u and green curry, both of them are yummy. The server is very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Great little Thai place off the strip! Right behind the Fashion Show Mall. We ordered the pad Thai with beef and cashew nut chicken. The beef could have been a little better but everything else was fantastic."}
{"text":"Found another great Thai restaurant!! Food is amazing.   We had the amazing crying tiger wrap. Wrapped just like a burrito with Thai fusion inside. Yummy.   Thai beef jerky, which was not that great because the meat was way too tough.    The chicken mint was to die for along with the Thai fried rice."}
{"text":"Today's Christmas and this restaurant is open with 3 persons taking care for the sitting area. One appears to be the manager, the other 2 are waitresses. Both waitresses perform their duties in an unhurried manner. The manager is busy with clearing tables and other things. None pay attention to us, even though we call them several times. The people sitting at the next table are down right pissed. After a while, we leave this restaurant taking our business somewhere else."}
{"text":"I got the red curry... freaking amazing... the flavor is the best curry I have had so far in life... mango with sticky rice soooo good too. I'm sad I dont live in vegas. Will think about this curry until next time.. please go and eat here!!"}
{"text":"A gem located off the strip. This place is a hole-in-the-wall looking place from the outside. We were turned off by the other businesses in this strip center but lo and behold, this restaurant incredibly clean and updated inside. Service was great. Food was amazing - every dish. We ordered koi jor (fried dumpling), red chicken curry with level 5 spice (not too spicy- I could've went higher so just FYI if you like things spicier), tom kha (shrimp soup), and boat noodle soup.  All were up to standards of authentic Thai food. I have relatives who are Thai and the blend of flavors was definitely almost as good as homemade. (Bc ya know, nothing beats homemade, am I right?)"}
{"text":"Loved the fact that they are open until 4am, perfect for a late night worker like me. Ordered Tom kha, Tom yum, and panang. All yummy! Loved the atmosphere, just not the location, kinda scary at night but would love to go during the day."}
{"text":"The cutest little Thai place . Awesome pad see ew! They've got a friendly staff and everything is neat and clean"}
{"text":"3 friends and I came here on a Saturday at 4 pm. There was only one waitress who was also working as hostess, and way too many tables for her to manage on her own. She was clearly overwhelmed. It took about 20-30 min just to get seated and get our orders in.  Our food came out pretty quickly afterwards. We ordered the hoi jor and thai dumplings as appetizers, which were good but nothing special. The entrees were delicious, though - giving this place 4 stars on food alone. We had the khao soi - which is one of my favorite thai dishes. This came with a big chicken drumstick, laden with flavor from the soup. The panang curry with chicken was excellent as well, and a the spicy catfish was perfectly fried and flaky. So filling and so good.  Towards the end of the dinner, we were in a bit of a rush to meet up with our other friends for EDC. 45 minutes into our meal, we were still waiting for our coffees which they'd forgotten about. We ended up having to take them to go. Overall, great food with some hiccups in service - which may or may not be the norm here. When I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely give this place another shot."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch at Thai Street Cafe last weekend and we are in agreement with other reviewers. The food, decor, service and restrooms are top notch. The food is a bargain. We'll eat here again when we visit Vegas. The exterior is rough but you enter a wonderful new world when you enter. It's a short walk from the Trump, Wynn or Fashion Show Mall. There's some people watching to be had as well since a \"Showgirl Supply Store\" is next door. A tall, blonde woman pulled up in a new Aston Martin so I got to drool over car as well as the great food at Thai Street. The woman, not so much. She was beautiful but tattoos too many. What kind of showgirl has tattoos? I bet she wouldn't put bumper stickers all over the Aston but I bet she has a few on her own Aston."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My husband and I ordered the beef chow mein, orange chicken and basil chicken. The food was fresh and flavorful. You could really taste the fresh orange in the orange chicken which I have never had an orange chicken that actually has a fresh orange taste. Also the chow mein was cooked perfectly along with the basil chicken. In each dish you could taste all the fresh flavors. It was a nice surprise to try a place and it be fresh and amazing quality! Will definitely be going here for all my Thai food cravings!!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure because they open until 4 am but it's one of the best Thai food I ever had. We had basil fried rice with fried tofu which we prefer over any meat because you won't get the complete flavor of basil fries rice with meat. Their panang curry is finger licking good. I actually dumped the rice into the curry bowl and let it soak for couple of minutes and emptied the whole bowl."}
{"text":"This was a strong 4 moving towards 5. The food was very fresh. I had a nice curry with seafood. The rice was excellent and the taste great. Wasn't as spicy as I would have liked (I asked for a 7 out of 10 but got maybe a 3 or 4).   I tried my friend's ribs, very good but a bit chewy. Lots of non-Thai food on the menu.  Very clean and fast service however a search of their health scores varies from C to A over time.  The location is near a bunch of strip clubs and stripper outfitters and is definitely in a sketchy part of town behind the strip. It is an oasis if you will...  Very bummed they did not have beer and do not serve alcohol. I will return on my next trip unless the health score drops again."}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon this place because they were open late... Glad my friends and I did, cuz we just found a new place to eat when craving Thai food. It's clean, fast service, food is fantastic, and has very modern look. Our server May was super nice! She also took an order for 9 people without writing on a paper and getting ALL orders right.   Can't wait for our next visit here."}
{"text":"Very quick delivery, the woman who was delivering was super friendly and nice also.   The steamed dumplings were amazing. Love it.   Thai tea with boba. Also delicious. No complains there.   Lost a star with the Pad Thai. Might be the worst I've ever had. I've never had pad Thai this dry before, I thought maybe if I stirred it up some of the sauce from the bottom would rehydrate the dry noodles but nope. It was also cold. The noodles were so dry they were stuck together like a block. Since I work in an office I don't have eating utensils and they only provided me with a flimsy spork that doesn't work with this dry, clumpy mess. Wouldn't be so bad if I had soy sauce to pour in it but they didn't give me any in my bag. (My bad for not asking when I ordered though) also no lime or lemon on the side to drizzle over.   Very disappointed with that dish but am hopeful the next time i order something different it will be better. Like I said, EVERYTHING else was amazing and I'm not a fan of ragging on places I intend to order from again, but that pad Thai was a huge mess. I definitely plan on getting yellow curry next time :)"}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  With so many Thai restaurants in town, I keep trying a few a week and still never get close to finishing the list.  This one in particular was very interesting to try as the ratings were very good, but the area of town not so bright.  China Town is one thing, but the location of Thai St. Cafe on Industrial Rd. is a little off-putting.  The restaurant's inside is very nice but I wouldn't hang out outside.  I tried the eggplant and tofu and opted for 10 on the spicy level (top).  The level of spiciness wasn't over the top, burn your mouth, but it did make you sweat a little. The dishes I ordered seemed pretty similar though, as if they were all made in the same pot, with different veggies and sauces and meats added right before serving.  The taste and sauce were not mouth watering but still above average.  Not sure I will be back any time soon, but the prices are very affordable and portion sizes accommodating.  If in the area for lunch I would not turn down Thai St., but I will continue searching for the best Thai."}
{"text":"I probably order this from Uber eats 2 maybe 3 times a week! Best Thai ever!"}
{"text":"The location was desirable but the outside and inside of the restaurant are very modern and nice. The food was AWESOME and very affordable!   We had the fried rice and the beef soup bowl. So good I demolished it"}
{"text":"Third visit here. Don't let yourself be fooled by the exterior or surroundings. The interior decor is brand new, modern, yet cozy. The food is consistently great, and service is quick and efficient. Loved the wrap on a previous visit, and the appetizers are also quite nice. Prices are very very reasonable, way better than anything on the strip."}
{"text":"Do not use the trash online service. I've been waiting up to 50 minutes for my food to get here even though online it said it would take 20 minutes. I got an email saying my food was here, I walk to the lobby and no one so I check the status of the order and they tell me my order was cancelled?? Complete bullshit"}
{"text":"This place is really good but service is the worst I have ever experienced. They don't acknowledge you, they don't make sure everything is OK, you have to stand up and ask if you need something, all they do is be on their phone and they won't even look at you. And when they do look at you it's like if they get bothered because you need more water or sauce. It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Quick dinner before heading home and it did not disappoint. We shared the green chicken curry and pad Thai noodles. Both were spot on for authentic flavor and freshness. Lots of rich green curry sauce and perfectly cooked veggies. Some of the best pad Thai I've tasted. Clean and nicely decorated little place. This will likely be a favorite Vegas spot to eat."}
{"text":"Jewel of a place in a seedy strip mall just behind the strip.  Food is worth it, and the place itself is nice and cared for, even if the surroundings are in disrepair."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Encore, and I just ordered food from this place. The app I used said food would arrive in at least an hour, but the delivery driver arrived with our hot delicious food and cold icy drinks in less than half an hour. I highly recommend this place for anyone on the Strip or off. Quick service and delicious food! I love their mango sticky rice and their pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! What a pleasure to find a restaurant in Vegas with fresh, delicious food, excellent service and kind people, reasonable prices, and a relaxing atmosphere away from the flashy strip. Will be back next time in Vegas! Highly recommend. Had the pork larb, tom kha soup, pad see ew noodles, and eggplant dish--all were very tasty! Particularly loved the eggplant dish!"}
{"text":"The very first time I went in and it was such a wonderful experience, I can't wait to go again. The food was fabulous and the atmosphere was really nice."}
{"text":"I love this place the pineapple fried rice is delicious! And the staff is really respectful and courteous to allergies and food intolerance. This place is safe for Vegans!"}
{"text":"great food?love the fried rice"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Interior very cool and clean. Staff very friendly and helpful.  Everything we tried was good. They even deliver to the hotels."}
{"text":"I stopped in very late one night after work and Aon was so courteous and helpful. The food is amazing. I highly recommend the Tofu Pad Thai. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This place is truly authentic!  The most authentic thai place that I have ever visited, as a matter of fact, and the price is very reasonable.  It is located in quite a sketchy area, but it is worth the visit.  Though if you are alone, I would perhaps visit in broad daylight.  I ordered drunken noodles with chicken (spicy level 10/10), tom yum soup, papaya salad, and coconut ice cream.  The drunken noodles spicy level was out of this world - I am a girl that can handle my spices and have never ever had a problem regardless of how spicy anything was, but I could not even finish this dish (the horror cause I always finish), and definitely experienced heartburn for the first time afterwards.  It was delicious and worthwhile though, just be warned.  The papaya salad had the fresh tanginess that I always look for.  The tom yum soup was flavored nicely (though I would recommend this dish a little less, as it is more soup and vegetables are more scarce).  Definitely recommend.  I can picture having some spice-offs here, though in the future, I would probably order a lower spice level."}
{"text":"We had fried crab appetizer and calamari. Calamari wasn't my favorite, I don't like calamari strips. But my pad thai tofu and beef was great and so was the pineapple rice. Spicy and tasty great thai tea alsk!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time getting food from here, but first actual going to the restaurant to order and pick up food. First off decor is quaint and comfortable with the dark wood textures with hints of of the kind of bangkok feel. The food itself (I got Pad See Ew, Spicy Chicken Wings, and Thai Milk Tea). The wings are spicy but addictive and you just want to keep eating it. The thai milk tea is what you expect, good. The pad see ew was similar in expectation and met it with its savory rice noodles. I did wait a bit for my food (roughly 45 min from my order went in, as it seems they have a lot of people ordering delivery), but they compensated with complimentary thai tea (I was half way through the one i ordered) for me not complaining and being patient. Overall good experience for getting food at 1 AM."}
{"text":"I preface almost every Thai restaurant review with this: My bf and I love Thai food. Well, he only orders chicken yellow curry every time, but the point is, we've had no shortage when it comes to our Thai food excursions. I can probably make an entire scrapbook of Thai cuisine, with half the pictures being chicken yellow curry. Go figure!   Enter Thai St Cafe. I was excited, really! Their reclaimed wood interior evoked cleanliness and a downtown-vibe feel. You've seen the type -- all the new coffee shops love this look. To drive in the hipsterdom of it all, Thai St Cafe even plants a bicycle in the corner.  Anyway, stars for being clean and invitingly pleasing, considering the surrounding location of Sammy Davis Jr Drive (aka Industrial Road).  Now the service: absolutely none. We came in right after the lunch rush, so we were the only table there. It was empty. Our waitress left us with menus and took our orders and that was the most communication between us. No checking up, no \"how is everything?\" nada. We wanted to order another side of rice, so we had to go to the counter and ask another guy for it. No drinks refilled. It was only after we got our check she asked us. Why would we want drinks now, we're leaving...  Food: I had their Tom Yum soup with shrimp (up charge), which was served over fire. I got a 2/10 spicy level, but it still was on the spicier side. It's okay, I could handle it. Plenty of mushrooms and shrimp, but too many onions for my taste. I tried some of my bf's chicken yellow curry and we both agreed we've had better. Seemed unbalanced, more coconut-y than most places. Overall, the lack of service ruined it for us and we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Panang--one of the best---and really good drunken noodle! It's great that they are open all night!! Sketchy area but also super busy area so no worries. Excellent service and prices are fair."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite thai places hidden in central Vegas, just east of the strip by sapphire. It's a little hard to find and my maps brought me to the wrong location at first but after some driving around I found them and I'm glad I did. The best pad see ew I've had in a while and the cashew dish was amazing. Highly recommend if you can find them."}
{"text":"I've ordered Thai Fried Rice 2-3 times from Thai St. Cafe and each time, the food seems bland. Also seems to be missing ingredients."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve this one star and I wish it were possible to give negative stars cause that's how disappointed I was with this restaurant. In their defense, the food could possibly be amazing but I would never know because they never delivered it--after an hour and 45 minute long wait. AND, what makes it worse is that I had to call them (three of my calls went to a busy signal) four times and once I was able to reach a live person, all they did was apologize, offer another half hour wait and promise a discount of 15% off on the next order...of which there will not be one. It could be the low blood sugar from not having eaten and waiting so damn long, but this experience is enough to make me not only write this review but to never even give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Great Thai food good ambiance Thai tea was so good  Server was fantastic food came out the right temperature  Thank you"}
{"text":"A great hole in the wall find. Minimal seating but great prices and a good lunch menu. Definitely would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Great food always get the pad thai, pad sew eew, egg rolls and mango sticky rice but they don't deliver anymore which is a big bummer. Seems like they are feeling salty that they don't get enough tips so they stopped the service all together. Lack of service and food takes too long too make. Quite unfortunate."}
{"text":"Best Thai food! Everything was delicious had the larb, crab fried rice with real shredded crab meat, and beef jerky! Service was excellent friendly and helpful with ordering explained everything we weren't sure of! Great find off the strip and worth our walk"}
{"text":"Parking was easy - there's a reserved spot right out front when we went at 6pm.   Ordered level 5/10 spice - not that spicy. The spice tray, particularly the hot pepper powder, was plenty to compensate though.   Tip - tell them upfront to make everything less salty (unless you really like savory dishes), as Thai dishes are generally on the salty side.  Ordered the hoi jor ($8.95) appetizer - soft and flaky on the outside, crab, shrimp, and pork on the inside - prepared wonderfully! This chow Jo dish is hard to make and difficult to find at restaurants, and the last place we had it was not great, so this was a delight!  The kao soy ($10.95) noodle soup is also a hard to find dish, as it is more of a Thai home-cooking style dish that is rarer at Thai restaurants - the Thai place in my home town stopped serving it, so this really hit the spot!   The drunken noodle ($8.95) and eggplant ($8.95) entree were very good, although you'll probably want to order an extra rice for the eggplant dish. Bring it to-go and make rice at home for a second meal! ;)  Also enjoyed the Thai phrases, decorations, and especially the drawings on the restroom doors of a man or woman peeing. Universal.  This place was so good, we'll be back tomorrow before we leave!"}
{"text":"Great food quality, great decor & somewhat okay customer service.  Cream cheese wonton was bomb. Amount of the Tom Kha soup was small, but it was pretty good. This is probably the 1st Thai restaurant where I saw they use onion in the Tom Kha soup. It wasn't bad, but it was kinda weird. Chicken satay was good. I had way much more better Phanaeng curry (spelled Panang curry in most of the places). Fried rice was generic & had nothing bad or good to talk about. Thai iced tea was served in a huge tall glass.   I was kinda surprised that they didn't have any alcohol, not even Singha beer. Specially since they're in Vegas.  Overall, it's a great place to grab something good if you're staying in the Circus Circus or any nearby hotels."}
{"text":"Thai St Cafe is an oasis in the middle of an overpriced, dissatisfied desert. They combine delicious food at a very affordable price. Do not let surrounding businesses deter you from enjoying this gem.   The atmosphere and environment is very modern, but casual. You're able to order your food online for carryout or dine in to cut down on time. However, we came during lunch and we seated immediately. The service was decent. The waiter took a little while to bring us drinks and take our order, but there were no more hiccups afterwards. They food and drinks came out in a timely manner as well   The food was absolutely delicious. We started with the chicken curry puffs, which were a little dry but had good flavor, and the Thai dumplings, which were amazing! I went with the chicken Pad Thai for lunch with a spice level of 6/10. The food was inviting in every manner. Lots of flavor while leaving heat in the front of your mouth. Left me feeling warm and full.   Again, if your wanting good food for good value, check out Thai St Cafe."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food is absolutely delightful, the atmosphere is great, and service was good. The fried rice was unbelievably good as was the various Thai curries we had. Great spot right off the Strip"}
{"text":"Totally awesome Thai food!  The food is authentic and cheap.  Go for the lunch plate-$8.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was a long walk from our hotel (Treasure Island) and next to a strip club.  Definitely order the Thai iced tea, it was very good."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place and the food they serve, but they really need to get their orders together. I have ordered from here quite a bit, and will continue to. The ongoing issue I have is that my order is wrong 99% of the time I get delivery. If first impressions are everything to you, I suggest dining in to appreciate what they have. They will forget to include something or take something out if requested. My orders are never large, usually two entrees and maybe a thai tea, so I don't understand how it can happen so often. They are extremely professional when it comes to making sure the order is right, which I really appreciate! But I don't want to wait another 30mins for food when it could be made right the first time. I always tip the driver nicely, even twice for making a double trip to fix my order. PLEASE try to fix this issue as I would love to order from here more!"}
{"text":"Thai St Cafe makes some pretty good Thai food. I've had their Pad See Ew and Pad Thai and tried a few other dishes and everything is pretty on point. The only reason I've docked them a couple stars is because they need to work on their service when not taking out. When we sat in and dined, they got our order wrong, then charged us for the item on the check. It was fixed, but otherwise that, the service was still kind of slow and not very attentive. I believe they forgot to give us chopsticks when we asked for a couple as well, and someone else had to bring them. Pretty sloppy.  Still, this place is worth going to if you're in the area - though it's kind of out of the way in a seedy area of town. It really doesn't fit in with its plaza."}
{"text":"Food here is excellent! Delicious and very authentic! More traditional food for a very reasonable price. Workers are all very nice and friendly. There can be a wait sometimes if they are busy, but it is well worth it! We tried the drunken noodles and tom yum hot pot. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Bomb food. Pad Thai on point. Papaya salad on point. They don't water food down like other Thai places. Great flavor and presentation. And the spicy level is from 1-10 and make sure you can handle spicy food before ordering anything around the 7-10 range."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times for take-out but their food is authentic and amazing. It's hidden behind Fashion Show Mall and Circus Circus but don't be fooled, their food is legit and the prices are reasonable. Would definitely recommend coming here if you want bomb Thai food. I always crave their beef salad *flame emoji*"}
{"text":"I almost gave this place 4 stars just because of the area it was in.  Surrounded by some sleazy shops.  But this place looks nice when you walk in, the waitress was professional and friendly, the service good, and the food delicious.  We went about 2 pm, and were the only customers.  The chow mein was  great, all fresh ingredients.  Likewise, the mixed vegetables with shrimp was scrumptious.  Egg rolls... best I ever tasted.  Food presentation was perfect.  I pictured a professional chef working in the back.  In summary, one star for the location, but five for the restaurant (which we found on yelp)."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Thai st. is a place that I feel like not a lot of people know of, but definitely should.   We came here after a night out one time. This place is located near the stratosphere (along industrial rd) by a liquor store. At first the place looks out of place as I wouldn't think a really good Thai place here would exist, but it sure does!   My boyfriend and I ordered their Thai dumplings, shrimp fried rice, and their chicken panang curry. The Thai dumplings were just perfect. They came out steamed and I love the sauce that it came with. It was like a sweater soy sauce. We couldn't finish the shrimp fried rice with its big portion and the curry too. My boyfriend's cousin ordered fried tofu pad woon sen and that had to be one my favorites too!   During the late hours I haven't seen this place busy, but I heard they have a great lunch menu. I'll have to try that!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, foods are fine , location hard to find but beside of that everything was good ."}
{"text":"I know I have been consistently reviewing Asian restaurants and small cafes , but I am sorry, I am on this adventurous whirlwind of work stress and subsequent nightmares; aggressive allergies and having to repeat myself at least three times, to everyone I know. I don't have the time for my \"Paint the city Red\" reviews right now.   I placed an online order from Thai St. Cafe and that part was super convenient and easy. Somehow, I am always annoyed when I know the place is across the street from where I am and I have to wait 60+ minutes for the delivery anyway.   I had the following items:  Egg rolls Dumplings Chicken Chow Mein  Total: $35 with delivery fee of $3 and a $5 tip.  I wrote very specific delivery notes on the order because my office can be a little hard to find and after placing the order, I immediately called the restaurant to reiterate my notes and told them exactly how to get to me. The hostess said she will relay this to the driver. Of course, when he arrived. he was at the other side of our property, about a mile from my office and I had to explain again. This just annoys me a bit. I already repeated it twice... so, really? You need it again? (See my note about repeating myself).  Eggrolls might have as well been frozen. Not the crispy, flaky roll I expect and get from my home girl at China Bobo. These reminded me of what I used to buy at Sam's Club, like 15 years ago. There was nothing memorable about the item.   Dumplings smelled like farmed or defrosted fish before I even opened the container. Eating them, I did not taste the fish, but definitely smelled it. The taste of pork dominated the dumpling with every chew. I eat meat but I do not like tasting the death of the animal in my mouth as I chew its bits. That was a turn off and I did not eat more than two. The texture of the whole dish was very good and well presented. The plum sauce had a very distinct prune flavor and to me it was great, to some it may be too strong.   Chow Mein was tasty and had a good amount of cabbage, carrots and green onion. The chicken pieces were HUGE and that was pretty much the whole dish. Sliced chicken breast (long way) dominated the dish, and it was sauteed and sprinkled with veggies and noodles. I ate most of the noodles and had a container full of leftover chicken. I have it the fridge at work, but I most likely will never eat it again and will leave it there because I feel badly for having to throw it out.   The Chow Mein portion was actually pretty small now that I think about it.  The 4-5 egg rolls were way smaller than usual so you are basically getting about 3 normal sized rolls for about $7 with tax and fees. Not worth it.   I've spent many paychecks in Chinatown and in Summerlin on great Asian food -- this is not fantastic Thai food -- this is very generic Thai and ti servers its purpose..   I understand that their portions and pricing are due to their proximity to the Strip, but again, Chinatown is 10 min away and there are some fantastic joints there. I can see this being a great place for hungry tourists, who do not want to pay the extortion costs of some of the Strip restaurants, but I would most definitely not make the trip from my neighborhood to eat here.   Based on the items I ordered, the food was just meh for my taste buds."}
{"text":"This place was really good! I would highly recommend this place if you are in Vegas and want to go off the strip to save some money on food that's also filling. We had one of their soups, lunch plate, and some Thai tea. The meat was really tender and soft. Both dishes were really flavorful and on the outside it may look intimidating for the run down plaza that it is in but don't be fooled the inside of this establishment is really nice!"}
{"text":"Great food but service not so good. Ambience is great. If you are with kids be cautious about location as it is not so good as it is the middle of 2 strip clubs"}
{"text":"Don't eat here! I just ordered delivery and my shrimp was RAW! Shrimp fried rice ... never ever ever! Gross !"}
{"text":"This is my GO TO right here late nights, close my shop at 2am and come here for a spicy meal. I don't know if he's the owner but the man with the glasses is very accommodating and I truly appreciate him and his hard working employees. Sometimes he gives stuff on the house and he truly cares for his customers. A place like this is a hidden gem, and will be coming back every week like I have been for the last couple weeks"}
{"text":"Highly recomend this place. Wonderful food especially the papaya salad and also the service is really nice. Although we had to wait quite a long time for the soup but since the food was so good so that was fine with us"}
{"text":"Found this hole in the wall surrounded by sleezy shops. The waitress's service is exceptional. We ordered the Tom yum, pad see ew, and the green curry. The green curry portion size is huge and the food is spicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"Good Thai food look just like the pictures in the menu. Smart decorations , price is fair."}
{"text":"Ordered the green curry with pork, pad thai, and the Orange chicken. The curry and pad thai were fantastic. The orange chicken was kind of doughy and not fried long enough. We ordered for pick up and the food was ready by the time we got there."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ordered the crying tiger wrap, garlic pork with rice, and curry puffs. The tiger wrap and garlic pork was really good and the portions were great. The curry puffs are a must try. Also the free small thai tea with yelp check in was super nice and awesome of them. Definitely come try this thai place out. :)"}
{"text":"Great place and awesome food. Came in today with my friends from NorCal and the food quality was great so was the packaging of our to go meals. I highly recommend this place . Ooh and please try the yellow curry and basil fried rice"}
{"text":"Good food i been going to this place every time I visit las vegas ..... portion kind small but the taste is great"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because the last time I was here, the waitress brought out my food and there was a piece of hair sticking out, she saw it, pulled it out and giggled. I felt too uncomfortable to send it back. Additionally, you should know this place has been closed twice due to health department violations. I'm just extremely concerned about the way the food is prepared and even though I've love the food, the thought of their kitchen being disgusting makes me not be able to stomach it."}
{"text":"I enjoy my food last night, dinner before movies with my cousin, the area is off strip, the prices was right and the food was excellent since we shared our different plates. Now that I am a local, I will return again."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent. We had the green curry chicken and the pork pad Thai. Having had lots of Thai food over the years, this place was about as good as any and the prices were very reasonable being this close to the strip - about $10 per person and huge portions. Very very pleased."}
{"text":"I can no longer convince myself to dine here anymore. I work across street and was dining here 2-3 times a week until the host of \"Dirty Dining\" walked in with her camera man to investigate the \"C\" health grade they had received and why it was not posted in the restaurant. Along with the cleanliness issues, the owner's cot for sleeping in the food storage room, unsafe food temperatures and plumbing issues this was their second appearance on the local show \"Dirty Dining.\" I would typically return after seeing physical changes and corrections however they have lost my trust after choosing not to post their lower health grade.   *Prior to their two mishaps, the food was amazing, so much that I would always order the dinner portion. It's open all hours of the night, services was a bit slow as I've only ever seen one cook but I was often there for the lunch rush so not a biggie for me especially since i work so close. I'm definitely dissapointed however if you can look past it then I recommend the yellow curry with tofu or shrimp or the seafood tom yum soup."}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall restaurant!! The food is amazing here, especially with the late hours until 4am!!!"}
{"text":"This Thai Curry house should get more attention. Prices are very good, food is delectable. The only downside of this restaurant is it's location. It's parking lot is small, but they have reserved spots. From the outside, it looks sketchy. Inside though, it's very clean and nicely decorated.  I ordered the Pad Thai and the yellow curry. I asked for spicy level 3 (out of 10) and for the curry it wasn't too spicy. What I would expect a 3 to be. For the pad Thai, it was what I would expect a 6 to be. It was really spicy.   Service was good. Establishment was clean. Food pricing was reasonable. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever!!! I actually like Thai food a lot and I eat it when ever I travel but this time believe me, if u can, u should avoid it."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. They've got a nice lunch special thats affordable and tasty. We've been going to this spot before they expanded. Looks like business is doing good. Not quite sure why they got rid of the Khao Soy, which was delish. Love the Chow Mien and Yellow Curry. Friendly staff that remember your name, and if you go there enough like we do, they will remember what you order. Only caveat is the location is a little sketch and strange people walk around the area (next to the cancan room). Other than this, great restaurant, clean and good food."}
{"text":"VERY CLEAN, food is REALLY good, not a c big menu but enough dishes. Must try checken winfs! Foof is fresh and best of all its open really late. It's our second time here we will be regulars. The parking lot looks shady but it's fine just lock your doors lol! Don't be turned off by all the \"Spas\" nearby just go in and eat some really good Thai food!"}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle and I grew up eating Thai food. I haven't been able to find a Thai place that was as good as the Thai food in Seattle, until I came here. Very close to authentic Thai food. The only issue is the ventilation of this restaurant. Always smells like smoke and looks smoky when I walk in."}
{"text":"I want to give this restaurant 5 stars.. Cause I've probably have eaten here over 30 times. Eggplant and beef is amazing and the rest of the food is also very good quality. The only thing and I believe it has ruined a fair few meals is they always make it hotter then what you ask for. I know I sound like a sook but I have even order meals without spice and has come back extremely spicey.. Just really annoying and cause we always get post mates  , you can't really just take it back. 3 stars Thai place fix up the communication within the kitchen. And i shall be returning ."}
{"text":"We work at night and always looks for great places to eat that are open late. Thai Street Cafe has never disappointed! Very authentic and diverse menu and they even deliver. They don't serve alcohol in house, but do allow you to bring in any outside adult beverages you wish, so it isn't too inconvenient. Definitely recommend if you are a fan of Thai food!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I must say, I am pleased to see that it's s very decent place to come in for lunch.    It's located in a weird strip mall ... In the Can Can Room complex .  However, this place is actually very nice and quaint.  It opened about 3 months ago.  Decor is very stylish and modern.  Food options was great, they have lunch specials for $7.95 ... You can't beat that!!  I ordered the chicken pad see-ew and usually add spice but I wanted to just a feel in their dish as-is.  It was a bit too salty and It could have needed a little more of noodles.    I will definitely return ... Can't beat the price!!"}
{"text":"Service was just awful.  And, they weren't busy at all, so I have no idea what the problem was.  Our food all came out at different times.  And, by different times, I mean the people who got their food first were already finished by the time the last meal arrived.  (We told them to go ahead and start...once we realized our food wasn't coming any time soon...)  We didn't have the proper number or type of place settings, and it took several tries to get a spoon for the curry.    The food was okay, but I wouldn't be back based on the service."}
{"text":"Yes, the area. Well, you can get some nice dance clothes next door. Was pretty hip to be honest and the food was very good.  Staff was helpful and polite. Restaurant was clean and hipster.  The parking here is very tight, close together, take the uber. If you are hold up at a casino and want Thai food that is tasty and won't break the bank, get in here!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Thai food in Las Vegas. Highly recommended! We ordered the khao soy and green curry. The curry was delicious and a good size serving. The khao soy had too much turmeric that it was overpowering but overall the flavor was still good. I wish we were able to try more foods but we weren't that hungry. I'd definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! Love the yellow curry & papaya salad, but mango & sticky rice is my favorite, hands down! Definitely a weekly ritual!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here cooked just to order and piping hot when it comes to the table. The staff is very friendly and I didn't order rice as I'm used to it coming with the meal, she added it in and said have a great day. I'll definitely be back here when I visit Vegas again. The atmosphere is nice and cozy as well, warm and aromatic just the way an authentic Thai spot should be. Great great great!"}
{"text":"We visited over Labor day weekend with 2 other couples & I think we had almost one of everything on the menu before we left there. One of my friends is from Thailand & she raved about how good this place was so we knew it was going to be good before getting there. We enjoyed every minute of it & it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"First timer . From LA to visit here. Found on yelp so I trying out the Thai food Price is good and authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Very flavorful food. I have a high threshold for spice and the level ten actually made my tastebuds tingle  I ordered the sweet basil (which does come with a side of rice.... I ordered extra sticky rice because I didn't know beforehand). I did wish it had more veggies (so order extra if you like to veg out too). The pad Thai was also tasty. The crying tiger wrap was disappointing."}
{"text":"This place has friendly staff, a small intimate atmosphere and flavorful food. We ordered the Prik King Chicken, the crab fried rice and the combination drunken noodles. Everything was fresh and delicious. The Prik King Chicken was my favorite. The flavor was incredible! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"First time at Thai St Cafe.  Wanted Thai food & since Lotus is closed, a good time to try someplace new.  It's a cute little spot in a seedy area, part of the charm!  Walking in, it's nicely decorated with very friendly staff. The Thai tea with Boba is huge, coffee as well.  And delicious.  Don't ask for lite or no ice, it'll set you back .50 or $1.  Understandable since it's a large drink.  The Thai dumplings were the best I've tried.  The sauce that comes with it is sweet and sticky.   We also tried chicken fried rice and chicken panang curry.  The fried rice is typical.  Nothing special.  The panang curry was good but it needs to be spicier.  I was told spiciness depends on the customer but I wasn't asked.  What I had would probably be a 1 or 2, I'm told.  Personally I think it needs to be up there around a 5 to really taste like Panang curry.  This is a short walk from the Trump hotel/Fashion Show Mall.    I would definitely come back and try different dishes.  This will be one of those places that I need to visit when coming to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had the pad thai, spicy basil chicken, and cream cheese wontons. It was SOOOO good and they delivered within the estimated delivery time. They even allow you to choose your desired spiciness level :)"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!  If i could give it zero stars, I would.  My coworkers and I went today during our lunch hour and besides taking our order and giving us water, we did not receive any other service...including our food.  After an hour, we had to ask them to box up our food because our lunch hour was up.  No apology.  They even charged more for one of our meals and my coworker had to argue for the correct price.  We used to come here a lot because we wanted to support a local business near our office.  The food is usualy good but the service always seems to decline each time.  Today was the worst!  Yes it is Christmas and yes it was busier than I've ever seen it but an hour wait for our food without even a hint of an apology was the last straw.  The worst part is that they had a toddler (literally a toddler!) bussing tables, collecting payment, and giving people their food/drinks. I would not be sad if this restaurant went out of business.  I will defnitely not be supporting it since they obviously do not appreciate my patronage."}
{"text":"Aside from the odd location (next to strip clubs and PROBABLY happy ending massage parlors). The food is bueno.  Service lacks in attentiveness: it took a bit more than enough time to look at the menu to order and napkins weren't provided. However, if you pay attention and know anything about the food business, they were busy and lacking staff.  The food, itself, is worth it. I didn't think it'd be fulfilling, but it did the trick. We ordered the Boat Noodle Soup, Tom Yum, and Kao Soy (plus a Thai tea, which was almost 2x more than your normal serving, they don't skip out!). All the broths were delicious and full of flavour. Let me tell you about the Kao Soy though. If you're ever conflicted with getting curry, noodles or soup, this is the dish to get:  1) The broth was the best. The minty, basil taste makes this spicy(medium on the heat scale?), yellow curry-based soup refreshing.  2) The eggs noodles were nice and firm, not undercooked or over cooked, wider than pho noodles but thinner than Pad Thai noodles. 3) The toppings were just right: a tender succulent piece of chicken that's been cooked with the broth, shredded crispy fried wonton noodles that add texture to the dish, and other stuff that weren't noticeable important (pickled veggie, cilantro, beansprouts)  Overall, a good place to eat, just be patient and request stuff if they forget"}
{"text":"the best thai restaurant in town...I've tried a lot of thai food everywhere but I like here the most. credit for their big thai tea..."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food that's close to the strip. On a whim, we decided to try something outside of the tourist realm and was content with what we discovered. Basic offerings with basic taste is exactly what we discovered by eating here.  The customer service lacked luster. I was glad to have iced water since I didn't get asked if I wanted a second cup, at least I had the option of drinking melted ice cubes.   The food was okay, nothing to brag about. If you need something quick and easy, this place will suit you. No fireworks, no excitement. Just food to fill your tummy.   The best thing about this spot is the convenience of its location. The strip can get congested, so venture off the typical path and directly behind it...you'll find this place."}
{"text":"We found this place when we were running away from the Strip with the shooter this weekend. The staff was so nice and let us hide out there for a while. My friends ordered some food (They loved it) and the beautiful server told us that we could stay as long as we needed. When we were getting ready to leave another staff member offered us a ride to our hotel (MGM Which was close to where the shootings happened) It was so kind. So eat here. Give them all your money."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for mango and sticky rice, and my bf loves Thai, so we came here a little before midnight on a Saturday night.    First, a word about the neighborhood- VERY dicey. It's in the strip joint part of the city, and they are clearly trying to catch the girls and the patrons as the clubs close for the night. Not a particularly safe area. However, their chosen location did not influence my review. Inside it looks very nice.   So, we both ordered- 2 waters, 2 Thai teas with boba- mine with extra milk, 2 mango with sticky rice, and he ordered a medium spicy soup. Even though the girl was writing down the order, she repeated it back to us wrong, so we corrected her. That should have been a warning sign.   About 10 minutes later, she finally came back out. She had forgotten the waters, and my Thai tea did not have boba or extra milk in it. We asked for our waters, and it took her several more minutes to bring them out.    Perhaps I should mention here- there were 2 other customers sitting at another table who were halfway through their meal and no one else. And there were 3 or 4 employees (we saw a male and female at the cash register and a male in the kitchen, and we were pretty sure we also saw a female in the kitchen).    So they brought out my bf's soup decently quickly, and when they did I reminded them that I had ordered the mango with sticky rice for my meal. The guy nodded his head and left. 15 minutes passed by while I watched my bf eat his meal before they finally brought me mine. When they did, they asked bf if he wanted his too. Thankfully, he said yes because within 2 minutes they had brought it to the table- translation, it was already done. If he had said no, it would have sat there on their counter getting cold and rubbery until they finally brought it out to him.   Not even halfway through our experience, the other 2 customers left. Even though there were no other customers, they only managed to refill our waters once. And each time they brought us anything, we thanked them, but not once did either of them say \"You're welcome.\"   We finished our food. Bf's soup had almost been too spicy for him to handle even though he LOVES spicy food and had asked for medium spicy. We sat there. And sat there. And sat there... until finally we gave up on the idea that our waitress was ever going to come back to bring us our bill. We went up to the cash register where both our waitress and the guy who had brought out the food were standing hanging out laughing- instead of helping their customers, paid the bill, and left.   Even though the service was atrocious, my boyfriend liked the soup. The mango with sticky rice was definitely not the best I've ever had, but it was okay. They gave us tall glasses of the Thai tea- these are the reasons for the 2 stars instead of just a 1 star review.   Not planning to return- other places have better mango with sticky rice, better soup, and far better service"}
{"text":"Awesome service, price and damn good food at 1am. Fresh food didn't stop! Great place to bring the family."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Everything was prepared beautifully and the price is super reasonable! We had the yellow curry, phad Thai with shrimp and the beef jerky. Loved it all! The location is a little weird like others have mentioned but the food is totally worth it."}
{"text":"We heard about Thai street through Yelp and thought it was super good. After a long day in Vegas, me and my girlfriend just wanted so have delicious Thai delicacies . However, it was not to be. The waitstaff were incredibly unhelpful and didn't even give us menus. The whole time the server was on the phone and I had to ask the server to take our order after she ignored us for 15 minutes. When the food eventually came after forever, it was terrible. The attitude and                   Inattentiveness of the waitstaff totally ruined our night. 2/5 stars. Never gonna return"}
{"text":"This place was so clutch! After spending the entire day on a tour bus, I was looking for a quick late night dinner option for myself and my little one. Despite the 70-90 minute delivery time listed, our food came in 15 minutes, even after the restaurant called to confirm our order and said it would be 45 minutes. Can't complain about that! Not the best Thai food I've eaten by far, but the quick and easy convenience of this place was just what we needed."}
{"text":"This review is for my delivery order about 2 weeks ago. I came back from a night out and chose to order from Thai St Cafe instead of another Thai place because they were just across the street (I was at Treasure Island) and figured they would get to me faster.   So at 3:20 AM, I placed an order for 2 Pad See Ew Noodles and 1 Young Coconut to meet the delivery minimum, totaling to $27.21 (+$5 delivery fee). So the waiting began.   I called once and texted twice for updates, and it turns out that even though I was just across the street, there was another order before me that was far away, so they decided to drop that one off first! So my order finally got to me at 4:20 AM, when everyone else I was with was asleep. The delivery guy called me before he was even there, so I ended up waiting in the lobby for 5 more minutes. He took out a wad of cash and strangely offered me two dollar bills.......huh? And I was really confused and just told him to keep it.  The food was barely warm and there was no microwave in my hotel room. The beef was so dry that I ended up just eating the noodles and leaving everything else, and throwing out the second Pad See Ew. And they forgot the coconut!! I called them the next day to try to get a refund for the whole order, and they refused to refund anything. As for the coconut that they didn't even give me, they gave me the run-around and told me to email Eat24, who would email them.  I just can't believe I paid almost $30 for basically half a disgusting lukewarm Pad See Ew, and that it cost $5 and one hour to deliver it across the street! I would only recommend this place upon my worst frenemies. No matter what my friends say next time, I am only going to Marilyn's Cafe for late night food -- $5 steak and eggs!!"}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp! it is located literally behind the casinos, was in the mood for Thai, but didnt want to be on the strip and this place was open late so thought I would check it out.... the food came out fresh and warm and the prices were pretty good...they even re did my rice when I ordered it too spicy and brought out a new order! so thank you for that!! hopefully when I am back in Vegas I can come back here"}
{"text":"My second time here for lunch and I absolutely love it. The service are fast and the waitress are nice. Very clean place. If you want authentic Thai food. This is the place to come. Super plus bc they have yen-ta-fa, my favorite noodle soup."}
{"text":"We got eggrolls, dumplings, ragoons for appetizers! We shared fried rice and chow mein, the chow mein was so good! The rice tasted like black licorice, not a fan..and sadly no cocktail menu."}
{"text":"This place redefines \"hole-in-the-wall\". Located in a distinctly dubious strip mall, the food was wonderful. I had seafood pad cha, with fresh green peppercorns. The potstickers and calamari were great as appetizers. The prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful except for their taste in music which left a lot to be desired.  The Thai ice tea was served in a large glass and was as yummy as expected.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find along Industrial Road. My friend and I were looking for a place to eat and found Thai St on yelp. It's easy to find, because it's located in a strip mall near a bankruptcy lawyer and several strip clubs and an adult toy store:) We were not expecting such a beautiful place considering it's tucked away in this area. Beautiful and clean, with their daily specials hand-written in Thai on a chalkboard - very charming. The food is outstanding and the server was friendly. Bonus points because she realized my friend is vegetarian and offered to have our meals made without fish sauce, without us asking first. I highly recommend this place. A lovely Thai oasis in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of making comments,but I been here twice,jus visiting from Texas..Thai ice tea here is probably one of the best I had,compared to most Thai restaurant..drunken Noodle is really good..with tofu & mushrooms,along bell pepper...very clean & friendly staff...not to pricey but I think it's good Enough to serve inside one of the top high end Casino,..Keep up the good service & friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"A must stop, the spicy chicken red curry and spicy chicken and shrimp drunken noodles (level 10 spice) are amazing, along with the pork ribs. Can't wait to come back to Vegas, and have this delivered once again to my hotel room."}
{"text":"Dishes were mostly very good.  Appetizers, fried calamari 4/5 and hoi jor 5/5.  Pad sew ew 4/5, spicy catfish 4/5, Seafood pad cha 3/5,  red curry 3/5, pineapple fried rice 4/5, mixed veg 2/5, pork ribs 4/5, eggplant 4/5.  Negative is dishes on small side and they automatically  add 18% to bill for our party of 6."}
{"text":"Thai St. Cafe is located off the strip by Fashion Show Mall on Industrial Rd. For those not familiar with Industrial Road....there are many adult stores and strip clubs around. It's definitely not an area that I would go out of my way for but sometimes I make an exception, especially for some good eatery. Don't we all?  Ambiance was impressive. Far from the sketchy, ghetto-ness of its location and interior was very modern and hip. They even had a small stage with a microphone, I'm assuming they do some live performances?   Service was friendly and efficient. No complaints here.  First thing that caught my eye when I opened their menu was their Boat Noodle Soup. My server had warned me that the soup is rich and creamy which I did not mind. I loved the thin rice noodle which sort of reminded me of Japanese udon noodles but a lot thinner. It was very smooth. Beef in this was super tender. Soup had the wow factor. It is a cross of beef stew and curry. It had that richness and flavor of beef stew, but with a spicy kick you find in curry. I highly recommend this dish.  Also got to try their Drunken Noodle. I have never had this before so gave this a try and it was good! Again, I enjoyed the rice noodle except this is a flat rice noodle. I liked the fact that it was mixed with variety of ingredients including tomato, mushroom, bell peppers and onions which not only made it filling but made it look vibrant and overall a better presentation. I recommend this dish also.  Thai Dumpling was easily forgettable. It's a steamed dumpling, similar if not same as Shumai. It was clearly a frozen dumpling that was heated before it was served. Sad to say but frozen Shumai from Trader Joe's (It's called Pork Shu Mai or Pork Dumplings, try it if you haven't!) is actually better in my opinion.   I also want to mention that my water tasted odd. It had a soapy aftertaste. I'm used to the chlorine taste but my glass of water here tasted like it was mixed with dish soap.   Overall very pleased with my visit. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"The delivery service was horrible. They told us 30 minutes and said it was out for delivery at 30 minutes from placing the order. We waited an additional hour before it actually arrived. The food was cold and soggy from the containers they were in from the water from the steam. Didn't even offer a refund just apologized. They already got their tip because it was put on the cc when the order was placed. We were practically asleep already when it got there and all the delivery guy said was sorry. I don't see how it took him and hour to get here from when we were told the food was out because the hotel is only right down the street (8mins & 2.6 miles). We ordered the food around 11pm and wished we never did. We were even able to cancel the order.  The delivery fee is also $5 not $3."}
{"text":"Place is great! I'm working in Vegas for a while, and needed veggies at my hotel since I was busy watching the premiere of Bachelor in Paradise (priorities!). They were fast and great to talk to, even suggested the best salad to get with the most veggies. I ordered the Beef salad (sub chicken) and Tom Kha. Delivery charge only $4 (mandatory for hotel delivery), but they delivered it to my room (AWESOME!). Definitely recommend, and get the Chicken salad if you're looking for something light, filling, and healthy! (Tom Kha soup could have been better!)  As far as spice, maybe get 6 if you like it spicy! Went with 8 for chicken salad (good), but 8 for soup was WAY too spicy!"}
{"text":"Cooling Vegas just nice to have hot and sour Thai food! After tiring walk around the strips, decided order some delivery Thai food here. Pad Thai is superb! Tom yam soup request extra spicy is superb! Highly recommend curry puff! Left over for next morning breakfast it still crispy!"}
{"text":"An extra star for the ease of ordering through Yelp.   Unfortunately, the pad see ew was just alright. It needed more flavor. The Hoi jar sounded enticing but it's flavor profile for me tasted more so of onions and garlic."}
{"text":"I wish i could leave no star for this restaurant. A few hours ago we ordered 2 yellow curry and other foods. Curry is expired and the restaurant were trying to convince me that it's good. I have attached pictures for your review. As you can see the milk is being separated from the rest of the liquid and definitely is expired. The restaurant didn't wanna fix this issue for me but gladly we ordered thru eat24 and they gave us a credit to order another food. Dont eat at this place or you gonna get food poisoned!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Vegas! I am a big thai food connoisseur and trust me this is by far the best thai food I've had in a long time. We were a group of 7 and we got a lot of food. Pad thai, Drunken noodles, Tom chi soup, spring rolls, Pad See Mao, Pineapple fried rice, Thai fried rice and Coconut ice cream. Everything was made to perfection and the spice level was perfect. Neither bland nor spicy! Absolutely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place was great and it is located off of the Strip. However, it is in a weird location, since the restaurant is in between some stripper supply stores, haha. Also had the opportunity to sit down, eat, and watch an Uber drive angrily kick out a naked drunk couple in front of the restaurant because they barfed all over the seats. Other than that, we ordered some classic plates, such as the pad thai, orange chicken, and the basil fried rice. The prices weren't expensive and the food was really good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some affordable Thai food in Vegas."}
{"text":"AWFUL experience all around... there is nothing good about this place. The food is sub mediocre, the service is one of the WORST I have ever experienced. My husband and I ordered our food at the same exact time and he got his plate first, finished it and I was still waiting for my food. We order Thai fried rice and Pad Thai. When I asked the waitress for my Pad Thai, she was unapologetic and had the nerve to ask \"do you want to cancel it\" this is not the right thing to say to someone who is hungry and has been waiting for over 40 minutes... needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My new favorite late-night Thai joint. The Panang Curry and Pad Thai were on par with Komol and Archies. The location was surprising and quite seedy, but the quality of the food and being open until 4am, 7 days a week, made it worth while."}
{"text":"I tried this place recently.  It's in a crappy part of town, but that's OK.  The decor is nice.  The food is excellent.  We got the lunch specials.  They were very nicely presented on metal compartment trays.  Pad Thai was excellent as was the curry lunch.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Went here because of the great reviews. We were seated right away, the restaurant was around half full. After 15 minutes of sitting at our table without being acknowledged in any way, let alone having our order taken, we left. I told the person at the counter, who might otherwise have popped over to take our order, that we were leaving due to the lack of service and she shrugged and said \"okay\". There might be great food here, but you have to be willing to tolerate awful service to get it."}
{"text":"Nice place.  I love it's chicken wing, dessert, and boba milk tea. Nice place for casual dinner."}
{"text":"Surprisingly this place serves no alcohol, even though it's in the middle of stripper central. Food was ok. Go to lotus of Siam instead."}
{"text":"Great food. Delicious authentic Thai food.  From the awesome soups, served in a hot stone box to all your typical Thai food classic.  Unfortunately the service is always mediocre, but the food is so good and you can definitely overlook that. Little gem. Don't get scare from the area!"}
{"text":"I ordered food late last night. I live about 10 mins from the place so I expect that could have some affect on the food.   I ordered shrimp and pork wonton. Wontons were ok. Broth was good. The curry puffs were not great I wish it had some chicken or something in there. I also ordered Tom yum vegetable soup it was a little to sweet for me. I had some shrimp and noodle dish I really like the shrimp in this dish.   Overall it was good for 1am, being delivered promptly, and in neat packaging with everything ready to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent!! This house would stand out in the SF Bay Area. Drunken noodles spicy as heck, with great flavor. Red curry smooth and savory, wonderful sauce. And 2 monster iced teas. $36buckaroos. I will remember this establishment."}
{"text":"So I ordered take out and asked for no veggies and they still gave me it with my chow mein.  They also forgot to pack me utensils and napkins. Sorry but I am not a savage and don't eat with my fingers.  I asked for Chile sauce on the side and didn't get it either.  You don't have to accommodate me but at least give me one chopstick or something!  PLEASE READ!!! HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF PURPLE MEAT??  I posted a picture of it below and it came with the beef chow mein.   I've never asked for my steak to be purple so I don't know standards they hold at this restaurant. I ordered the crab/pork fried ball and it had pink in it. The pad Thai was NOT flavorful.  Waste of money and hope I don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"If you are looking for curry that doesn't burn your mouth when you ask for a Zero or One on the spice scale this is the place. I love the complexity of curry without the heat!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem my husband had the boat noodle soup & I had the wonton soup + the bbq ribs \"amazing \" don't pay any attention to the location, the food was delicious. Next time we're in Vegas we will stop by again."}
{"text":"Such a nic3 place to hang out with your family or friends. And  also a reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here at 12am after a show.  The food was ok.  Nothing spectacular.  I got a beef noodle soup.  It had a little sweetness to it that I didn't really expect from the description.  I wasn't a big fan.  I tried the pineapple fried rice which was a little better.  The place is most likely a 3.5 a 4 star but they lost some due to the service.  It was almost non existent.  We waited a while before they took our order.  Our drinks took a while too but the food did come out timely.  Our cups sat empty the entire time."}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad, but not great. Service was very friendly despite what other reviews have mentioned; I guess we just came on a good night. My sister and I went here looking for some Thai food after a late show. We ordered beef fried rice and chicken pad Thai. The pad Thai and rice were pretty okay but one piece of the beef in the fried rice was pink. PINK.  Again, not bad food or service, but with all the options in Vegas, I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Sorry."}
{"text":"Horrible service ... the guy who works there is so rude!! They didn't bring Thai tea and I called and asked and they guy hung up the phone. They accidentally gave us nasty orange chicken which we don't want and demanded us to pay for it !!!!food is just ok and service is wow they treat people bad !!! Cheap people !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!  Everything cooked and seasoned to perfection.   Spice 5/10- had a bite, but not overdone.   Drunken noodles the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Located in a sketchy \"strip\" mall. Creatively decorated spot with a very reasonable menu. I had the drunken noodles and it was fantastic! In fact its the best drunken noodle I've ever had! Portion for lunch was reasonable but I was still a little hungry leaving. I will definetly go back and try a curry or pad Thai dish."}
{"text":"Love this place great food nice portions and good on making deliveries on time would recommended to any body who loves Thai food the price is right and their food is amazingly good"}
{"text":"Tried this place with some friends randomly one night. It's on Industrial among all those strip clubs,  so I was a little wary, but I know some of the best places are in the cuts, and I gave them the benefit of the doubt.   From the outside,  it's a little shady,  especially considering the surroundings,  but the inside is actually quite charming. The decor makes it look like you're hanging out on a nice clean little street getting some truck food. The music was casual and seemed to all be acoustic selections from this Filipina singer Sabrina. Overall it had the feel of a nice cafe.   No alcohol served here, but if you go to the liquor store next door and bring your receipt,  you can byob.  Anyway, foodwise, I wasn't quite as impressed.  We sampled a few of the appetizers and entrees.  The theme for the night:sugar.  On the menu it says that they're not believers of MSG, but it seems like they just add a ton of sugar to make up for it. The pad thai,  Thai boat soup, Tom yum, and panang were all super sweet, and the panang was even a little sour? The rangoon and Thai beef jerky were ok, but nothing special, and overpriced. The fried calamari I liked. It had a hint of vinegar on top of the fried batter.  My favorite of the whole night was dessert, the roti drizzled with condensed milk. Nice, flaky, and buttery. The dessert isn't enough to come back, though."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. It's located nearby strip or they do deliver too. Try it if you love Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is great! The BF and I were looking for somewhere off the strip to grab a quick late dinner before making the drive back to Los Angeles. The servers were friendly and attentive (and very good about refilling water), and the food was overall very tasty! Our appetizer and soup were fantastic, the pad see ew was just ok, but I suppose that's what we get for ordering such an Americanized dish. The fried bananas and coconut ice cream were a perfect delicious finish. Prices were super reasonable as well!  While we were there, there was a large (ie, 20 people) party that was very clearly a big Thai family birthday celebration. Our waitress even apologized for the noise, despite the fact that we were not at all bothered by them - after the raucousness of The Strip on a Saturday night, we were totally fine with more family-friendly celebrations.  We will absolutely eat here again next time we are town!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My family and I ate here for the first time today and enjoyed it very much. The ambiance is very cozy and intimate. All of the workers are super sweet and accommodating. Now on to the food! We ordered chicken paneng, pad  see ew, fried catfish & fried rice. Everything was very tasty and not too salty or bland like some places. We're definitely coming back again soon, even though it's on the their side of town from where we live. Great food, excellent customer service and cute restaurant!"}
{"text":"Horrible. This place is a repeat offender on having a very dirty dining and unhealthy conditions for food preparation. The moment I saw this when I googled it at the table, I walked away. Just so you know, search for the headline \"After only three months, Thai St. Cafe on Industrial Road near Sahara Avenue is back on #DirtyDining\".  They got a 32 score and a C rating, there's grease all over, dirty food drippings in the kitchen, toxic cleaner solutions next to the food, no labeling, you name it. Stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurants Pad see eww is horrible!! Has American broccoli and very bland! I will never order from them again. Waste of money. Go to Taste of Siam blows this place out of the water!! Or even Krung Siam  this is just another watered down Thai S&@t hole restaurant. My whole order was just bad waste of $40 ?"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out. We came around 11:30AM, they opened at 11AM. There was already people getting take out. We were seated immediately.   Their menu wasn't super big. They had around 7 dishes for each category, such as appetizers, main dishes, soups, and desserts. We ordered the Thai Iced Coffee and Young coconut. Oh my lord, the thai coffee was sooooo amazing! It was really sweet, but they warned us beforehand and we still got it. It kind of taste like coffee and thai tea. The young coconut actually came in a coconut, not too sweet. We then ordered the pad thai and the drunken noodles. You can order the level of spice you want from a level of 1 to 10. We got the level 7 spicy for pad thai and it wasn't that hot.   The food didn't take long to come out. The pad thai was very tasty and flavorful. It wasn't dry at all, and it tasted even better with some lime squeezed on top. The drunken noodles were ok. It tasted very plain and it just tasted like regular chow fun noodles.  The price was ok too. The total came out to be around $28. And they're open until 4AM, so if you have the munchies, this place is great! It's kind of in a sketch area though...right next to a liquor store and a bunch of sex shops."}
{"text":"You travel through the back area near the Vegas strip to find a lot of adult shops, some rundown buildings and...a modern Thai restaurant?  That's exactly where Thai St. Cafe is and although the location is weird, everything else is pretty darn solid.    The menu is pretty commonplace as most other Thai restaurants with your noodle/soup/entree dishes (along with some really nicely priced lunch items that go for about $7-9).  The most interesting item for me here was the rarer Kao Soy soup noodle dish.  With a very heavy, almost curry-like broth and a beautiful presentation (and for about only $11-12), it's a highly recommended item for anyone looking for something more adventurous and doesn't break the bank.  I also had the thai milk tea which tasted pretty good - loved that it came in a mason jar.  No alcohol that I saw to my knowledge though.      The decor of the cafe was very modern and super clean.  At lunch time on a Friday, it wasn't crowded (although I do hear it gets busier as the night comes along).  Kudos to Honey for the terrific service/advice as well - really friendly and made me feel very welcome.  Parking wasn't too bad - just make sure to watch out for incoming traffic depending on how you're coming in.    Affordable, solid food, great service. Thai St. Cafe is a great find for someone looking for Thai that isn't too far from the main strip."}
{"text":"Only place I'll eat in Vegas. Good food and good price and good service. I'll be back again soon for more. All my friends also enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Lets get one thing straight off the bat ... You might think google maps is pranking you because the place is easy to miss, nestled between strip clubs and massage parlors. But once you find it, get ready for some really delicious Thai food, especially if starving past midnight. Ordered the basics, red curry, basil fried rice, Thai iced tea, which were all very good. The place gets extra points for decor and service. I can imagine it's hard being so nice in the middle of the night lol. Word of caution, their spicy is SPICY. I ordered my curry a 7 out of 10, and it was on FIRE. And I'm Pakistani, so I can handle spiciness! So maybe order a notch down."}
{"text":"3 stars for quick service. It takes a bit to be seated you would feel like they didn't see you. Price is average but the food was pretty salty and the panang was too sweet, the basil seafood wasnt all that at all, however, it came out quick, it had fresh vegetables and I was starving. Wouldn't come back though"}
{"text":"Better than most Thai places you'll find. Very chill and inexpensive in addition to it being open late. It's right off the strip and not hard to find. The food is very flavorful and fresh the group that I was with ordered four different entrees. So we got to try and sample each other's food and we were very pleased with what we ordered. This is a must try and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a 3am hankering for Thai food and Thai St Cafe came through for me! I called in my order and they were ready for me 15 minutes later. They also deliver with a $15 minimum order. I got:  - Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao): 3 stars. While there is definitely depth and layers of flavor here, the sauce relied a little too heavily on the oyster sauce, in my opinion. It needed a little more fish and dark soy sauces, I thought. They stir fry the noodles with bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms. (Tomatoes and mushrooms have no place in traditional pad kee mao, but they weren't bad here.) The chicken in the dish was marinated spectacularly and not dry. This dish was also flaming hot, but I'll address that below. - Yellow Curry: 4 stars. Thank you, thank you, thank you Thai St Cafe for not making your curries overly sweet. This was exactly what I expect from a good curry. The pork was executed well, and all of the vegetables were cooked perfectly. Of course, the curry comes with rice. No complaints here.  About the spice levels. I have no idea how their system works. I ordered the noodles at a level 7 and the curry at a level 5, and there was a huge, HUGE difference between the two. The curry was very mild, while the noodles were the spiciest thing I have ever eaten. I see a lot of reviews noting that the drunken noodles are very spicy, and I'm thinking it has to do with the particular types of chilies that they incorporate into the dish. But holy moley, it was HOT. Not the type of spice that gets your nose running and feels like warmth, but the type of spice that burns on contact, makes your tongue tingle, and makes the restroom an uncomfortable experience. I was literally yowling in reaction to the heat. I'd be very curious to see what it would be like at a level 5; I'm guessing it would still be much hotter than the level 5 curry. If I were to order these two again, I would do the curry at a level 8 and the drunken noddles at a level 4 or 5.  Good, real Thai food available late at night! I won't be surprised if i find myself here again!"}
{"text":"My new go-to spot in Vegas! Open late and the service is spot on! I come here with my friends everytime we're in town.   We go the Thai basil rice entree and we also got the boat noodle soup. you MUST get the noodle soup. Super delicious and you usually don't see this at any other Thai places.   I'll be back to try other things here. The food seems to be authentic and presentation is awesome. See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food. 1-10 spice rating is well done. Location is a little on the \"not when it's dark\" side but I did walk during the day. Normal selections across the board. Spicy Eggplant was tasty and egg rolls (5) a nice size but slightly oily. I wouldn't go out of my way to go but if it's convenient and I'm hungry for Thai, I'm walking in."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had. Called in to order and they never get anything right. It's so frustrating for customers when you have unprofessional staff who would just put down the phone without letting the customer know and start greeting dine in customers... At least let me know so I'm not talking to myself.  If you dine here you are supporting horrible business practice. Businesses like this should not be getting so high of a review."}
{"text":"Good Thai place, just a block off of the strip! Fast and friendly service!! Had the pineapple fried rice and boat noodle soup! The pineapple fried rice was okay, nothing too special but still good. The soup was very flavorful and surprisingly light.  Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Red curry is really good! Come for a lunch set, best value in Vegas. There is also complimentary wifi :)))"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I ordered food from here while at work. We work at a hotel on the Las Vegas strip and recommend this place all the time to guest because of word of mouth so we finally decided to check it our for ourselves. They have a huge selection of Thai and Chinese food to choose from. We all picked something from the Thai side of the menu and were very impressed! I got the Thai BBQ Chicken with fried rice. It was very flavorful and the dipping sauce really made the dish. The only thing I would've liked even more if they would have grilled it. My co-workers also enjoyed their food as well. I also got their Thai Tea which was so yummy! And their delivery was very fast."}
{"text":"I was originally planning on going to Lotus of Siam but they were closed for lunch. After looking at the reviews I decided to give Thai St Cafe a try. It's in a sketchy location, everything looks run down on the outside and it's surrounded by strip clubs.   When I walked in I pleasantly surprised to find a tendy modern interior.  I started with an order of Hoi Joi. It looked great on the menu but the flavor was rather bland and the whole dish was forgettable. I wish I had ordered a different starter.   For my main dish I ordered the Panang Curry which after the Hoi Joi was incredible and redeemed the place. The flavor was robust and hardy. There was a great amount of chicken and vegetables. I ordered a 3 out of 10 level spicy. I usually eat spicier but this was a nice even level for lunch, not too spicy but present.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great Thai food in a relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got delivery to Wynn and he made me walk to his car... That defeats the purpose of delivery why did they even ask for my room number ? Only got it because they were the only ones open"}
{"text":"Just a great little place. I work at a law firm a couple doors down and I ordered from this place the first time today. Absolutely phenomenal. I had the spring rolls (I know, unhealthy) and the pork panang curry. What a great flavor. Just enough spice as not to overwhelm.  The service was good and they deliver. I think this place may stick around in this building, which is rare."}
{"text":"The Red Curry is AMAZING!!! The waitress asked how spicy I wanted it on a scale of 1-10... I said 12 and they definitely came through. It was not only spicy, but VERY flavorful! The Pineapple Fried Rice is also AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We had our lunch with thai ice tea, pad see ew noodle, pineapple fried rice, fried fish, papaya salad and chicken curry for a big group. The first 4 items are good. Papaya salad is ok. Curry is little salty and sour. I gave a 4-star for this place."}
{"text":"It's 3AM, you're drunk and you're hungry. What do you do? You get Thai food or course, the best part? They deliver right to your hotel!  It was super easy, I order what I want thru yelp and about 30 mins they'll call and ask you to meet them in the lobby. They charge $5 for delivery but it's still cheaper then eating at your hotel.   We had yellow curry with chicken, Tom Yum Noodle Soup, Chicken Larb and Drunken Noodle. All the food we order was yummy. I don't really have anything to complain about.   They open til 4AM! I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"We were craving for Thai food and ended up here. Excellent food ! We ordered chow mein with chicken, panang curry with chicken, tom kha soup tofu, Thai ice tea and soft coconut. Loved each and every dish. Its a small restaurant with decent ambiance and it's very affordable.This will be my goto place for Thai food from now on."}
{"text":"Lovely Thai restaurant! Reasonable prices, awesome service! We had potstickers, basil fried rice, drunken noodles, Penang curry, green curry, Tom yum, glass noodle salad--all were fabulous! They taste fresh and vibrant! I'm a curry lover, and have tried a lot of Thai curries... these were great! Would definitely come back! Easy parking and access as well. Uber driver said he drops people here all of the time and it's his fave Thai spot!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Thai st and was VERY IMPRESSED!!! We had chicken pad Thai with shrimp level 5 spice ( going hotter next time ) spring rolls and orange chicken to stay on the safe side and it was all amazing!! We will def be exploring the menu on our next visit which will be in the near future. The service was also quick and excellent! Only complaint is they had Rhianna and dj males wild thoughts on repeat..... literally other than that it was great !!"}
{"text":"Food in Thai St restaurant is very delicious.All staff are very friendly.Their customer service is very good.We stayed two nights in Las Vegas.We enjoyed our lunch there.After we had tried all food we ordered, we decided to have our dinner there too.We did not even make any research to eat in different restaurants. As we had a show, we just ordered food as take away food.On the day, we were heading back to our home town,San Franscio,we stopped by at Thai St Restaurant again and enjoyed lunch again. We even had to go food too.As we had three times visit to there, they offered us some free drinks too.What a good customer service they have!! I am sure that I will dine there again whenever I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I came here with a group of friends after a club around 2 am or so. Make sure to try the Thai tea here. It's a good size and delicious! I had one of the soups here and it was just so delicious! The spice ranges from 1-10 so choose wisely! I would definitely come back! The staff here was super nice and very helpful!"}
{"text":"Food was great, only downside there was a hair in my rice and restaurant showed little to no empathy"}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins on a to go order still haven't gotten my food yet, decided to write a review. Not sure what's going on today. Finally got my food, took it home and turns out they cooked my Larb wrong. I'd ordered pork larb and I got beef larb, NASTY!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot to stop in for some delicious curry!  I had the Curry Puffs for an appetizer and could have eaten two orders for dinner, they are that tasty.  Then I ordered the Yellow Curry with Shrimp and still had food left over to take home.  Parking can be a challenge but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Must eat here! Need a break from pricey meals at the hotels? So delicious and worth the 4min cab ride!"}
{"text":"An undeniable lifesaver here in Vegas for those pre-clubbing dinners or post-EDM nights when you just want to get something inside of your belly.  Thai St. Cafe is located just off the northern end of the Strip, and delivers (literally) some excellent food to get those starchy goodness into your body. I've ordered delivery as well as pickup from them, and it is a LOT quicker to do pickup. My first time getting delivery from them ended up in a 50 minute wait. You can bet that we were pretty drunk by the time the food came.  Some of the delicious items we've ordered include: - Beef Larb (spicy and tangy, and comes in big portions) - Seafood Pad See Ew (can't go wrong with these flat noodles) - Chicken Red Curry (again, another winner!)  Each entree is around $10 depending on any added meats to the meal, making it an affordable dinner for you and your friends. I am getting hungry just thinking about them while listening to my electronic jams. If you are looking for a great place that is cheap and delicious, there really is no better place. Thank you Thai St. Cafe for making our Vegas nights so wonderful.  Oh, and if you come dine in, there is plenty of free parking and space for seating. Another plus!"}
{"text":"Good value. I tried yellow and red curry. Both were delicious. I would definitely go back next time I visit Vegas. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Went to this place after a loooonnngggg day at the Grand Canyon and was hungry! Our plates came out one by one which sucked because we couldn't all eat together at once. My plate came out last as my family was already halfway done. We were the only customers so no reason for our dishes to not come out all at once. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"This place was great. Perfect place to get away from the expensive chain restaurants on the strip. Affordable and flavorful with a friendly staff. I had the boat noodles and the Thai iced tea. I was very pleased."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Reasonably priced and next door to the nail shop. Perfect vombo"}
{"text":"Pad Thai and curry have great flavors. Know your tolerance for spicy. I tried number 3 and I was sweating. The portions can be small for the price. Overall, it is good to try authentic Thai food here."}
{"text":"Outside environment is sketchy as other Yelpers have noted.  It is in an outdoor strip mall that has a strip club, Thai massage, and a 24 hour attorney.  Broken glass and old cars were scattered in the parking lot.    Inside ambiance was good!  It was clean, modern, and well kept.  The food quality, prices, and service were good.  I would definitely come back in the daytime; definitely not at night."}
{"text":"Idk where all these high reviews are from, must be semi or fully intoxicated people. Pics included. I think these people are very fortunate that they're one of few Asian places open this late at night. I would NEVER come here again. Our first entree came out exactly 17 minutes before the rest. Tom yum soup was flavored straight from the packet with no extra seasonings. Yellow curry was sugary sweet even though I specifically asked if it was sweet or not, was told no. Hoi jor or whatever it's called had odd texture to the wrapping. We almost walked out bc our food took so long. Asked to send back yellow sugar curry, but their cheap , shady mgr or owner perhaps, refused. You can go through my other reviews, I have never laid into an establishment enough to call them cheap or shady but this place is horrible unless you're as drunken as the noodles on the menu. I've also maybe one other time in my left not left a tip, this makes two. In 37 years. Came in with two starving teenagers, this is how much food we had left on our plates. Actually, nm, I felt bad and gave a tip after all, its not the poor waitress' fault the food sucks."}
{"text":"The place is a little hard to notice. But the food was amazing it reminded me of bangkok. We had the tom yum soup. Chicken pad Thai and green curry. The curry base was so creamy it was amazing  the pad Thai had a lot of chicken with made it worth it!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Chicken wings were terrific (and spicy) and spicy basil chicken off lunch menu was fantastic! The Thai iced tea was some of the best I've had and the sticky mango rice was incredible! One of my new favorite go to places for food in Vegas. It's off the strip and probably not the best walking around neighborhood, but the food and decor inside (as well as the staff) are awesome!"}
{"text":"Thai St was good, not exceptional like I was hoping for....... The location is very sketchy!!!! Once inside, the decor and atmosphere are very nice.  We started with the Beef Jerky Appetizer. Not my fav! I should have known by the name \"beef jerky\" the meat would be tough and overcooked. The Crab Fried Rice was really good, light and fluffy, perfect! The Beef Noodle Soup was okay..... the broth was great! The noodles were good, but the meat was tough, full of grizzle, pretty much inedible. The Shrimp Pad Thai was good, nothing spectacular.  All in all..... difficult to rate for me..... the misses were BAD! But the hits were GOOD! I will come back again if in the neighborhood, but not sure if this neighborhood is where I will be."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai with shrimp was great! Very impressed with the pot stickers too' best I've ever had. Clean environment"}
{"text":"Not too far from strip and yet prices are reasonable :) Fast service & good food. FYI: the Tom yum noodle soup has FISH balls NOT PORK as the menu says. Waitress let us change the soup when we discovered this and was nice about it. The Khao soi soup is delicious (curry base)! Beware though- we asked for level 2 spiciness and that already had a good kick for someone who does not really do spicy (my mom was still able to manage though). The regular menu options(anything not on the lunch menu) are definitely for sharing (2 ppl... honestly even 3 if you are getting more than just one thing). Will be coming here again on out next visit. Yum."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but pretty spicy!  On a scale of 0 to 10, I asked for a 2 on the papaya salad and it was too hot for me.  Raw Thai chili peppers!  But a 2 on the Drunken Noodle had just the right kick.  The Tom Kha soup with seafood was phenomenal, and enough for 4 people easily!  Good thing since I couldn't eat the salad.  It was packed with delicious seafood and the mussels were really good.  We liked this place so much we went back again the next night.  It's cheap and delicious!  I see some reviews complaining about the service.  Well go someplace else if you're looking for a \"dining experience.\"  If you want some good food when you're tired and hungry, with authentic seasoning, check this place out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice. No TVs. That would be good. Oh, they weren't on. The food is really good. Good portions. Took quite a while to get the food but worth it. Decent prices."}
{"text":"I'm often weary of take out restaurants but today I found a hidden gem!! Everything we ordered was fantastic!! I ordered the Green Curry w/ Chicken and my girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai. Warning     if you are sensitive to spice stay VERY low on the spice scale!! It's a 1-10 with 1 at a NON spicy level but be warned we each ordered 2 and 3 respectively and our dishes were what I considered to be hot. I couldn't imagine above a 5.  Overall excellent dishes! Authentic, Flavorful, and presented well."}
{"text":"This place has always been my favorite Thai cafe. I love the pad-thai-see'ew and add beef! Soo yummy with the veggies in it! And can't forget i always get great service every time i go!"}
{"text":"I have uploaded the pics of the rice already. I ordered a delivery for lunch with a side of brown rice ($2.95). The rice I received didn't even fill the half the small box container they sent in. It was less than the rice they include in the meal! Come on! Don't cut corners!! I've been a good customer - I've probably brought you some new loyal customers to the seedy part of neighborhood because I thought your restaurant was good, honest and not like other big restaurants that sell Thai tea for $5. You guys sell lunch specials for $8 for crying out loud and you charge me almost $3 for a half of cup of brown rice?"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My friend and I ordered the tom kha, crab rangoon, panang curry and pad see ew.  Tom kha was loaded with chicken and mushrooms and had a very flavorful and coconutty taste but was not overpowering. Crab rangoon had juuuuust the right amount of cream cheese.  It was a bit on the softer side so not too crispy which worked very well for our taste buds.  The curry was very creamy and coconutty which again I absolutely loved.  Pad see ew had loads of flavor and was a bit on the sweeter side compared to other thai restaurants I've tried.  We ended the meal with a complimentary roti.  It was a 4.5/5 for me on the food but the friendly staff, cozy ambience and awesome music selection really made the dining experience absolutely wonderful.  Highly recommended to thai lovers, I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you want watered down American toned down Thai food.  This place is full blast, full flavor, authentic Thai. One of the best Thai food places I've been to.  And I have been to he best of them on 4 continents. Don't let the neighborhood intimidate .  Once inside its a Thai food sanctuary . Decor is Modern Americana meets Thailand. Staff is friendly and efficient. Must go to in Vegas."}
{"text":"ODelicious! Reasonably priced and close to the strip! Looking forward to ordering delivery to my room next time!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and excellent food! It's a clean establishment and love the selection! Definitely bringing the whole family here next time!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I really do. They're close and I order delivery from time to time and they've messed up my order a few times but when I ordered today I felt like it was taking longer than usual so I went out to walk my dog and I found my food sitting in a dirty corner of the stairs near my apartment building. I live in a gated complex and put special instructions for them to call at the gate and they normally do! I received no calls of any kind and the thing that makes no sense is it was in my complex! I have my apartment number on the form, they could've just brought it to my door!"}
{"text":"This is for the delivery service on 07/23/2016.   I had a long day at EBC and stumbled back to my room with my friends. I woke up starving and did not want to leave the comforts of the Encore. I was browsing yelp and really wanted some soup and some greasy food to satisfy my hunger. This place wasn't far at all and they also delivered. I gave it a shot and ordered everything through yelp. It was the quickest and most painless way to order. I had never had such an easy experience ordering.  The review gets better! I was expecting the food to be ready in about an hour or more, but within 40 minutes I got a call saying they were ready with the food by the elevator. I totally didn't expect it to be done that quick, let alone waiting for me downstairs. The food filled a void that made my inner child jump for joy and smile from ear to ear with glee. The soup was hot and delicious, the appetizers were crispy and tasty, the main course was perfectly cooked and seasoned. There were no complaints even if I had a bad day and a hidden agenda from here. Honestly, how could you? The food was amazing and the service is second to none.   I ordered pretty basic items, but that's all I needed. The whole time while receiving the delivery and eating it, I was in awe of how easy it all was. The ordering was simple and quick. The delivery was fast and courteous. The food was good for a hungry, half hungover, lazy sob. The next time I'm in this situation, I would gladly rinse and repeat everything I done this day. I would give more stars if I could, but only 5 available, but they deserve each and every one of them. I told this story a few times, and I hope more hear about it and follow."}
{"text":"The absolute best pot stickers. I had the beef pad see ew and it was perfect. I got 8 out of 10 spicy and it was exactly that. My date got the beef fried rice and it was pretty good too. First time I've ever eaten all my noodles in one sitting. Don't mind the sketchie as fuck clubs next door."}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant for their dumplings, rolls and pad Thai.   The seafood soup I got was good but it was lacking in seafood and was also missing the mussels it was supposed to have.   The appetizer I really wanted which involved crab was \"out\" according to our server. This made me disappointed to start but then I found other items to try.   I couldn't finish the soup but the flavors were good and took the rest back to the hotel. They also let you pick your spice level which was nice.   The big gripe is they kept my credit card and I had to travel back to get it. The other concerning part is the had others in a stack. Seemed odd there would be that many."}
{"text":"First of all, the location is very misleading; it is between various adult superstores and such. The parking lot is quite small, with only a handful of public parking stalls. The rest are for the surrounding stores.  At first glance, the interior looks and feels contemporary and fresh. There are metal and wood finishes that are not too industrial-looking. My visit here was just okay and I will explain. The dining room sits many people, with booths along the walls and tables dispersed around the space. Despite the abundance of seats, there seemed to be just a couple of servers. I arrived for lunch in a party of 10. Understandably, the food was not expected to arrive quickly. We waited, however, almost an hour for the first dish to arrive. And slowly, one by one we all got our dishes.  If not for the slow service, I would have rated this place 5 stars. The food is very delicious. I got the boat noodle soup, which was very flavorful and hearty. I also got the crab fried rice, which tasted just as I expected. My friends ordered thai iced tea and if you are a fan, you will love their portion size!  I don't think I will be dining in here again. They do have delivery service, so if you are on a lunch break, you might want to look into that instead."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.  It was super fast even though they'd said it would be an hour,  it got there in under 20 min.  I ordered the pan see we and everything came mushed up together.  I think because they put it in the container streaming.  Since that isn't there fault,  they had to deliver it i would still give it another try but eat in.  The flavor wasnt exceptional but not bad either."}
{"text":"The food was amazing ... !!im just really disappointed in the portions...and with all the thai places i can go to in this city for that reason i will not becoming here again ... I hate goin to places that dont give enough to fill u up ... I dont care if the dish cost lil but more just give me a monster portion that will fill me not lil super small to go tray :'( this seriously breaks the deal sorry ... But ill go else where from now  ...theres places that about same price were u get more and that are just as good if not better ..."}
{"text":"First off, this place is located next to strip clubs, behind the Las Vegas Strip - so when my beloved Siri told me to take a turn into this plaza, I was almost about to take a U-turn.   But...this place has raging reviews & was the only thai that is open until 4 am (...and now we know why ;)) so I set aside my differences and went inside.   TOTALLY different vibe inside. Wooden tables, artistic decorations, clean bathrooms and  FAMILIES sitting inside enjoying their meal. My sister and I ended up ordering the following:   1. Crab Rangoons *appetizer* This came in an order of 6...and it was pretty on par with other thai restaurants. Nothing too extravagant, and definitely nothing that made you turn back and wish you never looked again.  2. Papaya Salad  This type of salad is my MAIN. Shredded green papaya, green beans, little dried shrimp, and peanuts PLUS spice level 7.....mmmmm good. However, some of the shrimp were WAY too dried, and during one bite, I thought for some odd reason I was chewing a stone. I hope I didn't lose a filling, but here's to hoping I never have to find out.  3. Pad See Ew  My sister ordered this dish but with fried tofu - as stated earlier, it was on par (my sister likes her spice to be as low as possible, so this didn't have the thai flavor I usually crave) - but I'll blame that on my sister's taste buds and not on the restaurant.    Overall, pretty damn good place. There's a lot more I'd like to come back and try - preferably during daylight hours, but it puts my heart to ease knowing that I can come in at 3 am and still be given good service & food."}
{"text":"The new thai place in town is doing a lot of things right!    Admittedly, I order Thai weekly...Sunday night is thai food + catch up on work time, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  I usually go for Original Thai BBQ or Thai Pepper when I need delivery, because Komol doesn't deliver (major bummer), but neither of those places (Komol excluded) tastes super fresh or healthy.  Thai Street Cafe tastes like the food is fresh and somewhat healthy (as much as thai food can be anyway).  I've had: the pad thai (yum!), the Tom Kha (AWESOME), the papaya salad (spicy!) and a few other things.  Everything has been great so far.  Oh, and if you are the kind of person that has any gut issues...this is one of the few Thai places that doesn't make my b/f's tummy rumble afterwards.    One more thing - we had a gluten-free guest in town and they made the pad thai sans gluten for her all special-like.  NICE!"}
{"text":"I love this place never had a bad experience here. I have dined in at 2am and call for take out all the time. It's always good and they have always been friendly."}
{"text":"Wow!! Excellent Thai food! We ordered the orange chicken and pad see-ew which came with rice. It was quality and affordable food for late night! The orange chicken was crispy and the flavoring was great, had a nice tang to it. The pad see ew was cooked to perfection. The chicken was savory and fresh, the noodles were delicious and the egg was savory. Great late night, open til 4 am!!"}
{"text":"Traveled 8 long hours and had to make a quick pit stop in Vegas for Thai St. Cafe. We were recommended by a friend and decided to give it a try, what a great choice- it was mouthwatering!!!However choose your spice wisely, their medium (5) is very spicy but bomb! I would definitely make the drive to Vegas for their Thai food"}
{"text":"The taste of the food are still good...which I guess is a good thing.. But I noticed the portion has gotten smaller.  I always order their thai style chicken wings which are really spicy but I like it. There used to be 7 fairly sized wings, but lately there are only six and the size has gotten a bit smaller..   Most of this update is for the service though. Servers are really nice and friendly but has become super slow. It wasn't like this before. I guess because they're getting busier and busier lately. I come here on my lunch time at work I'd say about 3-4 times a week. Lately, they take about 20-25 minutes to serve my food. They don't offer refills unless I wave one of them down. One time I had to go up to the cashier to ask for extra napkins.   I will still come here as I really like the food. but not on my lunch breaks anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm so glad that I was craving curry tonight and happened to stumble upon this new place on yelp. So we decided to give it a try. Despite of the location, the food was AH-MAY-ZING! & to top it off, our server was great (although I forgot his name).   Try out their thai beef jerry as appetizer.  Tom kha soup cause its on top of a hot portable stove. [Which is pretty cool & taste good]  Panang curry, cause only a few can make that dish right & they definitely got it in the bag.  & for dessert, how can anyone not get mango sticky rice :D   Definitely coming back for drunken noodles & the rest of their menu haha. Good after-shopping-food since it's next to fashion show mall."}
{"text":"This is not Lotus of Siam. If you want authentic Thai you need to look elsewhere. If you want fairly priced Americanized Thai food served promptly, in a location that is very clean and pleasant on the inside you'll find that here.   Parking: It's in a strip mall off Industrial. It fills up fast so parking in front may be an issue. If it's daytime it's ok to park around back or find a space further away. But if it's after dark...and you don't find parking up front many of you may want to find somewhere else to go.   3 Stars. It's good, but not great. Rather than write a long winded review I'll just say many of the other reviews are spot on in regards to how good their food is."}
{"text":"Very good late night spot. If you're looking for Thai food before 4am really late than this is a good little spot to get your fix. Would definitely recommend.  The place is clean and good ambience."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, and great Thai iced tea but the food was ultra oily and don't order \"meat.\""}
{"text":"Probably four stars, but it is late and my husband and I are hungry. Service is good. Food also good. Had drunken noodles and pad Thai noodles. Fried calamari was also good. Will come back to see if the fourth star is deserved."}
{"text":"Fast and easy food to pick up if you're near the strip.   There wasn't really anyone there when I arrived, granted it was an off time. The food was fresh and they provide all the sauces when you order to go!"}
{"text":"This place is really good!! I ordered food here around 12am on yelp eat24 & it was done within an appropriate time.  I got the eggplant, pad thai, & yellow curry. Also got a free thai tea b/c I ordered $25+.  The eggplant is really tasty & has a great sauce. You can order what protein you'd like it to come with, I chose the tofu which was fried tofu but very good!  The pad thai is good & sweet. Nothing extraordinary about it though.  Yellow curry was great as well, I got chicken & it came with bits of potato & carrots. The rice that came with the yellow curry seemed like sticky rice, which was bomb.  Thai tea is on point! Make sure to check the coupon section if u order on yelp eat24 to get a free thai tea.   The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because  1.) the location is helluh sketchy!! It's on industrial which is where a lot of entertainer building are at. I pasted the place at first & when I got to the building it was very close to an entertainer club. Lots of sketchy people around there.  2.) the portions from take out seemed kind of small. Other thai or asian places I order from use the same containers but pack it to the brim. They didn't pack the food to the top :( but nonetheless I still got into a food coma from the tasty food :)   overall, would recommend 8/10. but maybe go during the day? :-)"}
{"text":"This place is in a bit of a shady part of Vegas, but don't let the exterior fool you. Inside the decor is simple but nice and very clean.   The service is good, our waiter was friendly and he explained some of the dishes and drinks. Thank you Julio for the great service.  Now to the food. Having eaten at many different Thai places I tend to judge them by their Tom Kha Gai soup, let me tell you it was amazing. My husband got the duck curry and my daughter the chicken teriyaki and they were also very good.  I highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great prices.   Tom Kah is good. Thai tea is good . Pad thai is okay ."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive authentic Thai food.  Definitely one of the beat kept local secret that is just 0.7 mile from the Fashion Show mall.  The food are awesome, the staff are attentive and friendly.   Opening from 11am - 4am next day is super convenient for typical late night Strip walker."}
{"text":"The egg rolls were a little on the soggy side. We ordered spicy fried rice (10/10), but it lacked spice. The portions were on the small side for the price we were charged. However, we went back to try their desserts and would highly recommend both fried banana w/ice cream and mango with sticky rice!"}
{"text":"I am so sad... I live in CA and won't get to eat this weekly like I want to. Oh em gee. On our trip to Vegas, my boyfriend and I ended up taking a Lyft two different nights to get some great dinner. Food is amazing and authentic with good service. We tried the chicken satay which was so juicy and flavorful, dumplings, chow mein and crab fried rice which was beyond delicious. I'll be dreaming about it in my sleep! There is so much egg and fresh crab with stir fried onions making it the most flavorful and moist fried rice I've ever had. Don't miss this hidden gem in a strip mall... amongst strip clubs lol It's so good."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new Thai restaurant. And came across this café. It's super cute inside. But it wasn't very busy. The service was really good our server was really sweet. The food options are like your typical Thai places. Tom Yum soup, Different types of curry, noodles and your rice dishes... I ordered the Tom Yum soup at a 3 and Damn that thing was spicy, but it was good even though it was burning my mouth I couldn't stop eating it.  I also ordered the Panang curry. It was a bit too sweet for me. The tilapia also really good, it was fried to a crisp with a sweet and sour garlicky sauce on top. As for the Beef salad it was just okay.... I've had better."}
{"text":"Experienced this place for the first time last night thanks to the recommendation of my friends. We ordered Tom yum soup, pineapple fried rice, and drunken noodles (which is my personal obsession for thai). Everything that we ate definitely exceeded any expectations and even set the new \"bar of expectations\" when it comes to Thai food.   And yes, it shares the same complex with a stripper store so it seems sketchy... but I promise you the sketched out environment is worth it lol. Just don't look anyone in the eye. No I'm kidding."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch the other day as Lotus of Siam is still under a remodel...  Despite in a seedy area, both the food and service were great!  Started off with the crab rolls which were delicious! Generous portions and quite meaty!  Moved on to the Drunken noodle with pork which was also delicious. Flavorful and generous portions! Pork wasn't too dry either!   The Thai Iced Tea was huge! A tad on the sweeter side and quite creamy!  ... definitely a hidden gem as others have mentioned!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Vegas. Great food, cheap prices, good vibe and music. First class sriously. Close by parking can bring your own beer/win they don't have licence yet I guess."}
{"text":"UNEXPECTED FINDING   I got task to find a good Thai lunch spot by my group. Browsing around Yelp, I came through this restaurant. It seems it's a decent place, so I sent info to everybody. We were all heading there ASAP because we were starving.  Upon arrival, we were surprised to find that the restaurant is located at the same row as Showgirl Supplies, 100 percent entertainment, Las Vegas Bikinis and liquor store (?)   PARKING: FREE, limited parking, quiet area ENTRANCE: a bit confusing because they have 2 (two) entrance doors but only 1 (one) works  INSIDE: surprisingly, inside is very modern, clean, organized with warm wood touch color and bamboo. Communal dining tables dominate the room.  RESTROOM: 1 (one) for each gender. Clean organized with supplies  DRINKS: The Thai Ice Tea and Thai Coffee comes as twice the size of your regular cup, shareable.  FOODS: ###Yellow Curry: a bit bland, not too much meats ###Red Curry: better taste than Yellow Curry, more meats ###Tom Yam Soup: a bit flavorless ###Pad Thai: taste good, mediocre presentation ###Egg Rolls: crispy, taste delicious  SERVICE: fast, friendly, helpful  This is a good spot for quick lunch."}
{"text":"We ordered drunken noodles and basil fried rice. Food was good. Service was little bit late but the taste was good though!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and the service was excellent. The portions look small but are very filling and lots of flavor. I love the decor and atmosphere to just get food and hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"The food came cold and extremely salty and bitter. And the entire Order was small. I got fucking ripped off. This is why people don't tip restaurants that charge a delivery fee of $5; yes $5 just to drive 2 miles. Terrible food"}
{"text":"Ate here with my boyfriend sometime last week...such a great place to eat!  The smells of delicious food linger in the air right when you enter the restaurant. We were very impressed with how good the pad see ew was with the shrimp. The shrimp looked healthy and not all dingy like some places. Got that dish in a 6 which was the perfect level of spiciness for us! Will come pack again!!! + the thai tea wasn't bad either!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered off \"Uber Eats\" I was very impressed with order to delivery time. It took 33 minutes from the time I ordered to the time it hit our home.  My husband ordered the Drunken Noodles and it was ok. Not overly oily which is nice. He ordered a \"6\" spiciness and it was more like a 3.  My children ordered the yellow curry with chicken at a \"3\" for spiciness. It was quite mild. I wish we would have ordered double the meat because there was not much.  I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken at \"6\" Again I didn't think it was spicy at all and wish I had added double meat or veggies. It was tasty but just kind of lacking something.  I also would Recommend ordering extra rice as we ran out but had tons of extra sauce."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai spots in town! The strip mall it's in is certainly a bit seedy but the food and service is excellent and the restaurant is very clean! My favorite is the drunken noodles, sub the mushrooms for bean sprouts! Girlfriend enjoys the pad Thai as well, would recommend"}
{"text":"They have great food and good lunch specials. My favorite dish is the Spicy Basil Chicken either in the special or as an entrée.  Friendly staff that remembers you!"}
{"text":"Ok, idk where to start. This might just be my longest review!  Ambiance was comfortable. It was beautiful...inside. Outside, not so much. It's right next door to the Can Can Room. So if you get hungry after watching some naked ladies, you can always walk over to grab some Thai food.   The music they were playing was a nice tone. Had to Shazam it cus it was cute. Top charted songs sang in acoustic by Sabrina. Mellowed out the mood, I like it.   Now, my friends wanted beer. The girl at the register told us that if we wanted some alcohol we would have to buy some next door at XO liquor. So the boys got up and went to grab beer. lol. That's cool of her to tell us. Business buds?   Anyway, the girl took our order. We got nervous cus we ordered a lot and she didn't write anything down. We expected her to forget something....and she did. B+ effort for her trying to play it off and telling us she was going to check on it. Hah.   Ok, let's get serious.  You have two huge foodies and a guy who knows 99% of the las vegas restaurant businesses that's tried everything walk in. (He owns a hood cleaning business.)  We all have high expectations, and were serious about eating. lol. We were hungry! Ok...  Ro Ti - YUM! Friend got their first and said it took about 20mins to get. By the time we got there, the ro ti got to the table. It was the best thing we ate there... 20 mins was worth it? Inhaled it in 2 mins. Friend only got it cus it was the cheapest thing. lol. $4.  We finally ordered everything else.   Calamari - Not too bad. I felt like I bit into air for the most part. It's very light, and it was battered ok, but when you bite into it, the calamari was teeny tiny. Since they were all teeny tiny, we had a small hill of battered up small pieces of calamari. At one point I bit into a hard piece where I thought my tooth cracked. I spit that out quick. The sauce it came with was good though! About $8.  Beef Jerky - I actually liked this plate. The sauce made it much much better. Not too hard to chew, just right. It's beef jerky... This was about $8.   Crab Rangoon - All it had was cream cheese. yeah...Not a fan of this, and I love crab rangoons! To be honest, the comment that Panda Express had more taste to their rangoons was said. I think this was about $8.  Boat Noodle Soup - This was a friends entrée. We all shared though. I felt like he had the most generous amount in this entree bowl. Lots of noodles and lots of beef. It was WAY sweet. Beef was pretty good and tender though and the noodles were yummy, but the broth it was in tasted too sweet. $11.  Beef Panang - This was my main entrée. Large bowl with an okay amount of meat. This, I believed was good for the buck. About $9 + Beef $1. Came with rice. Only thing about this plate was that it was sweet too. The waitress didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it. I thought to myself that maybe they had their way of making it. Gave it a shot, and I was not the happiest. I've had a lot of beef panang in my life, and I was sad that this didn't have spice to it at all.   Tom Yum Combination - Ok, this was my friends entrée. He had HIGH expectations for this one. It's one of his most favorite dishes. Again, too sweet! He said there wasn't much in the pot. There were 3 mussels, and the rest were tiny pieces of  seafood chunks. He usually likes everything spicy, but again, we thought they made it a certain way and thought it was the reason the girl didn't ask. $9 + Seafood combination for $4.   Pad Thai - This was the plate that the girl didn't get in our first order. We had to call her again to ask about it. My friend was really hungry so he got a second entrée on top of his tom yum. Which he knew it was going to be not enough. AGAIN, this was sweet. It was actually the sweetest thing we got. I felt like I put some sugar in my mouth. I couldn't eat too much of it just cus I felt like it was a dessert.  $9 + Combination $3.    I was a bit disappointed with the food we got. I feel like someone had a sweet tooth that night in the back and made everything too sweet. Not one plate had a spicy kick to it at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a super spicy fan, but just a kick of it is what I like. I honestly came to try the mango and sticky rice dessert, but I realized it isn't mango season and didn't get it.   This was the first time my friends and I didn't finish any of our plates, well, except the ro ti. Which was comped by the owner because I posted a pic on Yelp right away. THANKS! He called the server to do it. We didn't  take anything to-go. I do give places chances again, so I'm not going to say I wont come back. Maybe it was just bad timing. It was late in the night.    Ratings: Ambiance: A+  Design: A (The lighting to take pics of food is superb! Every time you moved around on the booth, it sounded like a fart. haha.) Service: C+ (She forgot one entrée and my friend who got there first said his ro ti took 20 mins to come out.)  Food: C (a-ok) Pricing: C+ ."}
{"text":"My basil chicken was really good! I gave it 4/5 because of the location. I didn't feel safe. When I walked out to my car there were two strippers/hookers next door with what appeared to be their pimps. Oh I think there's a strip club next door."}
{"text":"I come to Thai st every time I visit Vegas. However, it seems like the quality of their food have slowly been decreasing. Sometimes, the food come out a little colder than usual. Nonetheless, the food are still not bad. Give it a try if you're into Thai food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nestled between gentleman clubs.  We ordered the crab rangoon and egg rolls which had a good crunch as any fried food should and was the best part of the meal.  For my entree I ordered a shrimp pad Thai which was a good portion size. I had asked the shrimp to be cooked well-done as I sometimes have allergy issues to shellfish. It was definitely cooked well done but had a very distinct burnt smell not only in the shrimp but throughout the noodles. It was almost as if I was having smoked shrimp pad Thai which wasn't too tasty. Overall it was just an average experience."}
{"text":"My first time here & I will definitely be coming back...especially since they are open til 4am! My boyfriend really enjoyed his pad Thai & we both agree that the mango sticky rice is THE BEST in Las Vegas (please see photo). Overall the food was good, but the service was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"i had a client in vegas request something healthy to eat (at like 1230am) and after a little searching on line i found these guys. Not only do they offer late hours of operations (i think they close at like 4am) but the food is quite tasty too :-)"}
{"text":"We previously visited this restaurant and had a good experience, but this visit was the complete opposite. We came with a party of 8 and got a table pretty quickly, but it took 10 mins to get menus. It took another 20 mins to get water to the table. The food got mixed reviews. The red curry and pad see ew was good, but the pad thai was bitter and the orange chicken tasted like straight lemon. Our server did not keep up with our drinks and was difficult to track down. When asked to switch a pad Thai for yellow curry they were quick to oblige, but brought red curry instead. It was good, but not what was ordered. The overall experience took an extremely long time for subpar food. Since 18% gratuity was already included because of our party size, we were put as their last priority. This is frustrating because the server did not earn his tip. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I stayed at The Wynn this past weekend and was crazing Thai food late at night. I love that they stay open until 4am and deliver. They do not deliver to your room though, I had to go and meet the driver in the valet area, which wasn't a big deal. The food was really good. My only complaint was the tofu. It was subpar, by everything else was delicious. The online ordering process was simple and user friendly and the delivery driver was nice. My food arrived much earlier than I thought it would. I would definitely eat here again and recommend it."}
{"text":"If anyone is looking for a late night Thai food, this is the spot! My boyfriend and I were craving Thai late night around 2am and found this spot and I'm so glad we did, we can't stop returning back! The only downfall is the location, next to adult super stores and strip clubs but the food and the price makes up for it. You get a fairly large portion for under $10 and every dish is flavorful. Honey has been our server a couple of times and she's great! So far one of my favorite Thai place in Vegas."}
{"text":"We loved the food but been feeling sick with stomach pain after 2,5 hours and having diarrhea would appreciate if manager would get back to us regarding this."}
{"text":"The Yen ta fo came out perfect, didn't need to add more spicy or anything. This place is open until 4am!"}
{"text":"I ate twice at this restaurant this week and although the food is still good, the quality of the table service has declined significantly. On my first visit I never got a napkin (yes, I could have asked for one but it wasn't a big deal, and I don't think that the waitress came back after I got my food), and on my second visit, last Sunday both waitresses seemed to be pretty unfriendly. The word 'bitchy' comes to mind. There was no one specific action, but each communication I had with them was never polluted by a smile, and their thanks when I left seemed to be completely insincere. I'll keep eating here for now, but the ownership needs to step up their game. The restaurant seating area has expanded by probably 50%, so I imagine that they are doing well. They need to employ competent, personable wait staff or they will lose the ground which they have gained."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas this past week and this was the last place I ate at before I came back home.  Delicious!!    This place was very close to the Trump Tower where my friends and I stayed.  Had I known that earlier I'd be having most of my meals here!   Location is nestled in a strip mall on industrial way.  If you're not careful, you will miss it.  At first I was like, \"Why are we going to the Adult sex stores?\" ... I want food, not toys!    Place: Clean and light.  Modern furniture. Clean bathroom (So important).   Food: Yummy!  Spice levels from 1-10.  I got the boat noodle with a level 7 spicy and extra chili on the side.  I also got the wings with a level 8 spicy.  Both dishes were delicious.  My girlfriend got the Drunken noodles and the egg rolls (no meat in these egg rolls).  She swears both were yum!    Service:  Was good.  Sweet young little girls.  Very nice and attentive.  Place was not very busy when we arrived (off hours).    Yes I'll be returning to this place on my Vegas visits.  This is my 2nd favorite Thai place! Woot woot!"}
{"text":"Quit looking through Yelp and eat here now. Truly fantastic some of the best Thai food I've had in my life. Cheap price, excellent wait service, clean, fantastic inner decor. Located next to the strip clubs in a sleazy Shopping Center. Going inside it looks like a high end coffee shop. Thank you Yelp for finding this wonderful gem. Perfect food."}
{"text":"The food is good-to-okay, but for the area, you can do much better Thai.  The best thing about this place is that you're probably not going to wait very long as opposed to other Thai in the area.  The service, however, is horrible.  The servers definitely need some kind of training.    Example:  At a table of 6, the server brought out two curries--no SPOONS or silverware of any kind.  Seriously 10 minutes later the curries were still there.  Other diners were food-less and the curry lovers were still spoon-less.  One of our six, in desperation, went to the front counter and asked for a spoon.  They gave her ONE spoon!  For good measure, they made sure it was GIANT!  So now you've got two curry lovers, one giant spoon, and six dumbfounded diners.  There were multiple tables in the joint that all seemed to be experiencing some kind of frustration with the service."}
{"text":"Ordered two dishes:  1) Drunken Noodle (spicy level 1) w/Tofu: They use the same flat & wide noodles that you can find in Pad See Ew but much more flavorful than Pad See Ew. 2) Crab Fried Rice: Expensive but for good reason.  They use real crab meat and I thought it complemented the noodle dish perfectly.  The reason why I gave this restaurant a 4-star rating is because the service was very slow.  They only employed one person for the entire restaurant during lunch and while he was nice, he was stretched too thinly and I felt sorry for him.    I'd also recommend not coming here with kids as it's located in a plaza with a lot of adult-themed stores.  The location is very bizarre, indeed, but definitely a hidden gem just off the strip."}
{"text":"Great food. My mom and i were looking for somehing good not on the strip and stumbled on this place. great customer service! Everything they recommended was great! plus they are open late and deliver! #WINNING"}
{"text":"2.5*. I really hate to leave a negative review, but honestly, the best thing here is the Thai iced tea (huge and delicious). The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the menus have pictures of everything (which is kinda cool since some places make the same dish in different ways). I tried the ground chili chicken as well as the beef and it was just bad, unfortunately. I bit into gristle on the second bite and couldn't have any more. There were string beans in the dishes that didn't go with the flavor, in my opinion. The worse part is that they didn't ask about our spice preference. The dish is supposed to be spicy in of itself, so I didn't really even think of it until I saw that it was ridiculously mild. Hot sauce wouldn't have fixed it. I took it to go for my husband, but even he ended up tossing it. The curry puffs, which I was excited to see on the menu, had a good crust, but the filling was terrible. Mostly tasted like mashed sweet potato. Way too sweet, no chicken to speak of and any curry flavor was masked by all the sweetness. The spring rolls were crispy but reminded me of the frozen ones from the grocery store. They had that odd, mushy interior and the flavor wasn't great. I don't think I'd go back here, sad to say."}
{"text":"Khao soiiiiiiii!!! Been searching for a spot that compares to the khao soi I had in Chiang Mai! None came close, but this place is probably the most tasty I've tried yet.   When you try Thai food in its motherland, it's pretty difficult to find a place that satisfies your Thai tooth here in America! I don't know if it's nostalgia, or the craving for authenticity that draws me into Thai spices...other than the pure fact that Thai spice is inherently addicting to my existence! When youve had an amazing sexy bowl of khao soi in northern Thailand, you're hooked! And there's not many places that serve that heart warming noodle dish!   Thai st cafe comes close! I'm all about the drumstick to maintain authenticity and of course the flavorful broth! This joint meets the standard! Pretty yummy! I actually cannot stop thinking about how it made me feel every time that spoon and chopstick of goodness entered my mouth!   What I will dock off a star for is an unfortunate matter! MANGO STICKY RICE! I'm the largest fan of withholding the coconut milk! Just too much sweetness! The sweetness and sticky ness of the rice is more than enough. Butttt...I asked for the coconut milk on the side, and it came out drenched  and the sever insisted that it's for flavor! So I politely asked for just the sticky rice and mango. An unbelievably disappointing event happened after that! The rice was hard as a rock! And had zero flavor! I see why they drench it in coconut milk. I couldn't even enjoy it and it truly bummed me out!   In conclusion, no mango sticky rice to be enjoyed for me at this establishment, but I will come Back for that khao soi!"}
{"text":"Wonderful.... I had a level 7 and it was just right if you enjoy a nice kick .... pad see ew and Thai rice ... don't miss this place"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery tonight at 8pm and prepaid. At nearly 10pm the delivery driver finally calls and says he'll be there in 15-20. So, my food was cooked 2 hours ago and rolling around in the back of someone's car ? No thank you. Terrible customer service too the guy lied and said he just left the restaurant.. even though when I called an hour ago they said the delivery guy was out with it. I've called 5x requesting the refund and each time they hang up"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and we were not disappointed. Pad Thai was just right. Curry puffs and egg rolls were delicious as well. In kind of a sketchy area but the decor was nice inside and service was very attentive. Enjoy..... We did"}
{"text":"diamond in the rough, but I'm glad I found it! I'm still actually not quite sure where it is but I do know I'm coming back. I did a carry out order but when I picked up my food the atmosphere was pretty shibby. The best basil fried rice I've ever had."}
{"text":"I order ot UberEATS. It took around 25mins. I think is acceptable. Food come fast and good portion. I will try to dine in next time."}
{"text":"When bringing your kids here, blindfold them prior to entering the strip mall. This is located near a bunch of strip clubs and burlesque stores. The restaurant itself is very nice, spacious and clean.   My party ordered a bunch of everything: both the papaya salad and glass noodle salads were great. Beef jerky strips were good. Pad-see-ew and pad Thai were decent. I didn't especially like any of the soups or fried rices we ordered. Green curry was a pass for me. The mango sticky rice would've been fine had the mangos been sweet instead of crazy sour. Young coconuts and Thai ice tea were excellent. Overall, food was okay for me.   The service was really slow that night. Our dessert and check took some time to come out."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food but not as authentic as it could be for example the Tom yam here is quite different from the original Thai Tom yam, however the waitress is really friendly and helpful also, the restaurant is nice looking and clean with parking lots in front of it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm with a group of 11 people. We had to split into two groups, at two separate tables since we didn't want to wait for one big table, and that's fine. It looked like it wasn't to busy, but almost all the tables were packed.  Food: OMG... Don't get the spicy food here. It was so spicy and my family and I eat spicy. They will ask you how hot you want it from a 1-10 scale, w/o warning you how spicy 10 is. We ordered the drunken noodles with chicken at a level 8, thai basil at a level 8 as well and both were so spicy for all of us, we could not eat more than three bites with rice. It The only good dish that we were able to eat was the yellow curry dish. That dish wasn't bad at all and it had a good amount of flavor. Again, only order spicy level of 6 or below.   Service: They need more employees. Seriously the food was not coming out at the right time together and they kept mixing the items we ordered with our other table. There was a group of maybe 8 that had been seated for a while before us and they were just getting their food when we finished ordering. They did not give us our glasses of water for so long! And they are so bad with refills. Oh and beware, they run out of boat noodles and young coconuts sometimes... Like how they did with us. One of the waiters did not know this and turned in an order for a boat noodle for my aunt and we had to confirm with the other waiter that there was no more boat noodles. WHAT THAI RESTAURANT RUNS OUT OF BOAT NOODLES?!?!?!  Price: The prices aren't bad. But the amount given does not equate to the price.  Overall, I would not return due to their customer service. Seriously need to hire more employees and have them pay attention to customers more."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, the service was quick and friendly, the restaurant was clean and modern, and the prices were very reasonable! We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious, budget-friendly Thai place away from the bustle of the Vegas strip! We'll be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Usually I love this place but FUCK them! I was trying to add mango sticky rice. When I clicked on the picture of mango sticky rice, ordered it. Apparently it was just sticky rice. Why do they have a picture of MANGO sticky rice when it's just plain rice!?!?! They wouldn't even correct it. Fuck this place!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know where to begin. I guess I can start with entering the restaurant. It was roughly 730pm on a Sunday evening (literally 2 hours ago) and the place was empty. Only one other table (6 tops, max) and our table (4 adults and 1 child). Service was meh, I don't go to Asian restaurants and expect any type of service, they're not known for that. Ordered soft drinks and only the cans were brought out, no cup or glass of ice to go with the drinks. Food was mediocre. I don't get how people are raving about the food here. Maybe we came on an off day??? For appetizers, we had Hoi Jor and Chicken Wings. Both were okay, I think dim sum restaurants have them beat in that area. I was told the spicy level was 1-10 with 5 being medium. I ordered number 4 spice level for everything we ordered, and it felt like it was an 8. Server seemed not to care about that at all...anyways, continuing with the food...we did family style ordering so papaya salad, beef salad, crab fried rice, fried tilapia, short ribs, and drunken noodles. Everything was either bland, or tasted really off. The beef in the beef salad was so hard to pull apart and it was so chewy. Crab fried rice was tasteless. The only decent thing was the drunken noodles. We pretty much left more than half of the food there and left. Expressed our opinions to the server and she seemed to not care, so it is what it is. Will never step foot into this place again!"}
{"text":"I tried to order delivery and they were very rude over the phone. I asked for delivery and she asked me if I wanted rice..????? I said my name was kitty and got a variation of zoey genie and beanie....The manager put down the phone while I was ordering and started talking to other guests. I could hear her greeting other people coming in and shuffling around. She stopped talking and just put the phone there... I thought she was busy and might get back to me later but no...she just left me hanging....I hung up to call back but it didn't go through... I was fairly upset but then realized maybe she just didn't know any better. I mean it really takes a lot to know how to operate a phone. Next time I'll send in my order through carrier pigeon."}
{"text":"It use to be very good, now everything it's too sweet. Thai food is not suppose to be sweet in everything"}
{"text":"I wish i can give this place 00000 star customer service and over promise on our take out order .... pls check ur order clearly b4 u take it out of the restaurant"}
{"text":"I had to give this place 1 star not because of the food, but the customer service is horrible. I've given this place a few tries and it's the same experience. Take forever to being water, take order, and they just treat you you dont matter and make you feel like you're bothering them."}
{"text":"I absolutely love my Thai food so I'm always hunting for a good place, at first I came here as I worked close by and they are open late the food at the time was  good -satisfactory. If you ever get food delivered I HIGHLY suggest calling them as soon as you place the order and reminding them That you have placed a order, otherwise you will be waiting an extremely long time. This happened 3 times to me, I put up with it as at the time I didn't have another Thai restaurant close enough to deliver. The breaking point was my last visit with the food quality once again lowered and became very average. The server even charged me extra for beef pad see ew noodle, come on its always beef !  Also when you check in you get a free Thai iced tea, two times they denied me saying I had to dine in when I was picking up food and when I finally was dining in the last time they said oh no it's for the small Thai tea and charged me for the drink I ordered anyway. Don't bother having a check in gift if you are not willing to give it to your customers and don't add a heap of extra charges it just makes the customer feel ripped off. I also had a soup on my last visit they light  it on fire under neath which had a cool effect however the chief must of put far to much fuel and the fire kept going over the bowl and burning me, all my arm hairs were burnt off. In the end I just moved it to the side of the table and waited till it stopped which took a very long time and made the effects really more of a bother. I mentioned this to the server but they didn't do anything. I can honestly say I have eaten here a min of 10 times previously and I will no longer eat here any more, a combination of feeling ripped off, bad customer service and the tipping point of the food getting worse was the cause. I should of looked else where the moment I went into the store and saw its between a \"late night massage\" shop and almost next door to a strip club."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in Vegas in my opinion. They took a while to get our order taken but we were a very large party so it's understandable (23 people). Our food came out within a very reasonable amount of time if not fast. The portions are pretty average compared to Thai places. So overall, I think four stars is appropriate.   Personally recommend the Basil Fried Rice over all the other fried rice options!!  Located in a very random area so keep your eyes open when looking!"}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent! Really enjoyed dinner with my family with authentic Thai food"}
{"text":"I ordered here from UberEATS and really enjoyed it. The second time I ordered it was disgusting. The rice was old and stale and the curry was watery and had no flavor."}
{"text":"I liked the food. It was very tasty. I had the crab fried rice, thai fried rice, pad see ew, their pad thai. This is another thai place I've tried and this is a step above a lot of them. That being said, their service was like a new restaurant at best.  Christmas day, I had to wait 1 hour for the food. Though so courteous, the service was obviously understaffed for a not so full restaurant. I asked for water, and it never arrived. The waitress served the bowls and dishes and they were lacking. There was a lot of smoke inside the dining area from the cooking area.  I would still eat here again."}
{"text":"Ok do not mess this up! This place rocks. I ordered delivery from my Hotel. Food was delivered in approx. 30 minutes. Had the Chicken Pad Thai, Spring Rolls and Pot Stickers. This food is really, really good. I give the Pad Thai a 9 out of 10. Potstickers and Spring Rolls 7.5 out of 10. Way better than expected and if I lived here I would order from them every week."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, ambiance and service! I really like the Pad Thai here! I will definitely come back whenever im in Town! My new to-go Thai restaurant in Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Really tasty, simple versions of Thai classics in a comfortable atmosphere.  Don't be put off by the strip mall location as it is clean and simply nice inside.  Tom Kha, Papaya Salad, Pineapple Curry were outstanding and kids loved the Chicken Fried rice.  Would pass on the Orange Chicken though. Value is really strong as well.  Great place to go if you want a break from many of overpriced, underwhelming Vegas concepts.  Friendly service as well.  They also do carry out."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place.   The pineapple fried rice was out of this world. The drunken noodles and Pad Thai were also incredibly good. The food far exceeds expectations.   I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Great food great place!! We went all the way from the strip and it was worth it. I had drunken noodles and Thai dumplings everything was fresh and yummy. I love it."}
{"text":"Very good thai food in las vegas, pad thai, Khao soi is amazing.  Service is very kind.   The lady who work night shift is very  nice.  We love her smile !!! Keep up the work guys you guys rock"}
{"text":"Wasn't able to order any of the curries because apparently the curry mixture was already pre-made and contained fish sauce, but thankfully the Pad Thai could be made vegan (and gluten-free) by omitting the fish sauce and egg, and it was still very tasty! Lots of bean sprouts, and the only thing I would have liked was more vegetables in addition to the tofu that came with it. Also, I'm happy the portion was decent and not too big, and reasonably priced.  Server was very nice and very willing to check with the kitchen to make sure they could make the Pad Thai without fish sauce.  The location and exterior made me a little wary, but the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant was very nice."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall and a great find just a couple of minutes off the strip.  It's very small. It has about 6-8 tables(?) Half of them being 2-tops.   We arrived right during the lunch right during the lunch rush.  So it filled up immediately. There was just one person covering all tables along with take out orders, and I thought she handled it fairly well for someone that was obviously slammed.  So in regards to considering that, it was good service.  I would just advise to avoid rush hours of you're in a rush or call ahead for take out.  We had the pad thai shrimp and red curry with chicken.  I absolutely loved the red curry.  I love spicy food and the level of spice was just the amount I love for that tingle but not so much that you've lost all other flavors.  It balanced the savoriness of the cocounut.  The pad thai was delicious as well and pretty stabdard to what I expect good pad thai to be.    The prices were reasonable and so were the portion sizes in relation to it's cost.   I'm from out of town but visit Vegas regularly.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Thai Street Cafe is an awesome new addition to LV! Open really late, very close to strip and the food is delicious, fresh. 4 of us had pad thai, some curried chicken (spiciest one is best) and some thai iced teas. Huge portions, all around delicious even past 3am.   The only thing missing is a slot machine or video poker!!"}
{"text":"Close to Trump. Food is good. Place is quiet. Perfect for a late night romantic dinner"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food I've had. We had the the pad see yoo and the basil fried rice. Both really on point! The spice and flavors were excellent and the service was very kind. They did a good job looking after you and giving suggestions. If you're nearby this place you definitely need to stop by!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place. A friend took me and I enjoyed it! Pineapple fried rice with shrimp, chicken, and beef, and a thai iced tea with boba! Soo good! I brought my sister here as well and she enjoyed it! Great food!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food in an unassuming strip mall (no pun intended)... it's surrounded by strip clubs lol. It's definitely a hidden gem. I had the red Thai curry with chicken and my husband had the coconut mushroom soup. Both dishes were fresh and full of flavor. Our new go to spot when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dining in here. Menu has a lot of options. Servers were nice and professional. I ordered the Red Curry lunch special with rice and spring roll along with a small salad. I like spicy but the level 7 was a little too spicy for me I would have gone for more of a 5. Would come here again and again!"}
{"text":"The food came out quick and had a lot of kick. I ordered the mixed seafood with a #5 spicy and the kick was pretty strong. I will return to try some other dishes and update this review as I experience more of what the menu has to offer."}
{"text":"Wow! I didn't know this place existed. After living here for 9 years industrial road would be the last place I would look for food. But I'm glad my in laws wanted some thai food. So pulling out my phone and looking for thai food on yelp I came across this place with 4 1/2 stars.   Food was amazingly good and dine in area is very clean. The waitress we dealt with was very kind and introduced us with some recommended food to try."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas! Super authentic! Aon is always amazing. She always goes above and beyond both when I eat there and order delivery. The service is prompt and friendly. Everyone is so smiley and fun to talk to I really felt like home. Their delivery service is also great. Always punctual and the food comes hot and delicious!  My favorite dishes are Yen-Ta-Fo noodles (tomato-based broad rice noodle soup with seafood), Tom Kha with chicken, drunken noodle, kao soy (curry egg noodle), green curry with beef, crab fried rice, larb, and basil fried rice. Very economical and generous serving. They have 10 spice levels. Level 7 is spicy and yummy for me. Also, check out their $7.95 lunch specials on weekdays. Their coconut ice cream is quite good (huge serving as well) but a bit heavy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I was visiting Vegas and was craving thai and I was super impressed. The service was on point the food service was quick and super clean.   The prices are just right. This will be my next thai place next time I'm here."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice feel to it. It's in a sketchy area but the inside is very clean and comfortable. The waitress was incredibly nice and was quick to recommend her favorite food when asked. They have done really well at making this place welcoming. We ordered the drunken noodles and the green curry. Mm mm mm! I love Thai food and this place has done it for me. Love love love mango sticky rice. You won't regret coming here. Minus a star for bad water"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants, in Thailand and in the US. I've never had bad Thai food until now. The spring rolls were extra-crispy outside and a mushy paste inside. Vegetable curries were mostly raw squishy tofu with very few veggies. The pad Thai was basic and not too flavorful. The pineapple fried rice was good, and the iced teas are giant - so be sure to share with someone! I would have a hard time recommending this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most affordable, delicious, healthy, and nicely decorated restaurants around this area of Vegas."}
{"text":"I've tried Thai St. Café about three times now and 2/3 of the time, it was take out. The only time that I have sat in at the restaurant was my most recent visit. And I must say, they may have gotten 4 stars if I stayed using take out instead of sitting in.   The only dish that I have tried here is their drunken noodles. They use mushrooms in theirs, which is different from the other Thai places that I've tried. The overall flavor of their drunken noodles is very good as well. It just meshes so well together. It reminds me of a pad see ew spin off. It has a tiny bit of sweet to it and it would taste especially good when I got it spicy. I usually get a level 10 spicy.   On my most recent visit, my boyfriend and I decided to go for dinner because I was craving for their drunken noodles. We got there at around 545pm so it wasn't busy at all. The dinner rush hasn't started. There was maybe about 2-3 tables aside from us. But the service was so slow throughout the night.   I ordered drunken noodles with chicken while my boyfriend ordered their pad see ew with beef. It took a while for the dishes to come out and when it did, they decided to give me shrimp instead of chicken. So I had to get them to re-do the dish. I also had to ask for chopsticks twice and even then, we had to get up to go to the register to even get it cause they forgot about it. They never refilled our waters. And when it was time to pay, I just took it to the register myself instead of waiting for them to grab my card. At that time, there was only one table aside from us. I just don't understand why it's so slow.   I'll definitely go back for their drunken noodles but I'll only do take out or delivery. I don't think I can sit down at their establishment again. Plus, parking sucks so I rather just grab and go anyhow."}
{"text":"Ahhh yes... Thai st.   A place I have come to call home. Many moons have I dined there to satisfy my urge for an authentic Thai cuisine.  I bet \"Richard T\" can back me up  They always say, it's about location, location, location.   This enigmatic dining experience is quite possibly located in the most culturally flexible location in the world.   It's fair to recognize that this project delivers an experience for all of the human senses:   1. I can ~hear~ a parlay of different native languages layered with a consistent orchestra of ambulances and occasionally in this symphony you hear the disparity of another patients financial or romantic situation.   2. You can ~see~ transcendence in the the staff. The transparency of their service and the tranquil demeanor their team chemistry is great for their transient consumer base.   3. You can ~feel~ the difference between a spicy level 4 and a spicy level 5   4. The ~taste~ is great   5. The ~smells~ are particularly intoxicating. there is a lot of balance in their acidity levels. And the aromas in this venue are PHat   Don't go alone however; unless you really think you're prepared to go to that part of town and get served quite possibly the best pound for pound Thai meal in town..... and have no one to share it with."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Love the Thai food there, very authentic, service is good too! Def recommend it! It also closed at 4am with a nice bar"}
{"text":"When my GPS directed me to this place I was kind of hesitant given that is in between a massage parlor and a strip club.  However, the food was excellent and the prices are very reasonable as well.  I got the panang curry and pad see ew - both were very tasty.  The Thai tea was a very tall glass and good value as well.  This might be my new go to spot for late night food cravings as it is open until 4am."}
{"text":"The food sounds great, but I've now been waiting close to 2 hours for it to arrive! The woman on the phone said an hour, which I felt totally ok about, but this is getting ridiculous."}
{"text":"Wow!!  I'm a regular here and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in today and saw that they have expanded and have a nice big dining area now.  Nice welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night after seeing their yelp reviews. The place may be easily over looked because it's by adult stores and strip clubs, but they have bright lights saying \"THAI FOOD\" and marquee light arrows pointing to their doors. (Lol)   The food is good. Service was decent. I got chicken pad Thai number 7, and it was pretty spicy. Spicy levels are from 1-10.  We also got chicken fried rice and orange chicken. The last review for orange chicken I saw was complaining that there was a lot of sauce. My orange chicken was more like caramelized in the sauce. There was more fired dough caramelized in the sauce than chicken.   My boyfriend liked his fried Rice. I'll probably go again, but I won't order the orange chicken."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and really taste good. the one main problem is the over all service always sub pare.  We always have to ask for our drinks to be refilled and the staff just seen slow and not really engaged.  Like I said the food is really good, the wait staff are slow and disengaged.  House Fried Rice with Chicken and Shimp is amazing!"}
{"text":"Very good food and cute atmosphere. Poor service though. Our drinks sat empty for awhile until my wife had to get up and flag someone down to get us some water."}
{"text":"I have ordered a take out. It supposed to be ready in 45 minutes for pick up and I ended up waiting on the parking in front for 1,5hrs.  No apology for the food being late. Overpriced for the quality. Asked for medium spicy and got a thai-spicy. Had to toss everything so I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Authentic food. (No unnecessary sugar added) Down to earth prices. Spice level till 10.  Just to name a few.  I went there on a Sunday night at 11 pm and it was one of the best Thai Food I have ever had at that time in Vegas. Our Server was May and she was a sweetheart.  The soup came in with fire lit under it and for under $9 bucks, you can't just beat that.  The food is great and so is the quantity. Keep up the good work and the fresh Thai chilly."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp! Fantastic theme inside. Yes its between the stripe clubs ;). I still brought ny family here. Food was great, price is about right. We got the chicken yello curry, pad see u. Tastes authentic! Give it a try"}
{"text":"Weird location next to strip club in the plaza. The food was ok but the portion was small comparing to price. Even me and my wife are not full enough with 4 dishes."}
{"text":"First time here: had the Pad Thai -game changer!! So so good! Plus for the price, it's amazing! They give you enough food that if you are able to finish it, you'll be hurting from a stuffed stomach. I would absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Drunken noodles , cashew nut and  mango rice dessert, all super delicious!!  Easy online ordering, direct and fast delivery."}
{"text":"That's is the best Thai restaurant ever in my life!!! Tom hka soup is awesome!!! Each time when I travel in vegas, I must to go this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The location might be a little misleading, but the quality of food is just awesome. As the name suggests, this is the place for authentic Thai street  delicacies."}
{"text":"We were so surprised by how fantastic the food is at this little gem!  From the outside it looks pretty scary but the inside in clean and nicely decorated.  The service was great.   Their peanut sauce is fantastic.  Loved their spicy basil chicken too!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food and service.  From the curries to the noodles to the soup to the salads.  Doesn't have any alcohol on menu, but there's a liquor store next door and they encourage you to bring your own.  Food was fresh, large servings, and a great flavor profile.  Nicely balanced and just a great experience despite the \"interesting\" location.  :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for this fantastic find! My friends and I had just completed a 5K and we were starved and craving Thai. Found this place and went based on reviews alone. OMG. Everything authentic and very reasonably priced. Menu is extensive and truly caters to every thai taste. We snacked on crispy rolls and crab rangoon which were both delicious. The food came and portions are plenty! I had the basil fried rice with shrimp. Everything was absolutely fabulous. Don't be afraid to venture off the strip for this place. Lyft can drop you off right at the door!   We asked about alcohol with dinner, and unfortunately they do not serve alcohol. However, our server Phil (who was fabulous) mentioned that they're BYOB and that there was a liquor store next door if we wanted to go get a 6 pack and bring it back! Perfect!   What are you still reading for? Go get some thai!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food in Las Vegas.  I always order Beef Noodle soup on my first visit to a new Thai place to gauge the Thai flavors, this place is great.    I can understand the service is not what most Americans are used to, these Thai girls are doing work of 2-3 people but they are kind and friendly.  Take it from a Thai (not half, 100%), I know what Thai food is supposed to taste like.  Aroi Mak"}
{"text":"Okay is this really Thai street food...no not really.  This is just a Thai restaurant with some pretty typical Thai dishes but with some authentic flavors.  Be careful if you Asian...the 1-10 rating is pretty biased..meaning the food is mad spicy for a 3-4 level.  I had the yellow curry which was really flavorful.  My husband had the pad thai and my brother had the pad see ew, both which were good but just too spicy!  So I have to knock them down a bit, since they would not honor a restaurant.com coupon I had.  Prices are reasonable and hours are good for those looking for a spot in the wee early morning hours."}
{"text":"Yummy thai food! Tom kha soup was filled with chicken and mushrooms and great taste! The pad thai was delicious!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai no meat.. Shrimp on the side...last time I got white meat this time she said its mixed together"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food, everything came out in a timely manner. Definitely going to come back! I recommend the Red Curry & Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. It's an easy location to find, and has plenty of parking. The interior is really nice and modern. The food was delicious! We had the dumplings, shrimp pad Thai, and spicy basil chicken rice. We received our order very quickly. The reason not 4 or 5 stars is the waitress working had zero customer service skills, we had to ask for refills, we never received extra napkins as requested, she wasn't very helpful when we were ordering by making recommendations, and definitely not chatty or overly friendly and there was only one other party dining while we were there. The men's room was out of paper towels, and the wall next to our booth had food/sauce splattered all over it. I could work around the messy wall, but the no paper towels makes me wonder if the staff is washing their hands after using the bathroom, if so they should have noticed this."}
{"text":"I've been here at different times of the day, and have also gotten them for delivery. Their lunch hours aren't usually busy, but be careful with going with a large group because service ends up being slower. Dinner hours get much busier but the slower service doesn't matter as much as during lunch break. It's not in too great of a location and parking could be difficult at times, but they do have a couple spots reserved for the restaurant. I like the variety of foods they provide and nothing I've tried has disappointed. Their lunch special is a great deal and the portion is definitely filling. It's one of my go-to spots for Thai food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The hot pots are always amazing and the calamari is fantastic!  But the service needs a bit of help...  I come here often buy Everytime a specific waitress is here the service is slow even when I'm the only one there...."}
{"text":"Coming from Hollywood California I get to indulge in a lot of Thai food. My beef salad did not come with cucumber, mint, and cilantro. If you list the ingredients on the menu then it should be in the dish. I also had to wait 24 minutes to get my beef salad. It took over 40 minutes to get my final 2 dishes, drunken chicken and larb. We had asked for medium spice for both dishes but instead got mild. My girlfriend said that she enjoyed the flavors of the dish. I agree, the dishes are good but one dimensional in flavor.   Thai food is built in layers. You add spices, chili, savory meats, and layer additional flavors by adding crushed peanuts, bean sprouts, cilantro, and mints. Eating each dish was like getting a good hamburger, bun, and cheese but leaving out the onions, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayo, mustard, and relish.   Considering the options in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend that you give this place a try.  It's worth a visit but don't expect to be blown away by authentic Thai flavors. Most of the flavor profiles you experience will have come from a bottle. Also, avoid this place if you are in any sort of a rush."}
{"text":"This place is pretty conveniently located near my work and I always get the yellow curry level 4. I have found that their level for is more like a level 3 at other Thai places. The yellow curry is fantastic, it is easily my favorite thing from there. The Hor Joi was really delicious, it had a lot of flavors all intermingling and went perfectly with the plum sauce.   The portions are great, the service is great, the location is tricky, but I will absolutely come back here again. I've already been twice in the last couple of months.   The Thai tea is really nice, pairs great with a spicier curry."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on this place and had to come check it out-was not super impressed however. I am not sure how no one else had the experience I did. When we came in we were not greeted by anyone, stood around for 5 minutes, when we went to seat ourselves the staff acted like we were jerks for doing so, and asked us to wait another minute to be seated. Meanwhile there were about 3 tables in the restaurant-that was it. Then the table they sat us at was broken and wobbly anyway. Ridiculous. We asked to be moved and they agreed but were clearly annoyed by it. Our food then took FOREVER to come out, even a couple who came in after us got their food before us...????  Then on to the food. I got the Pad-see ew because it looked so awesome in the pictures. It was not as awesome at all in real life. It was okay, but nothing amazing. It could have been a lot better. Noodles were plentiful and chicken was not. They put broccoli stocks in there instead of actual broccoli heads like they said on the menu.  I just really couldn't believe how average our whole experience was.   On top of all of this the location is awful- not easy to get too, and between two strip clubs also...so on that note I won't be back for the lower then average experience instead I will head to other Thai places."}
{"text":"Curry puff tastes store bought. Spicy fried rice was good. Red curry with chicken was good. Most entrees were $8.95. It's in a seedy part of town with suspect clubs but the service and food were good. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great service and the best part is it opens late . We had pad thai, the spicy soup and drunken noodles. Everything was awesome"}
{"text":"First off, I love that this place is open til 4am. That's a definite plus considering most Asian places close around 10. Secondly, the decor on the inside is so cute and cozy and they play good music. The food was also super yummy. We tried the curry puffs which were tasty and then I had the yellow curry with chicken at a spice level of 6. It was definitely on the spicier side but completely delish! We also had the Panang curry with chicken at a spice level of 5 and that was really good too. The food comes out pretty quickly and overall the service was good. If you like Thai food I definitely recommend! Specially if it's a late night."}
{"text":"The overall atmosphere is very calm and relaxing, great spot to grab high quality food with friends and family! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Is this place serious?? I ordered over $60 worth of food via delivery.  They said food will be delivered in 40 minutes.. after almost hour later I try to call them to check the status of delivery and their phone is down.  Starving as hell and going out to eat at different place.  Delivery driver called me hour and half later asking me for address... told him I am cancelling my order since I am on my way to different restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"This place does not even deserve one star! My cousin and I just left this place because 15 minutes have passed and they still didn't give us menus. There is only 2 other customers at the restaurant and 3 workers doing nothing but standing around chit chatting doing nothing."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. I love their thai style beef salad...  This will be my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food in a not so family friendly area of town. We had Pad Thai, Pad See Ew and Kao Soy. All were so good we couldn't stop eating until they were gone even though we were full."}
{"text":"Great Thai food for the price, very  cheap compared to other options near the strip. The layout is also very nice, staff is extremely friendly. I got the red Thai curry, it was yummy."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery via UberEATS on a Friday night. One of those nights where you've had a long work week and just feel like decompressing at home in sweats and eating delivery from the couch. I'm sure you can relate.  I ordered pud see yew, pad thai, thai tea and sticky rice with mango. Everything was excellent: Quality, temperature, packaging, flavor, delivery service and pricing. With the entrees, you can select how spicy you want your food. I went with \"4\" and that was plenty spicy (and I like spicy food). I'll probably go with 2 or 3 next time as Thai spice is no joke.  With the delivery fee and tax, the bill was $34 (before tip to driver).  I'll most definitely be ordering out or dining in here again soon."}
{"text":"This Thai restuarant is located on the outskirts of the strip. Our red light district of Vegas. Ahahahhaa it looks pretty sketchy on the outside but it's pretty modern in the inside. At first I had doubts Becuase the health dept. grade was a \"C\". Well that didn't stop me from trying this place out since they close very late.   We ordered: 1. Tom yum soup- 8/10- little bit spicy for a level one. It was very delicious. 2. Papaya salad- 8/10- good portion. Has a strong taste of the sauce and refreshing. 3. Pad See-ew?-7/10- very good and juicy. 4. Mango sticky rice-10/10- super amazing and so much to share around.  All I can say is customer service is A+ they are very nice and appreciative."}
{"text":"Summary: (on a scale of 1 to 10) Location - 2 Convenience - 8 Interior Decor - 8.5 Exterior Decor/signage - 4 Food - 9 Service - 3 Price - 9  We had the lunch portion of tofu and chicken Pad Thai. Everything was delicious and filling for the price. $7.95 BUT beware,  their spiciness scale is higher than most other places. Their 3 is more like a 5 or 6 other places and their 5 was like an 8.  The egg roll and sweet and sour sauce was very good too.  Wait staff was not very attentive and took forever to come take our order and refill drinks.  I still recommend this place though. It was great!"}
{"text":"This joint has become my go-to Thai place, over Ocha, Lotus of Siam, and Komol.  The atmosphere is great, the food is outstanding, the menus are the best I've ever seen at a thai restaurant (since the dishes can be confusing if you or your guests are unfamiliar,  and getting pad thai over and over is lame).  Location is pretty good and central, near the strip and Sapphire, and right off I-15 but without getting into the hassle of LVB.  You can even BYOB.   Oh and pretty cheap too. Standard thai food prices, but in a nicer environment. Very clean."}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers came in to eat here around 6pm on Sunday, we ordered our food by the time it got to us we only had been here for about 15 minutes which was surprisingly really fast, the service was good but here's the reason why I'm rating this place with two stars! As soon as we started eating our food I got one bite into my appetizer and I was horrified! I had a live insect crawling on my food ! Yuckkkkk ! We got a complete refund of our food and left ! Thank you but no thank you ! We definitely won't be coming here again. Check your food next time you come eat here"}
{"text":"Just visiting Vegas for the night and wanted something affordable to eat late. This hit the spot. Very clean. Delicious. Affordable. Andddd open until 4am. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Every dish has a level of each flavor. It JUST right. This cook understand food, flavor texture... BEST Thai in my life so far! Better than San Francisco. OMG!?"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and so are the prices. But they are always understaffed and the service is extremely slow.  You have to constantly chase someone down to get anything and it impossible to go during your lunch break!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and fast service here from the moment I ordered the food to the end. It was fast quick service and not even that the food was amazing specially the cream cheese something I ordered was so good"}
{"text":"Pad tai was so great! It was nice for me to manage spicy level on my own. I also like the clean and modern interior of the restaurant. Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I can't believe how good the food is and for a great price. It open late which is good for me because of the times I go out. The waiter was alright but he was a little slow to come around."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews for this place. Yeah, it's in the shopping center that was featured on a show about an undercover sting operation to bust pimps who have their offices here, but the restaurant is fine. Parking is tight, but they have the cheapest delivery minimum in and around the Spring Mountain area for Asian food.  I've ordered take out, pick up & eaten in house here. Portions are on the smaller side but non seafood entrees run between $7-10.   The restaurant is clean and modern. Wait staff was attentive and the food is good.   Honestly, if you order online, your food will be much spicier (I order 10/10) when they can't make snap judgements about me like what happens at every Asian restaurant.  Ordering spice level vs actual spice level:  9/10 in house = 3. 10/10 online = 10. One time it was more like a 15, but that was only one of many orders I've placed here.  Will return."}
{"text":"Yum! We had the chicken pad see-ewe and tofu red curry. Both were delicious and generously sized. Prices were fair and the atmosphere was trendy and clean."}
{"text":"This is my first Thai food experience. I can't explain how happy I was with it. I was a little apprehensive when pulling up, but it was a pleasant surprise!   The decor is clean and sharp. Very modern.   Weird to say, I loved the actual dishes. They were very different in a great way.   We had Tom Kha hot pot soup. I am in love. I don't live here and I don't know how I'm going to live without it. It was pretty hot, but in a good way. Next was the curry, I don't remember the name but it started with a P. It was great with tofu. We also ordered the orange chicken. That was super crispy, which was really nice. Drunken noodles with beef finished our meal. We ordered the heat level at a 4. That was a little too much for me (I'm a Wisconsin girl). The Thai iced tea was the biggest surprise. What a treat! Just order it, trust me.   Our server was more than helpful. She made excellent suggestions, even helped pair the proteins with the dishes. She was so attentive. Mind you, we visited at 11pm.   I can't say enough good things about this place. Except for the location ."}
{"text":"Soooo good and thank you for opening so late!! The outside didn't look so great, but wait til you walk inside. We were greeted and seated promptly, service and food were great! Highly recommend the spicy catfish and tom ka soup, both were packed with flavor! We ordered the chicken satay too, but I didn't care too much for them because they were dry to me; however, my boyfriend ate it all and he liked them ;) overall, I would def come back. Food was yummy and they open late, no fast food for us anymore!"}
{"text":"I am not Thai, so I cannot tell you how authentic the food is. I can, however, tell you how GOOD it is!! This is exceptional food for a fair price. Expect big bold flavors with great textures. The portions always look small when presented, but I always leave stuffed! Personally, I like to recommend the yellow curry with chicken for first timers. Everyone seems to love it. It is super velvety curry with fresh chicken, rice and veggies. It's a home run!  The food is very rich and so is the Thai coffee. Stiff, I recommend the coffee. It makes Starbucks look like child's play."}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam was closed so we went here as an alternative. don't know what people are saying about this place being good. They obviously have never had authentic Thai food and this place is nowhere close to it.  Thai boat was the worst ever. It was so sweet, it tasted like sugar. There's no balance at all and it was hard to finish, even added lime and spice couldn't save it.   Tom yum soup was totally watered down. Couldn't believe they called this tom yum.   The pork spare ribs was extremely salty and very DRY. It wasn't braised or cooked to tender as I expected and it should've been.   Beef Pad Thai- you can't go wrong with it. But it was wrong. The beef was extremely chewy like rubberband and the cut was so thick. The sauce was lacking and barely any flavor.   Only thing was good was fried tilapia fish. But then again you can fry a tilapia dish at home and it'll taste good. A 10 year old can cook this dish.  As for service, there was none because everything took so long. Probably because there was only one server and there was one other table.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Maybe if you're drunk then everything bad tastes good right?"}
{"text":"After waking up from a night of dancing and inebriation I conclude the food really is that good. Just had pad thai and fried rice both with chicken and a thai iced tea all were phenomenal. Last night the food was 2nd to none and leftovers this morning were just as good. Open till 4am and near 1Oak is a pairing made in heaven."}
{"text":"I work nights so I appreciate the late hours.  Staff was friendly and dining area was neat and stylish.  Food was decent."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price. You can also stock up on stripper supplies next door!  It's kind of in a weird location, but I would definitely come here anytime."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. Though we had started to look for a food truck, but they were off and then in the vicinity we found Thai Street Cafe via Yelp. Located in the middle of two strip clubs, next door to a liquor store, we were not sure if this is really the place we wanted to eat, but there were some amazing reviews and we just had to peep in - after all we had walked nearly 4 miles to get here..   Once inside the place was empty, maybe it was 2 pm on a workday and people had already had lunch, or maybe people were busy at CES, but the place looked warm and nice, and the staff courteous. It was clean, very beautifully done so me and my wife sat down and we ordered some food.  For my Wife we ordered Mixed Vegetable Thai Rice, and for me a Hot Pot with Sea Food, all we can say is that this is the Best thai food we have ever eaten, yes better than the one you get in the most genuine thai places, or even bangkok.. the food was delicious, and served wel.  The portions were large, and we had great company from the team. I eventually also requested for the Chef to come and join us as we wanted to personally thank him. A lovely place and a must do."}
{"text":"My friend and I were contemplating on where to go for lunch and she brought up this little Thai restaraunt we had seen a few times since it's close to our work. It may seem sketch at first glance next to Can Can Room and other adult establishments. However, I am so glad she mentioned we check it out. When you open the door, there is a cozy and friendly cafe atmosphere. The menu had so many delicious looking Thai meal offerings and it took a minute for us to decide. We ordered lunch special Chow Mein, chicken wings, and the best crab fried rice I've ever had! So much crab mixed into appetizing rice and our server said it was one of his favorites. I have to mention our meals came out quickly and were so fresh and delicious. As we left, all the employees were sitting together eating and they were all so friendly and thanked us and said goodbye. We will absolutely be back and highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, checked in and got a free Thai iced tea. Ordered the yellow curry mild with chicken. OMG, the curry sauce was most excellent and the chicken nice and tender. I was very full!    This establishment would've received a 5, but it took almost 30 minutes to receive my order. They messed up my daughters order, but corrected it. However it took another 15 minutes to get her new order. For the most part, I'd still recommend this place. I think the reason it takes so long for your order, lots of customers are ordering for pickup or delivery.   Atmosphere is great, don't let the outside fool you! Looks like a whole in the wall from the outside! But the inside is nice. As the saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover.  Great curry!"}
{"text":"Location is a little deceiving (kinda shady area) but the food was some of the most flavorful and delicious Thai food I have ever had!! I highly recommend the spicy basil (we ordered chicken) and the pad Thai.. my only regret is that we are only visiting and I can't come back to eat here again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Chicken was good, service was also fine. Calamari wasn't cleaned properly - Too chewy with clear skin on..seafood did not taste so well."}
{"text":"I was currently staying at a hotel and I had a craving for Thai food. Thai St. Cafe spoke out to me because 1) They were open at midnight and 2) Their food is simply amazing. I ordered a pad Thai and the chicken was cooked well, the noodles were nice and chewy, and the dish contained a nice balance of sweet, spicy, savory, and sour! It was great. Their fried wontons were nice and crispy and the Thai tea was very refreshing. Also delivery was pretty quick and the delivery guy was super nice! I would definitely come here again next time I am in Vegas and highly recommend ordering their food!"}
{"text":"This may be the worst Thai food I've ever had--or more accurately, this is the worst Chinese Thai food I've had as the establishment is not actually Thai. Not that that necessarily matters, but in this case authenticity is thrown completely out the window and the quality of the mimicry is as low as it gets."}
{"text":"In a shady looking area but well worth venturing over for. Had a Thai coffee, panang chicken curry and Thai dumplings. All were delicious! The panang curry was not spicy at all though, so if you want it spicy let then know when you order. Prices were very reasonable. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was trying told by friends that this was one of the \"better\" Thai restaurants that you can find in town (off the strip of course). However they most certainly didn't meet my expectations.  The service was very basic. No one was unfriendly or rude, but they barely came to the table and rarely checking in on us.  As for the food, although their flavors are extremely noticeable in their food, and it tasted great... their spice range is way off!! Per usual, they always ask what spice level do you want, on a scale from 1-10. I ordered a 4, even though I LOVE spicy food. But oh my goodness, that was the SPICIEST \"4\" I've ever seen.  So since the food actually tastes good, I recommend you order like 5 levels lower on spice that you would normally order.  So, I'm not convinced this is the \"best\" place in town for Thai, but it was pretty \"okay.\""}
{"text":"Delicious panang curry and drunken noodles. The curry they gave us was SO big!! I couldn't stop eating it  and even level 1 spice on the drunken noodle was delightfully spicy. But not so much that it was unbearable. The only reason I give 4 stars is due to the location... sadly placed in the middle of \"stripper street\" on Industrial. Very odd spot. But other than that the food was great."}
{"text":"Thai St Cafe is one of the late night offerings near our hotel that we ordered for delivery. My review will be biased - I only tried the pad thai.   Service: 3/5 -takes about 15-20 mins for delivery  Food: 2/5 -Pad thai chicken had minimal chicken, lots of noodle and was very salty -at the price point of $9 I didn't want to waste food. I ate as much as I could but couldn't finish because it was so salty"}
{"text":"I've been here four times in my short one week span in Vegas because this place is simply too awesome. The food is fantastic and the service is really good. Perfect place for a date, great ambience and great place to bring your family. Our waitress, Mae, is especially nice and approachable. Oh yes, do remember to check in for your FREE THAI ICED TEA!"}
{"text":"Yes, I agree that it is not in the best plaza BUT the restaurant is clean, modern in design and the food is GREAT! The bathrooms were also very clean and the staff is helpful and very friendly. We ordered Thai dumplings, Thai Fried Rice, Pad Woon Sen, and Mango Sticky Rice. I loved the flavors of the Pad Woon Sen. The mango sticky rice was by far my favorite. It is not too sweet, the rice was slightly warm and the mango were ripe and sweet. The Thai Ice Tea was also phenomenal. It had a flowery note and was not too sweet. Overall it was one of the best Thai meals I have ever had. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful service .... the best Thai food I have EVER had hands Down!!!!"}
{"text":"Best tasting Thai food I have ever had! Basil fried rice and panang curry were super flavorful and rich.Severs are very pleasing and service is also great. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Find this place on maps. Industrial style exterior and then you step inside !!! This place is a true diamond in the rough; rough looking neighborhood. Surrounded by massage places and strip clubs this place is awesome.   Staff is quick and friendly. Food is hot and fresh. Great taste and flavors. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good Thai in Las Vegas. Don't let the exterior fool you. THIS IS A MUST GO !!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai Restaurant in Vegas! I love that the owners and cooks and servers are all Thai! It relieves me to know that they know what they're doing. The food was great! Their menu was simple and easy to read. Comes in picture for those who likes pictures! I would recommend anyone to come and try! Nice atmosphere and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Pros, Cons, then Summary  Went here over the weekend with one other family.  PROs--Off the strip, so not as busy.  Food was ok, but I have had better Thai food.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  I had the spicy fried rice, which was just \"so, so\".  The orders came out in a timely fashion too.  CONs--For starters, the waitress asked, on a scale of 1-10 how hot I wanted my rice. (10 being highest).  I said 10...but it was not spicy at all, not even a little bit.  They DO NOT serve alcohol.  I felt like having a Singha beer, but they don't have anything.  The only TV they had was not on, as I was looking forward to watching some sports.  Portions are very small too.  Would I go back?  No, if Las Vegas has plenty of anything (aside from casinos and strip bars), it is places to eat.  There are many Thai places in Las Vegas, so I encourage people to go elsewhere.  Simply put, the food just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! They delivered to the Excalibur and the portions are a very decent size. Totally affordable for the area as well. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best tom yum goong I've had in years. Hit or miss service but they're trying. Expensive cab from the strip but the inexpensive deliciousness and chill atmosphere make up for it!   No liquor license."}
{"text":"Other than the shady area, this place is the bomb. Iam sure the reason they opened until 4am is to accomodate all the hanover guys from nextdoor :) Try the pork ribs, spicy catfish and the padseeyew. They were all hangover cure.."}
{"text":"If you're into late night eats after spending the evening consuming copious amounts of adult beverages, and you happen to enjoy said late night eats of the Thai food variety, stop right here. Actually, you don't really need to stop because you can order delivery right from the Yelp app, and that's what I did last weekend, twice.  The delivery minimum is $20, which is easy to hit if you're ordering for two or more, or if you're like me and ordering for one, but it appears like you are ordering for two or more. What can I say, I love to eat.  For me, I always order the Phad Thai on the first go. If they have good Phad Thai, in my humble opinion, the rest of the menu usually goes over quite well. My first round I ordered that and the Panang Curry. The second delivery of the weekend consisted of the above, with the addition of Crab Rangoon.   Clearly the Phad Thai and Panang Curry were real winners, having ordered them twice in one weekend. The curry was rich and creamy and the chicken tender. The rice was served on the side and is just the right amount of sticky. The Phad Thai is like a spicy noodle hug. The Crab Rangoon? A well designed and mixed filling with a lightly browned and fried exterior. If you're not a fan of the sweet chili sauce they serve on the side, we can stay friends. I am an aggressive dipper and I need it all to myself.  The wait time for delivery can be a bit intense, 60-90 minutes, but just plan ahead. With it being Friday and all, perhaps I'll take my own advice and plan ahead for a round three."}
{"text":"Got a late night takeaway order of Thai Fried Rice, Penang Curry and Green Curry, all with eggplant instead of Tofu. Even with a spice level of 6/10, it was not that spicy."}
{"text":"Will love it this restaurant for next trip to las vegas. Greta Food, Custom Chili level, Good Interior and server is very helpfull"}
{"text":"It's been a long time coming, but I did it. My 20th review. The big 2-0! Who here is not impressed? Unfortunately, my entertainment meter is low tonight. Creativity levels are running on fumes. I took lots of pictures though.   *Came for lunch with my D-school peeps. Prices are reasonable. Portions are generous. Lunch specials are available.  *The place is clean, almost too clean. Decor is modern.  *Curry puff was not good. Pastry was dry, curry was dry. The curry filling was essentially a crumbly mass of bland stuff.  *Boat noodle soup: What I ordered. An interesting take on beef noodle soup. It didn't taste like Taiwanese beef noodle soup, pho, bun bo hue, nor galbitang. It was much stronger with a strong dose of sweet. I suspected the culprit was some sort of plum-like sauce, but wasn't able to confirm. My table-mates loved it. I, on the other hand, get very angry when things that aren't supposed to be sweet are sweet. (Korean wings, I'm looking at you.)  *Tom kha: very milky, very sour, just the way I like it. Mushrooms, onions, cilantro, and onions were plentiful.  *Spicy basil: took one bite, approved of the seasoning and the spice. Rated 4 stars by friend.  *Red curry: took zero bites. Rated 5 stars by friend. However, she found the 8 out of 10 spice level she chose to be inadequate. If you can handle the heat, even a level 10 here would barely have you breaking a sweat.  *Highlight was the Thai tea. Free with Yelp check-in. Served chilled in a huge mason jar. Fantastic blend of tea and milk.   *In the sea of Thai places in Vegas, this one fits right in as being perfectly (and slightly) better than average, but memorable more for its look than for its food. I've had much better in Cali. Must be the Vegas inflation again.  *40, here I come!"}
{"text":"Great place but trying to call and order food no answer and all locations to business say have to order a day out online and closed but google says open and on a thursday at lunch time definantly never try to order here again complete waiste of a half hour"}
{"text":"This place seriously has the worst service I have ever experienced.   It is almost comical.   You will wait at least 20 minutes for water and they will never refill it, no matter how many times you ask and they say \"yes right away\"... I have been here 3 times now and always the same.  Plus they where just shut down by the city for health violations."}
{"text":"Want food near the strip that won't cost an arm and a leg. This is the place   Don't be turned off by the location. This is great Thai food at a great price. The staff is lovely and the food came out quickly, although we didn't go at a busy time."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself! This place left my mouth on fire! I got the pad see ew 7/10. Really spicy and tasteful! Would recommend anyone here! Place is great for large crowds and clean. Also, next to sapphire for all you fellas!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and brought it back to the Encore.  Food was great.  Everything was bagged up really well.  They gave silverware, chopsticks, chili sauce and peppers in the bag.  Tom Yum was yummy.  Chicken curry was great.  We ordered it with double meat and it was definitely meaty!  Area / location for dine in was a little sketchy.  I would recommend for takeout without hesitation.  It was an easy walk over from the Encore and a Uber back was $6.  As a bonus there is a liquor store next door so you can get a bottle of wine to go with your Thai!"}
{"text":"I really haven't had the best experience when it comes to Thai cuisine since I've been beck from Thailand. This food was really really good and as close to what I had before. We are defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, cozy small place. I tried pork cashew nut, tasted very good (not too sweet). Great service, will definitely come back. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the boat noodle soup and my woman ordered the pork rips, I found this place through yelp and happy I did. My woman is more of a Thai eating person than I am but I will admit the food here is very flavorful I love how you can taste the flavors of everything in your meal. The food is definitely delicious here if you love Thai food come here you won't be disappointment. Heck even if you want to just try something new you would definitely love it here. And it's close to the strip. It's nice and chill setting it's very calming nice music good servers and great food! Thanks"}
{"text":"I love being able order through yelp for a quick pick up. Their pad Thai is always a must"}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions and best dumplings in town. The staff was very quick and friendly. We always see a lot of locals come here. Competitive prices as well. It is located slightly outside of the Strip and not very visible, still has a lot of business."}
{"text":"We were hungry after an evening at XS. At 3am, Thai food sounded perfect. The kitchen here closes at 3:45 and we both ordered Kao Soy.   I have a soft spot for khao soi. A good one is so hard to find in the US. This isn't the best I've had but it's up there in the top 3. The texture of both the soup noodles and the fried noodles was on point and the soup had a lovely coconut curry flavor. Each bowl came with one large chicken leg. Yum!   It hit the spot and I slept so well afterward."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai Places to order out from! It's close by and opened late hours. I even ordered once at 30 min. to closing and they delivered with exceptional service, came right up to door with a smile and my two dishes, an appetizer and complimentary Thai Tea! Sorry about the late order....but I was starving. Anyway, my recommendation is the drunken noodles and the TomYum, but I may be biased because I love TomYum and will order it at every Thai place to see the variations. The Tom Yum here was good, although, I wished the flavor was more robust (?) Perhaps I just love strong lemongrass, galangal root and a tinge more spices flavor.  I also ordered their glass noodle salad and the pad woon sen, - both of which I loved.  I've never dined in, but the ambience is relaxing and looks like a good place to bring a few friends for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food and a great atmosphere. Clean and well maintained restaurant. The menu has a lot of options that all looked amazing."}
{"text":"Like the menu ., so big and so many choice to choose ., lovely atmosphere., so different from the look outside.., som tum is so delicious., very crispy papaya and great taste ., not only that the Yen ta fo is wonderful too , taste good , but a littleeeeeeee bit too sweet . Service is wonderful, very professional., will be back again soon ...must try .., Thai tea ., just right taste"}
{"text":"The place is very nice in the inside it's really clean compare to other places were you would expect to be in a decent shape this place is in great shape even tho it may seem ugly from the outside since its by industrial rd the food is great I would come back the great work thing is they don't use msg in their food which is great"}
{"text":"Chicken Satay was ok but a bit too dry. Chicken cashew was great! You can feel the food is super fresh and cooked on spot. 8.5/10 :)"}
{"text":"We ordered Fried Pineapple rice with shrimp, Pad Thai with beef and Drunken noodles with beef and everything was absolutely amazing! It's a hidden gem where Yelp took us and we didn't regret going there!"}
