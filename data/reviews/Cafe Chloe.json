{"text":"Honestly, I am not a contrarian, and I'm not cheap, either. But despite some glowing reviews here, I absolutely could not recommend this smug, overpriced strip mall restaurant.   With so many people saying so many nice things about it, I've tried it a few times but I'm through. The food is good. It's better than a chain restaurant or even some independent shops. But it will not blow you away and it's definitely not worth their bloated prices. The service people do their job, but you certainly don't feel welcomed. The atmosphere is stark, crowded, and uncomfortable.   Like an Italian trattoria, the food is prepared in a kitchen that overlooks the dining room but on one warm summer Vegas night the temperature in the dining room was at least as hot as it was outside. Warm summer nights aren't an occasional occurrence here, surely there's a way to deal with that.   As another Yelp reviewer said, this is the place \"that you would like to like better than you can.\" I wanted to love this place, but with so many better alternatives, it's impossible to recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner tonight. I inquired about the osso buco and the waitress told me that it takes 45 minutes to reheat, no thanks. I had the eggplant parm ($23) and my wife had the salmon ($26).  My dinner came with a side of penne pasta with sauce.  It came out in a tiny oval dish. The penne was overcooked and falling apart; the sauce was acidic and watery. They came around with grated cheese which I accepted. The busboy dumped a tablespoon of cheese in one glop on top of the watery sauce which made kind of a cheesy paste. The eggplant was multi layered and seemed good after I scraped off the two cups of the same watery sauce.  My wife's salmon seemed to be baked or broiled. The lemon butter sauce was mostly lemon and uninviting. Including two glasses of wine our dinner was $68 plus tax and tip it came to $86.50.  For that price I expect each entree and side to be top notch. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Not kid friendly at all.... Food was alright but not for the price... They charge 10 bucks to split a meal!!! Are u kidding me?!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that you would like to like better than you can.  An Italian cafe in a strip mall. supported by locals, with a real sense of neighborliness.  You want it to be better than it turns out to be.  The owner, the original Piero of Piero's near the convention center, turns out oversized portions of Italian classics that are unexceptional.  When reviewers rave about big portions, I doubt their credibility as food critics.  Give me small portions of really high quality food any day.  The one compliment I can offer is that the pours of wine by the glass (some good options) are very generous, equal to a glass and a half in any other restaurant.  If I were with someone who wanted to go there, I wouldn't say no, but I wouldn't look forward to it.  One more thing: the waitress was charming!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Friendly staff and most important amazing food.  Started off with some calamari and prosciutto and fresh mozzarella .  Main course was Chicken Marsala with some side pasta.  Friends had the Chicken Parmesan which was gynormous!  To finish it off cheesecake and tiramisu.  Cheesecake was good but the tiramisu was hands down the best I've ever tried.  It was the perfect ending to the meal.  Get off the strip, get in a cab and prepare to be wowed."}
{"text":"The menu is a gift from Piero, the genius, whose restaurant at Convention Center and Paradise set the benchmark for Italian cuisine in Las Vegas. He was also our chef and came to our table to say hello to his paison and my friend, Giovanni. I don't know exactly how it shakes out, but I believe Piero sold the rights to his name and cannot use it commercially. Because really, Chloes is his. The food was the best Italian I've ever had. (Take that with a grain of salt. I'm not Italian). I had Veal Marsella, Potatoes Lyonnaise, a House salad (included diced artichoke hearts, asparagus, and baby corn. The vinaigrette salad dressing was amazing), espresso and spumoni for dessert. The pricing is moderate. Dinner for two with dessert came to 75$(tip not included. We're George and rounded it up to $100). I read the other reviews and am surprised they found the food just adequate. Piero will be the chef there until someone asks him to build their Italian Ristorante. If you show up, and a stout, grey haired man, with an agreeable disposition is running the kitchen, stick around. You're in for a treat."}
{"text":"some of the best italian and seafood in Las Vegas.  the appetizers and homemade cheesecake and tiramisu are also to die for  the chef is \"Piero\" who founded Piero's then sold it when it got too popular  this place is busy but no too busy and  great for a cozy dinner any night of the week  they always have numerous and delicious specials"}
{"text":"I visited after 4 years and the rack of lamb was what I rememberd! Soooooo.... ono (delcious)! gotta go!"}
{"text":"Best Restaruant ever.... the food is amazing !! Everything is fresh made from scratch. Yolanda is the best waitress. I go here at least 3 days a week. It's a must go"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite. The portions are HUGE and it is DELICIOUS! Who needs the hassle of heading to the strip and paid parking! Chef Piero knows how to cook! I never had calamari this fresh in Las Vegas. Tasted like it was just caught. I can't say enough about this restaurant. Very small( 12 tables I think) and not at all fancy but ... who cares.... its all about the food and the great service from Yolanda! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was really close from my mom's house though so..   it was just one of those, \"will-do\" restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and ended up super disappointed.   The ambiance is absolutely zero. Between the old black and white tile, fluorescent lights, ugly deli coolers, plastic table clothes and very limited wine list it was not at all what I was expecting given the price point.   We requested gluten free pasta, not exactly an unusual request these days, and was told by the waitress that she wouldn't even ask the chef because she knew he wouldn't make it. She actually seemed afraid to ask him. At what I'm sure was a shocked look on our faces she did decide to ask him, to which he said no. Are you kidding me? He doesn't even make his own pasta, you can see the boxes piled on the shelf, all he had to do was boil some water and throw some in!!!    The only redeeming item in this place was the stuffed artichoke, which was rather amazing. Not enough to make me go back though."}
{"text":"Forget about it. The Best Italiano in Las Vegas , maybe the whole West."}
{"text":"This was the least flavorful meal I've had in a very, very, very long time.  Given how expensive the food is, it would have been nice if it tasted like anything--good or bad, I don't even care. It was just so bland.   Two other points:  1. We watched them serve alcohol to a girl clearly under age. She was about 14, knew the chef, and thanked him for her wine.   2. The women's restroom doesn't lock.   Our waitress was quite nice, though, and none of this was her fault."}
{"text":"We (4) had a wonderful meal at  Cafe Chloe, never have a bad meal, we have tried different things on the menu to see if this is the place for us. YES! I would suggest making a reservation unless you go early, the place was pack during dinner hours. We went early around 5:00p. We have dine here many times before we would post a recommendation, love it! I am cautious."}
{"text":"I would never think of visiting Las Vegas without at least one visit to Cafe Chloe.  It has become my favorite restaurant ever and I often dine in San Francisco, San Jose and Maui!  The Orange Roughy is to die for and always cooked to perfection.  The Tiramiso is the best I have ever eaten. It is true the location is in a strip mall but that adds to the charm of the place.  The owner and his wife and waitstaff always make us feel perfectly at home.  Who needs ambiance when the service and food is so exceptional?  I recommend this restaurant to everyone coming to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My wife and I like to share an entree and get a couple of salads. These guys charged us $10 to share!!! Are they nuts or what? We will not go back"}
{"text":"This review is based upon the staff. We ordered dinner around 7:00  and by 8:20, the staff was giving us stink eye. I asked them if they were closed and they told me that they were closing early because there were no new customers. The employee didn't say that we could stay and relax, she simply said they they were now closed. We left, they locked the door and turned off the lights. She did let me know that they usually close at 9:00.   Thoughts.  Soda comes in cans, so don't expect refills.  The prices are quite high for a restaurant lacking ambiance. $20.00  for pasta, $22.00 for Caesar salad with chicken. Chicken parm was $25.00 and doesn't come with salad. The food was tasty, but there are so many options in this town for good Italian food. Nobody wants to meet friends for dinner and be made to feel uncomfortable because the employees want to go home early."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the reviews I've been reading about this place.   ANYWAY, perhaps this has a special place in my heart because I've visited here so often. I've always had NOTHING but an exceptional experience. I love this place. I always order the salmon puttanesca though. It's just SO FREAKIN DELICIOUS. The tortellini are pretty great as well. Honestly I've never had a bad meal here. Service is always excellent, and they have a great wine selection as well!   I love that the owner is a Roma fan as well. I love walking through the door and seeing the sticker of one of my favorite futbol teams. I wish I could visit more often, but living in California makes that a bit of a problem!"}
{"text":"I love this place. First of all I have lived in town for 23 years and my family since 1955. The owner Piero is the Main chef with open kitchen. He has been serving las vegas for 50 years now with many different restaurants he started  many restaurants including Pieros, and Pasta Mia. Sauces are amazing, pastas great, chicken and fish amazing too and menu is perfect. Its only open 5-9 5 days a week. We love you Peggy and Piero."}
{"text":"Eh. Our waiter was nice and very attentive. The all around service was pretty good but the food was just.....okay. I had linguine with clams & it really wasn't anything special. I've definitely had better from different Italian restaurants in the city. My dad also got spaghetti, which wasn't that awesome either- the sauce was super thick & bland. Also, don't go here if you don't like to eat huge portions. My mom and I usually like to share at restaurants, but this isn't allowed at Cafe Chloe. They charge you like $10 if you want to split your dish...so dumb."}
{"text":"An Italian hole in the wall at it's finest. I am pretty shocked at the bad reviews I have read, as I felt my experience was totally different. Small, romantic, and dim lit with a vibe of an old school Italian deli and a small fancy restaurant all in one.  I would say this place is definitely a family owned business. Prices maybe a little high, but worth it for the ambiance and experience. Although I didn't indulge in the wine, the selection was decent. Make sure you look at the specials menu. Which has a varitey all the way from veal Milanese, to basic fettuccine bolognese.  I ordered the stuffed artichoke, and the tortellini Chloe, which had prosciutto, peas, mushrooms, and pink sauce. The pasta was fresh, which is a huge plus! The portions were huge, enough for leftovers unless you have a big appetite.  Fresh cheese and black pepper offered, which had they not been I would have been disappointed. For dessert the chef in house makes a cheesecake, or tiramisu. They have some basic gelato options as well. I got a cheesecake, and it was delicious and very shareable. I can't wait to come back and try some of the baked pasta, or seafood options. This place is a great neighborhood gem and I am so happy to have found it."}
{"text":"This food was so phenomenal. Real Italian so casual! Loved it so much! Thank you Yolanda for taking care of us. Chef is the owner...getting the real deal"}
{"text":"Didn't feel welcomed. The serving was pretty small and little pricy. Didn't like the fact that the people looked at my like I didn't belong there."}
{"text":"If you want delicious Italian food this is the place to go! Simple menu, good food, and excellent service. We enjoyed the Chianti, the chicken parm, and fettuccine Alfredo. Lisa provided top notch service. We will definitely be returning. As a Vegas native, this place reminds me of some of my favorite restaurants from childhood."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years (when we can get in) when we're in Las Vegas.   Besides the comfortable, friendly atmosphere, the food is AMAZING!  I dream about the arugula and squid appetizer, and the pasta with seafood is both delicious and huge.  This is a home-style restaurant in a strip mall that outshines plenty of trendy places in the casino hotels."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is welcoming, staff are polite, and attentive. The food is hot, served nicely, and has plenty of taste. Thank you for your service by providing excellent service and food."}
{"text":"We had dinner there the other night as usual the food was great!  My favorite it the Eggplant Parmigiana it is home made.  All are meals were served piping hot and cooked to perfection. They also have a amazing Italian wine selection?"}
{"text":"Will never go back there!!  My husband and I went there without a reservation at 6:09 pm and was told that since we didn't have a reservation she could take us but we have to make sure that we are out of there by 7:30 pm. After the hostess told me that, I looked over at the dining room and there were at least six empty tables. RUDE!!!  We will go to Nora's.  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I'm a local.  My wife is a native.  I like this place.  You have to be from Vegas to understand just how few local, chef-driven spots we have here.  Does it match what's happening in other places I've lived in terms of innovation, atmosphere, etc.?  Hell no.  But the food is great, and the people know us and treat us very well.  You come regularly, you're never going to get turned over or feel like a \"cover\" (whatever the heck that is) - like you absolutely will at some point if you dine on the strip.    I have to admit that it took me awhile to understand the pricing after some initial sticker shock.  It comes down to the fact that Vegas ain't cheap and there is a dearth of competition in the local dining scene.  After several years here and with Vegas treating me much better financially, I don't even think about it.  Just pay the bill and know that you're supporting one of literally just a handful of white tablecloth local establishments that's even worth visiting in this inhospitable wasteland we call \"home.\"    Some of the reviews deride this place for it's strip mall location.  Hello?!   This whole freaking meadow is a strip mall!  At least you can park right out front and avoid strip traffic and a parking garage or some dipstick valet.    Order the veal \"nerone\" and try not to think too hard on the short-comings.  Focus on the positives.  If you live here long enough, you'll see what they are."}
{"text":"my favorite! Only Italian place I don't mind paying for!  Grew up in Philly to Vegas, and this is the real deal!  The scampi, & Lasagna rock the house.  Calamari salad perfecto! Artichoke is awesome! Love! This s the home of old Vegas.  If you don't like their food, then your not old Vegas!"}
{"text":"the food is excellent and the service is outstanding.  my favorites are fettuccine and chicken piccata.  The owners are so nice and know us by name which is a plus.  Please go!"}
{"text":"Chef Piero & Peg have been at this for some time now. When Frank Sinatra was performing at the Sands back in the day, one night between shows Sinatra was hungry and somebody told Sinatra about Chef & Peg 1st place on east Sahara \"Gourmet Pantry\". That night Sinatra opened the second show raving to the audience about the food he ate at the \"Gourmet  Pantry\". Sinatra was know for to never eat at the same place two consecutive nights. But the next night Sinatra went back to Chef's restaurant and dined on the exact same thing that he had the night before Linguine & Clams in White Clam Sauce. THIS IS THE TRUTH, I SWEAR ON MY EYES! Cafe Chloe is not for (the faint of heart) everyone. Chef Piero's creation arrives to your table in large portions of quality ingredients prepared to perfection and  consistent flavor profile. Appetizers, Salads, Entree and Deserts which are prepared in restaurant with years of experience and PASSION.  Cafe Chloe's Wine list by the bottle and glass is also impressive. Again no short pours. Must try appetizer included;  fried calamari with abbaratta sauce. Baked Stuff  Artichoke seasoned to perfection and prepared daily. Meatballs with red sauce. Don't forget Saute clams in red sauce. All the Salads are prepared with fresh quality ingredients by the salad girl (owner) Peg and are delicious, huge portions. Dressing are homemade. Must try Salads are; Grilled Vegetable Salad, Caprese Salad, Cafe Chloe's twist on Ceasar Salad. Manga! Share or wrap leftovers for late night refrigerator raids.  Entree's are classic huge portion's of Chef Piero's 40 years of experience and passion. Chef with assistance from his protege never miss a beat orchestrating plate after plate.  A culinary gift to you from Chef Piero.  Must try Entree's are; EVERYTHING!!! Mama MAMA MIA! Cafe Chloe sauce is Chef's backbone to his Culinary Italian Nepotain cooking, the secret is out, SORRY Chef! Old school cooking done consistent and at it's very best. Expensive $$$ depends on how you look at it; quality, huge portions for an enjoyable meal. Desserts are homemade, huge sharing portions. Must try\"s are; tiramisu, Chef's spin on NY Cheesecake served with fresh strawberries. Cafe Chloe is not for (the faint of heart) everyone, but it sure is for me, it is my favorite Italian restaurant in the valley. Call for reservation is a must unless your a regular that dines there weekly. Maybe that is why I need to loose a few extra pounds?  Last thing; Chef Piero and Peg are gracious host that do it Tuesday thru Saturday, Dinner only. Also, they take so much pride and passion in their restaurant that they named it after their 1st granddaughter. Grazie Chef & Peg and C.C. staff for your PASSION."}
{"text":"I love to eat here when I am in town. Their food is amazing. Its a small intimate place. Ive been here a few times over the years and I've never been disappointed. The artichoke was excellent, the calamari was fried to perfection, the caesar salad is one of the best Ive had, the salmon or shrimp scampi are good choices and the steamed spinach was excellent and cooked perfectly!!! The cheese cake is amazing and one of the best Ive had (its big enough for the whole table to share). Love this place can't stress this enough!"}
{"text":"I'm really shocked by some of the bad reviews here! I've been to Cafe Chloe two times and I've never been disappointed. The food melts, literally melts, in your mouth. Yes, it's a little pricey but well worth it. We ordered the clams, shrimp, lamb, and all of it was out of this world. The service is always impeccable, the chef can whip up something that is not on the menu, that should be.....it's a hidden gem in the Las Vegas Valley."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and the food has been good. We came here on a Friday night just before 8:00 PM and upon opening the door we were told that they were closed in a very impolite manner. We ended up going somewhere else down the street. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Mom and Pop owned and operated. Not a chain allow time for your food to be prepared especially for you. It is the REAL thing. Best everything. Small intimate setting reservations highly advised."}
{"text":"Some friends recently convinced me to give Cafe Chloe another chance. Big mistake, the prices are even more outrageous and the food is barely OK. Piero was once known as a great cook but not a very nice man, he's still not a very nice man. To clear up the question of his affiliation with Piero's; he partnered with Freddie Glusman to open Piero's on Karen in the 80s. There were some problems, theft allegedly and he was sued by his partner, he lost the right to use his name on ANY restaurant in Las Vegas. There used to be holes in the stucco over CAFE CHLOE where he was legally forced to remove his name. His former partner still owns Piero's on Convention Center. If you want great Italian food, try Marc's Trattoria, The Italian American Club, or  the REAL Piero\"s"}
{"text":"Tonight we had such a walk down Memory Lane dining at Peggy & Piero Broglia's intimate restaurant, Cafe Chloe. It's been there for 17 years, ( where have I been? ) and is buried treasure! Tucked in a hidden corner of a little strip mall, this place has a reputation, a following, a distinct regular clientele, and a limited but very well crafted menu that  obviously keeps the linens on the table and the wine glasses toasting. Claudia, Diane, Dana... remember Piero's? Pasta Mia? They've been cooking in Las Vegas for 25 years.. Cafe Chloe is old school Italian complete with Frank and Dean music in the background. We'll be back.. delicious!"}
{"text":"I was referred to this restaurant by a friend who loves Italian food as much as me.  I was told to make a reservation as they are very busy so I elect to make a reservation for early on a Thurs evening for my husband and me.  Well, we get there and so much for being busy as it is just us and one other table for the duration of our dinner.I noticed the owner/chef in the kitchen kept looking over but never so much as cracked a smile or a hello.  I ordered the Tortellini Cafe Chloe which has some pancetta and pink sauce and it was ok, nothing spectacular.  My husband had the pasta with bolognese and it was good but again, nothing spectacular.  The prices are steep for the portions but as I believe in paying for quality, I gladly would, but in this case, I've had much better homemade Italian at Capo's so will go back there instead.  Cafe Chloe had zero atmosphere other than the owner and staff who just stared at us through dinner......we are normal looking people by the way, nothing shocking to look at over here, but we would have appreciated a warmer welcome."}
