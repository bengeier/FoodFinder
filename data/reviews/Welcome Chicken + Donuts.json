{"text":"Not a friendly spot. Interesting names don't equate to good taste. Not worth 3 bucks a donut."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today, I don't even like donuts that much but they have such a wide variety of different flavours, I thought I would give it a try. The lemon poppy seed one was absolutely devine! It was hands down the best donut I have ever tasted. I'll definitely be eating here again very soon."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! I love the Korean BBQ! I also had the chocolate covered sweet potato and chipotle donut equally delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and chicken is cooked just right! Phoenix's hidden gem!! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Dont go there early in morn. They dont serve chicken till 10:30.  Good donuts.  Maybe will try again but its long drive to find that out especially in rush hour"}
{"text":"The donuts are amazing and truly gourmet with exotic, adventurous and exciting favors and combos. What a treat! But even more amazing are beautiful young people who are polite, friendly and customer oriented who are passionate about providing the very best.  thank you"}
{"text":"Though they don't serve chicken until 11am, worth waiting for. The plain donut served with the combo was exceptional, though some of the other donuts were not to my liking. Overall, though, an amazing addition to a really underdeveloped part of town."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Chicken was fantastic wth the Korean sauce.  The cake donut was very good as well and surprisingly not greasy at all.  Finally the Thai Yum Slaw was very although the portion was rather small compared to what you get with the other sides.    I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Korean spiced chicken was pretty good. Side of slaw (forgot the exact name) was pretty decent as well but the donut... Blueberry Cacao I believe, was no lie the WORST donut I've ever had in my life. I threw it away in the restaurant immediately after two bites. Been back since and after two other donut attempts, it's safe to say they don't know what their doing and the beautiful exterior of the product does not match the taste.   Chicken / sides were pretty solid for me on both trips, donuts were a tragedy (seriously how do you mess up donuts?), place smelled like a kimchi  car accident, multiple homeless people be bummin inside the restaurant as well so enjoy getting panhandled why you try and justify your $11+ lunch purchase. Overall honestly just overrated / overpriced. Really wanted to think differently about this joint because of how great the Welcome Diner is but... they should really change the name so it doesn't reflect poorly on their original establishment."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet even though I've been here like 7 times?!   This is some of the best food in the valley and if you haven't been here yet you are MISSING. OUT. I have some food sensitivities so I haven't had any of the sauces and just get plain chicken, but it's SO PERFECTLY cooked and delicious, and doesn't take a long time to get once you order. Plus the donut options are plentiful and always great. The one with the passion fruit glaze is the winner for me, but I've liked everything I've had. But seriously, if they have passion fruit when you go, you gotta try it.  Also every time I'm here the staff is just so friendly and personable. It makes me enjoy going here all the more. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"On the way out of the rental car facility by Phoenix Airport, we drove by a sign that said chicken and donuts. Sold! We made a U-turn and immediately stopped in. From the outside, the building looks like an old school taco bell. But stepping foot inside, we were pleasantly surprised by new artsy decor and even more stoked to see the glorious donuts on display.   My group consisted of 5 hungry guys.  Donuts: The donuts were really good. Honestly, I would come just for the donuts. We tried about 6 different variations. I thought they all had bold flavor and a great doughy texture. I am a simple man when it comes to donuts. The maple ring really put a smile on my face.  Chicken: I opted for a 2pc combo that consisted of dark meat.  They had a choice of 5 different flavors. I went with the spicy Korean.  My first bite I thought wow! Bold flavor with just a little spiciness. Chicken was juicy and the batter/skin was still held up its crispiness.  But as I continued to eat, the saltiness of the sauce started to really make it a chore to eat.  I also was longing for a bit more fire. Overall, it is a pretty damn good piece of chicken if you stick to only a single piece.  Sides: My meal came with a choice of side. I chose the cucumber salad.  The salad wasn't as sour as regular Sumono, but I was kind of glad it wasn't. The bit of blandness and ginger flavor gave my palette a break as I was working through my salty chicken.   Overall: I thought that I would come back again for at lest the donuts and give the chicken another chance. I would recommend going there to try it yourself."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Welcome Chicken + Donuts today and absolutely loved it. I had the 3 piece special, with the Thai Yum slaw, Korean BBQ sauce on the side, with a plain cake donut.  Small dining area inside, larger outside seating in the shade Extra clean and sanitary Food was very tasty Chicken was crispy, moist, pleasing to the eye Slaw was well seasoned, crisp, and delicious Korean sauce was excellently flavored, with green onion garnish incorporated Plain cake donut was the best, light, fluffy, cooked perfectly Lunch came in a red plastic basket, with plastic ware, water available - help yourself Staff was polite, kind and attentive  First time experience was exceptional, I work nearby and will be coming back on a regular basis. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Being first timers at this place, we showed up at 10 and were too early for the chicken. So we started off with a maple bacon donut, which was amazing! The wait was then a lot longer than we expected but was made up for by the house giving us a free sweet potato pie donut, also delicious!! Once we got our chicken it was definitely worth the weight. It was crispy and didn't even need the sauces we ordered with them. We ordered two breast and drum combos and the six piece wings. The wings were huge so I would recommend just getting the six unless you are going to be sharing with a few people. Overall the atmosphere was great and they have a cute finer interior and then lunch tables outside for extra seating. This was a great find and the people who own the shop are very sweet. Wayne was really nice! We will be going back."}
{"text":"Had the chicken breast with Korean BBQ, Thai cole slaw and a plain donut meal. Was delicious and the sauce had a little spicy kick or slight bite to it. We will be back for this unique paring. Next time we will be buying some donuts to go for sure!"}
{"text":"The Apple fritter was great, but the chicken was just okay. I was expecting flavors that were a little bit less sugary and more flavorful and subtle. Still a fun spot, but not something that I'm going to be craving on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. I was so excited to visit this establishment after following their Instagram feed for a few months. It hit all the bullet points: local, creative, quality ingredients, and donuts (duh). ;)   But honestly, I wasn't super impressed. Here's what I know:   *it's tiny-small building, not meant for large crowd *service was so-so, more of 'get ya in, get ya out' attitude  *coffee, price was right ($2 for 16oz.), but they don't have an espresso machine *apple fritter was dry-doughy and large, $3, and had no crispy exterior that usually expect from scratch-made fritters *Apple cider, toffee, celery root donut was gross. I blame myself for ordering that one though (also $3)  So bottom line being, if I'm going to spend $10 on two donuts and drip coffee, I'm probably going to look else-where. Will probably return to try the ramen though."}
{"text":"Over priced!  Chicken lousy!!!  Comes with a fritter and a side. One of us got a piece of chicken that was too dry. My friend got 3 pieces of chicken under cooked. They give you a small side order and I got cole slaw. It was lousy. 3 pieces of chicken (only) was $15.  I called them back afterwards for my own curiosity to ask what the other side option was and the guy hung up on me."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place!! Good donuts and creative flavors and kinds. Boxes come out a little greasy and leave your car smelling more like chicken vs donuts but pretty interesting place! Cool seating area outside too!"}
{"text":"With the name \"Chicken + Donuts\"...I was expecting a random hole in the wall place and did not have high expectations...but this was some good-f***ing-casually-fancy-hipster-creative-fusion-flavor-explosion Chicken + Donuts, my friend. Maybe the jet lag and heat was a contributing factor, but it blew our minds.   For breakfast, my friend had two donuts with funky jelly filled flavor combos that we had never seen before and I had the breakfast sandwich (hot cake donut, bacon, egg, and jalapeno jam). It was so damn good, we decided that we absolutely had to stop by for lunch at the end of our trip on our way back to the airport so we could try the fried chicken with sauce on the side (it did not disappoint. My only regret now is that I did not get two pieces... *drool*). I loved it all so much that I also decided to get a to go box of fun flavored donuts to carry home on the flight for my other friends to do a 'donut tasting' (which was demolished in minutes, of course). I repeat... I carried a box of donuts through two airports y'all -- it took tremendous effort and willpower not to eat them all before sharing with friends back home.   Anyway, we salute you, Chicken + Donuts, for doin' it riiiiiight!   PS. Can you deliver to San Francisco, please?!"}
{"text":"I had not eaten here yet, but when they first opened they had quite the buzz. I happened to be in the area and got an order to go of their chicken and donuts and an order of ramen. The food was absolutely terrible. There was hardly any meat on the greasy, over-battered and over-fried chicken. It tasted like it had been sitting around, and then refried a second time to heat it up. We ended up with a big pile of mostly batter that went in the trash. And the ramen was just as bad. They had dumped a bunch of disparate ingredients on big floppy noodles that were pretty tasteless. After a bite it went straight to the compost pile. The food was not cheap and I will never return. I really don't understand how this place stays in business. Has it become a franchise run by someone other than the original owner? Do they leave management of the food to an unsupervised staff that has no clue as to what they are doing? I understand they own Welcome Diner (where I have never eaten either) and have heard good things about that restaurant; what gives?"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Phoenix food scene. The donut I had was delicious. It was flavorful and fluffy without being oily at all.  The wings, with the Korean bbq sauce, was also hit. The chicken was high quality, well presented and prepared.  Only downfall is the location. Hopefully welcome chicken and donuts will inspire some other entrepreneurs to move into this area."}
{"text":"Five stars for the excellent chicken (with Korean chili sauce) and great cold brew coffee.   Demerits for a very \"meh\" apple fritter. Over-mixed(?) batter gave it a glutinous chew, not enough time in the fryer to develop a crisp, and the apples struggled to assert themselves under the glaze (but they're out of season and we're in Phoenix, so that's forgivable).   Staff was great, nice little dining space. Good work, folks (but leave that fritter batter alone!)"}
{"text":"went in on Sunday and donuts almost gone...(TT.TT crying face....)  We are the weirdos ordering Ramen and salad in chicken+donut places. Staff are very nice and welcoming... got the birthday sprinkle donut and loves it! Hubby loves the chicken and ramen.(i could get the chocolate pistachio donut would be better!) Only one thing bothers us is the occasional flies around our table..it might take a bit more efforts to keep hygiene in hot summer. But in general its a good place to hang out on a weekend."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. I had the 1pc chicken breast w/Korean Chili sauce, Corn Miso Stir Fry,  and Hot cake donut. All Of those flavors were so delicious together. The chicken was well seasoned. I loved it and will return.   Reccomendation to the owner/manager: Extend the hours of operation for all the airport & corporate businesses that are operating 24hrs of the day surrounding the restaurant. There are no competitors around. Everyone wants a place to eat from conveniently when they work the swing shift/night shift. And there's not much to choose from for another 5 miles at least in each direction."}
{"text":"Sunday morning on our way to the train show with our kids, we decided to stop by this place for a quick bite.  but instead...   Hello Food poisoning! Be cautious of the raw chicken they're serving! And don't send it back because the guy behind the counter is ready with his 5min schpill  On how it's \"absolutely normal\" to see blood & raw chicken in their chicken breasts. (Yea ok guy that's reassuring)   We had pre-ordered 2 dozen chicken wings for the super bowl too but had to cancel. So glad we did! I would've had a hard time trying to convince my party that it was \"normal\" and that raw chicken is ok to eat. (Right) Good luck with that.   Oh and don't bring in outside coffee from your favorite coffee shop either. The same guy that tried to convince me that the raw chicken was fine to eat, kicked us out for bringing in our own coffee but of course not until we had already spent $45+ there. This was @ 10:30 am still very cold outside for our two toddlers and four month old.   A warning would've been nice, a simple hey guys next time please don't bring in outside drinks.  or idk maybe placing a sign on the door simply stating no outside food or drinks would have saved us the hassle.    Worst experience ever!   Thanks for the stomach ache! (Not)"}
{"text":"Generally good, but having a problem with consistently cooked chicken. Sometimes still raw despite the size of the pieces, being tinier but higher quality chicken. This is something they need to lock down. Service is friendly and helpful. Innovative donut flavors keep us coming back."}
{"text":"I have gotten doughnuts from here at least 3 times and I don't think I'm capable of buying doughnuts anywhere else now. I have also used postmates  to get me the doughnuts. Sometimes postmates messed up by being super late but  welcome chicken and doughnuts never makes a bad doughnut. It's much better than fractured prune FYI."}
{"text":"This is definitely a worthy place to stop if you are in the area. We stopped here on our way from the airport after a early flight, and it was completely worth it. The donuts were tasty and well made. They all had different flavors, even the glaze had a twist, but still a mouthwatering flavor. One person in our group got a breakfast sandwich with the Japanese yum sauce, and said it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches he has ever had.This is definitely a must stop place."}
{"text":"I had the Thigh Drum Combo- Japanese BBQ- Cucumber Salad, with a Raspberry Cheesecake Donut. The chicken didn't seem like anything special to me, it was average. What made the chicken taste good was the sauce (Japanese BBQ). The cucumbers were in a very small container and tasted very much like vinegar (again was only able to eat by dipping it in the Japanese BBQ sauce). The donut was the best part of the whole meal, very big and very delicious but also overpriced. The whole meal was overpriced if you ask me. All in all I would go back for just a donut if I had an extreme craving. I was a little disappointed and definitely expected more from reading previous reviews."}
{"text":"Definitely a repeater! The chicken was moist, the skin was extra crunchy, the sauce was very flavorful and don't even get me started on the cake donut! It was so good that we ordered a to-go order for seconds. We highly recommend this restaurant and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I was a 1st time visitor, who went there with a friend.  My friend really hyped this place up, saying that it served great food.  Our 1st choice was Carolinas, which was right down the street, but they were closed.  (Can never go wrong with food from Carolinas)..I called ahead just to make sure that they were open. A woman answered, said \"Please hold!\" What I didn't know was that she meant for ME to continue to hold because she was not coming back to the phone.  I kept holding and holding, when we arrived, we waited for about 6 minutes..When the gentleman ask for our order, I jokingly stated that I am still holding and waiting on the phone (09:45 minutes later)..he looked down at their phone, saw that a call was holding (yeah, that was me), he hung up the phone and sarcastically said, \"Well, you're here now, what is your order?\"  It goes without saying that I refused to place an order, but my friend did place 2 orders. As I looked around the place, there was this huge bucket in the middle of the floor because the ceiling was leaking (not very appealing if one is trying to enjoy a meal).  I will not ever visit this place again...Not sure how the food taste, but if it is a reflection on how a 1st time Customer was treated....then it must not be prepared very well."}
{"text":"Cool place but I gotta be real about the ramen.. Very expensive and it looked so yummy but was utterly disappointing and not worth trying! Ramen is one of my favorites so I was bummed. Their donuts are BOMB! Chicken was also disappointing :/ but still a cool place and cool people! Just not good Ramen."}
{"text":"I must of went on a bad day because these donuts are not good. The banana cream donut tasted weird. A mixture of perfume and wet dog. My husband spit it out. Even my 2 year old son spit out the sprinkle donut. It was very disappointing"}
{"text":"Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a much-needed foodie paradise! Not knowing what to expect, I was thinking chicken and donuts would be a take on chicken and waffles -- the flavors and quality of the food were insanely better! This is a place that FOODIES WILL LOVE! (We certainly did!) Don't go here if you are expecting KFC, Waffle House, Dunkin Donuts-type fare. This is not a fast food joint and if that's what you like to eat then you certainly will not be able to appreciate the complexity of delicious flavors this place has to offer.   The chicken is local, fresh, not full of hormones, and unbleached! Incredibly rare to find eating out! The flavors were incredible -- I liked the Korean Chili the best. The sides to go along with the fried chicken are unique and delicious! And the cake donut on the side was surprisingly-perfect with the food! We even got toddy (cold-brewed coffee) that was tasty and cheap and learned it is locally brewed in Phoenix too!   I'm really excited to try some of the gourmet flavors of donuts that they offer. They look like something out of cupcake bakery that you would find in San Francisco - not something typical for Phoenix at all. This place has no snottie vibe either! Just real people creating epic food with epic quality!  We'll be bringing my mother-in-law along next time for sure! This place really does have something to offer everyone!"}
{"text":"Food is always some of the most delicious. Doughnuts are amazing and have a ton of unique varieties for their flavor. Service is always great they make you feel like you're a friend that's welcome. Guess that's why it's called welcome."}
{"text":"Chicken is some of the best around town.  Donuts are creative and tasty.  Get there now!!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Stellar service. Had the plain chicken and it was perfect.  Also ordered the welcome griddle. It's was more on the charred side but I didn't mind. Donuts are so good too. The maple sauce is creamy and delicious. Wish I lived here to come more often."}
{"text":"I went this morning -- my second visit -- specifically for coffee and a doughnut. Despite being right down the road from work, I don't envision a return trip anytime soon.   My first visit weeks ago was for lunch and a chicken combo. I got the chicken plain with BBQ on the side since I like my chicken sparely sauced but I ended up more in the mood for just plain ol' fried chicken, so I set the sauce aside and dove in. Bad move: The chicken was unseasoned. I mean there wasn't a grain of salt to be found anywhere near it. Nor did I detect any pepper or garlic or any spice. There wasn't even a salt shaker on the table. As another reviewer noted, this might because the sauces are apparently so flavorful that the good folks at Welcome don't want the bird to be overly seasoned, but the chicken was practically inedible by itself. It was crispy but in a heavy, overly greasy way, not in a fresh-fried way. I guess the double-frying method helps it stand up to the sauce but it just tasted like oil to me. The cucumber salad was refreshing, thought. I forget what flavor doughnut I got then -- some kind of berry-flavored iced thing -- which should tell you how memorable it was.   This morning I got a cardamom sugar doughnut and a 12-ounce coffee. They were OK but a few things ruined the taste for me:   1. The smell of the shop was rancid. I don't know if the grease trap overflowed last night or the refrigerator broke down over the weekend and all the chicken went bad or what, but one whiff of the putrid stench inside almost made me turn around. I stood in front of the display case trying to decide what awesome-looking doughnut to get but my appetite was disappearing with each minute I stood there.   2. I paid $3.58 for a 12-counce coffee and a glorified sugar doughnut. The doughnut was just fine but honestly, it's nothing special. The coffee was even more forgettable. I guess if I'm going to spend up to $3 on a doughnut, I want it to be noteworthy. In a good way, not the way it was for me this morning.   So, dear reader, be cautious of all the reviewers here and otherwise who are tripping over themselves to see how many times they can use the word \"amazing\" to describe what is pretty much a serviceable if smelly doughnut shop. Truth be told, I'll most likely give them another shot but if it's as rank then as it was this morning, I'll get my doughnut fix on Friday mornings when someone in the office usually swings by Bosa and brings in a box."}
{"text":"This place put a bad taste in my mouth before I even tried the donuts. I was looking forward to trying it, and the person working the counter seemed happy and nice. When she was flirting with the guy in front of me. He walked away she looked at me and her face dropped, her tone turned monotone. It was weird! Um, yeah, it was like she knew me (never met her), and did not like me. Their \"almost always\" in stock donuts as advertised on their website, were almost all gone (one of the kinds listed on their site was there). She had a full rack of donuts behind her, that had to have been reserved for special orders (right?), because she told me all she had was what was in the cases. I regretfully bought a donut. Meh, it was not worth the hype, and in retrospect considering how off putting this woman was, I wish I'd just walked out without getting anything. I was summarily dismissed when she flipped the pay pad around for me to select a tip amount (yeeeeah, no) and turned to the next person in line. Few things are worth being treated with such disdain, a four dollar donut is not one of them. They should take \"welcome\" out of their name, because I felt anything but."}
{"text":"Came back and tried the Japanese BBQ and a cardamom sugar donut. So good! I love it. Even when the person in front of me took the last two blueberry cocoa nib donuts even though my wife wanted one and asked for it. No big deal. Next time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place I went for the chicken breast with Korean Chili Sauce w/miso butter corn and a Maple Bacon Donut! Top notch, the chicken was so good and juicy. Loved the side and definitely the donut! I will definitely back in the very near future for some more good food. Have to get there early because they sell out fast...So you know it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Tried it due to recommendations from friends and was highly skeptical upon arrival. To say it's not fancy or formal would be an understatement (but it is VERY clean). The food was incredible. Best donuts I've ever had - fresh, big and some really great flavor varieties.  The fried chicken was excellent - not overly breaded and very fresh. They use fresh chicken and never freeze and everything is cooked to order.  The staff is friendly, knowledgable and helpful.  And it's INEXPENSIVE! You need to try this place - someone in the kitchen really has talent."}
{"text":"Fully backing @welcomechickenanddonuts Just devoured the Lassi doughnut. I took my friend  yesterday, for her first time and made her buy me a couple doughnuts for later; thanks girl. The sweats aren't the only amazing thing this place offers; their fried chicken is the best, and they serve toddy. Sorry LoLo's there's a new #1 fried chicken place in the valley."}
{"text":"I found about this place through the staff at the Welcome Diner, which I love. The doughnuts here have to be the best yet. They have so many different doughnut flavors/combinations! I have yet to try the chicken or ramen, but they look just as good! The place itself is small and a little far south, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Crispy crispy crispy! This is my favorite fried chicken in town. Oh, the skin and crust is the stuff of dreams. The meat itself really tastes free range, organic. It's toothy and delicious without the bloat of grocery rotisserie birds. The plain cake doughnut that comes with the combo is the perfect compliment. It's slightly sweet and lemony with a bite on the exterior and a soft mellow center.   We get Vietnamese sauce on the side and Thai slaw. But it's all really about the chicken and donuts!! And those donuts- delectable! The yeast version has a glorious texture and amazing flavors. Not too sweet. Different choice each time we've been.   Hint - if you are getting two combos you might as well get the whole combo and an extra doughnut. You won't regret the extra chicken for just a few dollars more!"}
{"text":"I do not understand these glowing reviews.  A couple of Saturdays back, I decided to be adventurous and go to Welcome Chicken and Donuts.  When I arrived, the place was packed, with a line out the door.  I thought to myself \"that's a good sign\".  As I got close to the counter, I started checking out the donuts, which actually looked great.  There were a bunch of interesting flavor combinations, so I opted for a full dozen so we could try the full array of their donuts.    The person behind the counter told me that I was going to make somebody very happy when I get home .... then told me it was $27.00 .... not kidding .... $27.00 ... for donuts.  Okay, I can afford that, so I took my dozen donuts and headed home.   I arrive home, and grab a couple small plates, a knife, some napkins, and a small trash can for waste (I had no idea yet of how inportant that last item would be).   My wife and I sat down, and cut thr first donut in half.  We both took a bite .... and we both simultaneously cringed.     YUCK!     The donut tasted horrible.  First off, they tasted more like bread than a donut.  It wasn't just the lack of sweetness of the donut, but it's breadlike consistency (heavy, firm, chewy).  So into the trashcan, and onto the next donut .... and again YUCK ... and again .... and again .... and again, until we had tasted all 12 donuts (and actually not one swallowed bite between the two of us).  So here is the part of this story where I make somebody really happy, just like the counter person predicted.  I dumped the donut remains in the main garbage can, then took the bag out and double bagged it (to make sure they never get out, or poison an animal), then took it out front to our garbage can.  And my wife could not be happier!!!  I have not tried the chicken (and will not, due to the way the donuts worked out).  I do not understand all of these glowing reviews.   Place appears to be some sort of Hipster Cult home I guess.   You've been warned.   DO NOT DRINK THE KOOLAID AND DO NOT EAT THE DONUTS!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw them on the news Sat morning & went the next morning because I love places that do unusual things like this. About 11ish Got the breast, thigh, drum combo. Totally should have had sauce on the side as it took over for the flavor if the chicken so I don't know how that tastes alone. It was soft & juicy inside though. I liked the variety of unusual flavors of the doughnuts but they just weren't what I was hoping for. On top yes crazy things but inside just a plain old basic doughnut. I was hoping for Krispy Kreme soft with some big bold flavor n I didn't get it. Now I will give them another try but living in the West valley I won't go out of my way like I did this time. Hopefully next time around I'll be better."}
{"text":"i found this place thru Instagram. looked through the pics and I was like people look happy here and the food looks delicious so why not try it out. the happy people and the mean muggers behind the registers did not match up. but let's talk about food first. I didn't think this place would have really good ramen. the donut is pretty good as well. the chicken are flavorful but not overwhelming. the first time I got the chicken was the Korean chicken and that was really good. I thought it was going to be overkill since there was so much sauce on it. but the flavoring wasn't as strong as I thought it would be. the second time I tried the regular fried chicken, it was good until i notice it was a little undercooked. so I just threw it out. the only bad thing about this place is the place smell like oil from all the deep frying, kind of intoxicating. I usually have to eat out side to avoid the deep fried oil fragrance. the service isn't too great as well. the people behind the register can be friendlier, seem like they don't want to be there. At first I was like maybe they were just having a bad day on my first visit. yup, wasn't too fond on my second visit either. the only pleasant customer service I received was from the person who deliver the food. I found it odd that when they talk among them self on the back it's a whole different attitude than what was projected to the customers."}
{"text":"The cashier's service skills are severely lacking, however the guys in the back are great. Food was fine but not worth the price. Chicken isn't served until 10:30am which is a bummer and the experience I had isn't going to bring me back to try the chicken."}
{"text":"I found Welcome Chicken and Donuts on a \"Best of\" Phoenix list for our vacation. I am so glad I did! The chocolate donut was the best one I've ever had in my life! We went out of our way to come back to it again before our vacation was over because it was that good! We felt the prices were very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"You're in town....try it. You're a local...try it.  We got Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese and Buffalo chicken, Kimchi spring rolls and Tonkotus Ramen, apple fritter and two cake donuts(yeah, 5 fatasses whatever). The batter was perfectly seasoned and crisp. The flavors of the Korean, Japanese and especially fishiness of the Vietnamese were so wonderful that my go-to Buffalo seemed plain for once haha.   Apple fritter was a bit overdone, Tonkotsu was nothing to brag about (lacked the rich pork bone flavor...but that's something you've got to dedicate so much time to) but the fried chicken, which is why you should be there, was so phenomenal I have no qualms giving it a five."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken. Very crispy. Excellent customer service! Austin went above and beyond. Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Where to start, cooking is my career and I love eating. I've had fried chicken in many places but this one, this one was different and very special. The chicken was juicy and the skin crispy and well seasoned.. Front of the house staff was great and friendly. First time here, my family and I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place. Omg this place is the best. Their chicken is juicy and full of flavor, their donuts are the best in Phoenix. The staff is great and make you feel great"}
{"text":"Had the chicken with Korean sauce and the Thai slaw today with my wife and found it to be exceptional in flavor and tenderness ! Have had they're donuts before and they are amazing also, unique flavors and great quality ! Sure would love them to open another location in downtown Gilbert. ..."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and delicious donuts! The apple fritter cajeta is fantastic! And the coffee is one of the things that brings us back- super smooth, doesn't even need cream!"}
{"text":"Chicken was undercooked, bloody and the cashier's were rude. Overrated in my opinion. Not worth the hype it was given."}
{"text":"Soooooo.....I really really wanted to like this place, but Headed over around lunch time, but clearly b4 11:30am. The smell and presentation of the food was very intoxicating. The taste and combination was everything till....BLOOD started oozing out of my drumstick....I was okay like me try my Korean Chili one instead and the same FREAKIN THING,...boy was I pissed the freak off...the came over to explain because the meat is so fresh blah blah blah blah IDGAF how fresh it is...the meat CHICKEN should not be BLEEDING..I am not talking about a little red, but blood as if I cut my fingers. My trainee had a thigh and was like I'm good then within seconds her meat also filled up with blood. The sauce was so good that I initially asked for them to cook it longer, but the said if they did the meat would BLEED MORE...WTFIRECRACKER...so they offered up the a Chicken Breast and said it rarely happens to that piece of meat...I wish you all could se me face...all I could think about was what if a child was eating this meat...what if I was so blinded by this sauce and kept on eating and gotten really sick. Sheesh...I must admit that I'm torn from chicken for a few weeks, but that MAPLE BACON DONUT was THE TRUTH. But the blood results in 1 star :-("}
{"text":"I thought Rosco's Chicken and Waffles in LA was amazing eats, well this place is right up there.  Rosco's is straight southern flavors and  Welcome Chicken and Donuts is a fabulous Asian fusion flair. We made sure to come at 10:30 because that's when you can get chicken. I am so happy we waited, it was worth it. Also I could see coming for coffee and donuts in the morning because there were so many flavors of donuts to try. If you are in Phoenix this is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I could see it from the airplane when I was landing in Phoenix. Chef Michael babcock is the truth. I wish I was still in town to grab some more."}
{"text":"Save your money! Chicken was very bland and sauces not very good. Our chicken happened to be so undercooked it was bloody. Donuts were ok. Was very excited to come here but completely let down...bummer!"}
{"text":"I've loved Welcome Diner for a while, and I'm really excited that the Welcome team has this spot up and running.  Welcome's fried chicken has been a bright spot on the menu at their original spot, and I think the chicken here is even better. 10$ for the 3 piece combo gets you a pretty hefty serving. I've had both the spicy Korean and Thai fish sauces, and I think the Korean shines the brightest. It's more balanced than I had expected, with just the right amount of spice, acidity, sweetness, and funk. Some reviewers have found the chicken to be undercooked, and they're welcome to head to any number of spots that will serve them chalky birds. This is properly prepared, juicy, flavorful chicken.   The sides are fresh and tasty. The miso corn is my favorite. It's super crunchy and nicely sweet and salty.   I've only had the plain cake donuts that come along with the combo meals, and they're much better than they should be. My girlfriend doesn't like donuts, but these were crispy, lightly sweet, and nicely cakey numbers that are really satisfying without being overly sweet, and we both agreed that they are among the best we've had.  Long story short: This place is great, and I'm happy to have it downtown."}
{"text":"This place is a gift from the heavens.   I would like to offer a suggestion as to what to get when you go to Welcome, but unfortunately I have no suggestion because you cannot go wrong. Here are some of my favorites though:  1) The Chicken- I'm fairly certain that the chicken was raised in the Garden of Eden and prepared by Chuck Norris and Beyoncé. It's perfect. Upon taking a bite of this chicken, you experience an ecstasy that sends shivers through your spine. You experience a change that rocks you to the core of your being. You become a savage, ravenously devouring bite after bite with reckless abandon. After returning from this out of body experience, you are left panting, covered head to toe in Korean Chili sauce, and begging for more. This chicken will haunt your dreams; it will fill your thoughts; it might even threaten your dearest relationships because it is the only thing that satisfies you anymore.   2) The Iced Toddy- I want to fill a bathtub with this liquid gold so I can soak in it. A taste of this divine beverage is like the first day of spring after a long, cold winter. When you thought that the world was left hopeless following the death of the King of Pop, Blue House Coffee brought us hope in the form of an iced, caffeinated beverage. Imagine the edginess of \"Bad\", the simplicity of \"Black or White \", and the pure joy of \"Man in the Mirror.\" Now take all of those feelings and put them into a cup of coffee. That is Blue House's iced toddy: the reincarnation of Michael Jackson's music.  3) Every Donut- The donuts are freedom. With ever bite, you find yourself feeing more alive. Like up to this point, everything seemed ok, but now that you have taken a bite from this donut, you know what pure joy tastes like. The case is like a portal into a newfound happiness.   Go to Welcome Chicken + Donuts. It's amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been so excited to try this place! We are loyal customers at Welcome Diner and couldn't wait to get over here. We got here about 25min before they started serving chicken. We ordered the maple bacon donut (duh) and the blueberry cream cheese donut. Maple bacon was deeeeelicious. The frosting (especially the blueberry cream cheese) was super sweet, one bite at a time, we barely finished them. The fresh coffee helped wash them down! We ended up waiting until the chicken was being served (ThankGod we did). I don't know where to start or end on this stuff, the outside was fried to perfection without being too greasy, or salty it was seasoned to perfection and fried at the perfect temperature (I really appreciate the love they put into their chickens). Once you get inside, the chicken was so tender and moist it melted in my mouth! We tried both the Japanese bbq and Vietnamese sauce (on the side) they were very good but very strong in flavor I loved the chicken so much I didn't think it needed sauce! This was definitely worth the drive we will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts and chicken served by nice folks. Avoid the thighs if you don't like a little blood. Supposedly it appends because the chicken is organic. The donuts are also made from organically sourced ingredients. Nice outdoor area with a misting system."}
{"text":"My second time eating here and it was definitely a much better experience. I ordered the chicken breast combo and it was delivered to our table outside very quickly. Thanks Welcome Chicken & Donuts!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken and even better donuts. Had the Japanese BBQ chicken and the flavors were outstanding. Will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Chicken and doughnuts were delicious and everything was priced fair.  I wish more places would operate like this.    Only complaint which isn't just here it's at a lot of places(and not their fault) I wish these small and popular restaurants would not let their customers claim a table before they order.  Its not fair to those that have ordered and some that even have food in hand but no place to sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"I am only rating their donuts. I ordered donuts via Postmates. $27 for a dozen donuts! Wow. If it's that expensive, it must be delicious! Uh No. It's just not good. NOT AT ALL. I didn't even finish the 1/2 of the 3 donuts I tried. Other reviews report good chicken so I might still give this place a try. But stay away from the donuts!"}
{"text":"Came across this place on Instagram and stopped by when I was on that side of town. The guy at the counter was super helpful, which I appreciated being my first time.  I wanted their egg rolls but they were sold out so I went for ramen. It wasn't for me, but hey, I tried it. The doughnuts I got were awesome, I will definitely be back for more when I'm near by again. I think they have a unique vibe, a little pricey but overall I'm glad I stopped to try it."}
{"text":"The people who worked there were friendly and gave great recommendations. Everything we got was delish. The patio seemed like a place to enjoy your meal if it wasn't summer time. The location however confuses me... It's in the legit ghetto. That is no exaggeration. It's surrounded by a really poor neighborhood. If I didn't have a male with me I don't think I would have gone."}
{"text":"10+ times eating here, and Welcome Chicken + Donuts is superb every time (with an understandable exception and a slight disclaimer noted below).  I first heard about Welcome Chicken + Donuts from Welcome Diner (same owners).  My first time in I ordered the Korean chili chicken. I returned the following day to eat the same thing and my next few visits were also for the Korean chili chicken. It has an amazing taste and quality to it. The sauce topped with fresh green onions over crispy and moist fried chicken is pure excellence.  To this day it's one of my favorite foods and continues to impress me. My disclaimer is that I've never tried any of the other chicken sauces (Japanese BBQ or Vietnamese Herbs), so my review is somewhat incomplete in this sense. In my experience the folks at Welcome can do no wrong when it comes to food, so I trust the other sauces would be good, but the Korean chili is too compelling for me to bother trying anything else. I enjoy the sides that come with the chicken, particularly the Thai Yum Slaw. The sides add a nice dose of healthy to the meal and each has a unique taste. A+++++ lunch spot if you enjoy spicy chicken (it's not terribly spicy, but there's a kick to it).  I'm not big on doughnuts, so it took me until they started serving their breakfast sandwiches (which aren't on the main menu) all day on the weekends to realize that they had more than doughnut options for breakfast. The SXSW breakfast sandwich with bacon is delicious. It contains a soft-fried egg, cheese, your choice of bacon or sausage, and a jalapeno sauce served between a sliced plain cake doughnut. The flavors mesh together really well and it's different than what you'd find at a typical breakfast restaurant. I love it and often make breakfast trips here just for the SXSW.  This brings up my biggest complaint about Welcome Donuts. (I call this place Welcome Donuts if I'm going for breakfast and Welcome Chicken for lunch/chicken.) They seem to run out of plain cake doughnuts for this breakfast sandwich frequently. It's happened twice where they were out and couldn't make the sandwich and once when I had to wait for a new batch that was being made. It definitely stinks when you make the trip specifically for this item and then it's not available at 10:00 AM on a Sunday (fortunately it's only a 7 minute trip for me.) That being said, this place hasn't been around for that long and I fully expect them to get better at having a supply ready. I do appreciate that everything is freshly made using locally sourced ingredients, enough to understand their being unable to make a breakfast sandwich sometimes.  Welcome Donuts gets a lot of press for their doughnuts, and for good reason. They are freshly made in house the day you order them and there are always several varieties to choose from. I love seeing them on display as you might see art on display. I have ordered some doughnuts, and when I do I typically enjoy them although a couple varieties have been a miss for me. On the other hand, the sweet corn and rosemary doughnut is incredibly good. I never would've tried it based on the name, but the guy at the counter recommended it to the customer ahead of me as their best doughnut in the display. Welcome Donuts are also served at DeSoto Central Market, which is perfect for me since I enjoy working in the atmosphere of DeSoto.  Everything about Welcome is great. I mainly focused on their food, but their service and local  community support is just as good. Most of the times I'm in Welcome Chicken + Donuts I'm asked by an employee or manager how I liked the food. Their passion for food and welcoming (get it?) customers goes a long way to create an awesome business I love to support. It's also cool how their restaurants are both in less-frequented areas and uplift the neighborhoods they enter. Their chicken is purchased whole and fresh from a local Arizona farm. Other ingredients are directly sourced as well. The owners love Phoenix and it shows. They have created two great local restaurants and I heard they're looking to open a third one, which I'm excited for. Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a Phoenix staple serving some of the best food possible, and it certainly deserves its name, \"Welcome.\""}
{"text":"I travel often seeking unique and culinarily sound cuisine done right, and this place fits the bill. My girlfriend and I arrived at noon on a Sunday and found the place packed. Tight indoor quarters with seating for 20 and a beautiful outdoor space with seating for an additional 50.   This place is absolutely fantastic. They were serving ten different donuts; I had the Maple Bacon donut which was a harmonious combination of sweet and salty. The chicken was some of the best I've ever had; and for those seeking a delicious cruelty-free meal, their chicken is humane, never frozen, antibiotic free, free range chicken.  The sides offered that day included a Thai Slaw that was sweet and tangy and went perfect with the chicken. I ordered an iced coffee that was dispensed through a tap and given condensed milk and sugar syrup as fixings; truly the greatest way to enhance any iced coffee in Vietnamese fashion.   The service was exemplary; received food in less than ten minutes. Everything was prepared with class and simplicity combining high quality ingredients on a made-to-order basis. Would go back every week if this were my home town and state. This is a Phoenix gem and should be greatly appreciated by the locals; although there seems to be plenty of support for this amazingly creative and expressive establishment already.   Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential. However, it falls short of expectations for lunch. First, I must admit their donuts are really good. I have tried their various flavors and classics. Each donut hits the mark and is by no means disappointing. This is the main reason I awarded any stars.  Their chicken is a different story though. I had the spicy Korean sauce on my chicken. It was beyond salty. I like salty food but this was too much even for me. My friend had their sauce on the side and I discovered by trying their chicken without the sauce is still just too salty. Adding the sauce made it even more salty. This was also true for the side dish I chose as well. The corn I had was beyond salty as well. It was a disappointing experience for lunch. However, donuts may be  a possibility in the morning."}
{"text":"Love this place! Decided to try it before it got super crazy.  Breakfast---The donuts were yummy, tried a few of them. Maple/bacon, donut sandwich, chipotle limon, and classic chocolate. All were delicious! I can't pick a favorite so don't make me! We had some coffee and then we made a plan to return for lunch.  Lunch--- the line was a lot longer and it was significantly busier. We tried two chicken combos with different sauces- Japanese Bbq and Korean Chili. Chicken was crispy and juicy inside. Sauces were on point and the cake donut was to die for. The sides, slaw and cucumbers just added to the flavors. Yumm yumm! Reminded me of the mix of flavors in Roy Choi's food.  My only complaint is the girl that helped us BOTH times. When we told her it was our first time, she didn't care, no suggestions, no nothing, just a blank stare. We felt like we were bothering her with our menu questions and taking up her precious time. However, when she helped an unaccompanied male she was all smiles. Huh? I will say that the other guys at the register and in the back were very pleasant. Smiling and thanking everyone for waiting. You  can tell that they enjoy cooking and sharing their food.  Either way--- going back for sure... Just crossing my fingers I get one of the guys to help me!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been rendered speechless by a piece of chicken? If your answer is no, you've been eating the wrong chicken, and you need to get yourself to Chicken + Donuts.   We came on a Saturday for lunch and each enjoyed a combo of the two piece chicken and a donut, plus a side. We both got Korean chili chicken, I got the balsamic pear donut and my husband got the chocolate pistachio rose donut. I got the cucumber salad side and my husband got the slaw.   It was ridiculous.   The chicken was perfectly crispy but surprisingly light and juicy covered in an amazing spicy sweet Korean sauce garnished with scallions, and after I had my first bite, I couldn't talk. You know when you're sitting around the table with your family and your mom made your favorite dish and somebody goes, \"it must be good, the whole table went silent!\"? It was like that, but in an old booth in a renovated KFC serving the best food I've eaten all year.   The donuts were exquisite. The artisan donuts that this unassuming place pumps out... I can't comprehend it. My pear balsamic donut had a great natural pear flavor with a tart/sweet thing going on that ruled. My husbands chocolate pistachio rose donut was my favorite though, for the salty/sweet plus crunch deal. It was just all so good.   tl;dr: this place is unassuming perfection with the best chicken I've ever eaten, a great outdoor space, good donuts and Stevie Wonder on the speakers. It's a must."}
{"text":"OMG! Fantastic! I had the South by Southwest. It was amazing.  I travel quite a bit, so I am always looking for local restaurants. This one is a keeper!  Very friendly service and the food came out fast!"}
{"text":"Excellent donuts with the most unique choices of flavors!  I buy a dozen \"fancy\" donuts here and bring them into work quite often and I have never heard one negative comment about them. I've eaten here on the patio a number of times - still not one complaint.   Yes, the place is small, crowded, noisy, and in an interesting location, but if that bothers you that much....go to Starbucks Princess and have your scone there.  More room and donuts for me...."}
{"text":"Stopped here after flying into Phoenix. Food was out fast and tasted great! Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"A strong five-star from me.    Pros:  Menu Flavors Execution Service  Cons: Ambiance  Can be crowded  Surely a gem!  I enjoyed a chicken breast combo with a chocolate turtle doughnut & grapefruit mimosa doughnut with a cold brew.   My friend & I chatted for over an hour and the staff cleared our plates and even took a photo of us together.  Great doughnut flavors!!!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in PHX with snappy sauces (best on the side), thoughtful sides, good ramen, and donuts that would be described as whimsical if they weren't so legit."}
{"text":"BEWARE!  In-store prices for the 2 and 3 piece chicken (and whatever else) are up by $1 and that's NOT reflected on their website as of today. Why Not?  To Catholics, that's called a Sin Of Omission. For others, it's Bait And Switch.  Yeah, it's only a buck, but I thought $10 was enough already for for three pieces of chicken, plain donut, small side. NOTE TO OWNER: If you really need the extra money, have the courtesy to post CURRENT prices online, where many of your customers come from.  MEN'S ROOM: toilet not thoroughly cleaned from day before. TABLE: Sticky. Laminated \"Our Story\" card grossly dirty.  GINGER SCALLION CUKE SALAD: Revoltingly salty, 1 single GRAIN of ginger; no scallion. This should be SO good, SO simple. You made it horrible. Fix this.   And what's with the rack of many, many chicken parts (200-300?) standing in the middle of the kitchen ? This seems a permanent location for said segments, based on past visits at various times. Is your entire kitchen heated to the correct \"holding\" temperature, or what?   My chicken was tough and dry. Why did you forget how to cook it? Was it REALLY \"made today\"?  The sauce, corn, and donut were delicious. The service female was outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a donut connoisseur. I had a cake donut during my first visit, but went back again to try the raised kind. I would rank these donuts higher than Dunkin or a supermarket bakery, but I don't think they come close to the taste and texture of lots of other small shops. Maybe it's due to the non-GMO organics stuff, or the recipe, I don't know.  And the cheapest \"standard\" donut is $1.75. A dozen is $17. Specialty donuts are even more. I cannot regularly buy donuts at these prices.  As for the chicken, it's pretty good. The sauces and sides are really good though! One complaint is that I could not find a la cart prices for just a piece of chicken.   I will probably be back to try the ramen, which they seem to have on weekends, but it is $14, which is more than ramen costs in established ramen restaurants in big cities, so my expectations are high."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts. Period.   A few donuts to-go, including the chipotle limon, ginger coconut, and the horchata. I'll be back!  *the chipotle limon didn't make it home for the picture*"}
{"text":"If you love fried chicken, this is the place.  Great chicken, friendly service, a must have for any trip to/from the Phoenix Airport."}
{"text":"I went into here this past Friday thinking to myself chicken and donuts how unique is that; makes one think of a LoLo's spinoff. I spent rounded up $9.00 on a chicken thigh and drumstick with a cucumber salad. Not only was it overpriced for those two pieces, but it look as if the chicken was cooked too fast in old oil and not long enough. When I bite into the chicken it had an aftertaste and was pink with a tinge of blood inside. I expected more from an establishment serving food. When I tried to contact them shortly after the blood tinged chicken my call went unanswered after several attempts."}
{"text":"This place is great, I have been twice now and I had the same thing (once with bacon and once with sausage), rare for me but don't know when I will get back there again. I love the south by southwest egg sandwich on a cake donut, it is awesome, especially the spicy jalapeño relish! The doughnuts are good too, but I am really not much of a doughnut nut honestly.  I do like the maple bacon ones the best.  The chicken looks amazing but they don't sell it till lunch even though it is clearly ready quite early.  Staff is nice and service is good.  They sell beer too, beer and doughnuts are a very fun combo in the morning..."}
{"text":"I rave to everyone I know about the vegan donuts here.  Possibly the best I've ever had, especially that apple fritter.  Brought my Omni friend recently, he had the vegan ramen and couldn't stop raving about it as well.  I decided to try the cauliflower on suggestion of the cashier and it was delicious even without any sauce.  Though the portion is a bit small.  I noticed the ramen looked smaller than the last time I ordered it, too (though last time I could barely finish half, the portion was huge).  The cashier was super helpful, suggested some vegan sides and sauce as well.  I was disappointed they didn't have an vegan donuts on a Thursday but he explained they have to make the doughs separately, which is understandable, but he commiserated with me, gave me extra sauce for free, and suggested that weekends are a good time to get the vegan donuts.  I love the outdoor seating, they have misters and lots of shade which made it feel much cooler than the 100 degree heat outside.  I also love the inclusive bathrooms.  I'll be back probably today for some ramen and donuts!  Excellent customer service, delicious food, nice seating, what else could you want?"}
{"text":"I went there today with a few friends from work and I have to say I am quite disappointed. I got the 2 piece drum and thigh combo with Japanese bbq and it comes with 1 donut and a side. The donut I had was a maple bacon and the side was corn stir fry. The donut was ok, but the bacon was dry like salad bacon bits. I took a bite on the corn and I was done. Now time for the main dish, the chicken. The Japanese bbq had a weird kick to it and the chicken itself was raw and had some blood on the meat...ugh. I could barely finished it and the meal came out to around $11. It was totally not worth it and you're better off eating at Popeyes for better chicken for half the price."}
{"text":"Excellent: The fried chicken was perfect.  Crispy on the outside with a nice crunchy texture and amazingly tender on the inside.  Delicious!  The plain cake donut, which comes with the combo, was very tasty and light.  We loved it.  Good: I've never had a coleslaw that has wowed me, but the Thai Slaw was really good!  It was flavorful, not spicy (as you might think from the name), and not too sweet.  We'll definitely have it again.  Meh: You can get your fried chicken \"naked\" or with one of three sauces.  We each tried the Vietnamese with spices.  Nothing distinctive really stood out about the sauce and it was a little salty for our taste.  We'll be trying one of the other sauces, or go naked, on our next visit.  We will definitely be coming back!  The decor on the inside was bright and comfortable with local pictures and some local history.  Even better, they were not laying music on top of the natural noise of conversation and what is basically an open kitchen.  You can have a conversation in a relatively normal tone of voice - yeah!  Outside seating is shaded and is comprised of a very nice picnic table style setup.  A nice feature is that it is wheelchair compatible as the benches do not run the length of the tables.  Facing North you get a an up close view of planes landing and taking off, and towards the South a nice view of South Mountain.  We're looking forward to trying out breakfast and getting there before they sell out of yeast donuts!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today because of the rave review from my sons father.... (Maybe he was tricking me)...anywho, I ordered 6 Korean chili wings, Thai slaw and a maple bacon donut. My son got just a plain drum and a glazed donut.......oh, and a $2 can of soda.  We received our donuts and went outside....my son tried his and immediately spit it out...he's 7 & a sugar fiend, wtf? So I tried it and it tasted like straight up yeast. My maple bacon donut was good though....kinda a lot of bacon but good.   Then, we received our chicken. Opened my box and the wings were full on wings....not cut. Not a big deal.....but I was disappointed. They were freaking good, lots of sauce, crispy on the outside and then.......there was raw chicken.  I'm kinda curious to know if the owner ever gets annoyed having to write the same rebuttal for every bad review... \"Organic\",\"red bird farms\",\"cooked to 165\",\"safe to eat\"........  I'm sorry but If I see blood or any pink in my chicken, I'm done! I Immediately looked at my sons chicken and yeah, a tad bloody. I understand that maybe it's the age (young) of the chicken that is being used that causes this and the chicken is actually safe to eat....maybe start using granny chickens?  Seriously though, there has to be a solution to this issue as it's just not appetizing to see blood in the chicken you're about to consume...."}
{"text":"If I lived here, this joint would be my go to place... The food and customer service is OUTSTANDING! The fried chicken is flawless, finger lickin good to the bone and to the last bite - packed with flavor and amazingness! From the homemade sauces and sides to the off the charts Fresh and SCRATCH made, gourmet donuts this place will blow your mind! A definite party in your mouth and a must first or last stop to or from the airport. You will not regret it!!! Yumzville to the max!!!! Quality + Originality = Success !!! I can't wait to try Welcome Diner!!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet, but the donuts are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Showed up and all they had was 2 different donuts available. I showed up at 8am. They said that had technical difficulties."}
{"text":"Amazing and creative food. The donuts are spectacular. The chicken is amazing. The crusty, flavorful breaking is indescribable. So tasty. The chicken breast is super thick and juicy. Love it. Make sure you check this place out. They are always coming up with awesome specials that I've never seen anywhere else. Very unique concept restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Delicious chicken, fried cauliflower was Outstanding!!wonderful service and the donuts are amazing!! Try the Thai chili sauce!!! Will definitely be back next time we're in town!!!"}
{"text":"They added just a regular hot wing sauce which you can have on the side or (better yet) dipped. THIS WAS AMAZING."}
{"text":"The chicken and donuts are amazing. Ramen was disappointing...but the customer service is terrible.  The girl literally argued with me when I asked about a former menu item and then went in the back and was snickering. It's a shame that the employees can't be on the same level as the chicken."}
{"text":"Came here with my sister and MAN! it was packed! After coming out on the news as best donuts, they have been selling out donuts like hotcakes every 10 minutes. I tried their Korean style fried chicken. As a Korean, I would have to say it was refreshing to see Korean style fried chicken. The chicken was a different caliber of quality (very good) and it was fried amazingly. When youre eating this chicken, you realize you are not in KFC. However, the sauce was pretty close to what Koreans do. All in all, amazing place to try and so glad PHX is moving on up like the Jeffersons in the cultural food scene."}
{"text":"This place was an old KFC that they turned into a cute, unassuming establishment that serves not only crispy fried CHICKEN but also crispy fried DONUTS!  For the FOOD I got the one piece korean chili sauced chicken with the corn miso side and the regular cake donut that the combo comes with. I loved the presentation of the chicken when it came out. It was evenly coated in the rich, red chili sauce and it was topped with fresh green onions. The chicken was super crispy and the sauce was a little spicy but too salty for me. I tried my friend's chicken and he got the viet sauce which I liked much better than my chili sauce.  I intended to save my palate by eating the miso corn side but that was surprisingly salty as well. FInally I reached for the cake donut and my taste buds profusely thanked me. Out of everything, the simple cake donut was the winner for me because it had a perfect balance of sweetness with a slightly crispy outer layer and dense chewy innards.   The ATMOSPHERE is very plain. You enter the restaurant and order at the counter. When they call your number you go back to the counter and pick up your food. They also offer water at the counter. FILL UP because you will need it to wash everything down.  I really wanted to love this place because they were successful on so many components in my book like creativity and simplicity; however, my main course was just too salty in general. I would say to stay away from the korean chili sauce and the corn because my friend's Viet chicken and thai slaw were much more balanced."}
{"text":"This review is for the donuts only - I have not yet tried the chicken. I plan on going back for a second chance and to try the chicken.  I really wanted to love this place based on all the reviews and the staff as well, but the donuts, while creative in idea just didn't wow me, but we're way better than average. I tried the following; chocolate pudding with red wine and Pinot noir salt, pistachio rose and chocolate, chocolate almond coconut, cardamom, maple ring.  The best was the maple ring-also the simplest. Great maple flavor and glaze.  The chocolate pudding was innovative but I just didn't love the overall combo- however the salt finish was great.  The cardamom was ok.  The chocolate coconut almond was also ok - high hopes but it didn't wow me.  The pistachio rose and chocolate was actually a very good combo but the rose was a lil too strong.  Great service overall and a cool place to try when by the airport.  I will definitely try them again and also try the chicken."}
{"text":"I woke up with a mean craving for chicken and waffles and no motivation to get in the kitchen whip some up. I hopped on yelp and tried the hot and new option, this was the first place that popped up. Granted it's not \"chicken and waffles\", but it was close enough for my craving. I knew as soon as I pulled up that I made the right decision. The aroma of fried chicken and fresh donuts oozing out of the place makes your mouth water before you even open your car doors. I got a half dozen premium donuts and a 12 wing order.  Pros:  -Everything was fresh, the donuts had just been made, I saw them bring out the chicken from the walk in and start frying it up. This isn't stuff that sits under a heating lamp. -Offers both indoor and outdoor seating -They offer flavored seasoning sauces for the fried chicken. -Awesome service and friendly employees  Cons: -I wanted to try two different sauces with my 12 wing order and the charged me for two 6 wing orders rather than one 12 wing order because it was an inconvenience for them. -The price is a little ridiculous. For 6 premium donuts and 12 wings I paid $26.  -The service is slower than I like. Not bad. Just a little slow.  With that being said, I'll definitely be going back for some more grub and recommending it to friends"}
{"text":"We tried this on a recent trip through Phoenix. The donuts were fantastic. Probably one of the best apple fritters I've had. Interesting selection of donuts, all gourmet flavors. The fried chicken was good, but not what I'd come back for. Be prepared to stand in line. You order at the counter then try and find a place to sit. Tables fill up as soon as someone leaves. Friendly staff working hard to take care of everyone."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for chicken. Chicken is super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Korean chili sauce was fantastic, waaay better than the Vietnamese sauce which was overly salty. Also make sure to get the corn stir fry as opposed to the cucumbers. A little disappointed they were out of maple bacon by noon considering it's supposedly one of their most popular you would think they'd make more. I took 2 stars away for their cleanliness, trash cans were overfilled with trash, like literally trash falling out of them, napkins and wet naps on the floors under the tables and the tables/booths needed a serious wipe down. Overall decent spot with great chicken at a good price but needs to be cleaner."}
{"text":"I only tried their donuts, but they do serve chicken and even ramen. It's an interesting mix, but a lot of people ordered the chicken.    I tried their original glaze, the hibiscus juniper and the apricot. The only one that stood out was the hibiscus juniper which I recommend getting. It's slightly tart and has a good berry flavor. The other ones were just okay, but the donut itself was fluffy and thick."}
{"text":"Wtf  where have you been all my life seriously this was the greatest Fried Chicken let's start with the crispy crunchy skin was wonderful the thai sauce that they put on it little sweet spicy Tangy flavor overload Japanese barbecue sauce was just as good kind of wish I didn't find this place think I'm going to get really fat coming here also had their apple fritter it was okay looked delicious but it was okay but the fried chicken is unbelievably good as I'm writing this right now my mouth is watering"}
{"text":"I came here around 1pm on a Wednesday, and the line wasn't bad. It went by pretty quickly, but almost all of their donuts (aside from the usual glaze, chocolate glaze, etc) were running out.   I ended up getting a dozen (mix of premium and non donuts = $25) to go to share with people later that day. For as much hype as this place gets, the donuts fell sort of flat. Some items you couldn't taste too much of the flavor (ex: maple lemon) - it just tasted like sugar - or others it was almost overwhelming (ex: raspberry vanilla and rum mojito are both pretty tart). Also, the red wine chocolate pudding one...does not contain a lot of pudding as an FYI.   I'm not sure if I would come back. Maybe you need to get the chicken and donut to get the whole experience, but the donut should stand on it's own too right? And hmm, I wasn't sold."}
{"text":"This is more like a 4.5 stars. I'm a donut fiend (please don't groan but I really did like donuts before this whole donut trend started. I mean, who doesn't like donuts??) so when I visited Phoenix last week, I had to check out a couple of donut places. As a lover of chicken and waffles, gotta say chicken and donuts as a concept is brilliant. This place won't win over my favorite Union Square Donuts in Somerville, MA, but it's a close second. We ordered chocolate rose pistachio  (the best), orange douglas fir (can't taste the fir but still good), and the maple cheddar (a bit underwhelming), and the chicken with Korean chilli sauce. The sauce is more sour than your typical Korean sauce with gochujang (and sugar/sesame etc.) but still very good (and it's NOT inauthentic as some other reviews claimed). The chicken was amazing - very crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Worth a stop if you're in town!"}
{"text":"We came to visit here from MONTANA, I believe it was the store on Roosevelt; OMG!!! Save me. I am totally in love with all of this food. Took donuts home...Xtra. The chicken with the light batter so tasty. And the Korean dipping sauce to die for. The donuts well like I said I took some home and eat 2. I want one of these in Billings Mt. PLEASE!!! Thanks for the fantastic customer service. Tammie."}
{"text":"I stopped by today on my way home from work  to try them before they close at 4:00 pm , I tried three drumsticks with a Vietnamese herb sauce and 2 donuts . The drumsticks came with a little side of coleslaw, I brought it home  and no really thought it was very good, the coleslaw looked brown so I threw it away . The kicker was that my little sample was $20.00! So I not going back ."}
{"text":"This a great spot for you foodies out there. The different combinations of donuts are amazing. They also have awesome fried chicken. The fried chicken is a wet batter chicken, if your familiar to a wet batter chicken then you know the skin will come out super crispy. I also ordered the welcome griddle with bacon. The combination of a maple glazed donut with an egg and sausage is so DELICIOUS!! The fried chicken also comes with different sauces for dipping which I passed on. If your ever around that area it is worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Quaint little hole in the wall with crazy fun food. Have to go back to try the chicken and Thai flavours."}
{"text":"Visited Welcome Chicken & Donuts a few weeks ago with my boyfriend. Cute little restaurant but limited seating. Coffee was pretty bitter which surprised me because everyone wants a good cup of coffee to go with their donut!!    The apple fritter was enormous and so delicious! I got a chicken breast with sweet chili sauce and it was off the hook! The skin was crunchy and the sauce was tasty. My boyfriend loved his thigh and drumstick but the drumstick needed about 2 more minutes cooking he said. I didn't the cucumber side but the corn was really good. I would visit again!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best fried chicken in Phoenix, with super crispy yet light skin, not too much grease, juicy and tender meat at the right hot temperature, and just the right amount of seasoning that obviates the need for any extra sauce, which you will have on hand anyway because the chicken will come with a side of sauce.  I usually stay away from breast and prefer dark meat, but all pieces of the bird were enjoyable and delicious.  You are paying a premium for the meal, so come to the restaurant expecting to pay a little extra, which in my opinion is totally worth it.  6 pieces + sauce = $18.  The chicken wings come in just as crispy and delicious, but they can be over-sauced and a little too heavy when compared to the fried chicken.  The Japanese BBQ and Korean chili flavors were tasty and authentic, and the Vietnamese herb sauce was interesting in a good way.  Again, a little less heavy hand when saucing the wings would've made the dish ideal.  But heavy sauce notwithstanding, biting into the freshly prepared, piping hot, and deliciously crispy wings just confirms that this restaurant knows how to cook up poultry.  12 wings + sauce + slaw + one cake donut = $13.  The cake donut that is served with the combos are plain, unglazed, and obviously of the cake variety, and it's passable, but I prefer the doughy donuts that are displayed at the register, which will set you back at least $2-3 per piece.  They come in a variety of funky and unique flavor combinations, but honestly they are not anything special or a head above the competition, and they don't really add to the chicken meal.  I still prefer the Welcome chicken/donut combo over LoLo's waffle combination, but I wouldn't go out of my way to snag a couple of donuts here.  Each donut is pretty huge, I do have to say.  Still, I think Bosa donuts are better (and waaay cheaper).   One donut = $2-3, 1/2 premium dozen = $16, one premium dozen = $28.  There is plenty of seating inside and outside, the whole place including the bathrooms are clean, there are plenty of napkins to grab if needed, parking is ample, and service is friendly.  I do have to warn you that if you stay inside the restaurant for even just a few minutes, you will walk out smelling like fried oil, but don't let that deter you from checking this place out."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. I was drawn by the uniqueness of the random donut flavors and random pairing of chicken & donuts. I had the pistachio rose chocolate donut, which I was not a fan of. My friend got the sesame goat cheese or something like that, and that one wasn't great either. The chicken was stringy and hard to eat. I came out smelling like a college cafeteria. Anyway, I've had better."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time! They were closing soon so they didn't have a ton of options but what we got was amazing! Hands down one of the best fried chicken I have ever had! Got the combo leg, thigh, sauce, side. I got the sweet chili sauce while my husband got the Japanese bbq I really don't know which one was better! They both were absolutely incredible and homemade! Their Thai slaw and potatoes were really good, I liked the slaw the best unfortunately that's all they had available for their sides since we came in late! The environment was cute and quaint but we got it to go. Definitely coming back here, and coming in early so we have more options."}
{"text":"This is some of the best fried chicken you have ever had and with an Asian flare. The donuts are phenomenal as well. I wish you could open up one in the East Valley area. Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert. You would kill it here."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that the operations manager sent me a nice, genuine note on the below mentioned review and offered to amend the situation by inviting me and my nieces back. I really value the commitment this restaurant has and will go back to enjoy some chix & donuts or maybe ramen mmmmmmm! I'm updating my star from 2-3 for good looking out!   I'm not sure if my review will really count cuz I didn't even bother to eat the food....all the hype is what kept going thru my mind as I looked at the menu, than the lack of donuts in the case and than back at the menu and than back at the donut case!!!! It was 1:15pm and the line was about 7 ppl deep so I had some time, which I don't know why it took me so long to bounce. I really wanted to love this place cuz I wanted to share the experience & the cool concept w/my nieces but I can't. I'm not gonna pay hella $ for some chix and all they get is like 1 donut to choose from. Maybe it was the time of day or jus hella busy, who knows but nope! Probably won't go back either cuz than that would b doing too much. Also I don't think the AC works well in there and it b smelling like straight up chix grease factory in there, that kind that gets all up in ur clothes.... mmmmm no thank u!   I'm jus stick to the trusty Welcome Diner."}
{"text":"Donuts are a big disappointment and overpriced. Maybe their grease was old?  Odd taste to the donut. Got a maple and an almond chocolate.  Had to throw both of them away they had such bad flavor.  Also got one chicken breast. Not worth the hype.  It was a bit undercooked in the center. Very crispy batter though. The best thing from there  was their chili sauce. Sorry to say overall it was  totally not worth it. Had been hearing about it and finally made it in to try it. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot on a Sunday for a bloody beer and a glazed doughnut to soak up the prior nights craziness. Austin recommended the special combo that morning and didn't disappoint with well seasoned potatoes and farm fresh eggs and sausage. It's Not necessarily for the health minded folks but definitely a great departure from the norm. Didn't try the chicken but will be back for sure to give it a go. Located in an industrial area makes for an interesting venue. Great doughnuts great service."}
{"text":"This place makes Lolo's taste like cardboard. The Korean style fried chicken is to die for. The donuts are insane. I always end up buying a half dozen donuts to go. Beer available. Cold brew coffee in tap. There is very limited indoor seating. Plenty of outdoor seating and parking. Hint: sometimes if you come towards the end of the day, the donuts will be half off;)"}
{"text":"This place is located in the weirdest spot, sort of the industrial area of Phoenix, but it's so worth the drive I gotta make to get there. I love that it's not your usually just deep fried chicken, I always end up getting the teriyaki one with the Thai slaw, I love that they have ramen at this place too? I need to try it, but the fact they even have ramen is just cool to me.  Their donuts are great, they have your typical flavors as well as specialty donuts that differ every time I go in there, every time though there's always something amazing.  The service is always great, it's always busy in here, the place is small on the inside but luckily they have a lot of seating outside as well.  The fact they have vegan options is great too :) It's a place where I can go with all my friends."}
{"text":"Maybe the rave reviews + hype raised my expectations, but I thought the fried chicken was good solid 3.5 stars but wouldn't classify as great t or 5+ stars  Each member of our group ordered combo chix + sauce+ side + donuts to-go. As often as I can, I try to eat at the restaurant, but for location that offer a large% of their orders to go, I check out that option. I don't deduct points nor stars towards the temp of the food, but I was impressed how crunchy the skin my breast with sweet & spicy Korean Chili with cucumber side (great crunch + flavor). If you are going to under-season (need a touch more salt) the chicken, your sauce has to be rock solid. Korean Chili was more sweet & not enough spicy.  I ate most of the chix with no sauce & enjoyed the pickled cucumber side!  The donut flavors were creative.  We all had a bite or two of almost all the offerings for that day."}
{"text":"I visited a couple months ago, so this review is a bit late.  I have nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. The chicken is maybe the best fried chicken I've ever had outside of my own kitchen. It's amazingly tender and crisp. I got a combo of drumstick, thigh, the asian inspired slaw, and every single sauce on the side. All the sauces were excellent, even the daily sauce of asian inspired honey mustard. If you aren't a fan of fish sauce, I would deter you from trying the Vietnamese and fresh herb sauce, though. If you do like fish sauce, it's delicious. I think on my next trip I will have my chicken tossed in the Japanese barbeque and order the Vietnamese sauce on the side to dip them in. The staff is excellent. I will admit that I had an undercooked thigh, though. My friend also had undercooked chicken, but she didn't want to say anything. I asked the gentleman at the register for a replacement, and when the chef (I assume) saw this, he seemed very upset, presumably at the morning crew. The restaurant pre-frys the chicken, puts it on a cart, and then re-frys the chicken for the customer when ordered. The chef came out later to talk to me, apologized for the undercooked chicken, and in addition to replacing the thigh, they even gave me an extra drumette and some donuts to take home. I can't stress enough how kind that guy was. He seems like a good beer and chicken buddy, which I hope becomes a new thing. Again, the customer service here is excellent. I was an idiot, locked my keys in the car, and hung out for an hour and a half or so, but every interaction I saw between customer and employee was very friendly. For a gentleman who reviewed before, who complained about them not having chicken when he came, I think he needs to understand pars. I work at a restaurant, and depending on the season and the publicity, a restaurant needs to adjust the order, and it isn't always easy when things change dramatically, as maybe a restaurant gets a great review in a magazine. Back when he visited the restaurant, the Phoenix magazine had just named them a top 10 new restaurant, which I agree with. The food is great. Because of my car troubles, I was there until almost closing time. One single customer came in when they were out of fried chicken. They did, however, still have breakfast sandwiches (the pork belly slider special will definitely bring me back soon), and clearly posted it on the door that they only had breakfast sandwiches. The man who had come in was completely understanding as to the lack of chicken, though.  Why aren't all customers kind? Again, referring to the gentleman who complained before, restaurants run out of product. That's the simple truth. The shift or manager placing the order can only do her or his best at guessing the number of sales, hoping not to go over and cause waste, and hoping not to go under and disappoint people. It's mathematics and data-based presumption combined.  I drove 45 minutes to this store from North Scottsdale, locked my keys in my car with the engine on, waited an hour for my spare keys to be driven down, had an excellent meal, an excellent time, and wouldn't have traded that afternoon for another. I will definitely return, as the food is excellent, and every person with whom I interacted was exceptionally nice.  My name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"What an amazing treat to have this place open near the office!  I will gladly up my cardio to eat more of their fried chicken. Can't wait to catch them on a day that they have the noodles. Lucky me!"}
{"text":"Welcome Chicken and Donuts is legit tasty! I had the breast combo tossed in daily special sauce (sweet and sour pineapple) cucumber salad on the side and a glazed donut! Ill be back for suresies!!!"}
{"text":"No joke, this place can just be called Welcome Chicken Wings ....the wings are that good! Its lightly battered, cooked right, and from what we've read all local.  I suggest asking for sauce on the side so you can dip or add as much as you desire.  Now the donuts....  Yes, they are legit. Im usually just a plain fatty kinda guy that like long johns, chocolate frosted, and bear claws....but these buujee donuts here are insane! Considering that DunkinDs sells their donuts for $1.00 each, these hand crafted ones are worth the small difference.  I suggest the lemon cake one."}
{"text":"I have been to Chicken + Donut a couple times and it was VERY delicious. The cake donut was fresh and yummy and the chicken was juicy.  I'm sorry to report that the most recent time I went the donuts tasted stale. I eat alot of donuts so I know day olds when I taste them. I went at 11:30am so im guessing the stale taste wasnt from being in the display all day. Between 2 chicken lunches and half dozen donuts the bill was $35. For that price the donuts have to be fresh.   The service wasn't anything to write home about either. The counter person was rushing me to decide on which donuts i wanted in my half dozen. I hope this place hasn't started to fall off with their quality that would be a shame."}
{"text":"When we heard that Crepe Bar, one of our favorite go-to spots, was collaborating with Welcome Chicken + Donuts, it seemed like a complete no brainer to check it out. On that rainy morning, it was fairly busy at this small hole-in-the-wall restaurant but they were doing well to get through patrons quickly. There were very few tables to sit inside but a little bit more space outside.  For my meal I chose the 2 piece chicken in Korean Chili sauce with Corn + Miso Butter Stir Fry and cake donut; my date got the 3 piece chicken in Vietnamese + Fresh Herbs sauce with Ginger Scallion Cucumber Salad and upgraded to the Blueberry Cacao donut. The Korean Chili sauce was so delicious. The best way to describe it would be like an orange-y sweet and sour sauce with a bit of a kick to it. More impressive than that was the corn stir fry. It was buttery and had so much flavor; unfortunately, the donut left much to desire. It was boring & kind of didn't belong. At first, I thought that maybe it was because it wasn't one of the special ones but my date wasn't very impressed with his either. I tried a bite of the Vietnamese chicken & thought it was incredibly salty & the cucumber salad was okay but I didn't like that it was cold.  Next time, I'd probably just order the chicken wings in Korean Chili sauce. I would be willing to try one of the other donuts as well ... Hopefully for a better experience."}
{"text":"This place is in a really odd location near the Phoenix Airport in a converted KFC restaurant but they've tidied it up a lot and given it some character. Their donuts are pretty much the bees knees, highly recommend the key lime pie donut. Super good. Wanted to try their ramen but it was all gone within 15 minutes of opening. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"OK, gotta write this while I still have my sugar high :)  I met up with a couple of my adventurous friends to try this joint out while it was still new.  To start with, the external facade and neighborhood are straight up sketchy, so don't be scared off.  I almost was and would have missed something great.  The combination of chicken and donuts is really intriguing but I only got as far as the donuts.  Holy smokes, what great combinations!  Between the 3 of us, we had the apple fritter, the maple-bacon, the blueberry-cream cheese, the cateja, and a few more.  These were some truly wonderful donuts---tender, moist and really fresh tasting.  I had coffee with them and decided that blueberry was my favorite, for now at least.  I'll go back to try the chicken and other delicicous protein based specials.  They have a slightly asian array of side dishes and sauces for the chicken.  The options are limitless and these guys are on to something!  BTW, the staff is really lovely...all kind and helpful!  Ignore the sketchy neighborhood and support this endeavor.  There are some other places that have braved Buckeye road so they are in good company.  Get there by 10 AM for the best selection of yummy treats :)  Go. NOW!!"}
{"text":"Delicious doughnuts and mouthwatering chicken. Crispy on the outside and juicy chicken on the inside. Awesome - friendly service!"}
{"text":"The specialty donuts were a kick and tasted great. The dough was more bread/cake like than a traditional donut. I wanted to try the wings and they were out by 1PM. Small table area not sure if this is because there is more through traffic (take out) than sit down and eat. The Korean sauce on the chicken breast was good. Interesting concept."}
{"text":"bummed that I arrived at 10am, and after a long wait was told the flavors I wanted were not available. I am a fan and follow on IG and saw the meyor lemon advertised for today and tomorrow. I didn't think they would go so fast! great for you, sad for me! I won't be making the drive again....the popularity of this rad joint should do more to accommodate for the demand!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday for brunch and I can't express how amazing this place was. We walked in and were genuinely welcomed    By a worker named Austin. He was very down to earth and helpful. (I'm big on customer service)  We ordered the whole bird and the sauces on the side. The cucumber salad was very fresh and flavorful. The beans were delicious as well. I upgraded and ordered a chocolate donut. I was more amazed by the chicken than the donuts. The chicken was crispy and juicy on the inside. Best fried chicken I've had in PHX. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"These kids rocked it out of the park in no time.  It's hard to believe they haven't even been open half a year now.  The care and attention to detail in everything they do is borderline psychotic  :)  Definitely try their Sunday Ramen Special.  Has been starting at 10:30 with limited quantities.  I was able to score one of the last bowls at about 12:30.  Fish the kimchee out first . . . it's stellar, but I wouldn't want my whole bowl tasting of kimchee  The donuts . . . they are not messing around.  These are gourmet donuts  Get the chicken with the sauce on the side.  The sauces are powerful.  And order all three for a small upcharge, it's worth it  They now have beer!  It's only a few bottled varieties for now, but they're carefully chosen  I love this place, and I love their other joint the Welcome Diner.  Great one two punch"}
{"text":"Chicken + doughnuts??? Absolutely!!! Yes, please!!! Yummy... But first, and foremost, can I take a moment to highlight how INCREDIBLY NICE and ATTENTIVE the staff at Welcome is?!! Wow... they live up to their name, and then some! I was a tad apprehensive when we walked in, but the gentleman inside was so helpful... Now that I'm thinking about it- I probably should've tipped more. Smh. Sorry. Lol! But I digress...   THE CHICKEN !!! AMAZING!!! No, I'm serious... I am not one of those Yelpers who totally inflate a place, and in turn, let the rest of us down... This is some of THE BEST CHICKEN that I have ever tasted in my life (And I've tasted many a gospel bird)! Crispy flavorful batter on the outside... Moist, juicy, and fully cooked on the inside. I'm drooling right now!! Plus, they grace you with this fluffy cake doughnut that is rich vanilla with hints of lemon on the palette. It's truly a thing of beauty. The Asian fusion sauce selection really sets off the chicken, too. If you don't mind a little kick... try the Korean Chili - you won't be disappointed. We rounded out our meal with the stir fry, and cold brew coffee w/sweet cream...  The perfect Sunday afternoon lunch.  This was the start of a beautiful friendship... I see myself coming back again and again... And I know they'll Welcome me kindly."}
{"text":"I feel weird giving this place 5 stars because I usually judge donut places based off of their maple donuts and the maple ring I had just didn't do it for me. The donut was soft and fresh but the frosting killed it for me. It was extremely sweet and a little grainy. However, the chicken alone will keep me coming back to this little gem of a spot. My fiancé and I split a half dozen wings with the Korean Chili sauce and they were phenomenal! Some of the best wings I've ever had! We bought a half dozen donuts so I have more to try so maybe my opinion will be changed. Overall, recommended spot if you're in the area and in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, we are from out of town and usually go to Lolo's when in town, but decided to try something new this time. Walked in and saw the tables full but outside looked slow, the service was shitty, front counter lady was rude! Ehe good chicken and donuts but when servers aren't even cool enough to make you feel welcome but like you are getting in the way of their life, never go back. Lolos for life I guess."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back for the chicken! The batter is light and crispy, almost like dessert chicken. Hard to explain, but very good! I actually came for the donuts because I was craving gourmet donuts (like Blue Star donuts from Portland), but they didn't cut it. I applaud the creativity of the flavor combinations, but something was off for the ones we tried."}
{"text":"It's good food! The staff is awesome. The donuts are amazing and the chicken Good. It was kind of greasy and not that flavorful but good none the less."}
{"text":"I never eat doughnuts, and I never eat chicken, and I never thought to eat them together but this is a culinary masterpiece. The staff is so friendly and knowledgable on everything. The selection of doughnuts was not only appealing to the eye, but even more appealing to the stomach. The coffee here is locally roasted and fair trade from Colombia (Blue House Coffee) and my taste buds could definitely tell the love and time it when it when it was freshly brewed. They have vegan options too! You would've never thought! It's kind of a shady neighborhood but the extra precaution you take to hide all of your valuables and secure your car like Ft. Knox is definitely worth every succulent bite of their maple bacon doughnut that is very generous on the bacon! The owner is in collaboration with other local restaurants and is featured thorough out Phoenix for a good reason. They're DELICIOUS. The music I heard while in there is very indie--my favorite. Death Cab for Cutie, Noah and the Whale, and he Lumineers! If you're passing through Phoenix, trying to impress your thousands of Instagram followers for your boarder line narsistic \"local foodie scene\", or even just happen to be strolling in this neighborhood for some questionable used tires you HAVE to stop by."}
{"text":"World class donuts. Take a napkin for the creamy fills. It will end up in your lap. Expensive, but high quality. I only saw the fried chicken, and looked great.  Unique flavors. Savories, sweets and fills.  This is a gourmet donut stand. Worth a look and a taste.   Closes promptly at 4pm."}
{"text":"Chicken is delicious. I cannot complain. The only reason it gets the lower stars is the fact that they run out of food a few hours before they close. It's hard enough to get there with the early closing. The fact that you get there and all donuts are sold out. Wings are done. It's kind of a bad thing as I drove far to get there. But the chicken I did get was very tasty."}
{"text":"Came here this morning with my foodie coworkers and it was such a great time!     We split three doughnuts, the red wine and chocolate pudding, apple fritter and maple bacon doughnuts.  I thought the maple bacon was the best, but I have not met a piece of pork that I don't like, so I might be biased lol!  The bacon had a nice smoke flavor and when eaten as a whole with the glaze and dough it was an awesome salty/sweet flavor explosion.    The red wine and chocolate was just OK for me.  You can definitely taste the red wine and the chocolate pudding was nice on its own, but together?  Eh, not so much for me.  The apple fritter was pretty tasty.  Lots of flavor, great size with a lot of apples and a good dough.  Overall, looking forward to going again to try new flavors and most likely more maple bacon doughnuts!"}
{"text":"We finally made it to this place. Have been hearing about it for a while.   It is a really nice place, love the patio! My chicken was good but donut was a bit dry. My fiancé's chicken was dry per him but his donut was on spot. I wish that our cashier was bit more interested in helping us as it was our first time there...  Definitely does not live up to the hype but good enough to come back and try some more stuff."}
{"text":"What a great way to start the day! I had a cake donut with egg, bacon, cheddar and some magical jalapeño relish. It satisfied on all levels. I can't wait to visit again. The staff was a happy group and showed patience with my exploration of their interesting menu. The space is clean, bright and inviting. Of course, any place that serves a maple bacon donut topped with lots of real bacon is inviting."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I've tried most of the donuts here, salted hazelnut to apple fritter, and my favorite is still the maple bacon.  (When I fall of the diet wagon.)  Chicken is pretty good too.  But, I really come here for the donuts."}
{"text":"Great crispy fried chicken paired with fresh donuts. Been here twice and enjoyed it both times. Glazed maple donut with bacon is one of the best."}
{"text":"Finally made a pit stop here. Chicken and donuts, who would've thunk lol. Donuts are definitely creative. I had a chicken fried combo- 1 leg, 1 breast, 1 wing, (the meal comes with a donut, has to be a standard donut though, there's an upcharge for a premium donut). The chicken was decent, nothing out of this world, in fact, it was a little too crunchy for me. I'd definitely give 3 stars for just the chicken. I got a side of Korean Chile, it was way too salty so instead I just added hot sauce. I ordered with a side of cucumber salad and it was pretty bland. Side servings are VERY small.  I tried several donuts, Pear Plum Yogurt Donut, Apple Fritter, Pistachio Chocolate and a Boston Creme type donut. My favorite was the Boston Creme, the cream didn't taste generic at all. The Pear Plum donut was very moist and dense. The Fritter was nothing special, kind of dry actually and the Pistachio one was also quite dry.  I'll definitely go back for more donuts and for their chicken sandwiches, which apparently are so much better than just their chicken.  Chicken isn't served until after 10:30am. I noticed most sides are small so order more than 1 side if you're extra hungry, (or in my opinion just hungry, that's how small they seemed to me). Although the lines can get long, they move really quickly so don't fret if you see it coming out onto the side. Food also comes out quickly. Pretty limited seating inside but plenty outside."}
{"text":"This place is definitely something to check out... it's kind of strange, but also very cool. The fried chicken was some of the best I've had. I ordered the breast combo with the sauce on the side, and potatoes (apparently only served on the weekends). I didn't love any of the sauces that I tried, honestly, but the chicken had enough flavor on its own. The combo comes with a plain donut, and I didn't end up eating it. Not my favorite donut. They were also out of almost all of the donut flavors in the case, which is super disappointing. They had really cool flavors, like blood orange sage, red wine pudding, etc. Might have to go back again for the chicken and a flavored donut."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick lunch and boy were we surprised!! I've never had such crispy crunchy chicken! The best yet, and it surprisingly didn't leave a greasy taste in your mouth. There are so many different dipping sauces, all with an Asian twist to it. The DONUTS! So fresh! If your in the area you must stop by for some chicken and a cake donut! There isn't much indoor seating but there is a nice covered patio with misters and large wooden picnic tables."}
{"text":"Great service and Great Food. I had the 2 pc Chicken with spicy Korean sauce, and my wife had it with BBQ sauce. Chicken was as fresh as it gets, and hot. Delicious and juicy. The only thing I will do differently is get the sauce on the side. A little heavier than needed, and I think the chicken would be great without any sauce too.  The doughnuts are awesome!! Unique flavors. They know how to use that fryer! We will be back whenever we crave Chicken or Doughnuts again."}
{"text":"The donuts were ok. The woman behind the counter who took my order acted like she would rather not be there. Overall, not impressed."}
{"text":"The doughnuts themselves were good. Not amazing, but good. The thing is, they are really expensive. $1.75 for the basic ones and $3.50 for the fancy ones. It cost us $20 for a half dozen doughnuts and 2 coffee's. Sorry, but I've been elsewhere both in town and out that have way better doughnuts for a third of the price. It doesn't matter how \"cool\" you think you are, at the heart of any amazing establishment is the product you offer to people and how you offer it. No one can ever do good by just selling a gimmick, if you have a gimmick that's fine but you've got to have a solid product at a competitive price to go along with it.   We didn't get the chicken, so can't comment on it. The Ramen they had looked really good, but it's like $12~$14 per serving, so not sure if I'll ever buy it there since I can get amazing, authentic Ramen elsewhere in town for under $10."}
{"text":"Fine Donuts in Phoenix   This weekend adventure brought me to the desert land of Phoenix. Wanting to try the best Arizona has to offer, I happen to come across Welcome Chicken + Donuts.   Raspberry (cake) Strawberry Balsamic (raised) Chipotle Limon (cake) Chocolate Pistachio Rose (raised) Irish Car Bomb (filled) Matcha Green Tea w/ Blood Orange (cake)   Because of my experience with \"hipster\" donut places, I wasn't expecting much out of this place. The first donut I tried was the Raspberry. The frosting is full of raspberry flavor with a very luscious cake texture on the bottom. The Strawberry Balsamic was probably my favorite one out of the box. The strawberry flavor was punching my taste buds with extreme flavor and the slight hint of balsamic seemed to magnify the taste even more. The dough was also very soft. The Chipotle Limon was another great cake donut but I wasn't too big of a fan of the sharp and zesty flavor. The last one I tried, Chocolate Pistachio Rose, was another great donut that has a light chocolate flavor.   I didn't get to try both the Irish Car Bomb and Matcha Green Tea w/ Blood Orange but according to my friends, they really seemed to enjoy each and every bite.   This place definitely surprised me with the quality of the donuts. I'm usually not a fan of exotic flavored, Instagrammable donuts but the flavor was amazing and the dough was worthy. I would love to try all of the other flavors they have if I ever return to the desert.   The Fried Chicken isn't served until 10:30am. I came at 9:30am :'("}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, WOW!  Just got off my flight and needed a quick lunch.  Grabbed a Chicken Breast Combo with cucumber salad and Japanese sauce on the side. I have to say it was some of the best chicken I've ever had.  Love the menu, simple with some surprises like Ramen and donut egg sandwiches.  Check it out!, I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very small place, but great chicken and donuts. Ordered the breast, donut, side combo deal for about 9 bucks. The guy said pick any donut you want, but certain donuts will cost you a $1.50 upcharge. That upcharged donut I picked was filled with strawberry rose and had a nice powdered sugar coating on the outside. The chicken clearly stole the show with a crazy crunchy coating and great tasty meat inside (no fork needed). I think I had the Japanese BBQ sauce, but it wasn't really needed and the side dish was a corn, peppers and onion mix that was pretty standard, but good enough. Likely to return - on par with the top fried chicken in the Valley."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of The Welcome Diner so I was anxious to try their new joint. I found the menue to be a bit strange, but I don't care for fried chicken or egg. The ramen dishes sounded unappealing to me as well. BUT..... The doughnuts looked amazing, so I purchased half a dozen. I must admit I am not crazy about bacon but I loved the maple bacon doughnut. It was like having breakfast! The doughnut was so damn fresh and fluffy light. Delicious! I also enjoyed the raspberry goat cheese doughnut, more like a cake doughnut but just the same, delicious. My husband liked the chocolate cover glazed and I also found that the glazed doughnut was so good. The staff is so friendly and cute. Place is clean, you may sit inside or outside.  It's a good thing I live in Peoria because I would be hitting this place a lot!"}
{"text":"I organized a \"Day of Yay\" for my husband and had to include this because of his love of chicken and donuts.  I didn't actually have the chicken but my companions reported that it was quite good and had an Asian flavor.  The donuts were good but to be honest, I think I prefer regular donut-flavored donuts (get off my lawn - I'm getting old and cranky).    I don't know that I'd come back but if you're in the area, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Average and nothing special. Nice atmosphere and decor outside but I wouldn't drive all the way to the ghetto again.  Overpriced for sure.  Plain and simple. I don't know how to explain it other than just being plain disappointed.   This place is pretty trendy and will probably lose steam eventually because no one wants to pay $3-4 for a donut or $10 for a piece of chicken.  Personally I feel Lolo's is way better and has better sides at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Had the chicken combo with drum and thigh, fish sauce on the side, and cucumber salad. Tastes wonderful and juicy. Fresh organic food that is to die for. I can eat the chicken without the sauce and it's wonderful. Better than KFC and LoLo's Chicken. Will come here again."}
{"text":"Ok so the fried chicken is amazing! Very crispy! The sides are all really good too! The Ramen is not my cup of tea and it wasn't as tasty as I thought it would be but it was light which I liked. The donuts are not your typical flavors and are very tasty. The service is always great!"}
{"text":"One of the best fried chickens I've had in Arizona! Tried the Korean and Japanese BBQ sauces on the side, both were very good but honestly the chicken itself with no sauce is excellent. Got the potatoes as a side and they were seasoned perfectly. We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"DANG! Stopped on our way to the car rental plaza at the airport on a recommendation from a PHX friend. We got the welcome griddle sandwich (bacon egg + cheddar with maple glaze on a cake donut). Having driven all across the southwest and experiencing the stomach pain of its mammoth portions, we decided to split one. This sandwich is definitely not for sharing. It's small, but RICH, on a perfectly made donut. We ended up turning around to grab a second one on the way out of town. Wish we had the time to hang out and try the chicken and ramen, pretty much everything on the menu looks (and smells) great."}
{"text":"Welcome Chicken + Donuts sounds like the whole name is a full sentence.   DONUT: Strawberry Cheesecake AND the Passion Fruit. The strawberry cheesecake is better than the passion fruit for sure. I must say, when getting donuts here, go with the filled ones. The filling is to die for in most of those donuts, but I found the passion fruit to be a little lack luster. Maybe I was hoping for a more intense passion fruit flavor, but overall, the donuts are fried to perfection and the right amount of sugar is added. The donuts definitely stick to your sides, so even after sharing half and half of both donuts, it being one full donut, damn, it's a lot of donut.   CHICKEN: Thigh and Wing with Japanese Sesame Sauce + Watermelon Fennel Salad. The chicken itself was fried very well. I must say that the thigh and wing were fried to the right crispy level. The Japanese sesame sauce though was a little too sweet for me. I wish I had gotten another sauce looking back on it, but they offer other sauces (Vietnamese and Korean inspired sauces). The watermelon fennel salad definitely cuts into the heaviness of the meat and the donut (that you may have already eaten because I know I did) and is mighty tasty.    SERVICE: The friendly Arizona vibes are strong here!   Chicken and waffles, move on over, and let Chicken and Donuts take over. Come here definitely around brunch-ish time if you are making a weekend appearance because this place closes at 4:00 and I have heard if they run out of food, they close the doors earlier. I would definitely visit this wonderful establishment again in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Donut was good, sauce was great; however, the two piece thigh and drumstick meal was terrible.  What meat?  There literally is more meat on wings than these two pieces combined.  Terrible!  For the price, you think you would get a lot more."}
{"text":"Pass by this place Monday - Friday for 2 weeks and told my wife about it. Chicken and donuts she'll love it! It is the best chicken I have ever had! My wife doesn't really like chicken but she loves donuts I'm sure this chicken will change her mind! Must try! I read a review where they said bad customer service and got to say if it was before it isn't now. The woman who took my order was very nice and patient and the men cooking were very nice with big smiles! So, I will recommend them to anyone I come across! Go try some Chicken & Donuts tonight you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Cold brew on tap, Key Lime Pie donut and Wayne's smiling face....what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place has amazing chicken and there donuts are ok but every single time I try to get food from here they are out of everything  how does a chicken spot run out of breast thighs and wings wtf then your out of potatoes then there's the ridiculous wait this place is obviously good but unprepared for there norm it's always slammed be prepared for it. It's genuinely irritating especially for someone like me who drives a damn hour for there food for them to always be running out of stuff i won't waist my time or Money on this place until they expand and can actually service the volume of customers because this is now the fourth time I've experienced this here  in a month   It's. Ridiculous.  Back to lo lo we go atleast we know they will have food to eat when we arrive"}
{"text":"More places like this please!!  These folks are serious about their food and are not afraid to experiment with some wild, yet delicious flavors.  Everything was superb here.  The coffee also deserves a special mention.  9.5 out of 10 in my book.  I got the hot coffee, though I would love to go back when the weather is warmer and try the cold brew.  My cousin told me about his favorite donut flavor \"sweet corn\", though unfortunately it was not available when I visited.  Hopefully they revisit it some time."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite places in Phoenix, although the location is questionable, I love going here for their fried chicken. It stays crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. I don't really eat donuts a lot because of how sweet they are but here they are perfect. I like all the different variety to choose from. I was very surprised that they served ramen here. Even chicken and donuts I'll admit is already an odd combination. But I will say the ramen is good! I highly recommend the Korean glazed chicken!"}
{"text":"The vegan donuts here are the best I've ever had! Vegans be warned, these donuts taste like the real thing!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try with all the positive reviews but was unfortunately disappointed. Paid $17 for 6 donuts that were overly sweet and quit dry. Especially the next day. Selection was not that exciting either. Perhaps the key is to go later in the day and try with a piece of chicken. But, sorry won't be back."}
{"text":"Chicken is amazing/crunchy/delicious!  Apple fritter is the best in my opinion. A must stop if your traveling through the freeway.  The sweet and the salty combo was perfect and patio on side with misters is perfect now that weather is cooling."}
{"text":"I'm grateful that there's a place that has such an extensive vegan donut selection. But the donuts, vegan and not, were lacking in any flavor at all. The vegan glazed was soft but tasted like nothing. I didn't want to finish any of the donuts, and that never happens."}
{"text":"I don't like fried chicken.  There, I said it!  Soul Food?  I was born in Phoenix, not the South!    LoLo's, Mrs Whites, Welcome Diner, Popeyes, and countless local spots...I just don't like fried chicken.  This is the polar opposite of my Southern born-and-bred, Georgia-native husband.  He LOVES fried chicken.  Oh, I also don't like donuts.  My husband loves the occasionally BoSa donut.  Now he has Rollover too.  Tried them both...meh but more power to them.  I know, I know...but to each their own, right? :)  Insert Welcome Chicken + Donuts.  The first time we tried them out I ordered the 2 piece with Korean sauce, Corn Miso and a Maple Ring.  It was pretty delish.  But having it tossed in the sauce was overpowering for me.  I vowed to try it with the sauce on the side the next time.  And I did.  And it was **GOOD**  Oh.  My.  God.  Taste buds burst into a happy dance!  Is this for real?  Did I just devour a donut (possibly with a little whimper at the end)?  Am I savoring each lightly crispy, flavorful, superbly enhanced by a thick, spicy-sweet Korean sauce bite of fried freaking chicken??  Hubby and I now been here like 5 times.  Hands down, we both agree it is the BEST fried chicken we've ever had.  We ALSO agree they have the BEST donuts we've ever had.  Just the soft, creamy maple ring makes me sigh in delight.  Already we have returned 5+ times since their opening.  Now there is ALWAYS a line but it moves fast and is just so worth it.  We try not to talk about this place or else we both start impromptu Homer Simpson impressions...  5/5 only because I can't give them more.  You guys have SUCH a great concept - Keep the quality, cheap locals and service...then chain that sucker out!"}
{"text":"Super cute space in a weird location. I love Welcome Diner, but I wasn't impressed with this offshoot's donuts. Maybe I went on an off day, but the textures were boring and soggy despite creative flavors. Form over substance, maybe? Might try again."}
{"text":"This review is strictly about the donuts: We were told get there early or face a limited selection, that's true. Overall the donuts were good, but if you're eyeing this place for a nice donut I think you had better options."}
{"text":"When you've got a craving for really good fried chicken and some creative and delicious donuts, then Welcome Chicken and Donuts is your place.  The best thing on the menu is their Korean style fried chicken, with amazing sauces and sides. My favorite is a thigh and drum with the Vietnamese Herb sauce, and a side of cucumber salad.   Then right after you order, then you look to your left and there is a big display of donuts with amazing flavors. The flavors change, with some returning favorites and some new stuff. You can get some of my favorites, apple fritter or a lemon maple donut. There is always something that is interesting, or something that will catch your eye. Yummy stuff!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. SALTY. A long wait of 22 minutes to wait for food. I don't understand this place. I wanted to like it......but nope I can't. I do not suggest you waste your time, hopes or money. I tried the Korean BBQ wings.... soggy and drenched in sauce. The other wings....garlic and too much fish sauce. The slaw.....bland and dry. Had the chicken sandwich....nothing on the bread, no spread, no sauce, nothing. Chicken sandwich was dry. Donuts: standard and deluxe....dry, over priced and disappointing. We ordered three different ones...and we couldn't even eat them all due to driness. I had to drink plenty of the free ice water to swallow it down. The worst $30+ spent.......wasted $$$. PLUS for rest of the day we all had stomach issues. WELCOME???? NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"This place had me coming back to try the different doughnuts and wing sauces. I really liked the times I went here."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try something new! I went inside and the place was really cool. When I got back to work to eat my chicken, it was raw, my chicken was bleeding. I am not sure if it's a mistake or what is going on. The portions are small for what you pay for and I like my chicken cooked. I will never go back I don't even want my money back."}
{"text":"RI-DUNK-CULOUS!!! Be aware that chicken is not served until 10:30, I waited an hour and it was worth every second! The staff is very friendly. We were there when the news broke that Prince had died, we all mourned together.  They put on some tunes and then the chicken was ready...BOOM! The Korean chili dip is STOOPID GOOD.  The donuts are unique and tasty, but that chicken?  Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Korean chicken was amazing! Drove past this place on the way to work and had to try it. Not disappointed at all. The maple bacon donut was amazing as well. The line was long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'll say this for the Welcome Hospitality crew.  They're a fearless bunch.  In Welcome Diner, they took a chance on an old dingy diner near Downtown and turned it into arguably one of the top dining spots in the valley.  They owe that success not only to taking chances with their locations, but with their food.  With Welcome Diner, they've married traditional diner fare, farm to table ingredients, southern recipes, and even vegetarian friendly fare.  In Welcome Chicken & Donuts, they've taken a chance in another questionable neighborhood while serving traditional donuts as well as fried chicken with an Asian spin.  Asian chicken and donuts?  Makes no frickin sense at all, but (for the most part) it works.  Seeing that they didn't serve chicken until after 10:30am, I decided to venture here just before the Noon hour for Sunday lunch.  Much to my surprise, the place was PACKED.  Turns out they were having a special today that tons of folks showed up for.  It was a pork ramen dish that apparently takes the Welcome crew about two days to make.  More than half the patrons I saw were there just for that reason.  I was tempted to join in on that party, but as a rookie I wanted to get a better feel for the regular menu.  The line was about 12 deep when I arrived, but moved pretty quickly.  I decided to go with a three piece + donut combo (a drum, a breast, a thigh, and a donut), but I made some modifications based on some of the early reviews I read.  I decided to ask for all three of their sauces (instead of just one) and asked that they be put on the side.  Costs a couple bucks extra, but its definitely the way to go if you're a first timer.  I also got one of each of their three sides (instead of just one).  Again, a couple bucks extra but the side portions are all pretty small so no big deal.  For a drink I went with the Big Sky Root Beer.  For my donut choice, I asked the guy at the counter what their most popular donut was (since there were more than a dozen types to choose from that day).  Without hesitation, he said the maple bacon.  Sold.  Total cost for everything including tax came to about $22.  Because of the lengthy order queue, they gave me my donut and drink first and had my chicken and sides ready about 5 minutes later.  The inside was packed so I sat outside under their large pergola (which also had misters, making it decently comfortable despite being 105 outside).  I've had maple bacon donuts at other donut shops before but the bacon is often super dry.  Welcome's bacon was actually quite juicy and the maple glaze was very liberally applied.  One of the better versions of this donut I've had.  The Big Sky Root Beer was quite good as well and didn't have a heavy aftertaste like I usually get with A&W or Mug (maybe its because Big Sky is made with sugar instead of corn syrup?).  Once I got my chicken, sauces, and sides 5 minutes later, I went to work on those.  The chicken was also quite good and I liked the fact the batter wasn't too heavy.  The meat itself was hot and juicy and soaked up the sauces easily.  The sauces themselves on the other hand weren't really my cup of tea.  Maybe the Asian themed sauces were a bridge too far for me, but I wasn't hugely impressed with any of them.  The Vietnamese sauce tasted a little too watery and bitter for my liking.  Similarly the Korean Chili sauce had a tangy texture that I just didn't care for (at least not on my chicken).  The Japanese BBQ sauce was probably the one I liked best, but even that was a little overpowering on the tomato front for my taste.  The chicken held its own without any sauce so it wasn't a huge deal, but I'm glad I did the sauces on the side instead of on the bird.  I was however very impressed with all three side options.  The Thai Yum Slaw was a fairly typical coleslaw, though not nearly as much mayonnaise as most coleslaws (which was a good thing in my book).  The Corn & Miso Stir Fry was also a light, pleasantly textured side and I think I picked up some green chiles in there.  And the Cucumber Salad had a great clean taste with just a hint of ginger and a cold crunchy texture.  Pretty much the only thing that didn't work for me here were the sauces for the chicken.  I guess I felt they were a little bit of an overpowering contrast with the chicken itself, though the sauces probably would work well as accompaniments for Asian noodle dishes (or in today's case, the Ramen promotion).  In any event, my first experience here was a positive one.  The staff was cool, and the (largely hipster) customers was super enthusiastic.  I would absolutely come back for more of those donuts, and the chicken and sides would both do well as lunch staples.  And its really cool to see how Welcome has livened up this otherwise questionable area just west of Sky Harbor Airport.  Tip of the cap to the Welcome Hospitality crew for taking another chance on a concept and a location that no one else in their right mind would try.  And succeeding."}
{"text":"I've been waiting a while to try this place out, after reading about it on Yelp as well as the Phoenix New Times. Although the fried chicken as actually quite alright, along with the side sauce (I had the Vietnamese-style dipping sauce with fish sauce, garlic, and cilantro), the cucumber salad, as well as the cake donut that came with it, it wasn't as great as it was hyped-up to be. Don't get me wrong here; the food was good, the chicken was delicious and juicy, and the service was excellent and friendly, but I thought $9 for a 2-piece combo, with a small side and a dipping sauce was too pricey. Now I understand that they high overhead costs (especially near Downtown Phoenix) and I'm all about supporting small businesses, but I really thought that they could at least add a little more something to a plate like this. Say, maybe an extra wing, some french fries, maybe even a medium drink or something; that would then be worth $9. I also saw that the ramen soup, which I had considered before choosing the chicken combo, was like $14. That's an expensive bowl of ramen; even when I lived in Vienna, Austria, I don't remember paying more than 12 for a big bowl of Vietnamese pho there, and that's one of the most expensive cities to live and work in. In sum, would I come here again? Sure; as I mentioned, I support small independent businesses, and I want them to succeed. Would I ever order the ramen in the future? Maybe, just once, to try it out and see if it's as good as many say it is. Would I go out of my way to visit again? Probably not, unless I was in the area and was craving a certain item or some donuts. In any case, it's still a good place to check out."}
{"text":"Got an iced cofee and maple pecan apple fritter. It had a great taste but then the bad part came in, it was extremely greasy making it inedible! Coffees was ok but not that good. Maybe il try their chicken one day. As of now i will go down the street to circle k for coffee and donuts."}
{"text":"After eating here for lunch I officially can say that if I die I can die a happy man!  This place was amazing!! Donuts and chicken who knew? The donuts were pricey, (up to 3 dollars for one) but seriously, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Oh Welcome Chicken And Donut, how do I love thee...   let me count the ways.    First your chicken are amazing.  The lightness of batter but oh so crispy on the outside and so steamy hot in the inside.    Second your sauces take my breathe away.    Third, the sides gives me a nice reprieve because...  Fourth, your donuts. Oh your donuts with their not so run of the mill flavors are Devine.  I'm especially in love with the lemon maple."}
{"text":"The donuts were amazing! However, if you are looking for something fast, go elsewhere.  The chicken took about 30 minutes to prepare. The bread was burnt, and my piece of chicken was tiny. They also burnt the potatoes. My partner's chicken sandwich had an egg and cheese, which were pretty good and sizable."}
{"text":"Back for more of the Korean spicy chicken - with the Thai slaw this time.  Tasty!  My wife got the Japanese BBQ sauce on her combo.  This time around, we got some donuts to go.  My wife really liked the Mango donut.  My son liked the Chocolate Strawbery Bread Pudding donut.  My daughter's favorite was the Cookies and Cream.  The Apple Fritter was the best Apple Fritter I've ever tried, but...my fave?  The maple bacon.  WOW!!!  As good as it sounds :-)  The plain cake donut that comes with the chicken combo is still very tasty (with a hint of citrus).  First time:  Tried the leg and thigh combo with the Korean spicy sauce, the corn stir fry as the side, and the plain donut.  Chicken was very moist, very crisp, delicious.  Sauce is very messy, but tasty!  I was a little ambivalent about the corn stir fry - too salty.  The plain donut was extremely fresh, and had a faint citrus note.  Yum!  Also tried the local (Blue Moon, or something like that?) Root Beer - pretty good.  Cool local place.  Music was too loud, and the benches were too high/too close to the table.  (There was a patio area - maybe eat there next time?)  Bottom line, come for the food, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Hair in the chicken batter. Food is good but this is gross and easily preventable with good hygiene and diligence following health code rules."}
{"text":"Heard much of the hype from friends and read a myriad of reviews on Yelp, some of which were not that complimentary.  I was finally able to check it out with my own tastebuds on a special weekend event; a collaboration with talent from Chiwas Tacos.  We split the Champurrado Pilloncillo, Tamarindo fritter AND a Membrillo Jamoncillo Pinones donut.  Verdict?  Thumbs up on the cake consistency of the Membrillo and the crispy warm fritter with subtle tamarindo sauce.  Wasn't really feeling the Champurrado...would have loved a twist with cilantro.  But still happy with my first visit.  Wayne is incredibly friendly and stopped by our table to check in.  Already planning a future visit to try the ramen and other savory offerings."}
{"text":"Possibly the best chicken I've ever had. I've gotten the bbq each time & tried the spicy one too. Both are amazing but the bbq is my fave.  The cucumber salad & the corn salad are great. If you're wanting something a little healthier go with the cucumber salad. If you want veggies that taste like a treat get the side of corn.  I'm torn about the donuts. In my opinion, they're good but not great. I typically like funky flavors but feel like some of the flavors might be a bit too funky for me. Still worth trying though.  I can't wait to try the maple bacon donut, but they're always out by the time we get there. We've been told we've got to get there super early for that one. It must be delish! Dislike... They lady that threw her phone number on the table for my husband when he was there without me. Lol! While I can't blame her & it has nothing to do with the restaurant, I suppose it means he can never go there without me. But I don't mind tagging along :)"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town, Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a must visit! Seriously amazing chicken, great salads and creative donuts. The kegged cold brew coffee is top notch.  I've had all three sauces (Korean Chili, Vietnamese Herb and Japanese BBQ) and I like the Vietnamese the best. My two favorite donut combinations have been toffee apple cider with celery root filling and a chocolate rose pistachio. The celery root somehow works really well as a donut filling. I've always had great and  quick service. See you soon WC+D!"}
{"text":"I love this food and the whole concept. Great staff very respectful and they go out of there way to help you. Food was cooked to perfection and fresh. Donuts are amazing."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Donny and I'm a bacon addict.   No, I'm not in bacon eaters anonymous nor do I ever want to be!  Just know this review is based off of one donut, and it was divine. The best Bacon-Maple donut I've had yet. They didn't overcook the bacon and crumble it up and use as sprinkles. No, they cut the chewy fatty strip of bacon into little \"Mini me\" strips of bacon and then pile it on! And the maple icing isn't some gross maple flavor either. I'm not a fan of the maple donut at all. But this was awesome!  Now, as a donut fan, this place has some very unique flavor combo's never seen before. I held back and only ordered one donut (extreme willpower) based on the demanding day ahead of me (didn't need a carb coma) but I am so looking forward to going back to sample! And the chicken + donut combo sounds better than chicken & waffles. I'll try to update after a few more visits."}
{"text":"Chicken is just average, nothing special. Who in the hell ever heard of charging $1.75 for one donut? Not worth it or the trip to south Phoenix strip shopping center. Last trip from our office downtown for sure. Rainbow has much better donuts for a lot less $$$$$."}
{"text":"When I heard about a place that pretty much only serves two of my favorite things I knew that on my trip to Arizona I would need to stop there.  I made this happen and took a little trip over near the airport to check out Welcome Chicken & Donuts to get me some, well... chicken and donuts.  The restaurant is super tiny and has a very strange vibe.  The selection wasn't that great and I felt like the donuts were overwhelmingly savory.  Maybe it was the day or maybe that was just what was left over but there were not very many sweet choices.  I had a cookies and creme one and another that I don't recall and both where average/good.  The chicken was average/good as well.  kinda of strange that the chicken options all were Asian."}
{"text":"Best tasting chicken in Phoenix - hands down! Didn't even need the sauce, but the Japanese BBQ sauce was really good.  Yes the chicken pieces are small, because that is the size NATURAL chicken is supposed to be! No chemicals, steroids, and other nasty stuff. Trust me, this chicken is worth the time, money, and distance!  #BlackWomanApproved  Oh yeah, the donuts are good too :)"}
{"text":"This is a popular joint and I definitely recommend their fried chicken and donuts.   I would order with sauce on the side.   This place gets busy and can sell out by early afternoon.  I didn't think the ramen was too tasty.  Come and check out this funky combo that works."}
{"text":"Beyond heaven. Fun and sweet service, organic chicken and the best sauces and donuts one could wish for. This is a staple on my food tour of Phoenix. I try not to let anyone leave town without eating here. Yes, it is in a rougher part of town and is a food-island unto itself, but make the trip and focus on the eats. The place is always clean, the music and decor rock and the patio is a delight. Whether you get the vegan noodle bowl, or the chicken - you win!"}
{"text":"I hope I got here on a bad day because this chicken was awful, dried out like it had been sitting on the sidewalk for two days. They took the chicken off the tray and tossed it into the fryer AGAIN! under the extremely fried coating the meat of the chicken breast was brown, like it had another coating on it YUK!! We peeled off that layer to get to white meat and it was so dry, just awful and no where near deserving \"Best of Phoenix Fried Chicken\" Today I should have just gotten the donuts which are fabulous and stopp at Kentucky Fried Chicken for some moist fried chicken."}
{"text":"If you are in the Phoenix area this place you must try! The concept of chicken and donuts did not interest me. I am so glad I build the courage to give it a try. Everything exceeded my expectations. The minute I entered I was greeted by the woman behind the counter. I wish I knew her name . She was so kind and helpful with directing me what I should order. Her recommendations were perfect. The chicken was incredible. It had so much flavor. Also, the donut I had tried was just to die for. Everything that I ate exceeded my expectations and more. This is definitely the best kept secret in the Phoenix area. I am so happy I tried this place and I most definitely will be returning ."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Assorted, artisan donuts with flavors such as chipotle limón, lemon maple, and blueberry juniper.   Then they've got this crazy epic sandwich menu, cake donut for bread with insane goodness inside.   And it gets better: the place flips into a cocktail and beer spot where you could easily get lunch and a brew. Amazing.   Will definitely 1) be back and 2) recommend people go here when they visit Phoenix. It's not even a half mile from the airport."}
{"text":"Really sad that we came before 10:30am and didn't get the chicken. I wish we would have waited! We got the fried egg and bacon sandwich. It is really great, but really small so I suggest getting two if you're hungry. I would also get a donut while you wait because it takes a bit of time to get your food. Super casual, laid back atmosphere and the art on the walls is killer. Our friend took us here on our visit to AZ and it will be a great return spot on our next visit!"}
{"text":"The chickens are lined up at the backdoor because this is where they want to end their life. They want to go out in a blaze of glory! The\Fried Chicken IS perfection. The  accompanied sides of salad are just as delectable. Wether you opt for a plain cake donut or the Chipotle Limon...your taste buds will never be the same. Make the trip. This is my 4th time here and every visit has been better than the last. Oh and follow their instagram account. The #welcomedonutface series if comical, pure genius."}
{"text":"Wow this place sucks, way over priced hipster crap. Like a food channel show repeat from 2012."}
{"text":"Had a three piece chicken with Korean sauce and corn. The best piece was the breast although I love the red meat. It was just juicier and nicely large. The plain donnat was also the best. And I saw how the donnat with egg and cheddar looks like and it looked amazing!   All was good but maybe not so much worth to get there walking 3km from the downtown. And in the end it's unhealthy food.  Curious for their Raman.  I liked also their patio."}
{"text":"Good lord yes to this place.... why do I ever eat bread when toasted donuts on Shriners sausage are sooooooo much better!"}
{"text":"This review has two parts, one for the donuts and one for the chicken and everything else.  The donuts:  The donuts are really good here. I'm not a donuts person, nor a sweets person. I'll eat at most 1/4 of a krispy kreme. I ate a whole donut here. It was that good. I had the lemon maple and it was superb. A little doughier than a normal donut but entirely infused with lemon and maple flavoring while staying light in your mouth. My friend had the maple bacon donut which he said was the best donut he's had in his life and I believe him. You pretty much cannot go wrong with any of their donuts.   Everything else: I'm a big fried chicken fan and I'll be honest this place did not do it for me. I felt like their frying process wasn't crisp enough. The added sauce they put on top makes to whole affair a little too salty for my tastes.  I tried the ramen as well here and it was a pretty lackluster event.   The one thing I didn't get to try were their potatoes which people have been raving about, try to get here early for those, I hear they're top notch. The staff here were incredibly nice as well, they apparently messed up our wing order so gave us an extra 6 wings which my friend happily devoured.   Overally this place is good, but when half your namesake is meh, I can't rate it higher unfortunately, even if the other half makes a non(sugar)believer like me convert."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time on Saturday and I can honestly say it was so amazing. For Easter they had a carrot cake donut which was incredibly well balanced with a carrot cake like pudding on the inside and a perfectly fried donut on the outside. I also ordered the fried chicken wings with the Korean chili sauce and they were the best wings I have ever had. Great customer service as well, Austin helped us out and was extremely nice and helpful and knew everything out the food. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Six of us went here for a birthday lunch.  Since it is in an old KFC restaurant, and typically fast food style seating, we could not all sit together. That was as expected and our fault for picking this place.  However, despite all the rave reviews, only one person in our group liked the food.  The name says it all:  the only menu choices are chicken, donuts, and ramen.   You do get a few choices of sides and type of sauce, but that's it.  Chicken, donuts, and ramen.  The chicken was very crispy, and the donuts come in unusual flavors, but neither was anything special.  The Japanese dipping sauce was mostly ketchup.  The portions are very small for the price, and the not-very-good donuts are $3 each.  The pork ramen was nearly inedible, it had one piece of pork that was entirely fat, the dish was supposed to include a fish cake but didn't, and the broth had an off flavor.  I don't care for kimchi, but I think the broth would not have been very tasty even without the kimchi. All in all, not good.  I would not come back, and that seems to be the consensus of our whole party."}
{"text":"Looking for something different? You found it! I had the Korean style BBQ and corn miso stir fry and it was very tasty. Donut was ok nothing special."}
{"text":"Fantastic is all I can say, I don't eat a lot of chicken at fast food places, so this place is setup in an old KFC.  Well it is wonderful chicken, super crispy, super well battered and fryed up.  Then You have a choice of sauces which are crazy good, I tried the Korean one which was wonderful on so many levels, and the chicken still was crispy even under the unique sauces!  I had the cole slaw side which has a peanut dressing which was excellent, all topped off with a cake donut so light that it is a perfect ending to such a good meal.  The donut has a light lemon touch to it, the chicken I selected was the 3 piece with a sides for $10.50 wow what a great quality well made product to nosh on! Come early of later to avoid the crowds!  Still missed the bacon maple donut, shucks they already sold out when I got there."}
{"text":"HOLY. JESUS! I just finished devouring their fried chicken breast smothered in Korean chili sauce while driving... with my bare hands! It was dangerous and I could've almost died but it was well worth the risk. I also got some donuts but I haven't tried those yet. This was one of the best Korean style fried chickens I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  They had the best donuts and the most interesting flavors.  I ordered a coconut mango donut that was delicious.  We also had the chicken.  We each ordered a different sauce so we could try them all.  The Japanese BBQ was the best.  We ate outside on their patio and the employees kept coming outside to check on us and asking us if we needed anything.  So the service was great.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Legit!   I knew this place was going to be good because I love Welcome Diner. I ordered the chicken breast with Japanese BBQ sauce and an apple fritter and the Thai Slaw. My boyfriend ordered the 2 piece with the Spicy Korean Sauce, corn, and a maple bacon donut. I liked my sauce better, but his side of corn was bomb. The batter that they use on the chicken was light and crispy and the chicken was cooked perfectly, not all dry. I really wanted chicken wings, but they were sold out. The next time we go, it will be before 11 am so I can get chicken wings.  I wish it was open past 3pm :( so I could enjoy this deliciousness more days of the week than Saturday."}
{"text":"I get so excited when people are coming into town and I have some place that's amazing to take them too! The donuts are too die for. I like the cherry amaretto, and anything maple or coconut. I've tried all their sauces, and I love them all. I love Vietnamese herb, but you have to like fish sauce! And the Korean chili? Divine. If you want something sweeter do the BBQ. Only thing that sucks is the seating. I usually get there and have luck with booths, sometimes I'm outside. I wouldn't let that ever be a reason not to come! It's so good. Good enough to stand and wait!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but let me tell ya, I returned for the chicken. I can't even explain it, so delicious and crispy. The employees were super helpful when I asked questions about the menu. Unfortunately I don't remember the donuts being super memorable so I'll have to go back and give it a try. I'll definitely be updating this review soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful new addition to the neighborhood!  The place is really cute with great outdoor seating...and our furry friend joined us too.  I enjoyed a combo with sauce on the side, the corn and miso butter stir fry and a chocolate glazed donut...quite tasty!  The staff was super helpful since this was my first visit too."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place forever! My husband had the day off and it was before lunch time so we decided to give it a try and I'm not sure what the hype is all about.  The location is pretty easy to get to and there is tons of free parking. the restaurant is small but has that old time diner feel.  When we went to order, there was not a single donut in the case. It was fine because I mainly wanted to try the chicken. The employees seemed like they had a long day and were trying to hurry us when there was no one behind us in line.  They were also out of breasts so we ordered the thighs and drumsticks with the vietnamese herb garlic fish sauce. I chose the stir fry side and my husband chose the potatos. For our donut we got hot cake donuts on the side.  We took our seat and the food came out promptly. The chicken was pretty tasty, I liked the sauce and the chicken was overall pretty juicy. my side was not very good, I did not like the stir fry blend and I hated wasting it. My hotcake donut tasted like lemon, so I was disappointed because I figured a hotcake donut would be reminiscent of hotcakes and I'm not a huge fan of lemon.  Overall it was okay, I have had better chicken at other restaurants but it was still better than most places attempt at fried chicken. I would love to try their donuts and see if those are better."}
{"text":"great place and so much to choose from!"}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious!  The outside is crispy and a really good flavor, not greasy at all.  The meat was hot and very juicy.  The service is very friendly.  They were already out of breasts at lunch time, but I got wings which were so very good.   My husband is not a chicken fan, so he got the breakfast donut.  It was egg, cheese, and sausage.  It was quite good.  The place is very small, with only about 6 tables."}
{"text":"I support the concept and the general fearlessness of a fried chicken and donut eatery.  I appreciate that they make their own donuts and do so in a limited fashion.  I also like that they choose smaller chicken suppliers with a good record.  I enjoyed my meal (breast with Japanese BBQ, Thai slaw, Bacon+Maple donut), though there wasn't anything outstanding about it.  In my opinion what does stand out is the price - about $15 for one fried chicken breast + a donut + a \"natural\" soda.  That's over $40 for three small meals + drinks.  For that (small) amount of food, it's quite pricey, and the quality (while good) wasn't worth it.  Even if I were to just stop by for donuts, they are between $2-3 each.  The food is good, but not the value."}
{"text":"Very friendly, fun staff today. It goes well with the great food they serve. The tonkatsu ramen is a well balanced blend of umami and kimchee. Am not a huge donut person, but the donuts are better than most.  Come in during the week if you are not one to brave the crowds. But if that is all the time you have, then be prepared to stand in line, because this local joint has limited seating inside the building. It is worth the try so check it out."}
{"text":"Really cool spot in Phx! Love the old diner vibe and artwork. I tried their well known Chicken + Donut and it was a pretty good mix! Definitely IG worthy! I've only been here once though and never had the chance to come back."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to this amazing donut and chicken restaurant. It is not in the most convenient location, but it is definitely worth finding it! We always wait to go till after 10:30am so we can also get their amazing chicken. We tend to get 3 donuts and a chicken combo for the two of us and split everything. They always have a wide variety of delicious looking donuts and it is so hard to decide which ones we are going to get. With the chicken, it is just superb, and so far we have only tried their Korean chili. We tried it the first time and it was so amazing that we wanted it again! Next time we will have to try one of the other sauces that I am sure are just as delicious. They have quite a few booths inside that always clear up by the time you order and get your drinks and donuts. They also have great outdoor seating. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Oh, and their coffee is delicious as well (both the hot and cold brew)!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best fried chicken I have ever had! I am not a fan of eating skin, but wow they make it so good you want to eat every bit of it. The cake donut is amazing as well! I was really impressed how good it was without any icing on it. Of course I have tried several different donuts there and all were absolutely amazing. Go early, be ready for amazing chicken, take extra donuts to go!"}
{"text":"First - a warning - they don't start serving fried chicken until 10:30AM.  If you are coming for \"chicken and donuts\", wait until after 10:30AM.  FANTASTIC donuts!!!    Maple with sliced bacon.  Apple fritters with bourbon pecan   Donuts glazed with a red wine reduction w/cacao nibs  So many options ... it makes my head explode.  Regarding their fried chicken, they have multiple sauces ... very very very tasty.  The sides are also pretty damned good.  Side note -- they serve a few mixed drinks on the weekend.  We didn't try them on either visit, but people at nearby tables were definitely enjoying them."}
{"text":"I still stand by my statement that the key lime pie donut is the best, but I took another stab at the apple fritter today. To my surprise they were fresh out of the fryer when I walked in but I will admit I was a little turned off watching the gal add the glaze with her fingers. I was so excited about its freshness that it didn't matter but I was again let down by how bland it was. The 1st time I ordered it, it was way too sweet and this time is just blah. Not to mention I smell like a southern kitchen on a Sunday morning. I'll stick with Bosa unless in the mood for KEY LIME!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great flavors, service, and food. Brilliant concept ! I liked the blueberry tarragon, and was obsessed with the brown butter Meyer lemon that was insanely good!"}
{"text":"This set up is terrific. Korean Fried Chicken in an old KFC space. It's quick. It's clean and yes, it is popular.  When you walk in you are treated with a menu that is list an instruction manual - LOVE this.  Pick your chicken. Pick your sauce. Pick your side and take a doughnut. Of course, my son never made it that far as he salivated over the wide variety of interesting doughnuts in the case.  Get there early because when I went back later in the day, they were nearly cleaned out.  I got a chicken great with Korean chili sauce, a peanut slaw type of side and a cake doughnut. Wish the chicken was slightly more spicy but I can fix that. It was fresh and crispy and they're doing it all farm to table which I really appreciate.  I also read that they do an amazing noodle day on fridays and I will check it out.   The reason for 4 stars is their hours.  This is really far from my home and so I am limited to visiting on the weekends.   Great stop though!"}
{"text":"Saw this place E reviews on check please. I have always wanted to try Koren Friday chicken but did not know that is was available in the city. So pleased to find this place serves it.   One thing to know up front. Get here early on weekends. THEY RUN OUT OF CHICKEN ROUTINELY ON THE WEEKENDS. When we arrived at 2pm on Saturday the plan had 6 wings left. No other chicken was available.  They said they only prepare a certain amount each day. WOW. WHAT A BUMMER! I almost left but glad I stayed.   We ordered the 6 wings with Koren bbq sauce. Wow. We will be back for this for sure. Crispy and a great spicy sweet sauce. So  so good   Chicken sandwich. I guess this is not fresh so they had this type of chicken.  It was good. The wings were much better.   Welcome breakfast sand: awesome.   Sides Seasoned potatoes: not much seasoned. Not that good.   Cole slaw good, a tad sweet. Needed a little more vinegar.   Doughnuts: the ape.fritter was the best we have had in Phoenix. So good.   Lemon maple cake: not that good. Lemon and maple not that great a combo imo.   Service 4/5. Doughnuts 4/5. Chicken 5/5. Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"LAAAAAAAHVVV EEEET!!!   The chicken was so good!! It was moist and juicy. They didn't overfry it or made it where it's raw on the inside. PERFECTION. Perfect breading. Perfect seasoning. Perfect crunch! Ah so good! And the Korean chili sauce definitely grew on me as I kept eating.   The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is the the actual hot cake donut that came with the chicken was a bit dry. If you have had Chinese donuts, it has the same consistency minus the sugar. It was just a plain donut. Also the portions was kinda small for the price. It satisfied me but I wasn't completely full. I'll probably get the bigger combo next time I come.   However, the flavored donut that I got on the side was quite big and good. Was is the best donut? No. But it's a memorable donut. There wasn't that many of a variety in comparison to the bigger donut shops but it's too be expected of such a small place.   SERVICE was super friendly and helpful for someone who is new to the menu. Such a cute place and atmosphere! Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Welcome Diner for a while and was very excited to hear they were opening up a new restaurant. Let me tell you that I was not disappointed when I finally got to try them.  Its just a small little restaurant, run by some really nice people. But what they are able to achieve is pretty cool.  Both my wife and I got the 3 piece chicken and donut. I got the Japanese bbq and she got the Korean Spicy. We ended up trading a piece so both of us could try the other. I was really impressed. Both flavors were really bold and tasty. Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of batter. The slaw that I got as a side was really good as well.  I upgraded my donut to one with blueberry cream cheese icing and it was good. But really for me it was the chicken that stole the show.  Give this place a try. Its small little business like this one, and of course its big brother Welcome Dinner, that help gives Phoenix its flavor."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating this strawberry glazed, granola topped and white chocolate cream-filled doughnut from Welcome Chicken + Donuts...while I didn't get anything else with my donut, I have to say I rather enjoyed it over that of a standard chain donut.  Overall, my review stands as a 3/5 stars as it comes down to more of a flavor and quality issue than anything else. While this donut was loaded well with filling, the glaze flavor was more basic than I anticipated...the standard strawberry glaze was flavorful, the granola sweet and cinnamony, the filling though, definitely lacked spark and flavor density...the dough was a little dry and dense than I tend to prefer...so, I wouldn't get again, but it was a decent representation of the originality and fun offered by this establishment.  One hiccup: Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a nasty drive for me as I live in Peoria...  I intend on trying more to hopefully round-out my review, but current only wish: pre-posting on social media of new flavors/combos of the general AND donut menu so I can coordinate when to go..."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  Just moved from Charleston SC to Phoenix, so I would like to think I know anything about good fried chicken, and this place HAS IT. SO GOOD. The breading is light and crispy and the chicken inside is so moist and flavorful.   Had the chicken breast combo, with the vietnamese sauce (nice added flavor, but the chicken really doesn't need sauce it's perfect on it's own), seasoned potatoes and it comes with a cake donut too (which was super good, tasted a little lemon-y and went really well with the chicken).   Also got a half dozen specialty donuts to take home. Quite a mix of donuts flavors (cranberry chutney, bread pudding...), more for the adventurous food types.  Also the service is really great and they're super friendly!"}
{"text":"I Could not believe the portion size of the chicken. I thought they got my order wrong. I had a hard time deciding on the donut and was very pleased with the chocolate glaze and rosewater candy."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday, super crowded, but worth it! Chicken was crispy on out and moist inside sauce was delicious! ! Got the Japanese bbq. Got a chocolate rose pistachio donut! The chicken might look red,  but that's because it's natural chicken and not bleached.   Definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Chicken + Donuts?!? Come on, what's not to love about that. This is my second time coming here, the first time was with a friend last September. I decided to stop by because I was in this side of town to get my car serviced. I had to fulfill the craving. I got the breast combo with Korean Chili with cucumber salad. For $8.50, you get a gigantic chicken boob, donut and side.   I got their 24 oz cold brew (which is nice and strong ) if you can't handle too much bitterness, ask for extra room for cream/almond milk etc. I realized after I placed my order that I could've got a beer instead but I guess I'll save the beer pairing for next time lol. Awesome juxtaposition of flavors; get weird with it!! Cheers"}
{"text":"This is a small casual restaurant with only a few tables inside and a bigger patio outside. You come here for Asian Inspired Fried Chicken made with organic red bird chicken and really great donuts. You place your order at the counter and first decide on what size and flavor chicken you want, then decide on your Asian Inspired side and lastly your donut. Some donuts are a $1.00 uncharge. You then seat yourself and wait for to hear your number called. A special was offered the day I was there and they were offering ramen in addition to the menu.  I went with the two piece Korean Chili Chicken with tom yum slaw and a key lime donut. The chicken had a nice crisp skin and the interior was juicy. I thought the sauce was tasty. It didn't have that caramel shattering crisp thing I like in Korean Fried Chicken but there is no denying this chicken still was tasty. The slaw was very unusual to me but sort of tasty. I thought the donut was cooked nicely. It was light and puffy and seemed oil free. The Key Lime Donut was really delicious with lots of flavors and textures. I just wish my donut had a little more of the delicious filling as mine was very scant with the filling.  The people working there were helpful and very concerned about how everything was.  Tasty fried chicken and a fun donut is a treat!"}
{"text":"Great chicken with very tasty sauces - although the chicken is excellent on its own too.  The donuts are also very good. This is a nice repurposed KFC, with a cool patio area in addition to the indoor seating.  I had the thigh and drum combo with the corn miso stir fry and Korean BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Interesting concept for a foodie, but my first visit did not leave me stricken with the itch to ever return.  I'm sure I'm going to upset many who really like this place.  I'm glad you do, keep spending money there if that's your thing, it definitely wasn't mine.  One disclaimer: I have a Thai wife that cooks amazing food for our family, so I have high standards for Asian food or fusion.  I also spent a lot of time in Asia trying many different foods and experiencing Asian flavor.  First and foremost, I thought it was ridiculously expensive when the location is not Tempe, or Scottsdale, and the quantity of food is sparse when served!  I spent nearly $10 for a twice fried 1/2 chicken breast (normal sized, not big like Bushes), and maybe a 2 oz Thai slaw with 1 ounce of Korean Sweet and Spicy sauce, and complimentary naked mini donut that wasn't all that good.  Coleslaw was  simply okay, but I've had many better non-creamy slaw.  The chicken had very cripsy skin, good flavor, but it was also very dry.  I'm guessing wings, or dark meat are a much better choice here.  Value was just not there for me, and honestly, I felt Canes or Bushes chicken taste better and you get nearly 2x the food for the same price!  I left still hungry, but didn't want to let go of anymore of my hard earned money when better food and better value is elsewhere to be found.  Glaze, or cake donuts are $3 each, I don't get it?  They aren't designer donuts made fresh for you one at a time.  Places like Bosa, LaMars, Beyond Donuts, and Lucky's all have fantastic donuts for less than $1 each.  At Lucky's you can get a dozen for a little over $8, and if you ever go - try their red velvet cake donut!  Lamars is the most expensive at $11/dozen, but they are well worth the $1 a piece.  Obviously, this place has fans, but I don't understand how they stay in business for the price charged versus their quantity and quality of food.  It's a mystery to me?  Not sure why more people haven't commented that for $10  - 1 piece of fried chicken is a bit gouging.  Also, other items on their menu are priced higher than any competitor in the valley.  These seem like NY City prices in the barrio of AZ, go figure!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time  This is just based on food: Ordered a combo with the Korean sauce and a premium donut to go. Flavor wise, it was sweet and not salty. But they were over sauced, the drum and thigh were soggy, but the breast had some crunch. Donut seemed a little dried out.  I'm willing to give them another shot.. Need something with more zing!"}
{"text":"Best maple bacon donuts ever and delicious fried chicken! I'm in love!!!! I will for sure be bringing friends and family here. I heard about this place on the news and I'm glad I came down here. You've got to love something different"}
{"text":"It is so funny how often I go to this place for my lunch even though my school and home is on the opposite side of Phoenix. Regardless, I always get their infamous Korean chili sauce on 2 pieces fried breast and drumstick. I tried the other flavors: Japanese and Vietnamese, I like them too but they arent marinated well with the chicken like the Korean chili does. The Vietnamese sauce was just covering the chicken and was quite salty. Beside getting those glorious chicken, I also treat myself with their coldbrew coffee. O M G.. They are the bomb! (Period). Another great thing about this place is the people work there, so genuine and nice. The owner there is awesome and so nice! Overall, I really love this plAce."}
{"text":"I came here for national donut day and was not disappointed.  I tried the Thai chicken and donut with a corn slaw/stir fry, which was bomb. I also had and ipa. Wayne was super accommodating and funny! Overall, this place was off the hook!! Can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Holy cow --- this place is the bomb. Some of the best fries chicken we've ever had. I had the Korean chili thigh and drumstick w/cucumber salad and my husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich  with warm corn salad. We also got an assortment of donuts, not sure what all they were because we left it up to guy working and he did a super good job. Nothing was greasy, everything was made with love. We loved that it was kinda out of the way a little bit, and we plan to come back and try the ramen."}
{"text":"Visited on National Donut Day and were delightfully surprised at how amazing the donuts are. And even more excited about the fried chicken. It was crispy and light.  The donuts are also airy and fluffy. Cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast with the family and the donuts are out of this world good. The Thai chili Bloody Mary is a must have! There service is friendly and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I visited specifically for the ramen as in Phoenix good ramen is hard to find. I ordered the pork from the not so friendly cashier and waited and waited it took a good 15 minutes before my food came out, which normally I wouldn't mind but I was the only customer in the store. My ramen came out cold. Who wants cold ramen! Not me. They re-cooked another bowl for me which took half the time a little confusing by whatever. It was just ok, nothing amazing. Super disappointed. A man that worked there was very nice apologized and gave us two free donuts while we waited, I appreciated it but the experience was already ruined and the donuts were dry. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Solid chicken and donuts for lunch but you will pay the piper with an afternoon of guilt and sluggishness. The chicken has good flavor and isn't overly heavy but the sauces do nothing for me.  Also a bit out of the way and in a neighborhood where Carolina's usually dominates my attention when I visit."}
{"text":"I liked it, but not sure what all the fuss is about. The chicken was cooked well, not dry... Korean bbq flavor was tasty. Donut didn't stack up to the other Phx donut places- even with bacon on it."}
{"text":"Damn good donuts. Idk how they make their filling but its just the right sweetness. The chicken is bomb and the slaw is on point. Props because its easy to make some mediocre slaw, very hard to get the right tang and coolness. I work in the area and i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Do hipsters think it's cool to run-out of chicken at a chicken place?  The one time they actually had chicken (Korean chili) it was good and had interesting flavors. Not bland by any means. But, the other two times it was a complete waste of my time - they had run out of chicken. The most recent time was 1pm on a Friday and they were completely out. I was turned away. Well, I will not be back unless I hear management has figured out how to prep."}
{"text":"Love this place. I bring the nephew here from our west in sun city every other month.  His two favorite things chicken and donuts. I think he's convinced there is chicken in the donuts but whatever, who am I to ruin his dream of Santa, Hogwarts or Chicken donuts.  Not me.  I grabbed a breakfast Sammie this week and bought a shirt. The crew is happy, friendly and don't make you feel bad for not reading the menu completely. I'd have loved to try the ramen but it's only available on the weekends.  If you get lunch make sure to grab a pack of donuts with assorted flavors to spread the word of this awesome gem and because you should be a good person to those around you. But donuts, get more friends."}
{"text":"When two great comfort foods meet  Welcome Chicken + Donuts  serves exactly what the name says, fried chicken and donuts.  Everything at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is made fresh on the premises daily.   Welcome Chicken + Donuts has the most  amazing flavored donuts.  The dounuts are truly inventive with flavors like espresso, maple bacon, PB&J, crème brûlée, the list goes on and on. These donuts are a must try.  On my first visit I choose one of my favorite flavor combinations, Cream Cheese and Blue Berry.  My lunch companion choose the Apple Fritter and Wisconsin Cheese. The donuts were light, pillowy, and glazed with a wonderfully light sweet topping.  Now let's talk chicken.  All I can say is the chicken at Welcome Chicken + Donuts is delicious.  The chicken has  a crispy well-seasoned skin, and juicy tender meat, just like chicken should be.  Welcome Chicken + Donuts use a unique blend of varuous spices to give a world flavor to their chicken.  You can choose to have chicken seasoned with a dry rub or wet, both are delicious.   Together or separately - the chicken and donuts all winners.  I definitely recommend Welcome Chicken + Donuts."}
{"text":"I always come here and I will always come back. Breast and Leg Combo with Stir Fry Korean Chili Sauce. Best fried chicken and amazing customer service. Very welcoming staff."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place. I had come from Welcome diner the night before. I had a great experience and expected the same.   To note, I shared a dozen donuts with friends, 6 premium, 6 standard donuts. I don't think the standard donuts were anything to write home about. I enjoyed about half of the premium donuts, particularly the fruity ones. So from a high level, I would say lean towards their fruity donuts and you'll be good. I'd be interested to try the chicken (which doesn't start until 10AM). They also serve a bunch of random asian things such as ramen.  I could see myself liking other flavors from this place as they rotate a lot of flavors. However, as a baseline donut dough to donut dough quality comparison, I'd say these are just standard.  tl;dr get the fruity flavors, otherwise standard donut party"}
{"text":"This review is solely for the morning donuts. Service was nice.  But the donuts were not. Donuts range from $1.75-$3.50 I think. Coffee was $2. Both tasted non-special. I just wasn't impressed by their donuts."}
{"text":"First time there and the last time. Chicken breast had no meat. When I talked to the guy about it, he didn't do anything to fix it. Princess Leia working counter, somewhat rude. Obviously family members may post reviews to give better ratings. 98% of my reviews... are POSITIVE!"}
{"text":"I like risk. I like drinking iced toddy. I also like fried chicken.  Tomorrow the delightfully scrappy team that brought their delicious vision of what a local diner could be when the food was made the superstar, opens their doors for the first day of business... and what will they be featuring? Asian-glazed fried chicken, in-house created donuts, some misc veggie side dishes... and cold-brewed coffee that, in my opinion, is good enough to stand alone and make me get in my car. Often.   The risky part, however, is two-fold:  Will the former KFC building on the SW corner of 16th St. and Buckeye turn donuts into dough? Well, the Meat Shop has yet to meet its maker. The Duce has yet to take a deuce. Lolo's cried, \"YOLO,\" and promptly upgraded its school clothes. So, maybe it's all good in the hood... the neighborhood that I love, that is.  The other risk, besides location... location... location... is whether or not the trio of Asian chicken glazes will be embraced. As southern food goes, this is definitely from the south... well, South Korea. Currently 3 sauce options are available: a savory Korean, a fragrant Vietnamese and a tangy Japanese BBQ. During Day #2 of their soft-opening, we tried all 3 flavors.  So, first things first. As smart as it would've been to grab a To-Go menu, I didn't; and although my mind is like a viscous steel trap, sometimes that steel is more like a warm Gummi Bear and really doesn't retain shit, and therefore, caveat reador (basically, don't vandalize my bike if I get small detail wrong).  There were options for a 2-Piece, a 3-Piece, only chicken breasts and finally, the \"whole chicken.\" A 6-pack and 12-pack of wings are available as well. Each combo includes a small, asian-ish side dish (corn, sliced cucumbers or slaw) and your choice of house-made donut. There were 5 of us and we all ordered 2-Piece combos, and lamely all got the same Korean sauce. All sauces are available on the side, but they recommended having them tossed... and that was a delicious decision. I also ordered a half dozen wings with the Vietnamese glaze. Eventually, I returned for 2nds and brought back 2 chicken breasts, glazed in the Japanese BBQ.   The 2-Piece Combos are a drumstick & a thigh. The 3-Piece steps you up to a breast. I love the flavor of dark meat, so I was particularly happy with my duo. The batter had a gentle, buttery crunch, savory flavor and was right up my alley. To me, it wasn't spicy, but extremely flavorful and satisfying, with notes of sweet, garlic, sesame and soy. The chicken was juicy and tasty as if it were brined. Was it? I don't know. The wings are actual wings... and not the sports bar blend with \"drumettes.\" Also, they're the whole wing... right down to the tip, so expect that \"L\" shape if you order them. The Vietnamese glaze was very fragrant and though it pho'k up my friend's pallet due to the fish flavor, his lady-friend said it was her fave. It reminded me of Nuoc Cham, the traditional sweet dipping sauce made from sugar, vinegar, fish sauce, garlic and Thai chili (your recipe may vary!). Finally, the Japanese BBQ was Mr. Anti-Fish's top choice. I liked it but also felt it was the least expressive... especially next to the other two statement-makers.   I tried the apple fritter with bits of baked cheddar. We also shared a cream cheese w/blueberry and a couple of the key lime donuts. I think what seemed like a banana's foster donut also showed up. Although everyone had their personal fave, overall, I'd rate these donuts far and above the average 'nut. Flaky. Delicate. Flavor-layered. Creative. Risky. Bad-ass. Boom!   Finally, the cold-brewed iced coffee was SICK. LOVED it. Big and rich... balanced and truly tasty. It reminded me of my first toddy years ago at Sagasta's place, Jobot. They also have real cream. Viscous and oozy... the anti-soy of milks!  Only request?  - Larger pieces of chicken. The drum was a small drumstick and the thigh was just larger than a kiwi.  In summary, the chicken was delicious and the donuts were... fantastic.   For an $8-13 price range, as long as locals will get their asses down to 16th & Buckeye, I think this place is gonna work out great! Go try it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My first visit, but will make myself a regular when I return. I also visited their late night establishment Welcome Diner, also delish.  The menu isn't huge, but what they offer is satisfying. You pick your chicken, your sauce and side. With your meal comes a plain donut, or you can upgrade to any other in the case. I had a 1 piece breast with Japanese BBQ sauce, Corn Miso Butter Stir Fry,and a Cardamom Sugar donut. Nothing short of amazing on both taste and presentation for such a low cost meal. The packaging was also simple, yet appealing to me: recycled cardboard box with a Welcome Chicken + Donut stamp. The inside looks of course like a diner and the chicken cartoon artwork on the walls was fun. Make sure to come early, the popular donuts run out and sometimes certain chicken too!"}
{"text":"So I've been here a million times and realized I never wrote a review.  I'll start with, I've had a lot of donuts in my lifetime and these are by far the best I've ever had (or at least the filled ones). And the added bonus? They also serve fried chicken dipped in tasty Asian inspired sauces and bomb ass pork belly ramen. Weird combo? Absolutely not. The staff here is always impeccably nice as well. This place is kind of situated in a very unassuming area, and there's not much else around it. I like the outdoor seating here, but if it's too hot for the day they also have indoor seating available. If you get a meal, make sure to upgrade to a premium donut (you won't regret it). The donuts rotate daily, but my absolute favorite I've had here is the Key Lime Pie. If you ever see this one hanging out in the case grab it while you can. Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"The donuts are pretty good. They are huge for sure. It's a divey place but incredibly unique. The personnel was a little disengaging. Honestly I didn't feel too welcome.  Only came for the doughnut so I'm not sure about the chicken but it seems to be an iconic place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and each time, they ran out of something.   First visit, it was the cucumber salad and second they only had drums and thighs(I'm a breast kinda guy). Not a big deal.   Anyway, the chicken is delicious and crispy. The unique sauces takes the dipping game to a whole new level.   I think I will try the ramen next but it's so hard to say no to fried chicken."}
{"text":"Heard great things, so I was excited to give it a try! Very cute place with unique donut flavors and lots of sauce choices for the chicken. I ended up getting a breakfast sandwich, the south by southwest: interesting flavor but I can't say I'm hooked. Really wanted to try the vegan ramen but it was pricey. Also, all of the chicken is bone-in so if that's not your thing then it might be better to skip."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of write up in AZ Republic on 8/23/15 and well worth the trip. The greeter at counter was very friendly and gave his recommendation for sauce and side which I appreciated.  I had 2pc chicken and side and it was damn good.  The drum and thigh was seasoned to perfection and skin was nice and crispy like I like it.  The corn stir fry was my side and it was very tasty.  Very small inside and limited seating but definite try.  For the donut livers there is plenty to chose from in the cases.  Not my thing but saw plenty that I know friends would love.    Will be back for the wings next visit."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken breast with Japanese BBQ on the side, Thai yum slaw and Thai tea Arnold Palmer donut.  Customer service-amazing! Everyone was really helpful and even let me try the Korean Chili sauce, which I was not a fan of.  Fried chicken breast- incredible, best fried chicken I have ever had.  Japanese BBQ sauce- I am glad I got it on the side so I could dip the chicken and it was amazing! Will get it again for sure.  Thai yum slaw- wasn't a fan, it was very miso salad dressing tasting, I probably should have asked for an explanation on it. I would have thought it would have peanuts or some sort of peanut sauce thing.  Thai tea Arnold Palmer- was a good donut but was not a huge fan of the sauce.   I am definitely coming back for some chicken and Japanese BBQ sauce and hopefully they will have the maple bacon donut in stock for me to try."}
{"text":"I really hate giving this place 3 stars because I love the welcome diner. I have been very excited to try this place fora while . We ordered a two piece and a bowl of ramen.The ramen looked beautiful but was absolutely horrible. It tasted like dirty water. I don't even think they used canned broth. Nothing even close to the flavor pork bone ramen should taste like. If I were rating based on the ramen it would have been a 1 star. The chicken and donuts were both super greasy. The sauce on the side was really tasty but  it was hard to dip the chicken in because of the grease.  I went in to buy another donut since my ramen was inedible. I quietly told the lady taking orders about the ramen and the terrible taste and was simply told she would let the chef know . I felt cheated out of a good meal. I will not be back here."}
{"text":"I was on my way to an interview, so I didn't go ape. Otherwise, plenty of variety here to indulge in and super fresh. Coffee was local & legit, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We came in the afternoon and got chicken and 6 donuts just before they sold out. They are super busy due to the publicity but it's well worth it! The people that work there are extremely friendly and very helpful to first time customers. The chicken was probably the best part. I recommend going early in the day to get a better selection of donuts as when we went (around 1pm) they had a limited selection left. Nonetheless they were still delicious!"}
{"text":"In a word, crispy. This place has some of the crispiest chicken I have ever had. It is crisp to the level of Korean BonChon chicken. They give you a choice of sauces and with the combos you get a side and donut.  The donuts are so tasty. The flavor combos are very original. We had the thyme berry and chocolate rose pistachio. Thyme berry reminded me of a fresh guava interestingly enough.  This place definitely reminds me of Federal Donuts in Philly. There isn't a ton of seating inside but there is a nice patio area. It looks dog and kid friendly. Crisp chicken, full belly, can't lose."}
{"text":"This place is fantastically cute and service was great. The chicken itself was good.  Nice and moist. I got the Korean chili sauce but personally for me it was too salty. Next time I and going to choose a different sauce or get it on the side. I got a jalapeño mango donut because that sounded so intriguing! It was a bit too weird for me. And I'm not sure if it's because we were there near the end of close, but the donuts all seemed fairly dry when biting into them. I still don't think that's a good excuse though. I'm definitely going to try it again. I hope to have a better food experience next time."}
{"text":"1st experience, amazing! Korean glaze breast, buttery corn and the most amazing red wine glazed donut with chocolate pudding filling. Mmmmh!  2nd experience, yuck!  Vietnamese glaze was too strong, salty and stinky.  The donut may have been good but I couldn't get over the stinky chicken. And I usually like the Vietnamese sauce. A donut was left out of my to go order too. Err."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a lot of white meat on it.  The key lime donut was truly delicious!  The only negatives about this place is that is isn't open on Sundays, they close early and they don't serve chicken until 10:30am.  If you can work around those obstacles then you will absolutely enjoy Welcome Chicken + Donuts."}
{"text":"I tried Welcome Chicken + Donuts today for the first time with one of my friends. She has been raving about it for a while so I figured today was a good day to go (finals!).   We were greeted by whom I assume is the owner and he was super friendly and helpful. I decided on the chicken breast with the Korean chili sauce, Thai yum slaw, and the original cake donut. I also got a cold brewed coffee with the house-made coconut caramel sauce.  The chicken's flavor was great, but the meat was dry and difficult to cut/bite at. The slaw was a nice addition flavor wise. I ate a bite of chicken, donut, and slaw and it was a great combo! The coffee was so delicious. The taste was a little weird at first, but I got used to it and really like it (kinda like coconut milk). I took off 1 star because of the dry chicken, I wish I was juicier and tender.  When we were leaving the owner (I think) gave us 2 free donuts! A Thai tea and something watermelon. Very interesting flavors...  Overall, the service was impeccable and the food was pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"Menu was really easy to read, I like the straight-to-the-point options. Donuts had that nice airy bite to them, with the side of some iced coffee, you can't go wrong ."}
{"text":"This seems to be a place run by millennials and for millennials. If you're a millennial, from the looks of things, you'll enjoy it. Its a Korean style food place with donuts. I don't get the big deal about donuts. Its fried bread. I've never had a bad 'fresh' donut, even if it fell on the floor!   The service is slow, the prices are high, they seem very disorganized. They were selling items they didn't have (ran out of dark meat chicken long before they stopped accepting orders for it). Took almost 30 minutes for one chicken breast.   This place is clearly a fad right now. As you get older, you'll see this cycle. New donut place, all the rage, lines out the door, outrageous prices and then, after a year or two people decide donuts are bad for them  (remember Krispy Kreme was opening up locations like crazy? Now try to find one.)  There are six booths inside and more seating outside. We didn't have much choice but to go outside since the line to order blocks access to four of the booths. While outside, there are very aggressive bees trying to eat your food. I like bees, but I prefer not to get stung while I'm having lunch. I'm funny that way.  If you want better selection, a nicer atmosphere and delicious chicken, check out Lolo's a couple of miles down the road.  Unless you're a millennial, in which case you and your man-bun will love it here."}
{"text":"I have gone here twice now and tried the chicken with both the chili sauce and the Japanese BBQ sauce.  The Korean chili sauce is better by far, nice spice to it.  The Japanese BBQ tasted to me like hoison sauce dumped from a jar and sprinkled with a few sesame seeds.  Be sure to order the chicken with the sauce on the side if taking it to go - I learned after the first time when I got home and what would have been nice crispy chicken was all sogged up with sauce and the sauce had run all over the side dish as well because it was not in a separate container either.  The chicken is awesome, and I want to try the wings but each time there was a sign saying they were sold out -- you would think if they are that popular they would plan for that and have more on hand.    They have a unique selection of donuts that seem a little pricey but I may give them a try soon. Apparently you need to get there early for the donuts too because about half of the flavors were sold out each time I went."}
{"text":"First time here and what an amazing experience!  I didn't realize that everything here was non-GMO and ORGANIC which was a huge a major plus!!!    I had the Wisconsin cheddar cheese apple fritter and two piece fried chicken with Japanese barbecue sauce.  It was beyond fantastic. Fried chicken was so crunchy moist and succulent that it pretty much melted in your mouth.  I was hesitant about adding the Japanese barbecue sauce but I am so glad that I did. It is a definite must in my book!  The donuts were just as equally amazing and oozing with unique creativity freshness and so much taste in each and every bite.  I was torn between the cheddar cheese Wisconsin apple fritter and the banana cream peanut butter pecan, so I did both and loved it.  You definitely have to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Donuts are the new cupcake, for real! I have been following Welcome Chicken + Donuts on Instagram for ages and got to try it today. I very rarely eat donuts or stuff like that, but this was worth the unhealthiness! It's not in the best area, but it was worth the trip. The donut shop is real small, but the outdoor seating area in the back is really nice. I don't eat meat, but I saw people had ordered the chicken and it looked to be good quality. Also I was surprised to see that there were cocktails on the menu, that's pretty cool!  I had a hard time deciding which donut to order! I decided to get one unique one and one more classic one, and they were both vegan! I went for the Thai Arnold Palmer and Double Chocolate and shared with my family. We all loved them! They were sweet without being too sweet. I wasn't sure what I expected the tea one to taste like, I was unsure of it, but I really enjoyed it. I'm a believer in weird donuts now. The chocolate donut was pretty good, but I preferred the other one. Prices weren't too bad either for fancy donuts ha. This was a tasty experience I would recommend for donut lovers."}
{"text":"The donuts are different, but not in a bad way. The dough just seems to be cooked better. That's the only way I can describe it. The cake donut is perfectly sweet.  My boyfriend got the vegan ramen and said it was better than he expected. The flavors all meshed well and it was well seasoned. He said it's the most authentic ramen he has tired.  The guy at the counter was VERY educated on the menu. He answered all of our questions throughly and beyond. I love when the people working know what they are selling. The chef also served our ramen personally and gave us some suggestions as far as adding lime and hot sauce.   We will definitely be back if we are in the area again!"}
{"text":"Chicken- The flavor is pretty good, but the sauces (Korean and Japanese) tasted as if it came from a bottle.   Donut- I had the maple glaze with bacon. I've had better. The glaze was too sweet and over powered the the bacon somehow.   Coffee - We loved  the cold brew.  Overall it was just okay."}
{"text":"I was pissing out my ass yesterday because of your chicken!!! Couldn't go to work neither! Stop selling half cooked chicken!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Guns N Roses - Welcome To The Jungle)  Welcome Chicken & Donuts we got food and drinks We got everything you want sugar, we know donuts We are the people that can find whenever you're hungry If you got the munches honey we got your ramen  In the city, Welcome Chicken & Donuts Try it bring you to your sha nananana knees knees I wanna watch you eat   I've heard of chicken & waffles, but never chicken and donuts!?  I came here on a Saturday afternoon with some friends.  The place itself is quite tiny and from  what I know used to be a Kentucky Fried Chicken so it goes to say from the outside it looks somewhat like a fast food joint.  They do have a large patio with super large benches which can definitely seat some big booties.....guess it's a sign of what's to come!  I started to order the combo of chicken breast with Korean spice on the side since I like my chicken crispy and don't care to have it soaking in the sauce.  For my donut I went for the Chipotle Limon; Lemon cake with a hint of chipotle and sprinkled with sugar.  The chicken was definitely crispy and crunchy to the bite; it was well cooked and juicy too!  The Korean spice was a tad bite light for being spicy, but also very generic.  The donut was okay since I generally don't care for them anyways.    In the end, I feel like the concept is cool and caught everyone's attention since it's fried chicken and donuts....2 of America's favorite bites....right!?  Overall, however the combo doesn't really mesh well in my opinion but it's novel. They serve beer here so that's a kicker. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just had an unreal and magical experience here.  Somebody please help me tell the world about this incredible place.  Most delicious fried chicken and unique and mouth-watering donuts I've ever had the pleasure of eating."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of great things about the donuts. About a month ago I was finally nearby and decided to stop in since it was still early. It was close to noon and only a few people were in line. We debated on ordering chicken, but after seeing it just sitting out at room temperature, partially fried, on the speed cart, made it very unappealing. The donut case was full, but I was disappointed by the choices, I was hoping for at least one filled doughnut option. We ordered half a dozen and it was $15 with the tip I left. The service was friendly and fast. However, once we got home we were very disappointed by the donuts. The raised donuts didn't seem very fresh and had a very greasy taste. I was underwhelmed by the lack of flavor from the Maple glazed. The salted blueberry lemon had a very greasy taste to it, the glaze was good. The chocolate pistachio rose had a decent flavor, but the donut was dry. The apple fritter was very dry and had a greasy after taste. It also lacked apple, mine had 4 tiny pieces. The sprinkle cake donut was the best flavor and freshness wise, until I got to the middle, it wasn't even cooked, completely raw in the middle. The classic chocolate was the same exact way. We ended up not even finishing one donut. So after spending $15 on half a dozen of donuts, I was extremely disappointed. I really feel I wasted my money. I excepted a lot more especially based on all the rave reviews. One star is for the friendly service I received, but based on the donuts and the holding of food standards, I cannot rate any higher."}
{"text":"This review is about the Vegan Donuts! They offer them Friday through Sunday and maybe that's just enough time for me to miss them and stop by to get more. The fritters are wondrous fried pieces of joy with a nice apple to dough ratio and a beautiful amount of glaze to finish them off. The day I went they also offered a nice Spicy Mango and Jalapeno combination that was magnificent and a Smoky Peach Pecan that was savory and sweet bliss. I was able to sneak away from work to grab a few and while I don't want to make this a habit it may get out of hand real soon."}
{"text":"The wine donut was the best we tried three others nothing special in my opinion. Pretty cool they serve beer and chicken as well. Outside patio is nice."}
{"text":"Have been waiting to give this spot a try for some time and finally had the chance. As some have mentioned the shop is small and cozy but comfortable. Staff (1 I dealt with) was very friendly and informative. As a newbie, I asked for suggestions and settled for the BBQ chicken breast and three donuts (maple plus bacon, passion fruit, and something sesame) for the road. Chicken and sauce were good but not super. Same can be said for the donuts. Passion and sesame were just okay but the maple and bacon were super tasty. I overall left a little dissatisfied given how high my hopes were. I want and will give the place another try as I want to try another donut and their ramen. For now, I will stick with Sunrise Donuts."}
{"text":"I went there at about 1200 on a Saturday.  What I ate was EXCELLENT.  I have no idea what they use as a batter on that chicken but it was fantastic.  Now, the only thing negative is, they didnt have too much as a choice for extra donuts and they were out of chicken wings...!!  I guess you have to get there earlier but oh wow that food was excellent.  I ordered the bbq sauce version and am very very happy with it.  I will return."}
{"text":"WHAT A HIDDEN GEM!  Came to Phoenix on a work trip and we decided to stop by this place for lunch!  There is plenty of free parking right next to the place! Seating inside is limited, but there are plenty of tables outside to enjoy your food!  It's more of a casual place so you order first and find a seat!  I ordered: THIGH AND DRUM COMBO - This chicken is sooooooooooooo good - it's super crispy which I love but it's also so juicy inside - It also comes with a sauce which I think is almost the best part! - The pieces of chicken aren't super big, so beware if you're hungry maybe order a few more pieces  THAI SLAW - this comes with the combo as a side - this was surprisingly really good - I had my doubts, but the peanut taste in the slaw makes it perfect!  RED WINE CHOCOLATE PUDDING DONUT - a wine donut,,, HOW COULD I RESIST -  you can definitely taste the wine, it was a little strong for me  - the chocolate pudding inside saved it! - I love filling in donuts so this was definitely a great decision for me!  Overall, love this place and would recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"So, a friend of mine knows my love of both chicken and donuts and recommended this place. I'm really glad she did! Let me start out by telling you how amazing the chicken is! I do not know what they do to this chicken but; they are doing it right. The chicken is enveloped in a perfectly crisp coating, that is seasoned to perfection. I tried the Vietnamese garlic herb sauce. It was so delicious it really could've been a beverage, LOL! The only reason why I have given this establishment four stars instead of five is I don't understand why you cannot get chicken as soon as they open. In my opinion,  if you have \"chicken and donuts\" in your title, chicken and donuts should always be available."}
{"text":"This place was good. Stopped in for a quick lunch. Got the one piece + side (slaw) + doughnut. Chicken was excellent, sauce was on point, slaw was good (a little too zesty/salty/seasoned for me). Doughnut was good, but I regretted just getting a \"cake\" doughnut. Should have upgraded to the apple fritters, which looked amazing.   Outdoor seating was nice. Service was also great.   Glad I stopped!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place's food is amazing, as everyone else has said. But what really puts them over the top is their amazing service.   After meeting friends here for lunch, I decided I had to bring my kid in for a donut. We stopped in and to my horror were met with a completely empty case. The counter person saw the look on her face and handed her a donut he'd fried from the last bit of batter left in the kitchen. He said it was going to be his after-work snack, but he'd rather she had it, and he refused to charge us. She was thrilled, declared it the best donut she'd ever tasted, and asked if we could bring these donuts instead of cupcakes to school for her upcoming birthday. I guess these guys have earned themselves a lifelong fan."}
{"text":"How can the name be \"Welcome CHICKEN & Donuts\" and you can't get chicken till 10:30??  Guess we'll never know if they live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Recently went for chicken, place sure went downhill, the chicken pieces were smaller and just didn't have the crunch it used too.  Also ordered the shiitake mushrooms, it wasn't soaked long enough and it was tough and chewy....just lost a frequent customer.  There must be a new and untrained cook."}
{"text":"OMG!! Some of the best chicken and sides and sauces ever. This will become a regular lunch spot.."}
{"text":"Very short and unique menu so it's hard to make a decision but the food is fantastic! Great quality chicken and even the plain donuts have great flavor!"}
{"text":"Two pm Sunday is not the time to try this place. A handful of donuts were left, ramen was sold out, so were chicken thighs and drumsticks. We ordered chicken breasts with two sauces in the side, and the slaw. Chicken breasts were meaty and cooked perfectly.   We are Asian and the Thai herb sauce had far too much fish sauce, but the Koren Colin sauce was excellent. I wanted to rate this place 1 star but my husband said the the food was good. The one star was due to the incredibly rude woman taking orders. We sat by the counter in earshot of all the hellos and thank yous. We received none. Good food or not, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Chicken is crispy. Fast service. Inside and outside seating. We visit once a week and the 3 piece W/ donut is my usual go to"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Finally was able to stop in when my friend got his citizenship. Donuts were good, but I expected a lot more based on how they are promoted. Tried a few different kinds. Seemed expensive to me for a donut. I was not too impressed either. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but the donut to value ratio seems off to me. I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium product. This didn't feel like one of those deals. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable, but the food just was off. I will try again another time and update If this was a one time kind of experience."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was hot, fresh, moist, and perfectly seasoned. They are generous with the salt but it goes very well with the light perfectly fried skin. The donut selection is very unique and very fresh and delicious! I got the Korean sauce on the side but preferred the chicken without the sauce. The cucumber salad was very tasty as well. Keep in mind you are not going for the ambience, your are going for the delicious food. The dining area is just a few booths and is nothing special."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some friends. I have had this place bookmarked for a long time so I was rather excited when we decided on this place.   You can order donuts or chicken individually but I would recommend getting a combo so you can get the best of both worlds and get a side. I ordered the breast combo and paid extra to upgrade my donut to one of the fancier donuts. One of my friends didn't want her plain donut that came with her meal so I also got her plain donut too. For the chicken, I chose the Korean chili sauce and for the breast to be tossed in the sauce. For the donut, I upgraded to the maple bacon donut. For my side, I chose the Thai yum slaw.  They give you the donut immediately out of the case at the counter. I started eating my donut before the chicken came out because it obviously was not going to go with the chicken at all. The maple bacon donut was so good. The donut itself was so soft and fluffy. The bacon was cooked nicely. The bacon was cooked well for a donut topping. I love maple bacon donuts and this one is definitely one of the better ones I have had. I also started on the plain cake donut that my friend gave me before my chicken came out. It was more dense than a regular donut. It was also a lot less sweet. I can see it going with the chicken in a chicken and waffles kinda way. I would never just order this plain donut though for any reason than to eat it with the chicken but even then why do that when there are so many other better sounding and probably better tasting donuts in the case?   When the chicken came out, it was super hot and the skin was super crispy, even though it was covered in the Korean chili sauce. I wish I had ordered the sauce on the side though. I found it a little too salty for me. It had a nice heat to it though and had good flavor... other than the saltiness. The Thai slaw came in a little cup next to the chicken in the basket. The slaw was fresh and tasted pretty good. It had a lighter flavor and really helped balance out the saltiness of the Korean chili sauce on the chicken. The chicken breast piece I had wasn't juicy but it wasn't dry either. I didn't mind the piece I received at all.   I would definitely like to come back and get more donuts and try different things on the menu."}
{"text":"My only complaint is they keep running out of my favorite flavor of donuts but I guess that keeps me trying new ones. The chicken is very good. Take a walk on the wild side and eat it as it's meant to with the sauce on it. I had the Korean Chili Chicken, Thai Yum Slaw and a Classic Cake Donut when I went for lunch but I have had some of their yummy donuts on other trips. I am sort of glad they are not closer becuase their donuts are the best in town."}
{"text":"Going to try and be honest as possible with this review. I went there with very high hope, I thought Chicken + Donuts was a really cool and unique combo because most people love both and it's different from the typical Chicken + Waffle thing that everyone is doing now. The atmosphere was pretty simple but had it's own unique original feel to it. Excellent and friendly customer service, pretty cool people. Now to the food.  I was overwhelmed with all the different variety of donuts they had to choose from and was given a sample of their newest \"Maple Butter Corn\" donut (I think that's what it was called). Wasn't impressed at all, the taste did not live up to the presentation nor the price. I can't remember exactly but I believe they charge close to or just over $3 for one, definitely not worth it. I ended up ordering the 3-piece combo with a donut on the side which was a classic glaze because I figured you can't go wrong with an orignal glazed donut. I was wrong, the glazed donut was flavorless with a sugar + water pastey like glaze. You'd be better off going to your local donut shop and will get more bang for your buck. The chicken was pretty good, if you're not into kind of exotic tastes I suggest getting your suaces on the side, very unique tasting sauces but not bad just different. The Miso-Corn stir fry was AMAZING!!!! I'd literally drive across town for that side alone. My date ordered the chicken salad and said it was \"really good\".   Final verdict on this place: I'd recommend it if you're in the area but it's not a must. There's nothing about this place that gives an experience you can't get anywhere else. SO if you're in the area go give it a try, if you don't you're not missing much. You can wait until it's convenient for you."}
{"text":"I love there chicken.  It's like my mama.  And the Donuts are to die for.  I'll never eat a regular donut again"}
{"text":"My current favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I'm almost scared to write this review and encourage more people to visit and eat MY donuts. :)  This is a no frills place and I love that. I've been to too many restaurants that are dressed up with gorgeous ambience but lack in the food department. Chicken + Donuts isn't a fine dining restaurant by any means, it's a simple spot to grab a quick lunch or donut and coffee. Simply put, it's damn delicious.   My favorites are the Vietnamese herb sauce and the lemon poppy seed donut.   Now, because I like sharing, I encourage you to go, but please don't eat all my donuts!"}
{"text":"Great donuts and good chicken! Very small inside but a creative concept, excited to try it a second time!"}
{"text":"To be honest I don't even know what donuts I got... I had one the staff pick for me they all looked good and I couldn't choose, but they were all good!"}
{"text":"Apparently chicken can be served with any breakfast food! FIVE STARS for the cold brew iced coffee, which is reason alone to get here. Seriously the best and they top it with heavy cream which hardly oozes out of the dispenser!! The donuts rival portland's voodoo donuts, and don't shy away from the plain old fashioned served with your chicken. Fun, local, innovative and something different. Get here! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Dropping the hammer on the much hyped #ramen! I'm made it a mission and purpose to get here right at 1030am not to miss this meal time show! I refuse to lose"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a post-hike meal.  I really like the concept of chicken and donuts (my two favorite items)!  It had a sweet and savory taste!  My favorite is the Korean chili sauce.  I'm not too sure about the Japanese and the Vietnamese one, it was a little overpowering and salty. I will come back again to get the whole chicken combo (great value for 2 people)."}
{"text":"Amazing. Went in with another family (9 of us) for a quick breakfast get-together. Got a dozen to share (cut them into quarters) and then ended up ordering another 2 that not everyone got to sample. Wonderful flavor combinations. Standouts were the Key Lime, Blueberry Cheesecake, Apple Fritter and the Lemon Poppyseed. But the Chocolate-Pudding-Filled-Red-Wine-Glazed-With-Pinot-Noir-Salt was INSANELY AWESOME. Service was super friendly. Can't wait to come back during lunch hours and try the fried chicken, which smelled phenomenal."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my fiancé. We got there about 10:20 ( they don't serve chicken until 10:30 on the dot) luckily we got there just in time because 5 minutes later the line was out the door. I ordered the 1 piece breast with Korean chilli glaze and cucumber salad my fiancé got the 2 piece combo with 2 thighs and the Thai coleslaw. They both came with a plain cake donut. Everything was awesome the skin was crispy even after being coated in finger licking delicious Korean chilli glaze. The donut was crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the cucumber salad. Wasn't bad, just not my cup of tea. We also got a half dozen doughnuts just to try. Chipotle limon sugar, key lime, peanut butter blueberry, maple bacon, red wine, and pomegranate blood orange. They were all pretty delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So it's horrible that this place is about 5 minutes from my house!  I love donuts and am always on the lookout for the right kind of donut, which is what they make here!  I love the thicker, more cakey type donut; not that flimsy/cheap/fake stuff you get at the corporate franchise places that shall go unnamed.    I follow these guys on Facebook and love seeing their new concoctions.  I try to come here as much as possible and see what new offerings they have.  Location is a bit random, but I'm glad they opened it here so maybe it will offer some revival inspiration to the area.    Their maple/bacon donuts are some of the best I've had, as well as their old-fashioned (which are my fave!).  One time we ordered a dozen mixed so we were able to try everything from basic to the more \"artistic.\"  Every donut was awesome!  This place will have a donut for every taste and style and what's great is that they are always mixing it up.  No two days are the same and you can guarantee you will find the perfect donut for you.  To the geniuses behind Welcome, I LOVE YOU!  Keep up the amazing work."}
{"text":"For anyone planning to go here, I suggest going after 10:30am for that is when they start with the chicken donuts. Unfortunately, I went too early and was only able to order donuts. But will say, great donuts. I had the apple fritter and lemon maple. Both were very fresh and tasted great. I will next time plan to be there later :)"}
{"text":"Great food with a selection of sauces. Chicken had crispy tasty batter. Juicy but a little bit greasy. The staff was very friendly to us."}
{"text":"I was super excited about trying this place. Everybody's got it bookmarked and I even caught a special on the tele. I showed up at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and didn't notice a sign on the front door that says they're sold out. Sold out of everything basically. Everything except 3 donuts. The poor girl at the counter said this is been that way all week. My question is why does a business even bother to be open if they run out of food every day, way before closing time. I think the owner of this establishment might want to consider purchasing more material so they can take advantage of the hours they have posted on the door. Perhaps they should have a phone number to call to see if it's even worth their time before they drive all this way.... Hopefully I've beaten this dead horse to death. I will give this establishment another try so that I can improve their rating. Hopefully next time they have more than 3 donuts!  Update... Finally got a chance to see what all the fuss was all about. They were completely wiped out of donuts again but this time there was a couple types left. Enough to make half a dozen. Plenty of chicken though so we got the big meal-whole chicken plate. Selected the popular Korean and Japanese sauces. For the side I picked the vegetable medley which was primarily corn. The corn medley was actually pretty legit. Probably the best portion of the meal. The chicken was moist and tender but it just had no flavor. The dipping sauces were ok but nothing spectacular. The donuts we tried seemed a little dry. Overall, I'd say they serve a average meal."}
{"text":"I finally decided to stop by, I really wish I hadn't. I just don't get why people are crazy about this place, really I though about that all day long. I ordered the breast combo which is $8.50. I wanted the maple bacon donut, the guy behind the counter, said there is an up charge, I said fine. Then I got the bill, $11.08, I was like wow for a piece of chicken, some potatoes and a donut. I should have went with my gut and cancelled the order.  So the chicken breast was really dry and the donut tasted like the ones you get on sale at Frys food store.   The customer service was great but can't make up for the overpriced, average tasting food. I saw some of the cooks in back laughing, they must have been laughing at me for thinking this place was great, and giving them way too much money.  In the kitchen they had a huge rack of fried breasts, legs, wings, all just sitting there, I'm like how long do you guys leave this chicken out in 80 degree temps.  So like I said, just don't get the hype, it's almost like they are the only donut shop in the valley and can charge whatever. I will never be back no value or taste here. I was gonna take a picture, then I was like why."}
{"text":"The service was fabulous.   The team there was up beat and engaging.  They welcomed you when you came in and did not seem worried about my questions or me taking my time to decide.   The food was YUMMY.    The sauces are true to taste and my cucumber salad was refreshing.   I had fried chicken that was served hot and not oily.   They delivered water to the two puppies who were sitting outside.   They came around and made sure you had everything you needed after the food was served and prior.    I am looking forward to going back and trying more of their food.  We got two donuts to go."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for well over a year.  Always in a hurry getting in and out of Phoenix and just haven't found the time to give it a go.  Well, today I picked up my Silvercar and low and behold it's practically in the same parking lot!  Fate had spoken as I hadn't had anything to eat and here it was right in front of my face.  First off, the fried chicken is great.  Nicely spiced.  A little greasy but hey, it's fried chicken right?  The sauce I had been eyeing, and one of their most popular, is the Korean chili sauce.  They typically serve the chicken smothered in the sauce, which I did.  It was good but as I looked around all the regulars got it on the side.  I will do that next time and use it as dipping sauce.  It was still good mind you, just really messy.  The side I chose was the cucumber salad.  Nice way to cut the heat of the sauce but wasn't anything I would gush over.  Next time I want to try the Thai salad side or the stir fry.  Lastly, THE DOUGHNUTS!!!!!   I got a half dozen assorted to share with my friends and we devoured them.  While the maple bacon was of course wonderful, the standouts for me were the apricot buttermilk and the chipotle limon.  The flavor of these with their sweetness mixed with the savory fried chicken and Korean chili were the best bites to be had hands down.  While perhaps not the healthiest of brunches to be had it was certainly tasty and definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Vintage diner, diverse donuts, and fried chicken done REALLY WELL!  Shared the vegan ramen, a breast and leg combo with the Korean chili sauce, a side of their Thai yum slaw, and a raspberry glazed donut filled with a lightly sweeten cream/custard and topped with candy coated pistachios all with my boyfriend. Plenty of food for two.  Service was GREAT! Super friendly and welcoming staff. Very clean, cozy and bright interior.  Definitely would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"First time I went here it was great. I had the vegan ramen and it came exactly how the menu stated. Today we went back and the ramen came and was missing half the ingredients and they never said a word about being out. We were missing jackfruit and corn. They charged us $15 each for a bowl of noodles, carrots and scallions. Never again."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken alone tastes so good. Combine that with the Korean chili sauce on the side, and you get a party. I was very impressed with the sauce since I'm Korean and it tasted authentic. The donuts were a unique addition to the meal. The place looked pretty neat inside and they have outside seating as well. I hope they open more locations towards the east valley."}
{"text":"Every time I visit the city I make a pit stop. Chicken sauced in Korean BBQ was soooo good! Flavor was on point! Lemon maple donut was great in flavor you need two."}
{"text":"I hate to use hyperbole but I think this was the best fried chicken I have ever eaten.  Even without the awesome non traditional Korean sauce and just evaluating the chicken itself it was simply outrageous.  Very juicy, perfect crust etc.  The sauce is really, really good.  Its like eating a big fat hot wing.  The japanese sauce is also good, sweeter than the Korean.    I had the 'slaw and it was good.  The plain donut was also good.  The staff was very friendly.  They don't have a soda fountain but they have this \"natural\" cola in cans which I have never tried until today and it tasted great.  I am sure I will miss the caffeine later today but the taste was awesome.  Can't wait to go back and try the other sauce and a fancier donut."}
{"text":"After spending a lot of time eating the awesome food at the WELCOME DINER I had to try the new spot down the way from where I work.  All I have to say is that it is a must place to go!! GREAT SERVICE! The guys there are really down to earth. They give you an honest view of things you might want to try. They never rush you are always open for any questions you may have.  The food is SOOO GOOOD!! All the chicken flavors are great! My favorite is the Japanesse BBQ! The best thing also is that you can get the sauce on the side as well if you want to just dip. All four sides offered work with any meal. Cant say one is better than the other because they are so good!  The DOUNUTS!! MANNN the dounuts are a must. The best dount I say would be the MAPLE AND BACON one. But the others are great as well. Get there early because all of phoenix will be there eating all the dounts you missed on because you didnt get there in time.  Overall the price is great. For 11 bucks I got a three pieace meal with a side and a dounut. Cant beat that!  A MUST PLACE TO GO!!!"}
{"text":"Wild donuts, great sides....nice stop on the way to the airport. Don't forget to grab some wet ones!"}
{"text":"When I first discovered chicken and waffles, I had a whole new world of cuisine open up to me. WC+D was not quite that eye opening however.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside, and even once you come inside it doesn't blow you away. The outside patio is quite nice (and I assume they will be working on the outside of the building a bit more considering they haven't been open for long and still have an ad for the old business on their doors).  However, you come here for the food. I ended up getting a dozen wings with korean chili. These wings are not tiny wings like you get at other places, so half a dozen was more than enough for me (but I get dinner for later). The taste was wonderful. It was the right amount of spice and a little sweetness. The green onions were a good addition. However, as most wings are, these are super messy. However, having to lick off the extra sauce at the end was a nice bonus.  I ended up getting a chipotle limon sugar donut. It was okay. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special. I really wanted to replicate the chicken and waffle taste palette, but screwed up with the sauce wings and non plain donut."}
{"text":"Upon arrival to my surprise they were closed. It was 7:55 on a sunday morning and it was freezing outside. The guy working there insisted on me waiting outside till exactly 8 o'clock. I have never been to a donut shop that wasn't open at that time. I ordered 8 donuts, 5 which were glazed 2 bacon and 1 chocolate and my total was nearly $ 15.00. I will say the donuts were pretty good. I wasn't able to try the chicken because they don't serve chicken until 10:30, but from most of the reviews it sounds like they run out most of the time."}
{"text":"Amazing little gem in downtown Phoenix just a hop, skip, and a jump from Chase Field and Talking Stick Resort Arena.   Austin served us up the most amazing meal, bloody Mary, and hooked us up with his favorite flavor donut so we could try it since it was our first time. He was cool, calm, and collected although there was a line out the door and he went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our meal.   Only gave it 4 stars because the one table that was available was dirty and they ran out of 2 of the 3 things we wanted (wings & pork belly for the ramen). Otherwise, it was well worth the drive from Mesa, we will definitely be back.   The chicken is crunchy on the outside and so juicy on the inside. The sauces are delicious and in my humble opinion, are best on the side - Korean chili being my absolute favorite. The plain donut that comes with your chicken is just the tiniest bit sweet and really goes well with it. Can't wait to enjoy the patio in the cooler months!"}
{"text":"The donuts were okay. I'll be honest, I wasn't that impressed. It was later in the afternoon so there weren't that many options to choose from. I got this raised donut with a fruit custard filling in the middle. As I took my first bite, it tasted more like warm strawberry yogurt that got all over the place. Maybe I should've ordered a chicken &a donut sandwich or something else. I don't know if I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this new place, I've been here a few times, the first time around 2pm (on a Saturday) and a lot of their donuts were gone and they had run out of chicken wings. So I went a few weeks later around noon, a few of the donuts were sold out (maple/bacon!) and so were the wings AGAIN! The guy at the counter said they usually run out of the wings fast and that they start serving at 10:30am, I don't want to eat fried chicken that early!! I guess I'm just dissapointed that they run out of things so quickly, not sure if it's a ploy to make them seem \"cool\" but it's a definite turn off for the customer.  On to the food, we had 3 piece combo with  the Korean chili (and they had run out of drumsticks, what a surprise!) so they gave us a different piece. It was good at first but I couldn't finish it because it was just too sweet and didn't have the heat I was expecting.   We ordered a few donuts, they were okay. Ordered the blueberry cheescake and Peanut butter glaze with blackberry liquer...they're definitely creative with the flavoring but the actual taste was lacking.   I tried this place twice and each time I was just dissapointed. Please make enough or have enough food on hand to serve your customers, it's really annoying when you want to try something and it's always sold out...yes, I'm still bitter about the maple+bacon!!"}
{"text":"Absolute best apple fritter I've ever tasted.   The donuts are absolutely incredible. The chicken is okay. The service will depend on who helps you.   As we waited in a long line to be served one of the workers was being incredibly friendly to everyone in line, calling out compliments to make everyone feel at home. \"Stay cute, everyone,\" he said, garnering chuckles from the crowd. \"We'll be with you guys soon!\" He also took the time to visit all the tables and make sure people were enjoying their food and having a nice time.   That's quality service right there.   I only got to try the apple fritter and the cake donut that came with my chicken order, but I'd absolutely return. These are their specialty. This is what they excel in.  Unfortunately, I didn't really think the chicken was all that impressive. And the packaging was a bit lacking. The gal brought out my order in a regular eat-in basket, but I reminded her that my order was to-go. Sadly, the sauce was just packed loose in a small container inside the paper box my meal came in, so by the time I went to eat it, it had all but sloshed out. The chicken itself was pretty average. Maybe it would have been better if the sauce had been put on the chicken, which is how I was expecting it to be. But instead, I got regular fried chicken and a little cup of the sauce. I guess some of it got sloshed onto my chicken due to the lack of lid on the cup, but I think that was more accident than intent.   That said, I would only remove one star for the chicken because the service and donuts were all over-the-top amazing and I would come back any time I'm visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Unique flavorings of doughnuts that are grossly overpriced and in the end relatively boring.  Nothing impressed me about the donuts, sadly.  I was really hoping for doughnuts that are made to order and really fresh.  The three doughnuts I purchased had been made 8+ hours before.  I came away with an impression of uncleanliness.  Most of the workers or owners had scraggly hair and scruffy beards.  The interior and the servers don't add to the atmosphere.   I am going to stick with Welcome Diner and Rainbow Donuts."}
{"text":"Loved the concept and the slight sensation that you're getting something exclusive. Bacon maple doughnuts are out of this world-and the chicken?! Well you're gonna have to experience that for yourself. 5 stars says it all."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of weeks ago because I saw their pictures on instagram and the food looks so gooood. Decided to give this place a try and it was amazing!!!!   Now they close whenever they sell out of stuff, so we decided to give them a call first and they said they were out of wings. Oh well, I can deal with that.  Got there and the ordered two piece drumsticks combo and my boyfriend got the leg and thigh combo.. Mine Korean bbq and his Japanese bbq.  Got the miso butter corn side with plain cake donut.   The chicken was amazing! I had all the dark meat which I love, and it was SO juicy every bite I took. The taste was amazing too. I tried both flavors but I think I liked the Korean bbq more.   The donut was AMAZING. I like donuts, but I love this donut. It was warm when I ate it, and I so wish I could have one every day.  The side was ehh... None of the sides appealed to me. Wish I can just have another donut.   The service was good, place was clean, and I seriously loved the food. But I would say the portion is too small for what we're paying!! I guess because it's just so good:/.  Urgh. But my boyfriend said if they were closer he'd go every day. That's a big compliment right there.  P. S. Can't you be open for longer each day? Make more chicken and donuts so I can go more often!! Got such a short time span to get your yummy food. :("}
{"text":"this is an interesting concept that was worth trying. we ordered the fried chicken with kotean sauce and cucumber, a donut and a breakfast griddle.  the fried chicken by itself wasn't great, the sauce was way too salty, as we're  the slices of cucumber fro the salad. the portion sizes were TINY! smallest I've ever seen, it was laughable.  if I had known there is no way I would have paid those prices.   the doughnuts were nothing special but the coffee was really good.  I also particularly disliked that  at counter service they flip around a screen asking how much you would like to tip. who the hell pushes for tips at a counter?"}
{"text":"We went at 9am. Bummed there wasn't chicken but then relieved at the same time, fried chicken an hour after waking is kind of asking for a stomach ache and a shitty day. Pun intended. Hubs and I shared the maple ring donut, way too friggin sweet. Also shared the s x sw breakfast sandwich. The flavors were there but the plain cake donut's texture was all wrong and was saturated in oil. Will give it another go for some pollo."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They make great all different flavor of donuts and very tasty chicken. When I heard Korean seasoning chicken, I was very curious about it cuz I'm from Korea. It was pretty close to Korean swicy chili sauce chicken for sure but a bit saltier than most Korean seasoning chicken. But it was really good! I think when I miss my home I can go back there"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre donuts. Friendly service and plenty of seating outdoors (not so much in the very hot season though). It was a little too hipster for me with weird flavours and small portions for higher prices. Skip this and go farther south to Lo-Lo's for a real, better chicken and donuts experience."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after all the raving reviews. The place was packed at 10:30 which seemed like a good sign. Ordering process was easy but the food is rather pricey. Nonetheless we ordered the whole chicken combo, all three sauces and all three sides. Had to order extra donuts since combo only came with one. Donut seemed to be the best thing here. We returned one bloody half-cooked chicken thigh - and got a strange explanation from the lady who took the order about it being the bone marrow. Never had that while eating a fried chicken before. The lady did bring us another piece. Overall experience was not memorable or special in any way. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Chicken and donuts - two of America's favorite things. Add those to the team behind Welcome Diner and you've got an awesome new place!  Visited on a Saturday a little before 11AM. There was a line but we didn't wait too long. My boyfriend and I both got the two-piece combo. I chose the Japanese BBQ and the chocolate donut and he went Korean with a maple bacon donut.   (Okay. I know what you're thinking - isn't this a fried chicken place? What's with the Asian sauces? Asian chicken with donuts? What's going on?? Yes, it's a weird combo. But trust me, somehow it works and it's freaking fantastic so just go with it.)  The Japanese BBQ was out of this world. So delicious. It was tangy and flavorful, definitely more of a Japanese flair than BBQ. The Korean sauce was good but a little too spicy for me. So if you're a fan of mild, go Japanese. The pieces are smaller than what you get at a KFC or another place like that. It actually reminded me that chickens aren't supposed to be that big so I was okay with the smaller pieces.  I got the miso corn as my side. It was good but a few too many peppers for my taste. If it was just the corn I'd have gobbled it up.  Okay, on to the donuts. I hate to say it but they were just okay. I really wanted to like them and after the amazing chicken expected big things. I didn't like the maple bacon donut at all (weird, right?!) The bacon part was good but the donut was a little too chewy and left an odd aftertaste. The chocolate cake donut was better but was a little grainy. I have to say that my boyfriend went back the next week and got the regular donut and said it was very good. So save the upgrade and go regular donut I guess!  So despite the so-so donut I'm still giving this place 5 stars just for the chicken. As we were driving away I already wanted more. Needless to say, I will be back!"}
{"text":"If these donuts weren't sticky, I think I'd want to sleep on a bed of them. They are fluffy, fresh, and unique. I couldn't resist & got one of everything!   Let's start with this donut (and for the life of me I do know the EXACT name) called yuji & macha pistachio donut....it was sweet, tangy, and had a citrus aftertaste. After eating it in 3 bites, I regretted not getting a box of this tantalizing treat. Next, I tried the maple glaze donut- oh so ooey & gooey and the maple taste just stands out. My next favorite was the apple fritter- the pastry was so sweet and just perfect texture and then you got hit with delicious mouthwatering  apples in the middle. Perfection confections.  That's not all, in addition to donuts, they have croissants &, yes, fried chicken. Good heavens. If I knew exactly when I'd die, this is the spot!  Can't wait to try their  blackberry passion fruit donut & keylime pie next! Fork please!"}
{"text":"Grabbing To Go food...since I was in the area.  Small area for dining inside, but a lot more space to dine outside.  I ordered the 2 PC Korean Chili with Thai Yum Slaw...and it comes with a cake donut.  The sauce was flavorful.  The service was good.  Definitely worth trying.  Their designer type donuts are bigger than normal size with some fun combo flavors."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. It may be deceiving as the building looks like an old KFC location, but the chicken and doughnuts here are amazing. I don't normally like fried chicken but this chicken was cooked really well and was not overcooked or dry. I chose the Japanese bbq sauce and it is hands down the best sauce I've had on chicken. Stop here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sitting here eating a donut only because they are out of chicken.  It's 1:17pm.  They close at 4pm.  How do they stay in business? Donut is not even fresh. Staff was courteous but doesn't mean much when you have no food to serve."}
{"text":"I won't lie it is the name that peeked my interest. I like both Chicken and Donuts but never imagined having both of them at the same time. Well, that is what is served here and more. However, the highlight is the Chicken and Donuts.   Welcome serves all natural, never frozen, no hormone, no antibiotic, humanely raised, bone-in chicken. This chicken is golden crispy seasoned with salt/pepper to perfection. I am a breast and wing person which they have conquered satisfying my taste buds. Yes, this chicken is finger licking. You have to option to have it smothered in sauce or on the side. I have ordered my sauce on the side however the chicken is so darn good I don't take the time to dip it in the sauce. I have tried the Korean Chili and the Japanese BBQ. They both have a great flavor.   Now the donuts... I do not know where to begin. To be fair I do not like fancy donuts. I am more of a plain cake donut but my first experience was the sprinkled cake donut. I am officially hooked. I felt like a five year old again. I ate the whole thing and wanted like two more. It was sooooooo good. Now once I am hooked I am hooked so every time I returned I always seem to get the same donut. To challenge myself I added an extra donut to my order and got the plain glazed donut. Let's put it this way I will NEVER buy another plain glazed donut from the grocery store. That glazed donut is the BOMB. It melts right into your mouth. I have purchased other donuts from here for the office and friends who all have enjoyed their tasty treats.   The only side I have tried is the Cumber Salad. Because it is so good I have yet to venture off and try a different one. lol!  Now if you lucky you will get a seat inside. Otherwise there is seating outside. You can also order to go. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Get the Fuck on! I'm not a breast guy, I like thighs and legs and WC&D just moved my mouth up North. NEVER, have I had a better breast. I don't care what country or state I've had it, this was my favorite. Just bested Willie Mae's. The dredging is bland. Maybe a little salt and pepper but not much more. It's the sauce. The  fish sauce with mint that smells like a homeless crakheads inner toes. Belly button perhaps? I don't know and I don't care. That sauce hits your tongue on every known and unknown flavour and bud. The ones you know and the ones you never knew. Whoa. This Funky, Stinky, Pungent sauce is all you need on the crispest, juiciest fried chicken I have ever had. .... and Donuts, well....have you ever really had a bad experience with a donut? I mean, even terrible donut's are edible. So, the Bacon maple ring was actually really good. The apple fritter sucked."}
{"text":"Excellent service. A bit on the expensive side for donuts but well worth it. The dough is very fluffy and the ingredients are fresh. The donuts are not overly sweet like other corner store donut shops that I've been to. Well balanced flavors. It's also conveniently located adjacent to a gas station near PHX airport. So you business travelers can swing by, fill your rental car with gas, pick up great coffee and donuts and then head to PHX like I did. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Heard some great buzz about this place online from fellow Yelpers and wanted to check it out for ourselves. We stopped in for breakfast yesterday and were glad to experience the hype we had heard so much about. This place knocked it out of the park, and we didn't even get to try the chicken yet (which looked amazing getting prepped in the kitchen behind the front counter).   We had a Chocolate, Rose and Pistachio donut, a Rainbow Sprinkles donut, and a D. E. C. (Cake donut, Egg and Cheese, plus we added bacon because why wouldn't you?) Yes, I just described a donut breakfast sandwich; don't knock it until you try it. Both traditional donuts were excellent and made with quality ingredients. The breakfast donut sandwich was an amazing mix of freshly cracked egg, thick cut bacon, cheddar, and a slightly sweet donut that was warm and crumbled apart in your mouth. Absolutely delicious and recommended for anyone adventurous looking for a surprise combination of great flavors.   Can't wait to come back and try the chicken and ramen noodles next time! Not to mention more donuts!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a whole chicken combo to feed two people, and then at the end we find out it was too much food. The chicken was tossed with Vietnamese herb and Korean sauce. If I had to choose a favorite it'll be the Vietnamese herb, because it was lighter and had hints of fishsauce that I've never had in fried chicken before! Yumm!    The plain Donut that came with it was probably my favorite! It had a slight hint of sweetness inside and a hint of lemon.   The Cucumber salad side with - fresh ginger & scallion was very light, and I really enjoyed it. Very creative on the light flavors."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  The fried chicken was absolutely amazing,  but everything else was nearly inedible.  The sauces and sides were terrible and the donuts were the worst I've ever had.  If it weren't for the amazing chicken I would have given negative stars."}
{"text":"I have been waiting and waiting for this place to open because I love a great donut. I stopped in this morning on my way to work and was so excited when I saw the donut case.   Decisions decisions...after standing there for 5 minutes I made my choices. I chose the cajeta sea salt fritter and the chipotle limon cake donut. The fritter was huge and if you like sweet and salty you are going to love this donut. It was so good. I don't normally like a cake donut but this one wasn't dry or overly dense. It had a hint of lemon and the chipotle sugar was sweet and spicy. I loved it!   The premium donuts are a bit pricey but they are so worth it. Let me just say these donuts are drop on the ground delicious. Yes if I dropped it on the ground I would still eat it!"}
{"text":"Their chicken is fantastic... I love the Korean Chili sauce! The Vietnamese Herb sauce is also pretty good but I think the Korean Chili works really well with the chicken being fried. If the chicken was baked, I think the Vietnamese would work better. Haven't tried the Japanese BBQ sauce yet.  I don't think they had Ramen yet last time that I went there... So I can't comment on that.  Their donuts were okay to me, I know I am in the minority but I didn't think they were out of this world. Definitely some fancy combinations available but I wasn't super impressed with the taste of the ones I tried. I would absolutely come back here again and again for their chicken though!"}
{"text":"gotta say this is better than chicken and waffles (roscoe's in socal)  used my uber ride for rides back and forth use promo code for first free ride: uberSF8"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  You have to try it.  Don't think twice about it.  Everything is delish.  Everything is fresh.  Chicken and donuts, what a great combo.  Located in a historic part of town, the restuarant brings life back to Golden Gate.  Service is amazing and fun.  I can't think of anything this place does wrong.  You'll die a happy person knowing you ate at one of the best places in the world.  A great story to tell your kids when you're old.  I ate at Welcome Chicken & Donuts!"}
{"text":"Not exactly a convenient location for a second Welcome Diner production (a very tasty east Roosevelt Row hipster haven).   I had the chicken and donuts. The chicken was lightly breaded and lightly seasoned. The donuts, both cake, one chololate (good) and one vanilla (really good).  Good, but nothing exceptional. If you've been to The Welcome Diner and were expecting that level of food, I'm sad to report you may be disappointed.  The place itself (just like Welcome Diner) is retro-cool.."}
{"text":"The only place in Phoenix (that I know of) that makes vegan yeast donuts. Granted they're only available Friday-Sunday, and I live all the way in Chandler, but they're completely worth the trip. Every time I come here it is consistently amazing, and the staff are great. 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"Like it's big brother, Welcome Diner, I've delayed visiting this place for far too long. This is partly due to their limited hours as rarely am I ever in this area before 4pm. Actually, I don't think I'm ever in this area - period. But still . . .   The concept is simple. Chicken and donuts. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that fried chicken works well with anything - and so do donuts, so why not specialize in both?   If it's your first time, ordering a combo is your best option. I ordered two drumsticks with the standard cake donut and a side of seasoned potatoes. My girlfriend ordered a breast with a side of the corn stir fry.   I requested a chocolate cake donut to add on to my combo, but they apparently misunderstood me when I said I still wanted the hot cake donut. Thankfully, my girlfriend cut hers in half - which is probably good, since it ended up being my favorite. We also ordered a glazed donut on the way out.  I confess: The chicken here is extremely good! There's a satisfying crunch and great flavor found within. My girlfriend and I both agreed that, while not quite the best we've found in our Phoenix search, it's definitely right up there. I intend to try it in sandwich form during our eventual return.  As for the sauces? Eh, I honestly don't think they're even necessary with this chicken. It stands on its own just fine, but feel free to experiment. We strongly disliked the Vietnamese herb, which was too salty, while my spicy barbeque just seemed unnecessary. The seasoned potatoes were excellent, being cooked nice and crispy, exactly how I've always liked them. My girlfriend was also pleased with her corn stir fry.  The donuts are good, with my favorite being the hot cake donut due to my love of donuts in their simplest form. The chocolate cake was okay, while the glazed was better than I expected. They seem to be quite fond of adding lemon zest, which I'm pretty sure was present to varying degrees in all of the donuts. We liked them, but it's not like great donuts are scarce in Phoenix. They're comparable to what you'd find at most of the more popular (locally owned) donut shops.  I still wish they had better hours - as this is a place that could easily operate late into the night and probably do quite well. But for what it is, I feel it's a place that everyone needs to try out.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This our 4th or 5th time back. Time to revisit my review. My initial impression was accurate. This is a legit 5-Star spot.  We had the thigh/drumstick combo (1 Korean and 1 Vietnamese sauce - $9) this time around. You know how you often pull the skin off fried chicken and toss it since it's too greasy/mushy/thick? Well, plan on wishing you had more on this chicken. Between the light and crispy season skin and extra delicious sauce, this chicken is a cut above. For donuts we chose the Orange Banana bread pudding and the Pear Peach Apple Butter.  A-freaking-maxing.  I also had to try the fried shiitake mushrooms ($6). The batter was really good again and the mushrooms wet very tasty,  but maybe fried too long as they were s bit chewy.  The staff at WC&D are all extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome donuts! Loved the chicken! One adult and three kids. We all ate plain chicken breast with sauce on the side. Only knock is maybe one mainstream sauce, like honey bbq, would be nice for us less adventurous types. We all enjoyed the miso corn. 1 kid said it was his favorite thing he ate there. Even the plain donuts are awsome! Plump, moist chicken with crisp skin. Everything prepared to perfection. Super nice staff. Arrived at 2:30 pm and they had run out of many selections. Will arrive much earlier next time."}
{"text":"This place blew me away. I got the three-piece Korean chili chicken with a side of miso butter stir fry and slaw. Got a blue sky root beer as well, freshest soda ever had. The chicken was hot, juicy and crispy and the SAUCE....my gosh was delicious, the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. I didn't care much for the stir fry but the slaw was crunchy and unique. If they were to put that slaw on the chicken in a sandwich I'd be in heaven. Going to go back next week and try the Japanese BBQ flavor"}
{"text":"In Phoenix, Chicken and waffles have evolved further into the form of chicken and donuts. I'm not going to hate, I'm going to celebrate, cause this is an awesome combo!   Moist, tender, locally procured chicken are fried into crisp, meaty, morsels and accompanied with creatively crafted artisanal style donuts. Comfort food of today's generation.   What's donuts without coffee? Locally roasted high quality coffee concoctions can be found here as well. Donuts, fried chicken and coffee it's the trifecta!   The restaurant ambiance is hip, fresh, and modern and extends to the gorgeously landscaped parking lot. The outside seating area with its big wood benches and desert plants is an inviting spot to relax and enjoy the good eats. The Welcome Chicken and Donuts neon sign is an awesome homage to the old school era, and people line up for their photo opp.   Whether you are here for the coffee, the donuts, or the chicken, your needs for good eats will be satisfied with creative, local, artisan, food here at Welcome Chicken and Donuts."}
{"text":"Foodie heaven for great selection of donuts. Their have unique donut flavors. Their fried chicken was  crispy and not only. They have different sauces that accompany the chicken. I tried their sticky Korean sauce which had a touch of smokiness. This place gets Ickes during lunch with minimal seating space so get there early. Oh and they have Ramen noodle on their menu too! Definitely gonna try that next time"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally stopped in today for lunch. The fried chicken was really crispy which I liked. I would have probably preferred it more juicy and if the sauce was on it instead of on the side. That was probably my fault though since I did want to try all three sauces. My favorite was the Korean chili and the Vietnamese herb ones. I also tried the ramen they offered and I have to say that I was disappointed. It was too oily and there was no taste to it. I think store bought ramen packs taste even better than the ones they served. :/"}
{"text":"So I did not try the food. There was none. They ran out well before their closing time. That is very poor form. Too bad. Heard the food is not bad. But not having food when open is kind of pathetic."}
{"text":"i love Welcome Diner so I don't know what took me so long to get here but glad i did. been on a big fried chicken kick lately and while this isnt the juiciest, it has probably the best skin around. not too thick of a breading w a perfect amount of crispy-crunch, i'm day dreaming about it right now. its not cheap, but its all fresh and the staff is one thousand times better to deal with than the typical Church's/ Popeye's surly teens lol  secret tip: the plain cake donut is perfect for soaking up some of that spicy korean sauce"}
{"text":"Holy crap. The chicken and donuts were amazing, so I can think it says something that it was the cucumber salad that really blew my mind."}
{"text":"We got take out I thought that food with an Asian flare with doughnuts would be bizarre! It was but it was good the sauces for chicken yummy great chicken the best doughnut I ever had try key lime!"}
{"text":"Ever since coming here, I actually think about this place every day. What really makes them stand out is the flavors of donuts they offer. I had the Arnold Palmer, the red wine pudding, and chocolate rosé. The best donuts I have ever tasted. They are made fresh every day and I think their hard work doesn't go unnoticed because they often sell out before closing every day. The outside eating area is also very nice! I really want to come back and try their chicken because is looks amazing."}
{"text":"I randomly dropped by this place on my way to the rental car return and it was the highlight of my morning.  I had one donut and it was very good.  I wanted to try some chicken also but it was to early in the morning.    Service was very friendly.  Plenty of parking and it is less than a mile away from the Car Rental Return.  I am looking forward to stopping in here again on my next trip."}
{"text":"I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone wouldn't love WCD. The only thing I don't love about it is that I don't sleep on a cot in the kitchen there and wake up every morning to a sweet, sweet donut alarm. This place is GOOD. I ate a donut today that had hot sauce glaze and blue cheese mousse with micro celery and all sorts of other crazy shit and it was GOOD. Like REALLY GOOD. That idea is bizarre and daring but incredibly well executed and that's just the kind of food I want to be eating. This type of culinary wizardry is unmatched and mind blowing. Not to mention the people who work here are NICE AS HELL. It's packed all the time and the employees never show stress and are genuinely happy to see and serve their customers.   I want WCD to keep breaking down donut stereotypes for a long long time. I drank that Kool-aid, man. And it was tasty."}
{"text":"Well, today (11/5/2017) at about 1:00pm, we went to this place with about a collective 25 people at the suggestion of someone. Some people invited different people, word spread, it wasn't planned. We didn't even know everyone we just happen to sit at the same tables (because its two very large tables and a lot of people). We are just a friendly bunch. This will be important later.  I want to give this restaurant a five-star review because the food was good and the seating was great. But, I have to give this restaurant a 2 star review because of the lousy customer service of one guy.  We had never been to this place before and my husband asked the guy at the register questions about the food and he didn't answer any of them. (What the?) Which would have been helpful since we were going to buy a few peoples meals. Needless to say it wasn't enough food and he needed to go back and order more.  When the food was brought to the table, this very sweet lady, my husband ordered for, asked very nicely, \"What is this one?\" The guy was like, \"Whatever you ordered.\" Very blunt and rude. For crying out loud I think you know what the food looks like if you work there. If you don't know just say so you big jerk. \"Well, ma'am I'm not sure.\" Would have been a better response. She made the mistake of asking again when some more food was brought out. He said again. \"It's whatever you ordered. I'm just here to bring you the food.\" Yeah, we get it.  He comes out one more time to pick up some trays and scolds us for coming! He's like, \"If you come again, call ahead.\" This wasn't said in a nice tone mind you. My husband was like, \"That's not happening.\" Another guy was like \"Money's green.\" I'm just thinking my husband doesn't even know the guy next to him.  It was 3 pieces of chicken for $12 a plate. My husband dropped A LOT of money at this place, no one deserves to be treated that way. You wont be seeing us again.  Employees like that drive paying customers away. I hope someone important see's this and scolds that dude. If I knew his name I would drop it. The guy obviously doesn't want to work for his paycheck."}
{"text":"I'm a strong believer in carrying out your food until your doors close.   I went to Welcome on a Sunday at about 1 pm .  Quite a while before they were due to close.  However, they seemed to be lacking in a lot of their food other then chicken for which you could see lined up fried on trays behind the counter.  I don't know about anyone else but I know for myself that when I see food already cooked and sitting out .. it means not fresh.  Not only that they place is called Welcome Chicken and Donuts.... I promise there was about 6 donuts in the case.  I even asked about this and was told ... yeah they go quickly and they don't make another batch.   Not another batch and there is 3 hours till close!  Wow... mind you there were trays of fried chicken but like 6 donuts...wasn't the whole menu based on chicken and donuts.  Let's just say wasn't impressed at all.   Have food please till close... or at least up to 30 min till close.  Customers that rush to get to your place before you close are the ones you want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Best Chicken and there donuts are delicious . Highly recommended!!!!! Only downside no fountain drinks or official soda can but,overall great food"}
{"text":"Update review!! Fried Chicken Review  I finally tried their fried chicken. The Korean BBQ was good, it has a lil kick to it, to me 2 chickens was enough, I couldn't finish 3 fried chickens because it comes with a donut and 1 side. The Vietnamese herb was very delicious, it was my favorite. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The cucumber salad was my favorite side for the Vietnamese herb chicken, it definitely compliments the saltiness of the chicken. Everything was just good and then you add the donut! Heaven!"}
{"text":"Donuts, fried chicken, and coffee all in one place? What more could a girl ask for? Looking to fill my saturated fat intake and caffeine jolt for the day, we headed here on a mission for some good eats. There was a fairly steady line while we were here at the restaurant. We got here around noon, and they were already sold out of chicken wings, and at least half of the donuts (Btw, who sells out of chicken wings by lunchtime? Is there a secret coalition of dedicated eaters who descend upon the restaurant like a plague, to only voraciously consume chicken wings in the wee hours of the morning? We may never know...). Anyways, I had a breast combo which included a side and donut. I substituted a chipotle limon donut for the plain cake that is normally included with the meal, and had the slaw and Vietnamese sauce over the chicken. I also had an iced coffee.  The donut was excellent. It had the right balance of tender, yet chewy cake contrasting with the slight crunch on the outside. I also liked how it wasn't exceedingly sugary, which allowed a better balance of flavors to show through.   The slaw was crisp, with a good mixture of sweet and vinegar. My friend had the cucumber salad, which was too salty overall, but had a good crisp texture. The chicken was expertly cooked, with a perfect crispy crust, and juicy, tender meat. I tried some of the Korean spicy sauce and preferred it to over the Vietnamese style sauce on my piece. Strangely enough, the Korean style sauce was more subtle than the Vietnamese sauce, not something you'd often say when comparing the two cuisines! For me, the glaze on my chicken was too concentrated.  The iced coffee was smooth, and had more of a lighter flavor. For add-ins, they have milk, cream, and almond milk, as well as Stevia and sugar in the raw.  Service was fast and friendly, and despite having a steady stream of customers to serve, our orders came out quickly.   Overall, this is a great choice for a fast, affordable, and filling meal. I'll definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"These are the best donuts in Phoenix hands down!! The only downside is they can get pricey... I guess you get what you pay for- it's definitely worth the splurge for a special occasion though!"}
{"text":"Finger licking good...by far the best Chicken I have had! To be honest everything is great! From the hand made donuts to the sides and even the coffee. My all time favorite is the south by south west (sausage or bacon, egg, cheese and relish between a cake donut) with a breast on the side. Although this is a breakfast sandwich, it is served all day long. Thank the Lord! The staff is always very welcoming (see what I did there?) and take the time to give you recommendations and go over the menu. This is an all time favorite of ours and we will continue to go back! We also love the ode to the old neighborhood in which it sits at. Check out the WiFi password."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place out and ready to totally wreck any healthy eating plan I had in store for my trip to Phoenix. I will say that overall it was great. The fried chicken is superb and even without sauces is a near platonic ideal of what fried chicken should be. I tried 2 sauces. FIrst, the Korean chili sauce which is like a Gojijang sauce that you'd encounter with Bibimbop. Second was the Vietnamese sauce which I was thinking would make the chicken taste similar to Pok Pok's famous chicken wings (in Portland, NY and now LA). It however was a bit different and I would have preferred it a bit sweeter and a bit thicker/reduced. But they were both very good overall.   The donuts were really good and I would say they are probably better than any of the donut shops we have in Seattle. The star for me was the red wine and chocolate donut. The red wine frosting tasted and smelled strongly of red wine and played on that classic pairing very well. The Arnold Palmer and Thai Tea donut was tasty as well. I think it paired better with the chicken.   And that brings me to the only negative and reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars. Chicken and donuts don't necessarily go together. I love, love, love chicken and waffles. That combo of salty and sweet and crunchy just plays beautifully together. The denseness of the waffle holds up to being \"combined\" with the chicken. The donut, not so much. I found myself enjoying great chicken and great donuts but not great chicken and donuts. Still a fantastic place to eat but if they could find a way to get the two foods to mesh more I'd give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Creative donuts and a very tasty breakfast sandwich called the SXSW. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good selection of vegan donuts, super friendly, fast and accomdating service. All around good experience"}
{"text":"Wow! I consider myself a donut aficionado and these take the cake! Lol! The Thai chicken and slaw were fabulous as well. I may go again tomorrow morning..."}
{"text":"Easily the best donut shop in Arizona. Only negative is that they run out of flavors pretty quickly, so it's best to not have a set one in mind.   Maple bacon: my go-to; not too sweet, quality and generous amount of bacon.   Rum mojito: loved the minty aftertaste; refreshing.   Margarita: zest in the glaze adds a nice touch.   Phoenix cream: not an average Boston cream; chocolate glaze has notes of chili or cayenne. Really smart move to cut the sweetness and richness.   Apple/pear butter: filling had pronounced pear flavor; tastes like it had been simmering for hours.   Wings were fantastic. The coating is light and not overly greasy. Tried the Vietnamese (cilantro and fish sauce pair so nicely) and Korean. Wish the Korean was spicier, but love that the sauce tasted like Kimchi juice.   Will be back to try their ramen."}
{"text":"This review is based on customer service and a tone-deafness when addressing a customer's issue, not the food (which has always been stellar).  Welcome's wings are some of the best chicken wings I've ever had, crispy and well seasoned, and, up til today, a bargain. Alas, where last week you could get six WHOLE wings for six bucks, they have effectively doubled their price by disjointing the wings but maintaining the price point (a dollar for a drummer or a flat is a bit much, but does match their current price points on the rest of the menu).  Not a big issue, unless you don't let customers know what you're doing until they open their delicious boxes of chicken to find only half the amount that they thought they paid for.   And that is where this review is born: I called Welcome and was told things had changed, and when I explained that the issue was not the change but the lack of being told of the change especially since it has just happened, I was responded with a bit of a callous \"that's how it is now.\" No \"I'm sorry\", no \"our bad\", simply \"that's how it is now.\" They offered a free half dozen wings (yes, I'm no fool--I'm going to take them, but they'll be the last pieces of chicken I get from Welcome), but what I am left wanting is someone to instill proper retail relationships and even halfway decent phone etiquette. No, the customer isn't always right. But keeping the customer in the dark is never right. And the \"business as usual\" response is even worse.   Owners/managers, maybe check in on this one."}
{"text":"You know that old saying about movies, if you have a good story everything will take care of itself? Well, this is the food version of that story - you focus on unique and great food, using top quality ingredients, and you can be in the literal middle of nowhere and the people will come. Welcome Chicken + Donuts is a literal foodie field of dreams, run by a decidedly young group of entrepreneurial hipster folks that would blend in with the folks in Portland or Seattle but instead, are busy making great food near the airport car rental places on Buckeye Road.  They have a great selection of innovative and top quality donuts, and then they have amazing fried chicken, that you can get just fried or with several different types of Asian country inspired sauces (coated in those sauces so get plenty of napkins). I took my father and we tried both the Japanese BBQ style - a thick sauce and dusted with sesame seeds, and the Vietnamese herb style with the chicken coated in a sauce that is heavy on the fish sauce, but in a good way - pungent and salty, it reaches out and gives you a solid slap across your taste buds - nibble on the free cake doughnut (warm and fresh) that comes with it to help balance out the intensity of the sauce.   You also get one of several Asian country inspired side dishes - we got the cucumber salad which also helped to mellow out the overal food experience. If you sit on the inside, towards the front, is some history of the building and the location which helps to ground the business in some of the local history and culture.   As for costs - a one piece is $7.50, a thigh and a drumstick are $8 and those two pieces along with a breast are $10 - might as well go for the three piece kids and save a piece to gnaw on later, when you start missing this amazing food experience. Oh, if you want wings - 6 for $6 (and it is the full wing so well priced) or an even dozen for $11, get there early - I've heard those sell out before everything else.   Best bet for this place might be to send one person to pick up multiple orders and then bring them back to the homestead, and you can enjoy this messy and pungent mishmash of southern food culture and Asian flavors without any concerns on the level of messiness involved - or, if you want that crispy, crispy coating at its peak, do make a point to go down directly but either way should be equally delicious. Here is hoping they expand and open something like this near downtown Tempe but if not, I'm sure at least once a month I'll take the time to drive down for one of the more unique food experiences one can find as a native or on a  trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The is the best fried chicken I have ever had. Let me repeat this it the best fried chicken. The donuts are good and the pho is excellent. I have tried everything thing on the menu and you can't go wrong. They start serving the chicken at 10:30 and I would be there at 10:30 to get the chicken. Plus  the customer service is good and there is plenty of outdoor seating with misters. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"The best donuts I've ever had! So great! Amazing flavors and specials . They do great on social Media so check them out and see what they have"}
{"text":"The donuts are unique and very tasty, but the SXSW is hands down the most flavorful breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Owners/management/staff are all super friendly. This place is a true Phoenix gem!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com times 100. We had the Korean chicken breast and the orange chicken breast, the Korean sauce is the way to go, you have to try their plain raised donut it is like something you have never had before.  We also tried the mango chili raised donut and that was a great expierence of happiness on my tongue, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"The chicken was delicious and so was the donut. I was disappointed in the ramen however. It was not up to par. Nonetheless, the service is great and I recommend this place. Four stars due to the ramen."}
{"text":"Love coming here for donuts!  You can find crazy donuts all around the city but Welcome really has the best donut overall. The chicken is wonderful and I really enjoy their Hacked collaborations with local chefs like Carleen Badman!  Cold brew is on point too :)"}
{"text":"Chicken was cooked very well.  We tried the 3 sauces they had and all were pretty good and each had its own flavor. It was really good fried chicken but not the best I have had. We went about 12pm on a Sunday and there were very few donut options left. We ended up trying the simple glazed that was actually gluten free and really good. Will be back to try some more donuts."}
{"text":"We definitely almost passed this place, but I am so glad we found it! What a perfect little gem! The breakfast sandwich on a cake doughnut was a game changer. We almost drove back the following day just to try the fried chicken. I'll make a point to head back here the next time I'm in Phoenix. Perfect place for a little breakfast fix!"}
{"text":"The chicken and donut combo is the perfect brunch/lunch meal. Crispy outside, juicy inside. Sauces are great."}
{"text":"GREASY! We ordered a dozen donuts. 8 glazed, 2 maple with bacon, 2 chocolate rings. I have never tasted a greasier donut in my life! It was waaaaay overpriced for these donuts. Tasted weird, a bad aftertaste that reminded me of spoiled milk. We haven't been able to finish the dozen donuts, after 2 days. I'm going to have to throw it away. Do yourself a favor, buy a dozen of Bosa donuts. Bosa's not the best, but way better. Shoot, even a dozen from Frys is better. You can't see it in the picture that well, but there is a \"puddle\" of grease under each donut that soaks into the cardboard box. Also, the grease can be seen from the sides of the box. WOW! I still can't believe how much grease!!!!! GREASY and GROSS!!!! $18 for this dozen....TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great atmosphere, helpful staff and great food. Get the Korean sauce on your chicken and mango jalapeño donut!"}
{"text":"1st off, customer service is OUTSTANDING. Second time being here and definitely not my last. Nothing like a little mom and pop spot that has great customer service and good food. This trip I ordered the ramen. 2 thumbs up! My wife ordered the vegan ramen and a donut (or two) and not one complaint from her! (surprising ) if you are looking for a good brunch spot and great service, def hit this spot if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place since I first heard it's opening and now that it was featured in Phoenix magazine I finally committed to a time to drive there for lunch.  We arrived at 10:30am because that's when they start serving chicken.  The welcome feel of this place is warm and inviting.  The staff is super friendly and will help you in any way possible.  Ordering is simple.  You pick your chicken + your sauce and then you pick your doughnut.  Small upgrade fee for more premium donuts of course.  Not a problem at all.  Their donuts look high end gourmet!  I couldn't resist taking half a dozen home with me.  The fried chicken definitely holds up to it's hype.  Mix in a donut and you've yourself a life changing semi fast food meal.  Make sure you sit outside in there grand patio.  Huge picnic tables that are shaded from the AZ sun!"}
{"text":"Best D-A-R-N chicken and donuts I EVER had. Why does this place only have 4 stars!!!!! Chicken was perfect even the plain donut was delicious. The margarita donut was everything! MmMmMmMmM really good"}
{"text":"You had me at donuts! These donuts are for sure worth getting up bright and early for!   They are located kind of in the middle of nothing? When I first drove here I figured I was lost!  I was so new to Phoenix I just knew I wasn't going in the right direction and then boom and nice diner with the sign that says WELCOME! Lol  Really cute place. Their customer service is excellent very friendly staff and helpful!   Menu is good too pretty simple, my kind of menu!   Their donuts are pretty amazing like seriously where else can you get a rose pistachio chocolate donut? Tell me! I love the variety they have in donuts. My son loves this place and if your 7yr old  loves it EVERYONE SHOULD TOO   lol.   however the earlier you get there the better as they do sell out of most their donuts."}
{"text":"The subpar food isn't worth the harassment and unprofessional staff in this place. I welcome the opportunity for the owner to get in touch with me to discuss the type of people that work for him or her. Not at all a representation of what this business claims to be. It states it has an eclectic take on donuts but what their eclectic take is on, is their unethical customer service. Their claim to being a \"cheerful space\" is a joke, as their employees deliberately bully the customers. Let me just say that I had to request a refund on my entire food order purely out of fear that they were going to retaliate against me because I spoke up about the unprofessional treatment I received."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not need my approval. I don't think the human race has done anything throughout history that we deserve this glorious establishment. This changes EVERYTHING I thought I knew about life!"}
{"text":"I really liked the donuts and the chicken was pretty good. I wish the batter had a little more seasoning and it was a little crispier. The thai slaw was light and refreshing. I think I would go back for donuts. But the chicken was nothing I would specifically come back for. But it beats places like KFC. It was also a bit pricey for what you got."}
{"text":"Small joint in a developing area, I figured, \"new spot, will have to work out the kinks.\"  No way, first visit was great, I was even \"that guy\" that walks in 4 minutes before closing (I honestly didn't know the hours SORRY) they did not mind, were jovial and fun to talk to.   I ordered the Korean chili chicken, (asian) slaw, with a sprinkles cake donut.  Was highly impressed, the chicken was fried to a nice crisp and it was sauced tossed to perfection as to not goo it up.  The flavor was on point, I frequent Korean chicken joints in LA and this is definitely up to par.  The donut was eaten bit by bit after each mouthful of the chicken followed by slaw each time to clear the palate.  They also were nice enough to throw in an extra donut on my way out, that i am saving for dessert after whatever i scrounge up in my kitchen tonight."}
{"text":"From the people that brought you the lovely welcome diner that sits down Roosevelt row. Now bring you a delightful but yet intriguing place to eat out at! Who knew the love of fried chicken and a box of donuts will make \"chicken + donuts\" I love, love, LOVE the concept of everything that this has become. Literally fell in love with the inside and the back patio dining area. Menu is simple yet different there's a chicken and donut combo menu which you get your choices of chicken pieces and then the donut that compliments the chicken flavor choice of sauce which is 3, I personally loved the Korean bbq sauce! You also have a choice of side, I got the corn miso stir fry which is really good! And the donut was awesome, and so fresh you definitely can taste the passion! They didn't have a lot of drink choices? Or maybe I wasn't looking but you can't go wrong with water, am I right? Also the menu includes a ramen menu which a lot of people I observed order, have not tried but will update you cause I do love me a bowl of hot noodles! And also a sandwich menu, lunch and breakfast included! And of course their specialty donuts on display I recommend coming early I guess? Because I went at noon? And only a few were left out! But I'm pretty sure you can of course order a dozen a day before or put in an order! But other than that staff was super helpful and friendly! Loved their energy and the inside is so delightful with cute artwork on the wall! So stop by, and keep that local love going! Definitely a spot to return too!"}
{"text":"I have been skeptical about this place,  but it was nice to see a business owner take steps keep customers happy.  Instead of getting mad about my yelp review, he reached out to make things right.  Giving it 5 stars for trying hard to keep my business and will definitely return for the donuts."}
{"text":"This place is like a full on unabashed American style blitzkrieg on your sense of culinary convention.   It is like someone took the menus from my three favorite guilty pleasure restaurants (KFC, Bosa Donuts, Thai Chili) and gave pinking shears to a drunk person and had them cut up the menu and then gave the pieces to a blindfolded five year old, spun her in a circle and sat her at a table with the pieces and a bottle of Elmer's glue and locked her in the room for about an hour and then took everything off the table and then gave it to some crack monkeys who were trained to copy the words to a typewriter and then give it to a Hell's Kitchen finalist to prepare for that day's challenge.  So yeah, it's shocking but it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"So I've been here before. A loooong time ago. I only come here when my coworker wants it and i fly for it. This place is so overrated.  When you come in your greeted by a glum person at the counter.  I only come here for breakfast, of course they only have 3 breakfast sandwiches. And ONE of them is vegetarian!  They have a side of potatoes, oh but only on Saturdays and after 1030. They're called welcome chicken and donuts but they have no chicken sandwiches on the breakfast menu. You have to come after 1030 for that... What are you welcome to? A soup kitchen? You can eat only what they have at that time...they serve certain things at certain times...Even though their 'claim' to fame is chicken...today they had a whole rack of chicken just sitting there behind the counter...at 855am. But they're not serving it until after 1030..."}
{"text":"Welcome C&D sent us some gift cards so we came back today with friends. I wanted to update my review since I had a much better experience here this time. The service was great and friendly. My food came out quick and hot! It was so tasty! The chicken was a little too salty for me but I think maybe if I had eaten the donut and chicken simultaneously it would have canceled each other out. I'll be back. I thought it was definitely tasty. Thanks guys! :)"}
{"text":"Had the key lime donut $3. Amazing. Better than voodoo in Denver. Also had the chicken single piece breast. Great fried chicken on bone. $4.50 Crispy....served with a side of Korean chili sauce. Which I tried on side but did not like it. But that's cuz I am not a fan of Korean foods. Definitely will be back for donuts. PS decided on apple fritter to go. $2"}
{"text":"This place is not for everyone. The chicken is incredible. Fresh and sauce options. Fucking good. Do not lose sight of the staff because they are slightly forgetful and may not remember you."}
{"text":"It would be 4 stars because they are a bit pricy. I love the chicken!!! I drove 20 minutes just for it. BUT today I'm disappointed. I ordered a 12 piece and see my photo of the scrawny pieces I received. It was like miniature chicken and I spent. $15 on that and a $3 donut. I'm sad."}
{"text":"Bought a breast combo meal with cucumber salad and sweet and sour pineapple sauce on the side . Comes with a hot cake donut. I would get another piece of chicken added to basket . I like the crisp in the chicken but was wanting more . Donuts were slim pickings . Just ok . Not sure if I would go back ."}
{"text":"Even an hour before they close, great donuts and fresh chicken is still available! I tried a slew of donuts... The Wisconsin, poppyseed lemon, lemon maple, glazed and rose meringue. My fave was the poppyseed lemon and Wisconsin. I think all the donuts plus an order of chicken came out to be a lil less than $20. My friend said its the best chicken she's ever had. In my opinion, it's def not thee best, but it's very good.   I would like to come back and try the other donuts"}
{"text":"I have to admit that the atmosphere  really takes from the experience, it's seems to have been converted from a gas station or some small burger joint. However, the chicken was good and the donuts \"ok\" no major complaints, nothing that really stood out to make me want to visit again...it's ok...just ok."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken,donuts and coffee. The weekend ramen is great also! Definitely worth driving out to phoenix for!!"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool vibe. I had the \"rainbow sprinkles\" donut. The donut was fresh and ever so tasty. The chicken looked amazing. I will be hitting this spot before flying out of the airport. It's a must try in my opinion. The staff was really friendly, knowledgeable and made sure that I felt at home by handing me a menu to come back for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband has been raving about this place for a while and we were finally able to make it there.  It's absolutely delicious, it has climbed its way to the top restaurants in phoenix in my book.  I think the chicken is cooked with a \"double fry\" method, this keeps it both tender and extra crispy. I had the leg and thigh with the plain donut (I wanted to try the default instead of being adventurous).  I opted for the sauce on the side so we can try them all, my favorite was the vietnamese.   MUST TRY if you are in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Loved my korean fried chicken (dark meat), cucumber salad and hot cake donut lunch. The chicken was totally amazing and super addictive. I couldn't pass up selecting a couple of yeast donuts to take home for later. I selected the maple bacon and lemon fig streusel. These are larger than your average donuts for sure.  The donuts really are delicious and I believe the hot cake donut was the best of the 3 I ordered. However, my cat enjoyed the maple bacon donut best (he didn't get to try the cake donut). Confession, yes, I ate the rest of the donut after I shooed him away."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was just the type of donut I ordered, but I was underwhelmed by it.  The chicken was great and I think if I had gotten a better donut (in their defense, I did just get a plain glazed donut), I definitely given this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm near the airport I make a point to stop in, but I usually come in before they start serving chicken. That's okay because the donuts are so good on their own. I love checking in on Instagram to see what specialty flavors they have on the weekend and how cool is it that they even offer vegan donuts?!! Next time you pick up someone from the airport surprise them with a Welcome Chicken+Donuts donut."}
{"text":"After a airport drop off I decided to visit this place for breakfast.  Friendly staff and incredible donuts.  Some were on the pricey side ($3.00) for a donut but trust me they were worth it. Had the Maple Bacon and Chipotle Lemon.  It was too early for chicken but you could see the chicken out getting prepped for lunch and looked incredible.  They also have a couple of beers on tap but I didn't ask what they were."}
{"text":"They've got a pretty unique verity of donuts and everyone that I have tried was amazing. The chicken recipes seem to change from time to time but it's always very good and pair very well with the donut."}
{"text":"Who is the genius behind Welcome? Were they inspired by late night drunchies, pregnant women or are they just THAT clever? Regardless, Welcome C+D ... thank you. Chicken x Donuts x Coffee = a finger-lickin', sweet and head-clearing morning well spent ... mind you I'm still talking about Welcome.  They serve up classic cake/raised donuts and fritters as well as their eccentric, yet surprisingly well thought out gourmet flavored ones as well. I was eyeing the Cherry Amaretto, Peanut Butter/Jam, Maple Bacon and their special which happened to be their fritter flavored with Miso Butterscotch and topped with chicharrones.   I went with the Maple Bacon, wasn't feeling adventurous enough. I also ordered 1/2 dozen of wings with the Thai Chili sauce since most people seem to have had their hands on them in the shop. To drink I went with their Blue House cold brew- it ain't no Blue Bottle but it'll do.  The Maple Bacon Donut was fluffy, soft and fresh. The icing was just perfect, good maple flavor and I appreciated the chopped bacon crumb on top. The bacon itself wasn't overly salty nor smoky. A great contrast of salty and sweet, a 2-in-1 kinda breakfast.  The wings themselves were okay, the coating was crisp and not too thick. The only problem I had with the wings were that they weren't split so it was a bit difficult to eat. I should've took some tips from fellow Yelpers which advised to get sauce on the side. The sauce itself was okay, needs a little more sweetness to balance out the tangy/savory flavor and tbh overwhelmed the flavor of the well-cooked chicken.  The interior is fun, has a diner x donut shop x retro vibe to it. The staff is friendly AF, willing to give reccs and easy on the eyes. Male cashier wearing the plaid- here's looking at you, kid.  With WC+D being \"Hot & New\" like that new student who joined your Math class in high school, you have to check it out - you know AT LEAST once."}
{"text":"Such an interesting combination of cuisines.  Who knew you could successfully sell donuts, fried chicken AND ramen all under one roof.  It seems to be just what Welcome Chicken + Donuts is doing.  The venue is tidy and trendy.  The photography in the indoor dining area gives it a homey flair.  The wooden benches and tables outside give the outdoor dining area a rustic, picnic-y feel.  The cost is a little bit higher than you might pay elsewhere, but the business seems pretty passionate about its ingredients, their origins and quality, so it would seem that you're paying for food that's higher caliber than that found in cheaper venues.  Overall, the cost isn't prohibitive, and only pinches the wallet a bit more.  The food was good.  I tried the chipotle limon doughnut, which proved to be an interesting flavor combination.  I also ate the vegan ramen -- and upon ordering they asked if I'd like the marinated egg which I thought was ironic (and I did choose to add it on).  The ramen was good.  There were bites of sweet with mildly salty noodles and other vegetables.  I probably would have added some fish sauce or soy sauce, had it been on hand.  No one in our party, coincidentally, ordered chicken, so I can't speak to that, but everyone seemed pleased with their donuts and ramen.  I still can't get over that pairing...but it works!  I'd definitely come back here, but probably for the donuts, not the ramen.  Like, I actually might come back for the donuts before I move.  I want to try 'em all!"}
{"text":"Great find straight off the plane. And we will hit it again before we head home. Sweet and spicy chicken- great unique flavor served with the stir fry. Also very unique. Maple Bacon donut! Omg so awesome. The plain glaze was so light and just wonderful. Husband had the siracha limon he said unique flavor and really enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Finally has a chance to try this cute place that has favorite breakfast item in stock daily. We ordered the welcome griddle sandwich and friend chicken. The welcome griddle sandwich was absolutely amazing... the portion was small but I could really taste all the different flavors, which was amazing. The chicken lacked flavor and was a bit dry - if I went back I would just get the sandwich and be completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Tips:  Chicken is not served until 10:30am  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  The fried chicken here is super tasty and the flavors are very true to the flavors that they are trying to go achieve. The Korean flavor is a tiny bit spicy and has that great gochujang (red pepper paste) taste. The Japanese BBQ flavor is very reminiscent of a tonkatsu sauce taste. Overall the fried chicken flavors are QUITE salty, so definitely drink a lot of water or balance it out with some donuts. (They definitely made the best business decision by pairing chicken with donuts)  Peanut butter salted caramel donut - LOVE! Highly recommend for peanut butter lovers. It is a cake donut with a salted caramel peanut butter icing on top. It tastes like you're just eating peanut butter on top of a donut, super yummy.  Irish Car Bomb donut - A gigantic donut filled with a bailey's type of cream filling on the inside. Donut is light and airy, cream has got the flavors you love from an Irish car bomb drink.  Overall, great place with great food."}
{"text":"raw chicken is a turn off - sorry - better luck with another customer. could have gone to church's but thought i'll try that new place out. paid twice as much and ended up having 2 donuts and munchos  for sunday dinner. i tried to call to arrange for a refund but their voice mail is full. of complants? of suppliers wanting their money?"}
{"text":"We had just dropped off a rental car at Sky harbor Airport, we haven't eaten since we were up at 6:30am , we've been wanting to try this place for a while . Our server Austin was super cool and patient , it was our first time trying it , he even suggested a couple things to us we did the whole chicken with Korean sauce and Japanese bbq , even did some wings and fried mushrooms with buttermilk miso ranch. Definitely a must go , Im definitely trying the ramen next visit!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from someone at a pizza place recently.  Unique concept and I was a fan.  Went with a simple order of fried chicken, Japanese BBQ sauce on the side, and their coleslaw.  The chicken was the star of the show and came out hot, crispy, and flavorful.  The donut was good, but nothing over the top special. It's a smaller place but they move people in and out pretty quick."}
{"text":"If you want an expensive delicious doughnut. This is the place. The taste is worth the price. I've had many doughnuts from many places and this is by far one of best. I haven't even mentioned the chicken. OMG! The juiciest chicken ever, but go early because when it's gone it's gone. The wings are wonderful...try the Korean sauce, all the sauces rock! The staff is exceptional (friendly and knowledgeable of the food) just ask they explain the menu very well."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Phoenix. There, I said it. Ignore the one-star reviews about the \"raw\" chicken. Your chicken will be piping hot when it comes out and yes, sometimes blood and juices will continue to seep from the bone, but your chicken will be safe.  Compared to other Korean fried chicken places (Kyochon, Bon Chon, etc.) the quality of the chicken is comparable or better. The sauces are a little saltier but I'll forgive them for that based on other positives. All the sides are solid.  The doughnuts are also great. Personal fave is the pumpkin espuma, it's magical. I love maple bacon doughnuts but I'll be honest, Voodoo Doughnuts' in Portland is better. Locally, Rollover has the better maple bacon.  Cold press coffee here is also great. I love this place."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot staff was friendly food was good so I thought I would take my mom here cause I wanted her to enjoy a nice brunch... How embarrassing of an experience was this. Me and my mom and quiet polite people the man at the front taking are order was the rudest person I've ran into in a while he was wearing a black and red tie dye looking shirt didn't get a name cause he wasn't wearing a name tag but he treated my mom like shit I wanted to leave right then and there but since we made the drive mid as well eat. My mom asked about some of the donuts and he looked at her and talked to her like she was stupid and didn't know anything about the food she was asking about I ordered for her because at that point she wanted to go sit down because of how disrespect she was we received our food from the same asshole who took our order he slapped our donuts on the table and left he put our donuts down so hard on our table the donut frosting got all over my shirt. He didn't even get the beverage when she asked twice I had to ask one of the ladies who worked there for it a 3rd time she finally got it. All in all me who goes there frequently will never be dining there again and my mom will definitely not be making a trip and I'll make sure none of my friends dine at this establishment again. It's crazy some of the people that get hired did they even go through a interview process or just a friend of the owner either way ruined my experience such a shame."}
{"text":"Pros:   Nice memorial to a time (and neighborhood) that has seen better days  Patio is lovely, but inside feels run down like it only got a coat of paint from previous tenant. (the one door even thanks you for visiting Mr. T's BBQ)  Chicken is very tasty and the sauces compliment.  Unique selection of donuts  Cons:  At 1:30pm the donuts my friend and I both got were dried out and the toppings so sweet we couldn't eat them (saying a lot in our sugar-hyped American food). We got a Cherry Amaretto and Poppy Seed cake. Neither of us would go back for donuts.   Lack of drink selection (canned ginger ale and soda, a bottle black tea and a few meh beers)  I got confused if I was in a friend chicken spot or a fusion Asian restaurant.   Price of the donuts was ridiculous! Premium donuts run $25 for a dozen. Doubt anyone brings those into the office to share!  Lots of hipsters waxing poetically about the glorious nature of the chicken and donuts as if on the 8th day god made fried chicken and donuts and gave it onto Adam the Hipster saying  \"taketh these but do not eat so many or thou may not fit into thy super skinny jeans.\""}
{"text":"First timer here and a decent experience. Staff was extremely helpful with the menu & in making a selection with the flavors, sides and drinks (limited choices with beverages but decent). I got my flavor on the side as I wanted to check out the flavor of the chicken. I deviated from the combo and got a breast & thigh so I could try both white & dark meat. Both were good, but really dry making it hard to enjoy as is. Overcooked so the sauce was needed. It was 112 degrees outside so I was looking for a cool indoor location but it was still warm inside for me followed by piping hot chicken when served. I would go back but it didn't overly exceed my expectations like so many have discussed. Donuts selection was good."}
{"text":"The fried chicken here is amazing. If you like piping hot chicken, moist and juicy, and an actual crunch when you bite into it, this is the place. Warning though, it will ruin all other fried chicken places you previously loved, so eat at your own risk. Plain donuts are ok, but the specialty donuts are really good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about.  I went on a Saturday morning around 9:45.  I was too early for chicken but was able to try seven different donuts and was completely disappointed.  The yeast donuts are dry and taste like bread with simple syrup on top and the cake donuts are lacking in flavor.  I went on a day when they collaborated with another chef, so I even tried some of the fancy donuts but wasn't impressed with any of them.  I wasted $18 on donuts that weren't worth taking a second bite.  I hope their chicken is spectacular enough to warrant such high reviews.  Otherwise if you're after a yummy donut is head to Bosa or another of the smaller chains in town."}
{"text":"So, I never get any pictures. Shame on me. However, when I wake up in the morning and really feel like I'm missing Portland. This is my go to. The thing is, flavor profiles are such an incredible thing to those of us who want to thoroughly enjoy the food we eat.   I love that no matter when I walk in, my options are not limited and there is a constant funnel of new flavor combinations to try as far as the donut selection is concerned.  This morning I went in after a quick run up A mountain in Tempe. If you've walked that incline you know exactly why I stopped in for food after. My go to was the South by Southwest, the jalapeño relish really never disappoints. But I also went ahead with the side of potatoes this time around. My favorite thing about this place has got to be that portion control. I left feeling full and happy but not overly done. The staff is always polite and prompt and never too in your face, which is a lovely balance before your coffee.  The only thing that could make me happier is the day they throw up a glazed yeast donut with char marks from the grill....honestly. I always leave satisfied. If you haven't yet, check this off your places to visit next."}
{"text":"Love the doughnuts here. Gourmet flavors, not your average donut spot. Great dough, Casey the baker is a genius and her creations are simply amazing. This is for the doughnuts connoisseur."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list of places to try since they opened.  I grew up down the street and have seen this building change from fried chicken and fish and chip establishments.  Now it is chicken and donuts!  Who can resist that combination?!  I was so sad to hear that they were out of wings at 12:30 on a Tuesday... But I ended up getting a couple Korean chili drumsticks.  They were tasty!  The sauce had great flavor and it smelled amazing.  The chicken was not grisly, as some small drumsticks are... and the chicken fell off the bone pretty easily.    They had a pretty cool variety of donuts.  I tried the Chocolate+Almond+Coconut, Lemon Poppyseed, and Classic Apple Fritter.  All were good, but not exceptional and a little pricy.  My friend got the PB+Blackberry Liqueur.  It was probably the least favorite out of all of the ones we tried.    All in all, I will be back for some good chicken! Who am I kidding?  I can't say no to a donut too..."}
{"text":"My husband love they chicken and the donuts were pretty good. We be going back very soon. I would love to try their vegan soup."}
{"text":"We met a friend here for lunch because she had heard heaps of good reviews and had been to the other location.   I ordered the Chicken Breast Combo with the Japanese BBQ Sauce and a side of watermelon. I was thankful my friend cut the super greasy fried chicken for me as it was strewn with veins, blood and bones; the most disturbing part was the bloody chicken. After two bites, I was set.  The sauce was less than used as it tasted very strongly of soy sauce.   Also purchased a half dozen box of assorted donuts to taste with my family. The Lemon Maple was dry. The Plum Yoghurt Granola's donut was nice and the frosting was tart but with a fermented taste. The Maple Bacon donut looked a lot less like bacon on top and more like coconut; we didn't even bite into it and as soon as it hit our mouths the hickory flavour was too overwhelming and caused 75% of the party to spit it out before even chewing it. The Glazed Donut was boring and dry. The Raspberry Hazelnut's centre lacked the hazelnut but sure did taste like a chocolate pudding cup. The Maple Ring did not have a strong maple flavour but the consistency of the donut was better than the others.   The consistency of the donuts were very dry and more like eating a bread roll and as for the taste, remained unwanted in our mouths for hours. While they were creative in their combinations, it's best to keep in mind that some combinations don't necessarily work well together."}
{"text":"I rarely include chicken into my diet... but once every 3 months or so I get a random craving for fried chicken. Our normal spot wasn't serving dinner yet so my husband and I decided to try Welcome.   I wouldn't have had such an issue with the food had the service been better. As I said I almost never eat chicken and as soon as I cut into the thigh, red juice comes pouring out of pink meat.  Then when I return it to your window asking for it to be cooked longer and instead of doing so, I'm given a stern lecture about how their chicken is cooked and return to my seat with pink chicken, I am NOT pleased. I was told the chicken is fried twice to eliminate the possibility of being medium rare.   The girl at the counter rolled her eyes when I asked for not pink chicken, which tells me this is a frequent request. Then she tells me that the \"blood\" I'm seeing gush out of this chicken thigh is actually baby chicken bone marrow. Congratulations, you have officially killed my appetite."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Thigh + Drum Combo with Hot Cake Donut, Korean Chili Sauce and Thai Yum Slaw Apple Fritter Basic Glaze Blackberry Pear Apple Butter Hot Buttered Rum Cranberry Hibiscus Mexican Chocolate Snickerdoodle  Missed due to a New Year closure in early 2016, and thus scheduled as a between-meal stop exactly 365-days later, Welcome Chicken + Donuts confirmed rumors of fried-bird greatness prior to the 2016 Fiesta Bowl while the glazed rounds of Dough were a more mixed experience.  Owned by the same folks behind Phoenix's Welcome Diner, their Southern-style Chicken Sandwich frequently cited as one of The Valley's \"must have\" bites, Welcome Chicken + Donuts sees the team take on a double-fried style akin to Korean Chicken at an East Buckeye Road storefront close enough to the city to be accessible, though those unfamiliar with area may see the building surrounded by barren dirt somewhat out of the way.  Bringing a farm-to-table artisan's touch to comfort food, purveyors such as Red Bird Farms and McClendon's both justifying prices higher than KFC or Dunkin', those entering WC+D after 10:30 Tuesday through Sunday are greeted by the faint smell of oil as well as sweet and savory cooking spices, the Donut case hopefully still stocked from the store's 8am opening.  Undoubtedly another former eatery, the counter-style ordering seeing Donuts boxed or placed in baskets prior to a brief wait at one of several booths, diners are given a choice of several dark or light Meat combos plus Ramen, Sides and daily specials, the choice of just one Thigh and a Drumstick with Sauce on the side showing evidence of a long brine and good spice mix beneath golden Batter while the Thai Yum Slaw brightened shredded Cabbage with Carrots and fragrant Peanut Sauce.  With both fellow-diners completely in love with the fried Bird, requests for more quelled by the reminder of two full-meals to come, Welcome's raised Donuts unfortunately failed to achieve the same high marks thanks to a dense, wheaty base that unfortunately comes across doughy unless filled with Fruit Compote while Cake choices trend only slightly better, the Hot Buttered Rum almost textured like a Buttermilk Bar with restrained sweetness to smooth Frosting overlying the ring below it."}
{"text":"A hipster Barista at Cartel overheard my conversation with a co-worker about donuts and she said that we have to try Welcome Chicken + Donuts....a few hours later I realized that was the greatest piece of advise I had been given in a long time.  Went with the 3 piece combo with Korean Chili sauce. Perfectly spiced juicy chicken that had the perfect amount of heat where you could taste the spice without setting fire to your mouth. The traditional doughnut complimented the chicken perfectly and used it to mop up the extra sauce and washed everything down with a Blue Sky Cola.  This place is now in my top 5 places to eat in Phoenix and will be part of my lunch crew's rotation."}
{"text":"YES! I stopped in today to try their vegan donuts that I heard SO much about in the Phoenix vegan community. What I loved most is seeing on their menu that they use ORGANIC sugar and NON-GMO flour, YES! I also absolutely LOVE that their cold brew coffee is local. This is ALL a huge win for me! And, of course, the cherry on topping is the deliciousness! Mark my words when I say that this was the BEST donut I've EVER had! I also saw on their menu that they have vegan ramen! YES! I'll be going back to try! And, the prices, were VERY fair, I was actually expecting them to be higher. Loved this place."}
{"text":"One of the best food combinations is salty and sweet. Welcome Chicken and Donuts does this excellence.  I know that whenever I go here I won't be disappointed.  Having grown up sample a fair share of donuts as a family I am well versed in the decadence of donuts.  The great part about the donuts here is the combination of classic donuts like the apple fritter and cake donut but you can also try some of the most unique creations that they offer like key lime and lemon poppyseed to name a couple.   What goes better with a donut than coffee.  And the coffee does not fail.  There aren't many place around town that offer a cold brew and theirs is dynamite. I love that they offer almond milk as an option.  The chicken is spot on.  Just the right amount of crispness and so juicy.  Everyone that works there has been friendly and welcoming.  Indoor seating is limited but there is an awesome patio outside."}
{"text":"Interesting location with great donuts! I had a egg and cheese donut sandwich it was just decent. Seasoned potatoes were good though! My fiancé had wings he love them! He also had ramen which he thought was ok but wasn't spicy enough for his liking. Overall, I'd go back but strictly for donuts!"}
{"text":"I got the breast thigh and drumstick combo and it was the best fried chicken I've ever had and would probably compare every other fried chicken that I ever eat to this. The chicken was very moist and crunchy. We tried every sauce available and my favorite was the Japanese bbq with some sriracha on it."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at Welcome Chicken + Donuts this week. It was awesome. They had the most interesting and delicious flavor of donuts. We ordered the coconut mango donuts and they were awesome. We also had the chicken. So the chicken is fried and then the add sauce over the top. We all had different sauces so we could try them all, the best was Japanese BBQ. It was so yummy. We also ate outside on their patio and the employees kept checking on us to see if we needed anything. So the service was great. I would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"My co-worker picked some donuts up on her lunch and brought them back for us to try. They were all very tasty, though next time I really want to try the chicken."}
{"text":"They have pretty good donuts but what kind of coffee and breakfast place opens at 8? That's late dudes. There used to be this commercial for dunkin donuts where the employee had to get up real early and he was like \"time to make the donuts\" all sleepy like. If a boring corporate place like DD could be bothered to wake up early, I would think these guys who are supposedly passionate about donuts would be willing to too.   The reason I am bringing this up was I was going to bring a dozen donuts to work. Was hoping that my co workers would be all \"he is so cool he thinks out of the box with these crazy bacon donuts!\" But I couldn't buy that dozen because our meeting starts at 8. It's costing you $$$ to sleep in like that. I want you to stay in business because I think you are cool."}
{"text":"My family has been saying I needed to check this place out for months. Tried to get in at Lo Lo's up the road and couldn't find parking, so headed here. The selection of donuts is unique enough that you want to try a little bit of everything which I recommend but it's going to set you back a few bucks if you get a dozen and you're going to take most of them home because you'll be lucky to get through 2 of them if you ordered anything else. The flavors they have are pretty great and everything I tried was excellent.   The fried chicken though, that's the real deal. After tasting it I wanted to toss the donuts and get a bucket of it to go. It has a wonderful flavor and is juicy, crispy and perfect. I only tried the breast so I can't speak of any of the dark meat.   The people working the counter are extremely friendly, helpful and patient. They even fixed my order without complaint after I screwed up what I ordered. Definitely check this place out and bring your appetite."}
{"text":"this place was well worth the drive! don't let the questionable neighborhood deter you. the fun donut flavors are refreshingly unique and the donuts themselves were warm and fluffy. the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. we also had the ramen. it was incredibly flavorful, slightly spicy and tangy and very addicting!!"}
{"text":"I used to live across the street from Sidecar Donuts in Newport Beach, and BonChon in Jersey City- needless to say my expectations for Welcome Chicken and Donut were very high- I'm here to report that I'm a converted skeptic and a full-fledged fan of Welcome Chicken & Donuts!  We came on a Sunday around brunch time, and the place was packed despite its odd location, close enough to Downtown Phoenix but seemingly in the middle of nowhere. The array of donuts in the glass display was enough to make my mouth melt: Pistachio Chocolate, Blueberry Cookie, and Strawberry Cheesecake, to name a few. In addition, the chicken menu had the choice of three Asian flavors: Korean Chili, Japanese BBQ, and Vietnamese Herb.  My husband and I both opted for the Korean Chili and ordered three donuts to try. We settled into a booth with cute chicken and donut characters painted on the wall. As I took a bite into the Pistachio Chocolate, my taste buds went wild. What a perfect balance! Often, a gourmet donut taste too much like a baked good passed off as a donut, but in this case the donut was baked just as it should be- and then elevated to the next level. And the chicken? Yes, yes, yes! The skin, lathered in red Korean Chili, was not overpowered by heat, but had just enough zing and crunch to it to make every bite mouthwatering and addictive. The Chicken and Donuts combo is genius - its chicken and waffles with a modern day twist. Thank you Chicken and Donuts for bringing this to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of those who posted the chicken was raw. They were correct. The thighs I received needed a tampon, as they were bleeding. The Vietnamese sauce for the chicken tasted what I would presume dirty feet taste like. It was godawful. I saw this place on one of the Phoenix morning news shows. They work wonders with those cameras as to not make a place look bad. The employees and most of the customers look like they just flew in from the Seattle Grunge Festival. I was so disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"If you want to support small business and local entrepreneurs with a vision all while having some delicious food - this is the place.  Chicken was flavorful and the donuts were even more so!  I had the chicken with Vietnamese Herb Sauce. Awesome."}
{"text":"Right next to the airport, so if you're hungry leaving town and don't want to get stuck paying airport prices, drop in. And be amazed. The chicken, sauces, sides were out of this world. This is no regular food joint. This is foodie heaven. And I ate the whole plain cake donut, something I never do, because it was simply the most perfect donut I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Donuts taste like heaven, but their fried chicken was the absolute best......EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came across this spot by chance, and have enjoyed visiting time and time again. From the uniquely flavored donuts, to the chicken combos, I love everything this place makes.   The interior is small but cool, and you order at a counter. They have the case of donuts up front showcasing all of the flavors, as well as all of their menu items up above where you order. The employees have always been very nice and efficient. If you come past 10:30am, then you can enjoy their chicken. I usually get a breast, thigh and drum combo with the Japanese bbq sauce and Thai yum slaw, and I always upgrade my donut to whichever flavor I want to try. It's always fantastic!!  On this particular visit, I arrived before chicken time so I snagged a half dozen. I can't remember the exact flavors, but one involved beer, maple bacon, dark chocolate pudding, and chocolate pistachio among the sprinkled ones I believe. So so SO good. Anytime I drop someone off at the airport I make sure to swing by this place. Highly recommend if you have an adventurous palate or are willing to try something new!"}
{"text":"Chicken (lunch menu) not served until 1030a and it gets busy from then to 1p but may sell out sooner."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today with a few of my friends. The menu is pretty simple, and you order at the counter and the servers will come find you.   I ordered the thigh & drumstick combo [$9] - comes with one sauce (either on the side or tossed with your chicken), a side, and a regular donut. I asked if I could get two sauces, and the cashier said I could, but I wish he told me it would cost $1 extra. Also, since I ordered a premium donut (Lemon Basil, white choc. donut), I had to pay $0.70 more. So the total with tax was abt $12.70.   We sat outside, and since it had just rained the other day, the wind felt so nice. But yes, shooing away the pigeons was a tad annoying.  Our meals arrived about ~30min after we ordered. The sauces were more tangy than what I would have expected as well (aka they weren't that good). The chicken was lightly battered and crispy though and so moist! The donut was really delicious :0 there was a hint of basil flavor that wasn't overpowering. My friend got a chocolate, pistachio with rose flavored donut that was pretty good too.   -1 star for slightly pricey foods (for the amount you get) and sauces that aren't that great +4 stars for super moist chicken, their own parking lot, outdoor covered seating, unique donut flavors"}
{"text":"I am a fanboy of The Welcome Diner, and am so impressed with this new restaurant! The apple fritter had homemade Cajeta (a Mexican Caramel) with small specks of seasalt. I took a bite and found chunks of real fresh apple! Now that's some homemade love and quality!  I also tried the key lime filled donut and the chocolate mole as well. All excellent and lovingly made.  The fried chicken was incredible. I had the smaller combo with a leg and thigh and the cucumber/dill/ginger side. The chicken has a great consistency, the skin is flaky and crunchy and the inside had none of that fatty texture you find in lower quality chicken places. I had the Korean Chile sauce and I would say it was more flavorful than spicy, but I really enjoyed it. I cleaned off the bones!  The ambiance is clean and laid back. I like the art and their clever clean cardboard menus above where you order. They have a great outdoor seating area with long wooden benches, and cared enough to plant new trees all along the front. It's going to be gorgeous in the next couple of years.   Thank you Welcome Chicken and Donuts!"}
{"text":"Glad we walked in.  Friendly staff and donuts were awesome!  Didn't get to try the Fried Chicken, they weren't serving it yet but it looked awesome too."}
{"text":"This little place has huge flavor! The donuts are unique and flavorful. Whoever came up with these flavor combos is genius! The chicken?...OMG the chicken! DELICIOUS! Fried to perfection! Dipped in some of the most flavorful sauces you could imagine.  I won't forget the sides...simply heaven! This food made the earth move!  No literally it made the earth move.  The day my husband and I went it was raining and lightening, and lightening struck outside the restaurant and blew the man hole  lid right of the hole!   We will be back for more food really soon!"}
{"text":"My best friend brag about this place. How the vegan donut is amazing, its heaven, its blah blahhhh.so finally I tried it..... And its not even that great. My vegan donut was so sour. *sad face* even slighty hard, when the guy asked me how my donut was. He seemed like he didn't even care of what I thought about the donut or even consider me or offer me a different donut...  I would never thought this place would be in this area....no offense. Anyways,  we took the food to go. No napkins were provided. My nephew thought the chicken was.. okay... kinda dry he said.   Overall.  3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hip. They have some unique flavors. Ultimately some of the donuts are good, some are just ok, and some are actually not good at all. The cake donuts are super dry. And I can't say any of the donuts tasted that fresh at 9:30am. This place seems like a lot of hype and I guess people go for the unique flavors but unique flavors can't cover up a lousy donut."}
{"text":"I would totally recommend the chicken but stay away from the donuts. So let's start off with the good:  Chicken wings: hot, juicy, large and delicious. The Indonesian peanut sauce was savory but lacking heat. A little but of siracha will do wonders but it was delicious regardless. Also tried the Korean wings and I felt they were too vinegar and needed a little sweetness. Overall, the chicken stands up to the high raves.  Bad: Donuts... We ordered the chocolate passion fruit pistachio and a rose strawberry rhubarb one. Both the donuts were oily and stale, especially the chocolate one. When I bit into it the first bite was just oil...bleh. it seemed like the donut wasn't fried well or just sat out too long and the oil soaked in? Either way it was gross and there was no pistachio or passionfruut flavor evident. The rose strawberry rhubarb was better but not by much. The cake donut was once again oily and while the rhubarb jam was good, it was a very tiny dollop. The strawberry glaze was average and nothing to rave abt and also not worth the 3+ dollars it cost. Both the donuts were overpriced, underwhelming and oily....avoid these!  If I went back it would be for the chicken and not the donuts...never the donuts. But go there and get the chicken!"}
{"text":"Brought my babies for what I thought would be quick in & out donut run...wrong! We ordered donuts & food and it was freakin amazing!!! Great people also:) The \"South By Southwest \" breakfast sandwich was unbelievable. Kiddos had chicken drumsticks and I could here the crunch in their bite haha. We all loved it! Can't believe I've been missing out on this"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for quite awhile now, and finally made the trip. I would definitely say it was WELL worth it. They had a selection of unique flavor combinations. I had an orange, beet filled with labneh. That was probably the smoothest most fresh tasting flavor I have ever had in a donut. Yes, the prices are a bit high, but in my opinion well worth it. I guess I picked a good time to go, 9am on a Saturday. I don't have to wait at all. I would definitely recommend trying it at least once for a unique and we'll made donut. I was too early for the chicken, but I'm pretty sure I'll go another day to try it."}
{"text":"Every other establishment on earth that successfully sizzled their way into the upper echelon of quintessential fried foods committed to making chicken OR doughnuts really, really well. The magic of Welcome C+D is in the \"+\"  Welcome Chicken + Doughnuts is obliterating \"or\" as a conjunction altogether. You get to have it all, without sacrificing your standards for obnoxiously hip, artisan doughnuts that are ring-shaped renditions of craft cocktails and high quality, free range, bilingual chickens doused in authentic, savory Asian sauces.  So while indulging my \"ind\" (a culinary-Freudian fusion of \"and\" + \"id,\" which, yes, I did just make up for this occasion) I opted for chicken + doughnuts. In fact, I had Korean + Japanese chicken, of which the salty sweetness of the Japanese BBQ paired best with doughnuts. Between the breast + drum, the breast was more tender and meaty. Between cucumber salad + buttered corn, the warm, comforting flavor and texture of the corn won my vote. I also had pb&j + blueberry cacao + lemon gingerbread + maple bacon, but blacked out between the third and fourth doughnut, meaning more R+D is in order.   The Japanese BBQ fried chicken breast paired with buttered corn is my pick as of now, but I genuinely appreciate that Welcome C+D lets me have it all. As long as they supply a deep fryer and a dream, I'll supply cash and jubilant lack of self-control."}
{"text":"It was Valentine's Day and my boyfriend and I were trying to find a great spot to eat some breakfast before a day filled with activities. We wanted something somewhat quick and I was scrolling through Yelp I was like Chicken + Donuts? Two of my favorite things in one location? Yup, take me there now!  I have to say that was one of the finer choices I've made in my life because this place would be in my heaven. It's in an odd location, for those of you that don't live nearby but it's worth the drive no matter where you live in AZ.  Fair warning...because this place is just so dang awesome, there will be a line and some waiting involved. However, the staff is efficient and we still got our order within 20 minutes of ordering. It might seem chaotic at first but once you're eating your Chicken + Donuts you won't even remember anything else.   I went with the 1 piece chicken combo. I got my chicken breast tossed in the Japanese Barbecue Sauce (you can get it on the side or plain) and for my side I went with Thai Yum Slaw. I decided to upgrade my donut to their Maple Bacon donut for an extra charge. I can't even begin to describe the Maple Bacon donut. It's just perfect in every way...sweet buttery maple topped with salty crispy bacon on a soft fluffy donut. It's my kryptonite. The chicken was crispy and crunchy yet juicy on the inside. Although it's fried chicken, it's not greasy at all and seasoned pleasantly. I could eat it plain but the Japanese Barbecue was a great combo to the chicken. Lastly, the slaw was yummy and refreshing.   I ordered their cold brew to accompany my meal and it was smooth and it didn't even need any creamer. It was great on it's own. There's so many flavor combos available that I'm going to have to head back to try them all."}
{"text":"Wow, Welcome Chicken and Donuts is a must visit if you're in the area!!  I was with my pops around lunch time (12:30) on a Thursday and there was no line when we walked in.  We both ordered chicken combos, and we were extremely pleased with the food.  I went with the leg and thigh combo tossed in their Korean Chili sauce, which was so bomb. Messy but finger licking good!  Don't be scared, just get your chicken tossed in whatever sauce you choose :-)  The slaw was more tasty than the cucumbers for the sides.  The Hot Cake Donut it came with was also very good. Not too sweet but the perfect consistency.   We shared an Apple Fritter for dessert.  It was also very good: nice and fluffy interior with a crispy, but not too crispy, outer, with chunks of apple throughout.    I ordered A Classic Maple, Classic Glaze, and Rainbow Sprinkle donuts to go so my wife could have a nice treat when she gets home from work.  I can't wait to come back and try one of the sandwiches and a big bowl of ramen!!"}
{"text":"*Vegan review* On my first visit, I was in the city and decided to give their vegan donuts a try. The offerings that day were Smokey Peach Pecan, Lemon Berrycello, and Double Chocolate. Sweet and soft yummilicious, big ole vegan donuts.  They are melt-in-your-mouth delicious!   I have since been back and tried the Maple and Original glaze vegan donuts.  To my knowledge, the vegan donuts are only available on Fridays and Saturdays and the flavors vary each week.  There are other local establishments who sell their vegan donuts daily though (i.e. Volstead).   They offer a vegan ramen dish, but I haven't tried it yet.  On my last visit I discovered that they have a really nice and large patio out back, which I'm sure is popular during cooler months.  The employees are always nice and they serve up service with a smile.  Cool place with cool peeps."}
{"text":"I can only rate the doughnuts and customer service. The checker gave me some great suggestions and he was super friendly. I left with the pistachio, lemon maple and classic chocolate. The lemon maple is life changing!"}
{"text":"NOTE : this place gets packed QUICK!  Not much seating inside, but plenty of seats for you outside.  Also if you want to try the combo of chicken and donuts come after 10:30 am when the chicken is available.     My friends and I tried 3 donuts, moscow mule, maple bacon and sweet corn and rosemary.   Our favorite was the sweet corn, but the others are good too.   All the donuts are flavorful and soft.  Although all the donuts looked delicious ... I wish we can sample them all !!!   Next ... add chicken.  You can choose various combos and sides. Chicken wings are not on the menu, but also an option and what I would definitely recommend.  They didn't take long to make and super crispy, just how I like my wings.  We wanted to try the sauces so we got the wings plain with sauce on the side.  Now that I'm reviewing I realize there were only Asian sauces available : Korean chili, Vietnamese fresh herb, and Japanese BBQ.  All the sauces were a little too salty for me, but if I had to pick one I would choose plain with the Vietnamese fresh herb (which was basically fish sauce)   The guys that work there are super friendly and will answer all your questions.    If you just wanted a light snack or to start your day with breakfast here, I would definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"A really yummy place! The fried chicken is delicious - crispy without being too heavy - and the donuts are unique and fun. I got a breast combo with the Korean sauce and the cucumber salad side, and was not disappointed. The Korean sauce tasted authentically sweet and spicy. We got a half dozen to go and look forward to trying them!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what to say right now. I just finished a 2-piece chicken with the vietnamese fresh herb sauce, plus a few donuts that looked almost too perfect to eat. If I die on the toilet in an hour or so, I'll at least die knowing I finished things off with the best chicken meal I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Fried chicken: perfection. Super crispy, super juicy, just delicious! Get the Korean sauce on the side, as ordering it smothered was a bit too much. We ordered the thigh and leg combo with the Korean sauce and Japanese bbq sauce.   Donuts: We legit ordered $20 worth of donuts, just to be a tad disappointed. It could be because we arrived at 3:30 when they close at 4....so I'll hold my reviews on the donuts til I try them early in the morning. They look phenomenal though!   Ramen was tasty, had a savory pork flavor and came with lots of items in the bowl i.e. corn, kim chi, charsiu pork pieces, scallions and soft boiled eggs. The taste was only mediocre for being $14/bowl though.   We loved the novelty of the place and will be back for the bomba$$ chicken!!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place and decided to stop by to see what they had. I know it's a \"chicken place\" but I decided on the pork ramen. I'm glad I did, it was very tasty. I finished the whole thing which included picking up the bowl to drink the rest of the broth. I had it with a cold brew coffee which was alright. Will have to go back and try their chicken and donuts."}
{"text":"Life is full of surprises. Every once in a while we are supposed to indulge. Last night (and maaaybe this morning) I ate donuts from Welcome Chicken + Donuts. My first foray into the heaven of sugar was a donut covered in cheddar \"Apple fritter with Wisconsin Cheddar\". A bit dubious I went with the flow. Handed over to me my eyes widened. I thought donuts were required to have a hole in the middle.  No. This cheddar donut was humongus - about the size of my hand. Filled with a gooey creamy sweat something I was very happy. Motivated by this wonderful experience I ordered another to take home. Based simply on looks I took home a white iced donut with sprinkles. In hindsight this was an excellent means to create a sugar coma first thing in the morning. It was the breakfast of champions.  Will is the best, most awesome employee *ever* to walk this earth. That kid is full of energy and can make anyone laugh.  I can only imagine what eating a combination of donut + fried chicken could do to my system at the same time. I might just die."}
{"text":"I purchased a 1/2 dozen donuts. It was a Friday around 12:30, so that could explain why they tasted old and dry. I will give this place a try one more time and also try the chicken."}
{"text":"This unassuming restaurant blew me away with their top-notch service and flavor-packed food.    My local friend proposed Welcome as an option for my first meal of the day at 2PM.  I was skeptical about this fried chicken and donut combination; who has ever heard of such a thing.  I followed my friend's recommendation with blind faith and was rewarded with the best meal of my entire trip to Arizona.    We were fortunate to not have to wait in line when we stopped by for a bite.  After we ordered and sat down at a table, we realized how lucky we got because a long line soon formed in front of the register.    Our food arrived promptly and was followed by a long silence as the three of us stuffed our faces with the delicious food.  I got the thigh and drumstick combo with Korean sauce and the cake donut.  The sauce had more of a kick to it than I was expecting but it was still manageable and tasty.  My friend got the same combo but with the Vietnamese sauce. I regretted not ordering the same sauce because it was so damn delicious! It had a great balance of sweet and salty! Since it was Friday, we were all able to order the seasoned potatoes as sides and we were the happiest campers.  They were like homestyle fries and perfectly seasoned.  We ate everything and I only wish I had more room in my stomach to order more donuts!   I will dream of this place until I return to Arizona."}
{"text":"I have had 3 donuts from Welcome Chicken and Donuts. The extremely flavorful salted caramel bun type thing.... got this around opening day, and it was legitimately tasty. The second time, I tried the blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate cacao. Both were insanely good, even better than the salted caramel. The chocolate cacao had dense white cake donut with dark chocolate icing... so good. The cheesecake blueberry was also delicious... a little savory, a little sweet, and all tasty. I will certainly be back to try more donuts and try the chicken!"}
{"text":"This is an incredible food joint with some food combinations that you wouldn't expect from a chicken place. Speaking of chicken, it's so crispy and moist and you can have their sauces on the side or tossed in with your chicken. They also have a vegan ramen which is the best noodle bowl I've had in a while. Finally, you can have one of their several donut flavor combinations that are unexpected but delicious. Excellent customer service and atmosphere (talk to Austin). I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Chicken was good but skin was too soggy for the sauce. Should be double fried. Only had 4 types of donuts left at noon and chick with short bangs at register was rude. Ended up leaving after bee came to our table inside and was all over my food (lots of bees outside). This was a bust as other trendy hipster places are, since the are too cool for a good customer experience."}
{"text":"Love love love this place just as much as the restaurant Welcome Diner. Every donut is unique, delicious, and fresh. The Friendly up beat staff is on point with service and you can tell they love what they do. As soon as you walk in you feel the warmth and inviting atmosphere sucking you deep into a food coma. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The donuts are pretty good. I don't quite know if they are good enough to justify the price though. I paid $17 bucks for 6 donuts and they didn't stand super above and beyond bosa or even dunkin. I guess I will have to try the chicken next time and see it that helps this place stand out."}
{"text":"My chicken was hot and crispy from the first bite to the last.  You'd think the sauce would make the coating soggy, but it didn't!  The coffee cake donut was yummy and the cucumber salad refreshing.  I tried the Vietnamese sauce this time, but I'll be back to try all the others!  A new lunch fave to share with coworkers.  The staff are friendly and efficient, and they seem happy to work here and to be invested.  A cool little spot.  One of these days I'll try their ramen too."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Had fried chicken with Korean chili sauce on the side-next time I'll get it tossed in the seasoning. The chicken is super moist and juicy, the skin is crispy and light. I also had a sticky buns donut. Very flavorful without being overly sweet. I wish I had room to try other donuts. And if they have the Thai chili Bloody Mary, get it! Best food I've had in Phoenix. A must try!"}
{"text":"I went on a weekday morning around 11, it wasn't that busy. No one was in line but took about 10 minutes for someone to take my order. I was expecting a lot more from some of the hype I've heard. I ordered the breast and drumstick with potatoes. The chicken was pretty good, excellent crunch and coating. The potatoes were not that good. I don't know how to explain it but there was a weird taste to them. The best part of this experience was my plain jane original glazed donut. That was absolutely one of the best donuts I've had. Super soft, gooey and sweet."}
{"text":"If I was trapped on a deserted island and was only supplied one meal for the rest of my life chicken and donuts would probably be it! This place is a munchie party in my mouth satisfying the sweet and savory cravings I desire in a meal. I always get the Japanese bbq chicken it's so good and for a side I love the Thai slaw and the corn stir fry it's so yummy. The plain donut that comes with the meal is so perfect bringing satisfaction to every bite. I love this place so much it's awesome."}
{"text":"What a great concept! I had two chicken drumsticks with the Thai slaw and a plain doughnut. First off the skin on the chicken is cooked perfectly, doused in sauce but still crispy. The meat was so tender and the doughnut was perfect for sopping up the drumstick sauce. All in all it was a little expensive but well worth it. Please check it out and get there at 10:20 before the line goes out the door."}
{"text":"The food and coffee were delicious! What a welcome first meal in Phoenix! We had the welcome griddle and the tonkotsu style ramen. Both were fantastic! The donuts are amazing and there are some vegan options too. Their purveyors seem to be mostly locally sourced and the cold brew was one of the smoothest I have had. The atmosphere is that of a small diner and very friendly. The only drawback for me was the lack of all gender restrooms. Binary bathrooms are challenging to navigate for me when traveling and not knowing each state's set of laws around bathroom use, so I would have appreciated if the single stalls had been all genders."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was good: crispy but not overly fried. Not very meaty but it did the trick. I really liked the spicy Korean sauce. The Japanese BBQ sauce was pretty good too. The Thai cole slaw was very tasty. The hot cake doughnut was okay, nothing special. The doughnut with sprinkles was good. The grapefruit rosemary doughnut was my personal fave of the 3 that I tried. It was not as cakey as the other two, just a bit fluffier than a DnD glazed doughnut. $3 for a cup of milk?? Yikes.  The men's bathroom was dirty. There was a leaky ceiling and the table was sticky. In my opinion, these things kind of added to the character of the place as a hole in the wall establishment but at the same time was kind of gross. The staff were friendly. Parking was very easy. The neighborhood wasn't very inviting."}
{"text":"Go inside. Walk up to the counter. Close your eyes. Point to the menu. Eat whatever your finger lands on. Be amazed. Thank me later."}
{"text":"The chicken is the truth, so are the donuts! I'm gonna tell you, there's sauce available, but you don't need it!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Small quantity and a bit high in price. Try the maple bacon doughnut!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a cheat day! The proportions are perfectly sized and donuts for dessert is a \"hell yeah!\" every single time."}
{"text":"Not impressed!! Spent $13.68 for one piece of chicken a cup of dipping sauce a tablespoon of funky coleslaw and a dried up donut..  Place is small, not very clean and played loud music that also sucked... I would probably never come back. The only plus was that the person serving me was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Lucky for me, I only judge food AFTER I've tried it. Been reading and hearing about this place...with their anomaly combo of fried chicken with a donut. What the...?  But I love food so here we are.  I went with the consensus and ordered the most popular menu item. Thigh and drum combo, Thai Yum slaw and sauce on the side. I'll start with the sauce. I tried both the Japanese BBQ and Korean Chili. Hands down- the Japanese BBQ won for its flavor alone. The Korean Chili is a bit spicy yet tart and lacking flavor, leaves a strange aftertaste in the mouth. The Thai slaw- not the taste I was expecting but actually quite refreshing. I tasted mint in there. Normally not a mint fan but it works. Tasty! I'd eat it again. The cake donut- ok. So I'm a sauce & condiment kind of person. I like my donuts frosted, fries with ketchup, chicken strips with 4 different sauces, etc.! BUT again I wanted to try this as everyone before me so thoughtfully recommended. So I ordered and ate the plain cake donut with the chicken. Heavenly. I will never judge a plain donut again, unless it doesn't taste like this one did. Simply delicious. Soft, fluffy on the inside, perfect golden crust on the outside. Alas, we mustn't forget the chicken! Everything I wasn't expecting and better. Getting it unsauced is the way to go. Alone, it's crispy, flavorful and so juicy! I think if you ordered with sauce, it wouldn't be as crispy and that'd be a shame. If I had 10 pieces in front of me, I would've eaten all of them with no regret. Dipped into the Japanese BBQ, I've now entered to a new dimension. This place isn't close to me house but you can bet your big booty that I'll be back!   P.S.- so because I'm a glutton, I ordered a maple bacon donut for the drive home. Hot damn, kid!!! That is one delicious donut! So fluffy soft inside and that frosting is to die for. Its huge and can be shared. Unless you're slothy like me."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype is about. I love gourmet desserts and after my horror story with Rollover Doughnuts, I decided to try Welcome Chicken + Donuts. I got the cinnamon cardamom, the rainbow sprinkle, and the lemon maple, since they didn't have any other remarkable flavors. They tasted pretty much the same as if I'd bought them at any old cheap doughnut shop, but they were about $2 apiece."}
{"text":"The Korean chili sauce is good... The chicken would be good if they would cook the chicken right. We saw previous reviews of this place serving raw chicken, so the first thing I did was cut into the thigh and dark red juices start gushing out and the chicken is raw. My fiance's chicken thigh was also raw. I took them back and the cook had the nerve to say that the blood is from the broken bone of the chicken. First of all... I don't see any broken bones on my chicken and I've had enough chicken I my life to know that this isn't safe to eat but he reassured me it was. They made a new batch for us and the new ones looked better than our first ones but still really pink. Their donuts weren't anything to rave over, we got the PB and the red wine and they were eh. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The chicken was perfectly cooked. The Korean chili sauce added a whole new dimension to the chicken pieces. The variety of donuts ranges from savory bacon to red wine and chocolate. Saving the best for last, we have amazingly delicious ramen with char siu pork. The chicken salad with kimchi vinaigrette was refreshing and light with a little kick from the kimchi. The staff was extremely friendly.  Creativity: A+ Food: Amazing Service: Exellent **A triple threats**"}
{"text":"I went to a *very* exclusive party over the weekend.    A fried chicken + donut party...in my mouth.  I could dig out a thesaurus and use numerous nifty adjectives to describe their perfectly cooked fried chicken and melt in your mouth donuts, but instead I'll just repeat what numerous other Yelpers have already said; the chicken and donuts are phenomenal.    You really have to find out what the hype is for yourself.  You can score you own mouth-party invitation by popping over to Welcome Chicken + Donuts for lunch today.  (Oh, and you're welcome.)"}
{"text":"Being a cookie kind of girl and skeptical in general of \"Best Of\" food lists I smiled and thanked politely when tons of people talked and wrote about this place. I silently smiled when my friends asked, \"Have you been to WCAD?\" \"Not yet\" was my polite response. I was really thinking, \"Ummm, no, and I never will.\" I peacefully read article after article and Best Of lists that hailed their almighty Key Lime Donut. Nope, not going unless they have cookies. I silently doubted all the claims. However, when my Foodie friends starting talking I sat up and took notice. I jotted it down on my Spring Break, local Staycation food tour list.   Cookie monster was busy today so I dragged my rear out of bed on the second day of Spring break and drove the 15 miles or so to get there. Okay, I had errands in the area. You'll never know, wink! I might or might not drive many miles for good food in Az. I'm not telling.    Well, forget the donuts. Let me tell you, the one piece Chicken breast combo with Thai Slaw and sauce number 1 was freaking, seriously delish!  Holy Heck, (chicken)  in a hand ( cardboard) basket! Get that, okay?  \"The donuts?\" you ask, \"How were the donuts?\" Well here is how that went. I bought a half dozen of the upgraded donuts. I got their signature Key Lime Pie one of course. I wanted to try the Irish Bomber and Chocolate Almond one but they were sold out. Insert sad face. Happy face come back.  The very lovely lady behind the counter threw in a red wine covered something or another as a recommendation, and I ordered a chocolate and an Arnold Palmer Thai Lemonade to boot.  They cost me a weeks paycheck though. Seriously $12.50 for 6 donuts, ouch! I spent my entire spring break food allowance. Sigh! After all was said and done I might or might not be a donut convert, just saying. Sorry Cookie Monster I have a new BFF!  But here is the interesting part I honestly thought just the plain cake donut they gave free with the meal was way better than the upgraded donuts. It tasted better and was free with a meal. You can tell the quality of the donut without all the goodies and stuff on on it. So surprisingly I liked the food here better than the desserts.   By the way, they have one of the best cups of coffee I have had in Phoenix. Just a regular Joe please. So hard to find in Phoenix.  Finally, the staff members are super nice too. And those errands you ask?  Well, never happened because now that it is 90 degrees in March I couldn't let the leftovers spoil, now could I?"}
{"text":"Chicken and Donuts. If those two together don't intrigue your inner fatty, I don't what will. I drive by this place daily on my way to work and It has constantly resignated with me. So today I finally decided to satisfiy my curiosity. I walked in. Immediately, I noticed a comfortable delight carried by the local patrons that frequent this establishment.  I gazed upon the menu to both grasp the mystique of this locale and to see what I wanted to eat. They have a simple variety of items to choose from. Their is a bevy of donuts to choose. Interesting choices such as maple bacon to your traditional favorites; such as chocolate, maple, and glaze. Then theres the chicken. You can order chicken with three different flavors. I happened to choose the spicy thai. A personal favorite but theirs other choices. They also have sandwiches and side items to choose from.  Verdict. The donut was great. Very fresh and contained a myriad of flavors. The chicken was plentiful. The batter was tasty and the meat thick. The flavor of the spicy thai was outstanding. All in all the food was very good. They also have coffee on tap, which I found as a classic revival.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out if your ever close by."}
{"text":"This place is great. It has been on my list to try for a while and I got a chance over the summer. I got the ramien which was delicious and the hubby got the chicken and donut which he loved. We each got an additional donut to start with and they were great. The place is very cute and service was great. Looking forward to making a trip to the Diner soon"}
{"text":"Small place with 6 tables inside and a good size patio outside.  Had the Thigh and Drumstick Combo in the Vietnamese Herb Sauce garlic fish sauce and cilantro, with the Stir Fry corn onion bell pepper in miso sauce along with the Maple Bacon and Classic Chocolate Donut  Batter/Crust by itself is good enough to eat without the sauce, the Vietnamese Herb Sauce is very fishy tasting and kind of a turn off.  Have been wanting to try this place for sometime because of the hype with media and Yelp, definitely did not live up to expectations with both the chicken and donuts."}
{"text":"Location: I think this restaurant just opened up not too long ago and it used to be a church. It is located at a busy business district. The place is a bit small with total of 6 tables max inside the place. If you have a big party, get ready to sit outdoor. It isn't very well decorated and a bit old. However, I am there for the food and the place is relatively clean.   Service: this is not a sit in restaurant with your own server. Therefore, I can only rate the service of staffs who work over the counter.They are very smiley and friendly. If you are obviously a first timer, they definitely take the time to explain each flavor they have to offer. It takes between 5-10 minutes for your order to be ready. Weather you are dining in or taking it to go, it is super convenient.    Food: We wanted to order chicken wings and unfortunately it was all sold out by 12pm. I ended up ordering 2 pieces of chicken combo with Korean chilli favor and cucumber as a side. When my food finally arrived, it came in a small neat looking box and a donut. Oh man! The chicken falls off the bones and the chicken skin is sooooo flavorable. The cucumber side dish was a bit salty. I probably wouldn't recommend it. The donut is not too sweet and it just a perfect way to end the meal.   I cannot wait to go back there again to try different types of donuts and maybe a taste of their chicken wings."}
{"text":"On the most unassuming, industrial street intersection sits the most interesting restaurant in Phoenix.  Why so?  Well, where else can you get crispy fried chicken, donuts and ramen?  Where else might you find a restaurant with that type of variety... I'll wait...   Buhler?    Don't go here thinking you'll have Southern Fried chicken that is usually heavier flour and more seasoned.  This chicken is Korean Fried, which means it is \"twice fried\" with a very light batter that is almost tempura-like, but not quiet.  The chicken is served with (or tossed in) Asian inspired sauces.  I ordered a 2 piece chicken with the Korean Chili.  Since I got the combo, I could have a salad and donut with it.  I opted for a Sprinkle donut.  I also had a the very good cucumber salad.    Return FActor :80%"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check this place out forever.  Welcome Diner is one of my fave spots so I had no doubt this would be great too.  I went specifically for the ramen that they make on the weekends.  It did not disappoint.  The home made pork bone broth is nothing short of amazing with a great depth of flavor/umami.  We also tried the chicken with the Vietnamese sauce.  I loved the sauce and can't believe how super crunchy and crispy they get the outside of the chicken while maintaining a perfectly juicy inside.  Will definitely go back and will try to get there a little earlier to take advantage of a larger selection of donuts.  The service was also great.  Super friendly.  Great job on all fronts.  :-)"}
{"text":"If you love donuts, this should be your first stop after arriving at the airport!  I wish we could have tried the chicken because it looked amazing, but were 30 minutes too early."}
