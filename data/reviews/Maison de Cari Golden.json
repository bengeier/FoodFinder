{"text":"The place atmosphere is dark and depressing. We waited 45 mins for our food, only 2 other table were occupied not busy at all! Service was bad, poor manners! And the food was the worse food I ever had in a restaurant. Very greasy, over cooked and not clean!"}
{"text":"Experience was beyond subpar. Food took an hour to arrive to the table. Some dishes were warm, while others were cool. Saag paneer tasted like frozen spinach mixed with Saputo mini bocconcini. Butter chicken was a putrid yellow colour and the kitchen must have their own direct pipeline into the Redpath sugar plant because one bite of the sauce gave me immediate cavities. The waiter forgot to bring items but remembered to try and bill us for them. The one positive is that the naan was warm and fairly chewy. Normally, I'll try a restaurant at least twice before passing judgement. However, after my first experience at Golden I'm not sure if that second chance will ever come. Hence, the lowest i can give is 2 stars."}
{"text":"Tiny place but packs a big punch. Great food, although a tad pricy. My girlfriend, who apparently is a professional rater of Indian food, says this place is hands-down the best in the city. I think La Lumiere de L'Inde is a bit better (and cheaper) but I DO think it's excellent."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food I had in my life ...
You can taste that the oil they use is old.
Just disgusting ...
Very overpriced which is not explained either by the bad quality of the food and the horrible atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Cheap? Absolutely? Good? Well...not so much. Pretty bland. The flavors ran together and everything was overcooked. Maitre d' and waiter hovered over us the entire time in an effort to shuttle us out. Also, the naan is heavily sweetened. Some folks like that. Me? Not so much. Maybe I'll try it again, but I doubt it.  

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Awful. Used to be good decades ago. Now they just don't try. Every other Indian restaurant on this street is better. They use bad ingredients. One of the vegetable pakoras was actually rotten. Everything was limp and lifeless and the flavors were one dimensional. Even the naan was dry. It must have been from the day before."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible delivery service. 1h45 for two dishes a soup and a couple of sides. Food was cold and not the first time it happened but is the last. Its too bad because the culinary ability is decent. Much better places overall in Parc Ex"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order from this place all the time. We usually order the exact same thing; butter chicken, lamb curry and eggplant. Sometimes the food is good, but lately, the quality is hit or miss. We ordered those three dishes last night and were extremely disappointed, it was the last time we will be ordering from this joint."}
{"text":"Un super bon resto indien sur St-Laurent, qui ne paie pas de mine, ou les plats sont vraiment bons et copieux, et ont l'air typiques!
Service rapide
Prix raisonnables
Déco assez basique, c'est pas le meilleur endroit pour une date, bref on va là-bas pour la bouffe!
Metro le plus proche: Laurier; sinon ya le bus (45 je crois?) sur St Laurent
A essayer! :)"}
{"text":"This place is tiny and adorable and I love going there.
The food is really good, but always a little bit sweet for my taste. Even the naan tasted sweet once. But I still love it..."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!

One of my favourite Indian Places to get takeout! They make my favourite of all time onion bhajis with a special yoghurt base sauce. 

I also always order the naan bread and papadum.

I usually get either the chicken tandoori, butter chicken, lamb korma, and /or rices. Their butter chicken is a bit too sweet for me but it's ok to share.

It's always so delicious here, love love love it!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten inside. This is only for take out.

I LOVE this place. Very good shrimp, spices and butter chicken! Is relatively expensive, but the food lasts me and my boyfriend about two to three days. The curry is good and the owner is very nice."}
{"text":"Great little indian restaurant with a fairly extensive menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ahh la cuisine indienne.. je n'y vais pas je cours !

J'ai adoré le plat que j'ai pris (poulet tadoori) d'ailleurs c'est un classique quand je mange au restau indien. Le plat était épicé mais modéré enfin pour moi car mes amis ont pris d'autres plats plus spicy. Un conseil demander conseil avant de faire votre choix !

Je dirai que j'ai qu'un seul regret : qu'il n'y ai pas de cheese naan. Pas de panique pour les amoureux de naan, il y en a tout de même des classiques :-)"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends. There's nothing wow about this place. The food is pretty average. Nothing special at all. I'd rather spend 3 bucks and take a bus  to Park & Jean Talon and get some tasty & not too pricey Indian food. 

Food : Meh
Service :Meh
Ambiance : Meh
Worth the price : Neh"}
{"text":"Best Indian resto in the Plateau /Mile End! I went there fir years when I lived in Montreal and always go back when I return to the city. Also, one night when I forgot my computer bag at 10:45pm and never realized it until 11:15pm (15 minutes after they closed), the gentleman was nice enough to open up again after I knocked on the door! He kept it stored in a safe place because he wasn't sure when I was coming back! I gave him the biggest hug ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oubliez le service avec un sourire. Ici, ce qui compte, c'est la saveur des plats!"}
{"text":"This restaurant knows how to turn plain old rice into something addictive. I'm talking about their palao rice, which is an exquisite melange of subtly fragrant spices and roasted onions. It is the perfect complement to their tasty and flavourful curries. Aaahhh... the wonderful butter chicken that melted in my mouth without a fight! My dinner companion had the lamb tandoori, which was more than sufficiently spicy and definitely delicious. Indian restaurants are easy to come by, but good ones like this tiny `hole in the wall` are not."}
