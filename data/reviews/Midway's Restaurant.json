{"text":"Midway Restaurant is one of the best Greek Family owned diners I've ever been to. The breakfast and lunch meals are all so tasty! You get so much good food for a really decent price!!!  The service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Went here specifically for the 5 stars. Although the food was good I guess I had certain expectations for 5 stars. This is a standard diner with standard prices. Located in an industrialized area it really has that \"Cheers\" type feeling where everyone knows everyone."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem of a place this is. Went for lunch and had the open roast beef sandwich with fries and veggies. What a fantastic meal with good portions. The wait staff were very friendly. The food did come out a little slow. I will most definitely be back"}
