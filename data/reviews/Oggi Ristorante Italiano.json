{"text":"This place is even better then ever.  Miami brought to the NC...music is above and beyond...You all should get acquainted and try the atmosphere and food.  They are new to NC and deserve your attendance !! Guaranteed to have a great time......"}
{"text":"Really cool decor inside. Stopped in after an event near by.  Food was decent. Some dishes are a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"I worked with Melanie and Ivan to plan a surprise retirement dinner party for my wife for 19 people. They did an outstanding job helping me organize a great event with customized menus with my wife's name on them. Our server was excellent along with the staff that worked out table. The food was excellent and I would highly recommend Oggi to people that love Italian food. I started with \"plenty\" of Calamari which was very good. I also enjoyed the Crabmeat Ravioli which was outstanding."}
{"text":"Super great service, attentive staff and very quick wait time for seating and for food. Perfect place to swing in for a bite to each before a concert at the filmore next door. Good small plates, recommend the crab ravioli and eggplant Parmesan"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and had a fantastic experience. Started out with the calamari, which was done to perfection! The bread was perfectly crusty and had a fantastic flavor.  I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli in white cream sauce and my date had, I think, chicken scallopini. We were both very pleased with our respective dishes. The quality of the food for the price was also excellent.   The service was phenomenal-- the waiter was attentive, but not overbearing. The owner stopped by to check on us as well. Finally, they delivered a little birthday treat of flan with  dulce de leche ice cream. Now, I am not the world's biggest fan of flan, but it paired PERFECTLY with the ice cream and was delectable!   The interior is beautiful and the seats were comfortable. There does appear to be some left over cow-hide on the walls from the prior establishment, but it doesn't really take away from the overall feel. The only thing I could possibly recommend is slightly larger two-top tables.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Try the lasagna or chicken piccata; you will not leave disappointed. Delicious food and excellent service. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! Food was delicious and service was outstanding! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"While the food is good and the ambiance is trendy, overall it isn't worth it. We had a large party with a reservation made well in advance. The week before we arrived the manager called to ask if we could be out in 2.5 hours because they \"were booked.\" Rushing people before they even get there is not a good start; especially when we arrive to find an empty restaurant.   The service started out great as they divided our table among two servers who were both very attentive (at first).  Drinks seemed to come in a timely manner and appetizers came out at a good pace as well. The only flaw in ordering was that we still had giant menus (with the old restaurant name on them) in front of us when our first course arrived.   Once we ordered our entrees it took forever for them to arrive; with one half of our table being almost done with their food before the other half's food arrived. While the food was good it was an awkward situation watching half of the table eat while the rest of us tried to make conversation as we waited for our food.   Let's talk about dessert; or should I say the order we cancelled because it took over 45 minutes for it to not show up before we gave up.   Then paying the bill, I don't recommend using cash here as they can't even make change for a $20 bill. Instead of admitting the issue to us the server quite literally did everything in his power to ignore the table, even going so far as to use a side do to walk around us. If he had simply made us aware of the situation we could have easily paid with a credit card.   When we asked for a manager to see what was happening he could only repeat \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry,\" without offering any way to rectify the situation.   One last negative moment, the drunken fools in the bar who then spilled into the restroom. As I was using the restroom two visibly intoxicated customers stumbled in, a man and a woman, with the guy asking others in the restroom to \"watch my girl she's too drunk.\" We ran into them again as leaving, ordering more drinks from the bar.   On a positive note, the hostess was wonderful. She was very pleasant and accommodating when we asked her to take a group photo of everyone with the birthday girl."}
{"text":"Stopped by after an event at the music factory.  Great atmosphere and drinks.  The food was excellent."}
{"text":"I was here recently and had a truly unbelievable experience.    It took 45 minutes to get a simple drink I ordered.  My boyfriend found out 30 minutes after he ordered his beer that they did't have it.  I found out an hour into my seating that the kitchen was out of one of my dishes!!    Where is the miscommunication?  Why doesn't the server know what beers the bar has and why doesn't the kitchen let the servers know what they are out of?  The restaurant was only half empty and there was one bartender.  I am not sure what was going on.    It should have been an easy regular meal at this very pretty restaurant and instead we were waiting for Godot.  Spoiler alert - he never arrives.  Just like this excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a group. Overall, we were really impressed with Oggi. All the pastas are made in house and you can tell in the taste. My dish (linguine with mussels) was excellent! Everything was super fresh and flavorful.   The decorations are way over the top. (Do yourselves a favor and look up at the ceiling fans for a chuckle.) And, service was a little on the slow side. I'm torn even mentioning this... If we had been in for dinner, I would probably have loved the slowness, allowing us to linger over good food with good company. But, as a \"business lunch\" it didn't work.   Moral of this story, I'll be back for sure! Probably for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Give me all the calamari and bocconcino emiliana! Both were so good that we ended up ordering them twice. The GM, Ivan, and our server, Matt, showed us some of the best service we've seen in Charlotte. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time, and I eat out everyday. The staff was overly attentive and went the extra mile. The food was great and the drinks were awesome! Definitely a must go to before any event at the music factory!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the lunch service is so slow. This place is great! More people should consider this as a lunch spot. The food is DELICIOUS and wonderfully priced.   A group of coworkers and I went and there was more than enough room for all of us. The waiter was great. I got the gnocchi and the plate was so large (for $9!) I have leftovers for later. The sauce is homemade and yum!   Basically. Come and enjoy lunch here!"}
{"text":"Formerly known as Osso (still on the menu covers), OGGI is basically the same restaurant. First time here in a long time. They had great service for our party of 20 and even gave complimentary croquettes. I had fried calamari, which was decent. They have really great drinks and I recommend the raspberry mint martini. Fair amount of alcohol in these. The crab ravioli was okay, but nothing to write home about. Best dish was the lasagna, which I will order the next time I go. Great job serving a large group."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, service, food and ambiance. Not to be missed . Best Italian and drinks in the city!  Don't miss this treasure ! Mussels sambucca is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of for adults and three children. Our server Ivan was AMAZING, he was engaging and knew the menu. Visiting from the Tri state area, and my husband being of Italian descent I must admit we approached this restaurant was a bit of hesitation that they would deliver the caliber of dishes we are accustomed to..but boy were we pleasantly surprised.  Everything from the eggplant parm to the chicken Milanese to the tiramisu was spot on delicious! Their drinks were delicious and the kids menu had variety for those picky and non picky eaters.  One of the members of our party is gluten intolerant and they were extremely accommodating to her needs, checking everything and suggesting alternatives when an item had gluten.  I would recommend this restaurant to individuals with gluten intolerance, families, singles or groups. Fantastic food, excellent service and great ambiance!"}
