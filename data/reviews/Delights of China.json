{"text":"Always have the best food from here!  Such a gem for Chinese in the city.  Fresh ingredients and amazing portions!  Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"We had Cantonese Chow Mein, Soup and other dishes there, really gave us a big surprise, lots of toppings and tasted so goodwe are happy to have a Chinese restaurant nearby our place.Ps: they have lobsters, we may try next time. wowwww"}
{"text":"Clean decor, fast friendly service, good food with good portions in BWV. Heard the people at the next table also enjoying their meal. It's hidden in the plaza beside no frills but be sure to check it out. They also have a lobster meal special which normally you can only find downtown or north York."}
{"text":"If you have an allergy beware: we just spent 5 hours in the ER!    Went to DofC today at lunchtime to try the Dim Sum. My husband (who has a shellfish allergy) asked which Dim Sum items had shrimp in them and told the server specifically that he has an allergy and cannot eat them. She told us that the items we selected were fine and did not contain any seafood.  Turns out the SPINACH DUMPLINGS we ordered were actually filled with big hunks of shrimp! We only realized this after my husband ate one, based on the server's menu recommendation.  The server apologized to me (not my husband, the one who actually has the allergy) and gave us 50% off the lunch bill.  I guess that was supposed to have covered the cost of the ASAP taxi home in the middle of the meal to get the antihistamines, the further cost of the 911 ambulance fee when those didn't work and his throat started swelling closed, the time/misery he spent in the hospital getting shots and on the IV and heart/breathing monitors, plus the follow-up cost of the Epi-pen the ER said he needs to make sure something like this never happens again...oh and potentially the price of his life?   Look, I don't expect a server to necessarily know 100% what every, single,  ingredient on a menu might be: but it is okay to say \"I'm not sure.\"  If we thought there was even a chance this would happen we wouldn't have ordered the spinach dumplings: but we were assured they did NOT contain shrimp.   However I DO expect a server to tell the cook if someone does have an allergy so they don't bring back a supposed vegetable dish from the kitchen that is actually filled with huge hunks of seafood specified as an allergen!  I can't even excuse this as some kind of a \"rush\"  mix up because there was only one other table with 3 customers at it in the place and they didn't order any dumplings.   This was our first and last visit to this place: obviously."}
{"text":"Kind of hidden - in a small strip mall next door to a No Frills. Well worth hunting down. Have been there a number of times and have never been disappointed. Great food, good service, kinda nice decor. Check it out - you will love it."}
{"text":"I ordered from here last night and it was EXCELLENT! I was so impressed with their flavourful and tasty dishes.     I ordered shanghai noodles (tons of flavour) and general Tao chicken, won ton soup.  The general tao chicken was crispy, and not soaking in wet sauce that would make it soggy. It was amazing!   The deliver was very quick, prob 25 min max, when we were told 45 min. That's always a BONUS.     I will be going back for sure.  5/5 stars"}
{"text":"So the restaurant and 30 quite small and only has a few tables but most people here have been coming for takeout and delivery. The prices are a lot more reasonable for take out verses for those who are eating here. The food is good but a little inconsistent. I got some kung pao chicken and it only comes with vegetables no rice no soup or anything. That's so weird to me because how else are you supposed to eat it with a fork? The Kung pao didn't taste like kung pao but more like an incredibly spicy chili chicken. Even after I got clarification that it was going to be fried and breaded when it came out it wasn't breaded. It was so incredibly spicy that I couldn't taste the food I could only feel the space on my tongue and I had to switch meals with my husband.  My husband got the general tsos chicken and that was a lot better and it was actually quite tasty and the price was good! That was on the daily special menu and also a free egg roll and included rice. Mine Didn't include rice, or egg roll or anything and wasn't that good but the portion was a tiny bit bigger.   I feel like places like this nickel and dime you and that's definitely a deterrent for me to ever want to come back and try it again. My experience was not bad but I was sitting in the restaurant and both of their doors were open blowing cold wind inside. I think they had this open for those delivery ppl from skip the dishes and door dash. While I understand that I also feel like it's completely inconvenient and senseless to have the door open blowing cold wind inside of your restaurant.  At the end of the day our 2 person meal  came out to $31 which is ridiculous because we could've gone somewhere else to eat where we wouldn't have been nickel and dimed for two basic small entrees."}
{"text":"Had the orange beef and it was delicious. Not to much batter, the sauce came separate so it was very crispy.  As appetizer we had the spring roll and the egg Rolle which were equally delicious.   Strongly recommend this place.  The only good Chinese restaurant in the area as far as I know."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but would like to more. Service was very poor, probably one of the worst I've ever been to and I frequent restaurants and new ones too. Server looked annoyed and didn't want to be there, we were also the only table there for a Friday night. Second server was also terrible, barely said a word to us throughout our time there and I don't care to make conversation but even when ordering, things we needed and just not knowing how to be polite.  Food was mediocre, it is more of a westernized Chinese restaurant so if your looking for something more authentic try somewhere else. We had the Szechuan noodles, beef with black beans and vegetables, hot and sour soup, fried calamari and seafood mix with vegetables, best thing was the Szechuan noodles.    Side note, ate in China town the next day and both food and service was exponentially better. Will also most likely try this place another time, getting take out of course."}
{"text":"This little gem took over the spot immediately next to No Frills in Bloor West Village. We've only been once so far...but we'll be back to sample more of the menu.   Tonight, we had crispy ginger beef (and the sauce comes on the side). Tasty, tender, and with bits of ginger in the very light breading. Recommended. We also had Szechuan noodles, which were excellent, with enough variation in the spicing that each bite tasted different from the last.   Clearly family owned and operated, this is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"A good North American Chinese restaurant has been sorely lacking in the neighbourhood. Upon arrival I immediately heard the reassuring noise of a jet engine coming out of the kitchen. A roaring hot wok is always a good sign. First time here so I had an old standby, General Tso's chicken. Very easy to screw up so a good metric to judge by. When it arrived first thing I smelled was vinegar, another good sign. Not too sweet, great balance. Chicken very crispy with a light coating of batter and sauce, vegetable were firm. Egg rolls and spring rolls were great, tasted like they were made in house. Tried some of my wife's food, equally good. Next time will be more adventurous and try one of their seafood dishes. Bravo, please maintain and I will be sure to return."}
