{"text":"The phrase \"Never judge a book by its cover\" was most probably adapted from \"Never judge a restaurant by its appearance\" which I'm almost certain was born here.  This place could easily be mistaken for a motel, or maybe even a crusty casino. It's TACKY AS ALL HELL. It's got one of those retro lookin' neon yellow (the ugliest shade you could imagine) brightly lit signs. Ones you imagine would read \"SUNSHINE MOTEL\" or \"DAISY INN\" Idfk why that's what I see in my head lol. My first impression was [wtf, omg, I'm getting e. coli poisoning tonight. Google lied to me about this place]. You could easily place old men in Hawaiian shirts, socks & sandals, and beer bellies in this scenery, only to walk in and have the right hand of god smack you right quick for your foul judging. I know I was; felt that backhand right up my backside. Their WALLS ON WALLS, SHELVES ON SHELVES, CABINETS ON CABINETS, STACKS ON STACKS of alcohol was I M PR E S S I V E. Some bottles, I've never even heard of. Then they pull out some next religion on you. Grape religion. Y'heard? DAT WINE BIBLE DOEEE. THEY HAVE A WINE BIBLE. Shit was bigger than Justin Bieber's ego. Unheard of, right? Weighed about the same as I did. Looked like a book out the Hogwart's library. I unfortunately didn't bother with it, it was overwhelming at the time. Anyways, just in case you need recommendations and have the desire to discuss pairings and the selection of wines that they offer, they have a sommelier on staff, why wouldn't they. I don't know that the price is right though. The quality of the food vs. the value is debatable. Neither my date nor I were able to finish our meals (not due to an excess in quantity, the portions are fairly tiny). I initially thought the restaurant was empty and business was terrible. They shafted us to the front corner of the restaurant. Completely isolated from the rest of society. I later learned that the restaurant was much larger than it had initially appeared (this place just keeps playin' me), I went to use the bathroom at the back of the restaurant, where the concentration of patrons were. I smiled. I was happy to realize the considerateness of the hostess and careful thought put into strategically placing us apart from the boisterous larger crowds. They saw we were a pair, deduced we were on a date, and gave us privacy. Attention to detail is something I can appreciate. I don't think I've ever tipped so generously in my life. Either that, or it was a coincidental fluke and they're totally getting credit for something I surmised in my head all on my own lol. Either way, the service was memorable, and the food was appetizing. Though it fell short of my expectations, it was not disappointing."}
{"text":"Via Allegro is the restaurant I went to on my first date with my now husband..so yes there is a soft spot in my heart for it..however let me tell you the other amazing things about this place..  I've eaten here a few times over the years.  The bread they bring out comes in a variety of breads with a hummus dip..yum, easy to fill up on this alone.  The steaks are delish.   The mushroom soup is a specialty you must absolutely try!  the Napolitan Trio is passable, I've made better breciole at home on a Sunday morning..and it's a plate that is not worth it's cost in my eyes..so skip it..  Desserts..the Crème Brule..it was my first date dessert and is still memorable!  there was a passionfruit / mango cheesecake that I tried there too..but it was a little too tart for my liking.   The entrees (steaks) come with nice sides like quiche, which makes a nice presentation.  Wine list is impeccable. Lots of great wines that you won't get at the LCBO.  Between courses they bring out a gelato aperitif to clean the palate. - Details are taken care of!  Also, you do not have to trek all the way downtown to get here..which is nice!  If you know someone that has not been here, and you're not close to downtown Toronto, bring them here..it makes a nice first impression!"}
{"text":"I am not going to rabbit on it's a quick and dirty review. Don't let the location fool you, Via Allegro is great. The food is fantastic and so is their wine list. They also have an extensive selection of Scotch as well.   The servers are excellent and really go out of their way. Just be prepared to spend a few bucks here. It's not at all on the inexpensive side but it is well worth the price."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant but I was very disappointed. I don't have a problem paying top prices for food that's well prepared and delicious coupled with great service but this place just didn't hit the mark.  We were a large group of nine people and the majority of us just felt that the experience was lack luster. Two of us had the Steak Frites - the dish description said that the frites were gnocchi (cut to look like fries) and the steak was actually beef short ribs slowly cooked. The meat was pretty good but the whole dish was lukewarm. Both of us had to send back the gnocchi fries because they were cold, chewy and inedible. It was almost like they had been reheated several times. The waiter promised some fingering potatoes in their place but by the time they arrived the rest of the meal was cold. One person had the risotto sud, she said it was just ok, and another had a pasta dish which he said was ruined by the amount of cheese the waiter dished out over the pasta. A few of the others had the fish special and they enjoyed it. Someone in our party ordered a gin martini (he went into to great detail with the waiter about how he felt a real martini was made with gin and specified gin; he was served a vodka martini. Although he was brought a replacement I feel like it's the small attention to detail ie.listening to your guests, that makes the service exceptional. I felt that our waiter paid better attention to the men at our table than he did with the women. At the end of our meal a few of our party left and the rest of us decided to stay for another drink. Once the men placed their orders the waiter walked right by the ladies without asking if we'd also like to order something. He wouldn't have stopped unless one of the ladies said, \"Hey, you didn't ask us if we wanted anything!\" On another note, this restaurant does not accept debit which I find completely strange. We also asked for separate checks when we arrived and we were told that they couldn't accommodate that request because their systems were not able to handle multiple checks for one table. Really? I'm pretty sure they just didn't want to, maybe something to do with adding on the 20% tip when there's a large group. Not a pleasant experience and who really wants to sift through a large bill and sort out who had what to figure out what each person owes at the end of a meal? And yes, they have a giant wine menu but how appropriate is that when the food is just sub-par? Again, I'm not afraid to pay higher prices when the food and service warrant it but this restaurant just didn't live up to what we were expecting"}
{"text":"Unexpected ambiance - great for special occasions & date nights! The most extensive wine list ever!! The type of old fashioned wait service you just don't see anymore. The menu isn't your standard Italian fare (duck, rabbit, lamb prepared 2-ways etc.). Everything's deliciously gourmet!   If you're tired of the standard & you want an upgrade - give this place a go."}
{"text":"i've been going to this restaurant for about 8yrs the food is to die for fish steaks i have taken several of my friends they have all enjoyed it---if you have not been there you are really missing out"}
{"text":"The first time we came here a couple of months ago the service and food was great. Came here today and waited to be seated in an almost empty restaurant..we waited awhile even though we made eye contact with multiple people working there. We finally sat ourselves down.  The Caesar salad was yummy The 4 cheese gnocchi was average The Alfredo pasta my husband added chicken to was good, except for the fact that the chicken was dry and when he told our waiter it was like he did not know what to do. He brought extra sauce at my husbands request but they charged us for the chicken anyways!!! 6.95 add to Alfredo pasta (21.95)."}
{"text":"The food was delicious the service was fantastic but the wine list was a little intimidating I would recommend this place I'm in Italian heaven"}
{"text":"Only thing I can say is that this was one of the best restaurants in Toronto. They kept playing with the lighting. Never clued in that it was due to Earth Hour. Place was fun with hardly any light. Especially in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"The seafood linguine pasta is super salty to the point that its unedible.  For the price you pay, you expect it to be good."}
{"text":"Via Allegro is one of the best restaurants that I have eaten at. Everything, and I mean everything, was melt in your mouth delicious.  I was there in a group of eight and they were very accommodating when that afternoon we had to move the reservation back an hour.   When we arrived they seated up promptly and were very friendly. The Service was excellent and they gave us some great suggestions for wine pairing. There is a ridiculously giant wine selection.   Dinner was fantastic. Between the eight of us we ordered a good portion of the menu and I tasted it all. Everything was flavourful and prepared perfectly. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!   Special note for the ladies: They give you a little ottoman beside your chair to rest your bag on. No trying to figure out where to hang it, nice touch."}
{"text":"I had a business dinner here recently. It is a large, outdated resto with a few gimmicks to keep you going. They have MASSIVE pepper grinders, and a WINE-LIST that mirrors the yellow pages.  They fail to deliver."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance and very attentive, sweet service. (Doesn't hover over you but there if needed.) The food is divine - we had the pizza and the risotto. Family feel to the restaurant. Anyone who compares it to downtown grub, I don't think it's trying to compete with it - it's a quaint suburban spot that's in a league of its own."}
{"text":"Via Allegro Restaurante is fine dining, Italian quinine, in Etobicoke, across from Sherway Gardens Amazing Italian Entres, huge Italian wine selection, and quaint atmosphere! I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to experience fine Italian cuisine! Pricey, but wort it! No, that's not what I had, but that's on the internet; I can't remember what it was, but it was delicious, combined with a glass of red wine, and a rum and coke and 12 other friends, making it a great night out!!"}
{"text":"One of my best restaurant experiences in Toronto!  We went to Allegros because of all the hype we heard from a lot of people. When you park in front of it your expectations kind of drop... the entrance is in between a Staples and a Tim Horton's... once you go passed the doors you forget all about that! The ambiance is lovely and rafined and very Italian! The menu is a bit pricy but it's worth it. We heard a lot about their risotto and boy, we were not dissapointed. We were even treated to some wine tasting by the house sommelier (on the house) and also, since it was my birthday, they also brought some lovely chocolate cake on the house. I would recommend this place to anyone for an absolutely lovely dinner experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food, large selection wine and other spirits, warm and inviting atmosphere and amazing service. Costly but worth the experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food. This isn't just about food not tasting great for the menu prices. There are actual dishes that just do not work. Monk fish wrapped in prosciutto? Duck risotto with a silver dollar sized duck portion and raisins? OVERLOAD of salt. Inedible because of salt. Forgetting to put on the side sauce that is mentioned on the menu. Taking 30 minutes between courses for a table of 4 adults. Not even setting up a table for the right number of people (4 adults, 1 kid, 1 toddler - we were led to a 4-top). And who cares about the 4 inch thick wine menu. Also wouldn't hurt to have white linens and better cutlery for the restaurant that tries to be \"something\"."}
{"text":"The food here is great although pricy.  I ordered the Seafood spaghatinni and it was delicious.    My wife had the pizza and she loved it.  The Tiramasu is a pass and although fresh it was not sweet at all, not sure what marscapone they are using.  Imagine being a diabetic and ordering a desert that doesn't have sugar.  I would go there again but would try the cheesecake instead."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about this place and was very excited to try it. It is in a strip mall - right next to a staples. In fact the lit up sign shows \"egro\" as all the letters have burnt out. The interiors reminded me of those old steakhouses in NYC made infamous with mafia history.  The place is noisy and bustling and the staff, although super efficient were a little cold. The food was good. We ordered the carpaccio to share and it arrived in under 5 mins. The wine list is very impressive and we selected a great Pinot noir from Italy. For mains I ordered the platinum risotto and my SO ordered the veal and tiger shrimps. His risotto was excellent but mine was definitely over seasoned. The tiramisu was great too. A good meal - interesting environment but not worth the driving effort. Ther are several places that can trump via all"}
{"text":"Famous for their wine selection when they should be focusing on their food. Perhaps this place is good for Etobicoke but it is average at best and that's not a bad thing until you get the bill and realize you paid a premium for average. I don't like to be so critical as I was a guest of Marcus (even though Marcus didn't have his credit card so I paid the bill :)) but I can't help it, I have to say it the way it is. Originally we were going to go to the Shangri-La and opted for this because it was suppose to be better. The place was empty when we arrived at 7 pm to my surprise, and I see this as a warning; dinner hour and no one inside. I ordered the Seafood Classico with Linguine. It came with an ample amount of seafood but still managed to be under whelming. Marcus had the salmon which looked only ok. They have a very extensive wine list from $50 per bottle to $70,000+ per bottle (yes, $70,000+)however, I feel before you build an extensive wine list you should build a good menu. I would not recommend or make the trip to Via Allegro Ristorante again."}
{"text":"Food was quite good.   Had the veal tenderloin and mushroom risotto which was quite good.   Little salty on the risotto.   My date had the truffle risotto which was very rich... Too rich for one sitting...as a full entree.   Wine was very expensive.... $50 for half litre was the cheapest.   Would rather spend the money and enjoy some beers at the keg."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last evening celebrating my girlfriend's birthday. After we were seated, I got up to use the restroom, and had discreetly ordered 2 Kir Royale's from the hostess, to please bring them to the table. Came back from the restroom and the first thing our server said was, \"so you ordered 2 Kir Royale's right?\". I thought this was in poor taste as I had purposely pulled the hostess aside, and whispered to bring the drinks. The rest of the evening went well, as the food was very good. Upon receiving the cheque, I was shocked to see the price of the Kir Royales were $24.95 each. Never in my life have I ever paid that price for this drink. It just left a bad taste in my mouth, and I could not justify such an outlandish price for Cassis and Prosecco.  The prices on the menu are high, but the food is very good, but $25 for a mixed drink is preposterous. THIS price cannot be justified. We will not be returning to Via Allegro."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here. The ambiance is beautiful, as you really get the Italian feel. The waiters are very attentive and kind. The wine list is like a Bible so I am pretty sure you will find what you like. I have had the golden spoon risotto which was so delish. The duck was so tender. I loved their passion fruit cheesecake but it's meant to be shared, as it's very decadent. The nutella tiramisu is good if you don't want anything too sweet. It's a great place to check out after shopping at Sherway Gardens."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Etobicoke and stopped by the LCBO or Staples I could never figure out what's up with all the new BMWs and Mercs parked in the plaza. And then it hit me. The service was excellent, the wine selection is amazing, the pizza is over-priced and the best I have tasted outside of Italy. I have become a regular is all I need to add."}
{"text":"Consistently a great restaurant. Remember when I was a kid they used to serve sorbet in between entrées to cleanse the palate. can't go wrong with anything on the menu but usually order the passion fruit cheesecake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Pricey but devine  Favs are seafood risotto,  mushroom soup, reserve wines, calamari,  pizza, ceaser salad  Service is always good  Feels like you're in rustic Italy, homey but elegant"}
{"text":"For many years I have driven by and or been told by others that I MUST try this place.  Finally I took the opportunity to visit Via Allegro on New Years Eve.  Now as im sure you have read in some of my other reviews im Italian and the amount of Italian restaurants I've been to is insane so I will take a lot to WOW me.  So as you can see I've given Via Allegro 5 stars.  Right from when we entered until when we left the service was hands down.  We all know how busy New Years Eve can be.  The only real complaint I can say is that they only take visa or cash not debit.  That's just a minor detail and not worth loosing points over.  There was 4 of us so we ordered 4 different apps and 4 entrees so of course we all had a taste of each others dishes.  All food was cooked to perfection and each bite was an explosion of flavors.  If you are into wine this is the place to be I swear the wine menu is the size of a photo album need 2 hands to lift.    Over all great experience and I cant wait to visit again"}
{"text":"Outstanding - period. One of the best ceaser salads I've ever had, wine list; mind blowing. Pizza; wood oven.   Sixteen years in the business; for a good reason.   Nicely done."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Went for dinner with family for my birthday. Looks amazing inside. Walls are stacked high with wine and scotch bottles!..There's a stone oven for the pizza. Service was very professional and punctual!.. Our host was patient with us.  Appetizers: The Adam and Eve is just amazing..from the presentation to how well the meat has been cooked.  Entrees: We ordered the margherita (a little salty but very tasty), the goat and pasta (fancy presentation), four cheese gnocchi and Chilean sea bass risotto. Tiramisu for dessert Food was delicious. still amazed to see that gigantic wine menu (size of atlas shrugged: I hate that book btw)  Fine dining cuisine at its finest..don't expect to come away cheap"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. But service was not at all what it should be for this caliber of restaurant. The tip applied at 20 percent for our group of 12 was not deserving. I have gone to this restaurant for years with not good service. Final straw...."}
{"text":"This restaurant is gorgeous, you might not think it from the outside but once you walk in, you would be surprised.   Huge restaurant space, tons of seating and romantic candle lights everywhere. All male servers and bartenders excluding the hostess.   The wine book is HUGE (it might be the biggest book I've ever seen haha) They have wonderful sommeliers and if you don't want bottled, they have great stiff drinks!   Dinner:  Caesar Salad/Allegro style  Seafood Classico and Linguine  Truffled Mushroom Risotto  Creme Brûlée  Tiramisu   Delicious!!!  All portions were fairly large. It's an expensive restaurant but the food is so fresh and tasty, you get what you pay for. This restaurant has been in business for years and with food like this, it shows why :)"}
{"text":"Came by for lunch hoping for a lunch menu, but they only use their dinner menu.  Food is pricey.  Mushroom risotto is really good though.  I am super picky about risotto and it was right on.  My criticism is that this place has looked the same forever.  It feels too 90s in there with metal vines on walls and ceiling and too much decor happening.  It really needs a makeover for the price point.  Service was very good.  Seasoned waiters here."}
{"text":"I would have to say the best Italian food I've had in GTA.  Their calamari app is the freshest tasting and absolutely cooked to perfection. Authentic pizza's and pastas. The seafood linguini had more seafood then pasta, great tasting fresh sauce. Grilled sea bass, thick and juice, perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Went there for a family dinner.  Very good, polite and professional service. Pizza was very delicious. Fish was very good.  Vegetables were cooked to perfection. Mushroom soup and risotto was good but little over salted. Seafood dish was very good."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight . I found the food ok . I paid $40 for a duck risotto that had no flavor."}
{"text":"Very good service and great food... seafood pasta well cooked. Huge wine selection the size of an encyclopedia."}
{"text":"Loved it. Can be a bit echo-ey at times, especially when the restaurant was fairly quiet, but that could also be because we were cackling quite a bit. Our party of 4 ordered the calamari and the Assagi Di Salami for appetizers while we worked our way through the first bottle of Von Strasser 11-07. Calamari was slightly salty but crispy and tender, can't go wrong with a salami board either. We all ordered the daily special of Chilean Sea Bass. Melt in your mouth goodness and came with butterflied prawns, scallops, risotto and veggie medley. Very heavy dish but oh-so-good. We ordered the tiramisu (again so good, not sure if its a 'real' tiramisu but it tasted good so who cares?), passionfruit cheesecake and the fresh berries.   Pros: that Chilean sea bass and tiramisu Cons: that wine list might have pulled a back muscle when I tried to lift it"}
{"text":"We arrived at this restaurant by accident. We were shopping and saw their sign on the side of the building and decided to check them out. We were greeted in a friendly manner and seated quickly as it seemed we were at the beginning of the dinner crowd. Our server was attentive and was never too far away.  The menu was a bit of a shock though as we were not expecting the pricing. There are numerous restaurants in the city that charge $50.00 for a steak dinner, but we were a little surprised that this one in this plaza would be as well.  BUT...  I ordered the Strip Loin and my wife ordered the Rib Eye. Both came with fresh vegetables and potatoes.  We were totally surprised and pleased with the quality of the steaks. They were the best steaks we have ever had at any restaurants.  The wine menu was extensive and some of the choices were way out of our price range, but they boast 5,000 bottle inventory.  I recommend this place to anyone who loves a good steak. dinner for 2 with 2 beers and 2 glasses of house wine came to just over $220.00."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few years and just decided on a whim to come.  There were 4 in our party.  The food is just a delicious as I had remembered.  We had the calamari as a starter, fruiti misti pizza, pepperoni pizza, Chilean sea bass and seafood risotto.  All delicious and service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Via Allegro is easily one of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto. An insane wine listed paired with incredible food. U literally get mad bc you can't eat more than one entree. 100% must try (ask them 2 use the huge pepper shakers they won't let u lol) xoxo"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I did not feel like the food quality reflected the prices.    The Caesar salad was excellent.  Very large. I recommend you share it. My hubby had rack of lamb he enjoyed it but said it was salty. The salmon was good.  I had the mushroom risotto, it was very salty and rich.  Again a dish better shared not as an entree.   What was really disappointing was desert.  It was my Mother's Birthday. They were out of the Creme Caramel. It was sad as there was nothing else she wanted.  They brought her a complimentary tiramisu.  That was nice. She didnt eat it though.  My daughter ordered the gelato. 12.95 for a 1/2 scoop of ice cream that melted in 2 min. She ended up eating the tiramisu.    They don't have debit? That is weird! The service was good and the dishes came out in a timely fashion.  Overall. Way too pricey for what you get. There are way better Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"I been here twice in the past month and the service has been exceptionally slow. The pricing is rather high for service quality.  The  meals were OK but it took forever to get them.   I would definitely not recommend this restaurant for any sort of business meeting or dinner as it will not be an efficient experience"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the strip mall location... I've eaten at the Via Allegro Ristorante dozens of times and the experience has always been fantastic.   Once, during the holiday season when they'd slightly over-booked, or under-estimated how long folks would be at tables, and the lineup of waiting customers was getting a little long (maybe 10 of us), they poured complimentary champagne for those of us who were waiting. Nice touch.  The food is fabulous!   My personal favorite is the Spaghetti Bolognese which isn't typically on the menu, but prepared as a lunchtime special. It was SO good that I had them wrap up a few morsels to take home with me to make a friend really envious of my lunch date at Via Allegro. :-)  The risotto is heavenly and the Caesar salads are perfect. Basically, everything on the menu is perfect... and I've tried it all.  Their wine list is HUGE - and if you're confused, just ask for the sommelier to recommend the right pairing. They'll even do tastings for you.  The service may not always be super personable, especially when it is busy (which is usual) but it is uber-professional and some of the wait staff have been working there for as long as I've been going to this restaurant.  If you are in Toronto West (Etobicoke) for a day or more, this is the place to eat... it has won two of the highest international awards of their kind, the Grand Award from New York and the Whiskey Supreme Award from the U.K. and deservedly so!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! is the best way to describe one of my top 10 restaurants in the GTA. The service is amazing, the wine selections are to die for, and I would highly recommend trying the mushroom risotto.  If you would like to impress your family or perhaps a date.......then this is the place!"}
{"text":"Known to have the finest selection of wines in Toronto.  Wine spectator grand Award for many years.  Close to 6000 selections. Service was sincere, what I have expected from a fine dining Resturant.  We were here for lunch, and it wasn't very busy.  We had a pizza, salad and a seafood linguini.  I would rate the food as 7/10."}
{"text":"Went back and what a difference. The service was just awesome and friendly. Food was excellent. The manager made sure we were happy with everything. Well done! Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"A bible-like wine menu. Sorbet post appetizers to cleanse your palette & purse stools beside each table. I'm really enjoying this place. The only downfall I'd say would be The lack of curb appeal. Get past that and it's wonderful inside."}
{"text":"we were just passing by looking for a nice restaurant and we found here. The interior design is so beautiful and food is even better! I enjoyed a lot! yammy!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside entrance fool you, this place serves fantastic Italian food. They have an extensive wine menu & any alcohol you can imagine. Never overly crowded so it is the perfect spot for last minute reservations. Great service also. I go to this place regularly. Ideal if you live close & want high end italian & don't feel like driving through Toronto traffic to get it!"}
{"text":"What used to be great cuisine has slowly become over done drab food and as a yelper and foodie alike the food comes first.  Never mind the excellent service and attention by the waiters the food isn't what it use to be.  Never mind the excellent venue and ambiance which soothes and relaxes you before you eat the food is not what it used to be.  Never mind the mind blowing wine list with thousands of bottle selection, the food is not what it used to be.  The food is what motivates me to go back, and the outdated, over done, never changing menu is something that I despise. Yes I do think the meat and risottos are amazing but its not exciting anymore (I could cook everything they make at home). Get a new chef, look around at other italian food which is light, fresh and doesn't make feel like I've eaten a block of butter and change up the old.  Etobicoke doesn't have that much high priced selection but for my $200 meal w/ tax w/ tip I feel I would have been happier and lighter at some newer restros downtown. I'm sure some of the zoomers agree, while other just go because they don't know where else to throw their money. Buca or vibo next time."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate our daughter's birthday.  The ambiance of this restaurant is classy and with the dimmed lighting made it hard to read the menus! Thank god for our phone LED lights!  The wine selection is one of the biggest in the GTA I must say! The wine menu looked more like a King James Bible!  The wine sommelier Wendy was very helpful in helping us to decide what we wanted.  We started with several appetizers and they were devoured by our hungry group.  For the mains, I had the long bone ribeye, my wife, the Truffle Risotto (which was excellent), my son (salmon.. which was great), our friend had the gnocchi, very tasty indeed!  They made a couple of mistakes with the ribeye as our friend's was done too rare for his liking but they quickly rectified it and came back to keep reporting to us that it is being redone and will be served to us very shortly.  Lots of extras like free Foie Gras appetizer, dessert and champagne!  The polenta plate was a great appetizer!  Had a tour of the wine cellar as well, very informative indeed!  Wendy is one of the few sommeliers and has been with Via Allegro for 17 years!    We love this place and have frequented it many times over the years.  Never failed us but a little heavy on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Alright, the food is so spectacular, I'm now done sulking.  Yelp is often correct, in terms of ratings.  BUT I think that the rating is definitely OFF for this restaurant.   I think it's one of the best mid-range cost Italian joints in the city!    And if you have a yen for extremely unusual, expensive wine, this 3,000 item wine list will satisfy you!"}
{"text":"I came here on a business dinner. I ordered the seafood classico, which was quite tasty and probably worth the $33. One co-worker mentioned that the rabbit two ways wasn't as good as he expected. All in all, a good place for a business dinner or possibly a romantic dinner if you want to impress. All of the dishes will be in upwards of $30. The wine list is larger than a dictionary. Make sure you have time to spare because service is very slow."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  The risotto was plentiful and worth the money and so was the Osso Buco.  The server could have been more friendly and personable. I felt he was a bit stand offish."}
{"text":"Great Italian food in a strip mall?  Yes!  But bring lots of cash or make sure there is room on your credit card. Dinner for 2 with 1 cocktail, shared appetizer, 2 pasta dishes, bottle of Chianti, shared dessert and glass of dessert wine was $205.  Mozzarella di bufala was melt in your mouth good, served with tomatoes and arugula.  Pasta dishes were great. Cavatelli with pheasant prepared table side in a hollowed out cheese round so the heat of the dish can melt some of the cheese. Rabbit tagliatelle with chorizo is a little unusual, but the flavors worked well. Don't be intimidated by the wine list. It's broken down by geography so If you have a general idea of what you want, it's easy to find. There is a separate dessert wine book too, 1 page for desserts, about 20 for wines.  Considering the size of the dessert wine list the wine by the glass section is a little disappointing though."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Service is impeccable and the food is a spectacular flavour explosion with amazing presentation. Date night or group dinner, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Atmosphere Stuffy. Old decor. Not welcoming. 3 couples arrived within 15 minutes. It took a middle aged guy and two young hostesses over 10 minutes to figure out if they have tables. One couple left. The washroom had 4 stalls. Two were locked off by the restaurant. One had unflushed nasty stuff and one was overflown with toilet papers all on the ground. Seriously at 16 bux a caesar salad...you need to keep the washroom sanitary...this is not a 5 bux a dish chinese restaurant!  Service Food came out on time. Waiter was friendly but obviously exhausted.  Food Ordered an old fashioned...could not drink it. The worse old fashioned ever tasted in any restaurant. Had 2 pastas. They were just okay. Not worth the price point. Cheap ol' Levetto had a better ragu. Absolutely not impressed.  Not sure what we are paying extra for here? The dirty washroom, average food, bad drink, confused front greeting hostess...wouldnt go back. Rather drive downtown or sauga for fine Italian dining."}
{"text":"Really disappointing ...after hearing about this place for years my husband and I finally had the chance to go.  We made a reservation and showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday night ...very quiet at that time so we sat down at our table and took in the atmosphere. 10 minutes later we still hadn't been approached by our server. Eventually we were able to order but wine that took another 30 minutes (although in their defence they have a large wine list so it may have taken a while to find it) ...the food took 45 min to arrive and it was underwhelming to say the least.  Service was poor and not at the level you would expect for a $250 meal (that's without appetizers or dessert!) I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it but will not return."}
