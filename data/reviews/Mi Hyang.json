{"text":"I try to like the place, but they should really hire more staff. Only two people working as servers is really not enough. Especially when the place first opened about a year ago! and one person in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Excellent attention to detail and a super friendly staff has made this our favorite restaurant. We love the excellent side dishes, and they seem happy to keep refilling them.  They offer a unique flavor - the Kim chi is sweet and delicious.  Their beans, bean sprouts and glass noodles are always great, and they often throw in an interesting twist - like tonight we had a spicy broccoli that we loved enough to get two servings of.  For the main course the mackerel, soups and bulgogi are all awesome.  I like the dinner bulgogi better than the lunch, get the $10.99 version even when you are there at lunch - it is best served on the hot plate with lots of veggies.  The spicy pork is great too. They serve a sweet cold rice drink at the end of the meal that cleanses the palate and refreshes nicely. Tonight the place was full - a couple of groups were waiting for a table as we left.   But our waiter was friendly, calm and efficient the whole time.   Our kids enjoy the k-pop on the tv, and they make the free wifi easy by putting the code on a sign at the table. We recommended this place to some friends who have also made this a regular dinner spot.  I used to go to Owl of Minerva when craving Korean near First Markham Place but haven't considered any of the other places since finding Mi Hyang."}
{"text":"I went there 2 times for lunch and every time, the food was delicious. The service was amazing! I almost ate all of my banchan and the server asked if I wanted more. This is definitely my favourite Korean place to eat in Markham!"}
{"text":"A very good Korean restaurant - with huge portions and excellent side dishes.  Their kimchi is unique - it has a sweet flavour to it, which I quite like. I love their pork bone soup, usually a big portion with 3-4 bones, and a very flavourful soup broth.  I think it was 7.95.  I think they are understaffed, with all family members running around.  So sometimes other tables are not cleared.  They usually offer you second helpings of side dishes.  The only reason why this isn't a 5 star review is that there is a lot of msg in all of their dishes, and you can feel it afterwards.  Overall very good value. Even though I like the food better here, I prefer the spacious tables of Est West, and the service is less chaotic."}
{"text":"First Markham Place has become a popular destination for the vast selections of different Asian restaurants to try. It seems that there is a new restaurant popping up every couple of month or so.  The newest addition to the list is Mi Hyang, a Korean restaurant that offers popular Korean dishes, from Bulgogi, Gam Ja tang, Bimbimbap, etc. For the first 2 weeks since their opening day, they were offering $3.99 ( Reg. $6.99) of 4 of their signature dishes (Bimbimbap, Korean beef  in stone bowl, Korean sushi, Gam Ja tang)  Every meal comes with 7 appetizers. Though the appetizers are not as outstanding as Nak Won, it's still decent. As a huge fan of Pork Bone soup, that's a must order for me in a Korean restaurant, especially a newly opened one. The broth was flavourful, though standard in my opinion. Skimpy on the lettuce and potato, the pork bone was full of meat and tasty.   My most favourite dish of the evening was the Korean beef in stone bowl. It is basically bulgogi w/ clear noodles in a stone bowl with a delicious soup base. It goes great with rice. The beef was tasty and flavourful.  There is always a line up of the many times I passed by this past week (even at 10:00pm). Surely because of the promotion, but prices are decent and food is on par with most of the other Korean restaurants at FMP.  The service was where it went downhill. 2 over-worked staff members was trying to manage a packed restaurant, from working the cashier, clearing the tables, taking orders, delivering the meals, and taking requests from every other customer. They definitely need to hire another helping hand. Our table had to call for the waitress approx. 7-8 times because she kept forgetting to bring the essentials to our table (spoons, tea, bowls, appetizers, chopsticks). She kept coming back with 1 thing and rushing back to take another request before we had a chance to tell her everything we needed at once.  A bit frustrating, but we tried to be understandable as to how busy the place was.  I would give it another go if I'm craving my Gam Ja Tang again around FMP."}
{"text":"It's a solid korean restaurant in Markham. But I think the menu is so big that I can't even think about what to eat. Went with the Pork Bone Soup. It was ok, I don't think the broth is as salty or rich as others, but it was decent. They gave plenty of appetizers and the rest of the food looked alright.  Nothing spectacular, nothing bad to say either. There was really only one girl manning the whole place but I didn't feel like she couldn't handle it. Sometimes I saw the cook come out."}
{"text":"Had my favourite banchans, just love those soybeans. Kimchii was sweet which is different than the typical kimchi but I really liked it. Lunch special makes it great value for all the food you get so decided to get dokboki as well which tasted amazing. There is free wifi and when I arrived Girls Generation was playing on one of the TV's which is a bonus...lol.... Nak Won was my favourite Korean Restaurant in Markham but now its Mi Hyang"}
{"text":"Korean restaurants have been popping up all over First Markham Place. I haven't tried this one so I thought I'd give it a try. It looked like a place that would serve homestyle Korean food.  Me and my friend ordered the lunch specials. Prices was around $6.99-7.99. We got the kalbi and the soon tofu soup. Service was pretty fast on a weekday during lunch hour. Side dishes came promptly after order was taken. We were really hungry so we just dove right in. Despite how hungry we were, the banchans weren't very satisfying. Their potato in soy and liquid honey is half cooked and very sauce overly fluid. Bean sprouts were almost tasteless.   Next came the soup, salad, and the bento box filled with fried dumplings, another salad, rice, and kalbi. The kalbi smelled soooo good. Very very good flavour. But the meat looked quite limp and questionable. The soup and both salads were sub par and I wouldn't want more if it were free. My friend's soon tofu soup was alright though it was not at all spicy.   The verdict: go next door. Plenty of choices in that plaza for Korean craving."}
{"text":"I had the bulgogi on rice for lunch. portion is way too small for the 7.99 price. A few of my coworkers had pork bone soup, which was only 5.99 and a much bigger portion. Others had the bulgogi lunch box, which was a bit on the small side as well and 7.99  As with most korean places, they give you many side dishes. I didnt find any of them that unique, or interesting, just average.   The staff gave us some trouble about having a large party, and wanting to merge 2 tables. We had a part of 9. They had 2 tables for 6 side by side that were both empty, and a 4 or 5 booths for 4 that were free, but much farther than the pair of 6-seaters. My feeling is they didnt want us to take up both 6-seater tables, in case another large party showed up. But frankly, it was already 12:30pm, and the restaurant was half empty. We insisted on the 2 tables of 6 for 9 of us, and they eventually said okay after consulting with owner.  Overall the taste is okay, and the fact it seems to be run by Koreans is a plus, but pricing is not as attractive as Chingu at West Beaver Creek / Hwy 7, which has better pricing, bigger portions, and is also run by Koreans.  Decent restaurant, and would try again for the pork bone soup, but for other stuff, cross the 404 and go for Chingu instead"}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best. They are nice people, but they didn't even know what they're serving (appetizer) and not so fluent in English either .  I ordered the tofu soup with pork and all I tasted was MSG. It was so powdery as well, I just couldn't bare to finish my food .   Their appetizers are randomly given out, one table might have kimchi and the other might have bean sprouts . I looked over to the other table and noticed they served them kimchi while I was served some next level jello ."}
{"text":"$4.99 all day specials though is a $1 more than their Grand Opening Specials, still great value!!  I came for lunch when Mi Hyang was half emptied and the waitresses still fresh and in a good mood. I were greeted with all smile and when I asked for more spicy.. the waitress kept asking me not spicy? No MORE spicy! Korean Spicy! :)  Even dining alone, I was served with all those banchens and salad. I was almost full even before she served me my food : Ddulo Ra Myun. Noodles was the packaged one, which I kind of expect at this price point! There were tons of rice cake and even pieces of beef with tons of veggies!  My meal was ended with this cold sweet rice soup, which was a nice touch!"}
