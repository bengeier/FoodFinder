{"text":"Terrible customer service. I had a reservation and knew I was going to be late. I started calling 30 min before to let them know and left a voice message. No one answered any of the extensions. When we arrived late we were told we had lost our table. The hostesses when not helpful. We could have a seat but would not be served or get a menu until 45 min later. I did talk to the manager, and he brought us menus. But the damage was done.  After the initial hassle the rest of the evening went fine. The lecture on elliot Ness was great. Our server took good care of us and the meal good."}
{"text":"Great meal tonight before going to see BNL at Nautica. I had the salmon and my sister had the scallops, which were sweet and delicious, both served with w red skin potatoes and asparagus. Great view, good service and a band was about to begin playing, but we had to make our show. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner about 5 pm on a Saturday - we were seated outside on their beautiful patio.  The setting was fantastic! Lots of boats, kayaks, a wedding being photographed - and lots of people watching! That might be enough - but our dinner was wonderful! Heather, our waitress was very attentive.  I had the crab cake, tempura shrimp - what was outstanding and the most delicious goat cheese salad - my husband, a great burger - a glass of their pinot grigio on tap topped of the meal - go for the views  AND for the food and service!"}
{"text":"We had the Fish Monger as an appetizer. Everything was singed. Burnt or over breaded.. Then our bread was cold and underbaked... My sangria was ok. No fruit in it so it may have been a glass of sweet red wine. I did have the oysters and they were fine. The scallop appetizer was good. But very very salty.  And lastly I had the creme brûlée.  It was a tad sour and in some spots cold. This to me means it was microwaved. I don't think I would ever come here for seafood again.  Dirty martini's maybe.... But the food, absolutely not.  Hopefully someone else has a Better experience"}
{"text":"I dine out at least six days a week, but rarely do I have a \"wow!\" experience. Dinner last night was just that. We had the salt block cured scallops to start, and they were delicious. Our server was very knowledgeable, and pleasant. For dinner, I had the Ribeye, and my date had the Strip Steak. Both were remarkable. We'll definitely return..."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner today (Monday) with a friend. We ordered the scallops for an appetizer and the Surf & Turf as an entree. The bread and olive oil was awesome. The mashed potatoes were delicious. Of course the lobster and steak was amazing. The waiters made sure that my drink was always full. The food took a while to come out, but I was not in a hurry. I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food, but I can't because the Rusty Anchor just called and canceled our reservation for New Years Eve. It sounds like they took too many reservations and didn't realize it until the last minute.   Today is December 30th, so they get two stars -- I guess it could have been worse, they could have just turned us away when we arrived tomorrow!  Still, kinda the worst night of the year to realize you took a reservation almost a month ago that you can't honor.  Rusty Anchor, I direct you to Jerry Seinfeld for a lesson on the sanctity of reservations:  http://youtu.be/A7uvttu8ct0"}
{"text":"Great location and scenery. Good food. High end cuisine. Good wine prices. I recommend checking it out.  Drew was a great waiter."}
{"text":"First time we went here, our waiter was awesome and helpful, food was fantastic, so we were excited to try this place again. We were extremely disappointed the second time around. We placed our order and it took over a half hour to get our food and when it arrived it was barely warm. The waitress had told us our food was in the window and should be out any minute. Ten minutes after that it arrived. We had asked for waters all around and only a few of us got glasses of water, so we had to keep asking hey we need a few more glasses please, every time it was only one glass at a time that came, maybe there was a shortage? Maybe a shortage on water as well since no one ever came to fill out glasses of water THE ENTIRE TIME! We could get new glasses of water but fill your glass? Don't ever think it! Food was nothing close to what it was the first time. I got a chowder soup and ended up chomping down on a huge piece of shell, awesome. Other food was pathetic as well, only reason this is getting 2 stars is for the first experience being good but the second was so epically horrible, can't even give it 3 stars. It'll be hard to convince us to go back to this place unless we can find our first waiter again."}
{"text":"Wonderful time for fm project. Great music and food. Nina was our server and was perfect. Only negative is I would like them to go back to their old wine list with more of a selection. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Those oysters were damn good! Service by Heather was fantastic, but the live Blues were the highlight of this place."}
{"text":"I'm not certain this review is fair or not, because I didn't actually stay for music or food or drinks.  To start, you have to pay $5 to park in the parking lot, which is difficult to get in and out.  There's virtually no signage whatsoever, so you just have to know that you're going into the same parking lot as Shooters and the gentleman's club (whatever it's called now).  Because there is no signage, we finally made it to the place after walking through Shooters, and down the river walk.  As I finally walked outside, it was quickly saying that the place was pretty ghetto - just trying to make something out of nothing.  They certainly do a good job of making it look and sound good online, but I would not waste any time, money, or effort going to this place.  We left and went to Ken Stewart's - had a very nice dinner there."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to have dinner and attend a performance. I ordered the Vegan Chopped Salad and the Grilled Verlasso Salmon. Husband ordered Lobster Bisque and Lake Erie Walleye. Here are our impressions:  Waiter was nice, but not particularly attentive. More on this later. I would not recommend the Vegan Chopped Salad. It is described as \"romaine mix tossed with chopped cauliflower, diced cucumbers, peas, and sweet garlic vinaigrette.\" When it arrived, I thought I had received the wrong salad. All I saw was lettuce. I really had to dig to find a few peas, tiny bits of cucumber, and maybe a piece or two of cauliflower. The dressing was very sweet, but oddly, I only tasted it in a few bites. Could not taste any garlic. After another bite or two, I couldn't find any evidence of it. I barely ate about a quarter of what was there, because it was so disappointing. My husband's Lobster Bisque, on the other hand (which I tried), was yummy. However, he was only partially finished with it when our entrees showed up (I had long since given up on the salad). Keep in mind, nobody had checked to see how our soup and salad were. I pointed out to the food runner (not our waiter) that we still had the soup and salad on the table and had no room for the entrees (small two-top table). Perhaps I'm expecting too much, but at a restaurant with prices like these, I presume that the soup/salad plates would be cleared away before the entrees are placed. I also let the food runner know that I wasn't happy with my salad. She apologized, took it away, and left our entrees. My husband still had the bisque along with his entree. Our waiter came along soon after the entrees were delivered and I expressed to him my disappointment about the timing of the entrees and of the salad. He came back soon and told me that the salad was removed from our bill, which I very much appreciated.  My entree (salmon) was somewhat dry and overcooked. The presentation was really nice, so it could have been much better. The cauliflower puree and asparagus that came with it were quite good. My husband's entree (Walleye), was REALLY good. The potatoes that came with it were excellent, and the green beans were very good as well. I felt like he and I had very different experiences, as if, had I only ordered the right food, I would have been happier with the experience. I didn't mention my disappointment with the salmon, since it was still fairly good, even though it was a bit overcooked. When our server finally came over (he never checked to see how our meals were), he cleared my plate away and asked if he should clear my husband's plate also (husband was away from the table). His plate was clean except for the green beans, but I knew he was finished. Server made a joke about making sure he finished the green beans before taking the plate away. Haha, ok. Husband came back and ate a few more green beans and was finished. But the server never came back. His plate sat there for, easily, another half hour while we were watching the band. Server never came back, never asked if we wanted dessert or coffee, nothing. Husband finally had to flag him down to ask him to please take away the plate and bring a dessert menu.  On a side note, the ladies' room was very nice and clean.  All in all, a weird dining experience. My conclusion is, if you get the right server and order the right food, you'll really enjoy your meal. But it's a crapshoot."}
{"text":"We LOVED the music brunch at the Music Box/Rusty Anchor this past Sunday.  The music (band Duchess) was FABULOUS as was the food.  The selection and quality was way above average.  We adored our waitress Nina...as a matter of fact we are going again at the end of March and have requested to be seated in her section! I highly suggest giving this Sunday brunch a try."}
{"text":"Late night dining after an event upstairs.  With the band playing it was hard to hold a conversation, but the food was pretty solid!  I started my meal with the lobster bisque.  It came served in a white crock and was covered in a flaky pastry dough.  The soup itself was slightly sweet (as you'd expect) and had a significant portion of lobster contained within. A shot of sherry might have really \"jazzed\" it up, but the flavor was robust and quite good.  For a main dish, I chose the potato crusted salmon.  I came with a side of grilled asparagus and rice.  The fish itself was cooked perfectly and the potatoes on the exterior was lightly grilled as well.  The accompanying horseradish dill cream sauce was a perfect pairing with this dish.  Was not expecting much from this place at first glance, and other than the slightly high prices I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"Will never eat here again! They were out of several dishes & Incredibly rude service by our server Neil and the manager. They were also extremely slow, never once filling water or coming back to check on us. My friend ordered a salad with shrimp, twice they brought out her salad without the shrimp. Great view but that's where anything positive stops at this place"}
{"text":"We had been at the Music Box Supper Club for an event so I made last minute reservations at the Rusty Anchor.  The prices were much more than I wanted to spend that night so we just got 3 appetizers and split them after finding out they were out of perch fillets.  We had the risotto, the scallops and my husband had the lobster perogies.  Rave reviews of all three items.  The music was a bit loud...and I hate the kind of music that was being played.  In hindsight, I wished we'd gone elsewhere but we did get to try a nice restaurant in the flats.  The service was good and the food quality was excellent but I'm pretty certain we'll never return.  It's just not our kinda place."}
{"text":"I came to the Rusty Anchor for a Cleveland Stories Dinner Party (which happens on Wednesdays). It was a busy event and much more crowded and claustrophobic than I expected. The stories were funny and touching, the service was fine, but I was not a fan of the food. I ordered a plate with an Erie lake fish and a lobster bisque. I found both to be too greasy and salty. The fish was breaded and buttery, so it felt like it had more calories than a fish should and it masked the natural flavor of the fish. The lobster bisque was also covered with a breaded layer, which felt too fatty and dense to me. For the amount and quality of food, $36 + tip is pricey, but perhaps I was paying more for the nice location and show than the food."}
{"text":"I have been to the Rusty Anchor a few times now, but am just getting around to writing a review, as I have been to several different events they offer and was extremely pleased with all of them.  I went to a Sunday brunch, which is something I have been longing for in my area since I moved away from DC, which has one every place you go. The food selection was excellent. From eggs benedict, breakfast burritos, potatoes, pastries, chicken parm, you name it. Not only was the selection good, but everything was prepared well and tasted great. That on top of a greta build your own bloody mary bar, you really can't ask for much more to start your Sunday! That's without even mentioning the music. The brunch coupled with an excellent band makes you almost forget it's sunday morning/early afternoon. I highly recommend trying this out.   I also went to one of the late night dinner speaker events. This was during St. Paddy's Day week and the talk was about Danny Greene, who I have always been fascinated with. For $20, I got a great meal and listened to some awesome history that was relevant to Cleveland and the Irish in this area. Perfectly timed event with a great atmosphere. The place was completely packed, but all of our drink s and food came out promptly and with a smile. The featured dinner was an Irish soup, Corned beef, and a Guinness float for dessert. It really doesn't get much better than that. Check out the speaker events, find one you are interested in, and get a great value meal and a unique experience while getting a great view of the water.   I have also seen two concerts in the upstairs venue. The acoustics are phenomenal. It has a really great blend of a big concert, while remaining extremely intimate. I don't go to a lot of concerts because the crowds drive me insane, but I will go back here every time there is an act I want to see.   Overall, no matter what you are trying to do here, you won't be disappointed. The staff is friendly and quick. The food, compliments of Chef Dennis, is delicious. And, you can't ask for better music. Highly recommend stopping down to the flats this summer to check them out (or winter if you don't see this fast enough)!!"}
{"text":"We went there after a day at the rock and roll hall of fame, made reservations off of yelp. Was greatly impressed with everything! Our waitress was awesome the food was also very good but the atmosphere  and people is what makes  this place the band was a show stopper  on their own! Blair Crimmos and the hookers must see band!!!10 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Rusty Anchor on Monday and had a wonderful meal and service.  I only had a main course but it was superb.  I had the pork and the taste was perfect.  I had the simple sides with potatoes and asparagus and it was great.  This is a restaurant inside a concert hall the views on the river are spectacular.  Service was also very attentive."}
{"text":"Friday night out for dinner and a show on the west side of the flats. Started out with dinner at the Rusty Anchor with show plans later upstairs at the Music Box Supper Club. I will do separate review of the Music Box, as I see these as two stand alone entities within the same building.   We arrived for a pre-concert dinner reservation and were seated right away in the rear half of the restaurant, partial closed off by a window wall from the bar / club area. I like the setup of the dinning area as it was a bit quieter than the bar area featuring a live band at the time. Great river view of the Cuyahoga and I was wishing a big freighter would have sailed on by, maybe next time. Clean nice looking decor with some nice concert posters on the wall. Ya got feel good when a Ginger Baker poster is hanging on the wall behind you.  Service was good once our waiter made it over to us, about 5 solid minute wait before drink orders were taken. Once drinks were served we ordered a salad that we split. I went with the Perch dinner while my wife ordered the Salmon on a cauliflower purée. The surprise of the evening was the salad, nice crisp mixed greens with walnuts, blue cheese, pickled red onions and 2 types of beets (red and large mild yellow). The beets were tasty and not your poor jarred crappy jarred ones that lurk in the back of your pantry.   My wife enjoy the salmon with praise for the cauliflower purée. I liked the perch dinner with the panko breaking but can see how traditionalists might want your usual beer batter fish. The French frys were also good, I just wishing they would have been served with some malt vinegar. Guess I could have asked if the kitchen had any malt vinegar.   Scoring the Rusty Anchor a 4 with good food and wait service. Great view and very convenient to the Music Box and the Improv next door."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Incredible concert / event schedule.  Special event brunches are wonderful.  Great riverfront deck during the nice weather."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch and Cleveland Jazz Orchestra featuring Evelyn Wright = great time!!!  I treated a girlfriend to Birthday Brunch here this past weekend, and I was not at all disappointed!   I was a bit hesitant about the food based on some of the reviews, but no worries, everything was great.  I reserved ahead of time, on Open Table, arrived promptly at 11:30.  We were immediately seated and directed to the Brunch buffet.  Breakfast burrito bar, warm tortillas, salsa, grilled onions, jalapenos, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, choice of sausage, and thick sliced bacon....yum!  Also Bananas Foster French Toast, warm, gooey and delicious.  Eggs benedict, pasta marinara, corned beef hash, tossed salad, seasonal salad with fresh strawberries, blue cheese and pecans, fresh baked breakfast breads and muffins, fresh fruit, cereal, milk, yogurt and hardboiled eggs.  This buffet was well worth the $18 charge.  Everything was fresh and delicious, the Bananas Foster French Toast was truly addicting.  The music was great, not too loud, just perfect for Sunday Brunch.  Last but not least, you can't beat the view!  Keep in mind that you must purchase music tickets separately from the Brunch reservation.  I purchased through Flash Seats.   I will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. Shannon is such a great hostess and britanny was an outstanding server. Thanks to crystal for checking with us"}
{"text":"In short: They forgot about us, then brought us food (cold). Waived the entire bill.  More detail: Had a reservation a 7. Ordered around 7:20, the waiter acknowledged that there was confusion on who was our server. Ordered three entrees, two bisques, an appetizer, and a mixed drink. Mixed drink came out and the bar staff was unaware of how to make it. That being said it was fine. Bisques and calamari came out, the lobster bisque was a little cheesy and not bad but not what I expected. Calamari was fine.   Forty five minutes later the server tells us that our tickets are third (WTF!?! It wasn't even that crowded). Fifteen minutes after that we went and found a manager, they said our ticket was next. Bull crap! The food came out five minutes later and all three entrees were lukewarm at best. Our orders clearly got lost and had been sitting there for awhile.  The server came back to check on us and brought a manager with him, presumably because he knew we were going to be upset. We told them the problems and they offered to remake everything, but we were so done with this place at that point that we just got some boxes and left. They waived the entire bill, which is what they should have done, so I can't give them too much credit for that. They basically screwed up as much as possible, but made it right as best as possible too. I ate the lobster pierogis the next day and there wasn't too much lobster in them.  Side note: I was surprised by the limited seafood options of a place call The Rusty Anchor. There were like 5 or 6 seafood entree options.  This all being said, I want to note that I review every restaurant I go to, not just bad experiences. I understand things happen, and every place will mess up every now and then, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We were on a time limit due to a concert @ Nautica Pavilion. I told the hostess we did not have reservations. First she said it would be an hour wait, then she checked & said if we take a seat right away  she could fit us @ a table - being only 2 people. I gave her my name & went to get my husband waiting by the door. She then tells us we have to sit @ the bar - she went back on her word. w/ limited time we sat @ the bar. Now the bartender takes food orders from a group of people who sat down after us. For the prices, they need to improve customer service ! The walleye [was] excellent."}
{"text":"went here for birthday dinner on memorial day. was very excited from what other people said about it but ended up leaving underwhelmed and disappointed. we ordered steak, veggie burgers, shredded chicken tacos and chips & salsa. the menu was shortened due to it being a holiday. we attempted to get an appetizer for the whole table but the lobster ravioli was dry and under filled, calamari was overcooked and everything else fell short of being seasoned. the veggie burgers were okay, the steaks were overcooked and under seasoned, the tacos that were supposed to come with shredded chicken but arrived to the table with ground chicken instead. frankly the best parts of the meal were the fries and view. the server did try his best to aid in our situation and it was greatly appreciated. overall it's only worth the view and is overrated."}
{"text":"We went for Michael Sonata's Frank Sinatra tribute and we were all pleasantly surprised! There was a group of 8 of us and not once did I feel as if our server was too busy for us even with all his other tables. Service was slower than normal, but that was ok since we went for the live entertainment.   We started off with the pork belly appetizer, which was crisped to perfection. The lobster bisque was topped with a pastry shell, but was thicker than what I am used to. Though it was a decent soup, I would probably not get it again. My mom RAVED about her house salad and said she would return solely to eat the salad! For the main course, I had the lobster & potato pierogis. These were really good, but I wish I could've tasted more lobster in there. For dessert my parents had the apple \"cheesecake\" and really enjoyed that. Overall, I would go back to Rusty Anchor, but the entertainment would be what drew me back more than anything."}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner tonight. Great ribs and sea bass. Thanks to our waiter Kyle for making sure I got the fish prepared to my liking. Great service. Tasty food."}
{"text":"Rusty Anchor Music Supper Club was a hidden gem! The waterside atmosphere combined with amazing staff and fantastic music made for a top ten dining experience! Hats off to Drew our waiter he did a fantastic job and Crystal the sommelier was knowledgeable and helpful in selecting a wine for the evening! The beet salad and the roasted half chicken with lobster risotto is simple divine! The entire dining experience is one to remember!!!"}
{"text":"Warning!!  Went here on a Sunday @ 9pm but kitchen was closed.  It's a restaurant but their hours are based around shows at the comedy club.  Looks like a nice place to grab dinner before a show but it's not a restaurant you can just walk up to on a random night."}
{"text":"I want to thank our servers Heather and Nina for their wonderful service. They were very attentive to all of our requests and went above and beyond to assure us as exemplary dining experience . Very personable ladies and would love to sit in their section any time we return to the Rusty Anchor."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to introduce family members to the Music Box Supper Club experience.  Cocktails and seafood from the Oyster Bar on the deck, dinner at the Rusty Anchor, and a show during dinner.  Cicie, our server, was fantastic and never skipped a beat.  She catered to our every need and brought us delicious entrees, soup, and salads.  Kudos to Cicie and the chef!"}
{"text":"\"Get the f*ck out\" - VP of Operation Mr Grattan of Music Box Supper Club (where Rusty Anchor is located) to my friends and I. On Saturday June 3, 2017 I brought myself and my best friend, the bachelorette, to your club to enjoy her bachelorette party along with a group of friends. Approx. 1 month ago I called and spoke with your staff and was able to reserve a table for the 20 people in our party with no problems. The morning of the 3rd, I called and left a voicemail to confirm the table reservation and my call was returned in a swift manner to confirm that yes, we had a table for 20 reserved under the name of \"The Bride\".  We arrived at your establishment at approximately 11:15pm and when \"The Bride\" asked your VP of Operations, Mitch Grattan about our table, she was told that \"We don't reserve tables. We don't do that here\". He turned away from her and I came over to inquire about what was happening. He again spoke very rudely to me and told me that is not something that is done there. I told him that I had spoken with multiple people about this, including that morning, and that if he did not know anything about it to please point me in the direction of someone who did. He told me to talk to another gentleman at the front door who was taking tickets (a tall African American man who's name I do not know), who informed me that he only worked for the promoter and didn't know anything about tables. At that point I caught eye contact with Michael again and asked him who else I could speak with to get the situation straight. He said \"nobody. Can't help you\". I said that I had spoken with someone on the phone that morning who dealt with bookings and asked if they were in the building to which he replied that if I had a problem I could \"take your money and get the fuck out my club\". At this point he was yelling in my face (and while the music was loud, he was standing over me pointing and yelling in my face). I turned away from him to go into the club and gather my friends so we could leave.  What I did not see was that apparently he followed behind me in an attempt to grab me and another member of my party asked him to let me pass, and told him that I understood what he was saying and to \"Let it go please. We understand\". He then replied to her that she could \"get the fuck out\" too. I sincerely hope that he was not attempting to physically grab me, but with the way he was acting, I do not believe that is out of the question.  To top it all off, when I went to get the rest of my party, they were actually sitting at the table that was reserved for us - \"The Bride's\" name on it and all, just as promised.. I found one in the bathroom, crying profusely. We gathered ourselves and proceeded to leave the club.  In the end, I am not only appalled, offended and angered that someone from your organization behaves in this manner, I also find it unbelievable that he has no clue of simple policies in your club. If there was a mistake on who handles the bookings, I can understand that but he was so outright rude from the beginning and unwilling to even try to accommodate us it was an immediate problem. A mistake can be rectified and apologized for. A mistake can be forgiven - but what he said to us and how he treated us cannot. There is no excuse for his language and ill will towards us. No one was loud or belligerent with him - other than to be heard over the music (which at one point I did say to him that I could not hear him because of the music and I moved closer to the podium to speak with him. At that point he started walking away from me, then turned and told me to \"get the fuck out\" when I asked him who I could speak with if he couldn't help me). There is absolutely no excuse for half of the party leaving this event in tears. No reason for him to be so belligerent towards us and I would hope that there is some sort of consequence for these types of actions because his behavior along cost you at least $1k that night (20 people admission + drinks etc. for a bachelorette party!), not to mention the word that will spread with the people in my party and those that witnessed it as they were trying to enter.  After a horrible experience for a bachelorette party, I contacted managment of both Tropical Cleveland and Music Box (Colleen). Both replied and apologized completely for the events that transpired with their VP of Ops, Mitch Grattan. (see above). Unfortunately, after the matter was closed, someone who manages the Music Box FB account decided to come back and post a blatant LIE as a response, saying that we got physical in the encounter. This did NOT happen and I am seriously offended that they would even suggest this about my friends and I, without actually investigating first or providing any proof. I have asked them to review cameras of this incident because now they are lying on my name and reputation in public and that will not stand."}
{"text":"I love the setting of the restaurant. There are many tables but not too close together. My party and I arrived early and they were able to seat us  immediately. Before we ordered, Ryan the manager came over and welcomed us. That is always a nice touch. We started off with the calamari and deep fried mushrooms. We loved the calamari but the mushrooms though they looked tempting were a bit bland. I got the friend perch dinner with fries and cole slaw. It was all very good. I won't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"This is a 4-star review, bordering on 5. To start, I did not have high expectations of this place, based on all of the poor reviews I had heard of the Music Box and also, just the name of this place is not appealing. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised and am already planning on returning next weekend!  PROS -You can't beat the atmosphere of this place on a beautiful summer night. Right on the river with a gorgeous view of the east bank of the Flats. They have a pretty long patio and we were seated there right away.  -Live entertainment. While we were there, a Frank Sinatra cover band was playing and it was awesome.  -The service was super friendly and informative. They were running behind in the kitchen and instead of letting us wonder, or waitress was upfront about our orders and when to expect them. She also made a few recommendations and made sure we were aware of the food and drink specials. -The food was really quite good. We started with the ceviche and Lobster Bisque. The ceviche was good but the lobster bisque was on point, and I don't even like lobster bisque! I got the Filet Au Poivre (steak with potatoes and gorgonzola cream) as my main entree, and while it was not the best filet I've ever had, the quality still matched the price I paid for it. Chris got the Pepper Crusted Yellow Fin Tuna and he gave it 5 stars. Next time I go, my entree will definitely be seafood.  CONS -As far as I could see, there was no dance floor to groove on. With all of the great artists and bands they have come through here, you'd think this would exist. -The white wine sangria was just white wine with some fruit thrown in it. Not very good. -Okay, I am going to say it...I cannot stand the name 'Rusty Anchor'. When I hear it, I think 'grungy dive bar', not 'nautical, high-end restaurant'. I hope they consider changing the name!  BOTTOM LINE -I'll be keeping an eye on the entertainment schedule so we can plan some group dinners on the patio here!"}
{"text":"We came for the Evil Ways show and arrived at 6:30 for drinks and dinner.   We loved the atmosphere when we entered and knew the music would be amazing in such a small venue.   We got a table for 2 and our server came for drink orders where we both ordered drinks with Absolute vodka.   After 15-20 minutes she returned to say they had no Absolute.   Ugh!   We agreed on another vodka and it took 10 minutes before our drink arrived.   We weren't in a hurry, but that's just crazy.  The menu is very limited and has many odd items of which we had no interest.    We ordered the risotto balls appetizer, which arrived in a timely manner.   They were very good, but only 3 per order.   My husband ordered the lobster bisque and it arrived hot and tasty.   The puff pastry on top was very difficult to cut apart so he ended up not eating much of that.   We ordered cheeseburgers, medium well, and they took a long time to arrive.  Sadly, when they did arrive, they were very pink inside, but I wanted to be done before the music started so we ate them.    Not at all my favorite way of eating ground meat, but it was ok.   It was huge and we were both stuffed.     After dinner we ordered a glass of Pinot Noir and a Malbec.   I could see the server looking at the glasses the bartender had poured as she wasn't sure which was which.   Instead of asking the bartender, she just gave us each one, and of course she didn't have it correct.   I know my wine, and it's sad the server doesn't.     All in all, I really liked the atmosphere, food was just ok, as was service.   Would definitely come back for a show, but probably not to eat as there aren't many items that appealed to me."}
{"text":"I've been to the Rusty Anchor numerous times. A nice little spot for some seafood and a sparkling view of the river. When you have tickets to a show, it's very convenient to grab a bite and stay in the same building and transition from eating dinner to enjoy some great live music. There's also a nice wine and cocktail list.  So, I was conflicted about my rating. On a recent visit, I had bought my parents tickets to a show for their anniversary and made them a dinner reservation. When they arrived... they were informed they couldn't find their reservation and they didn't have anything available. Naturally, I was livid. However, they did end up acknowledging the mistake and making them a new table within a reasonable amount of time.  I've never understood the people who said they wished they could give a place 3.5 stars. But I get it! I like this place, but i'm weary of reservations now for special occasions. Otherwise, I do like the Rusty Anchor, and I believe in how they are activating that corner of the Flats down on Main Avenue."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the food has always been impeccable. The pork chop was to die for and the walleye was crazy good. The Sunday brunch is a must, and Holy Macaroni love the \"Build Your Bloody Mary\" bar, Love the views of the river and the huge ships drifting by! And you gotta love the diner or brunch/show combo. A CLE must do!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! There was a live band there playing which was nice and entertaining.  It was pretty dark in there when we had dinner so we couldn't get a great visual of what the food looks like..  ordered the surf and turf for dinner and lobster pierogies and pork belly for appetizer..  Lobster pierogies and pork belly were dry.  I couldn't even taste the lobster in the pierogi and the flavor was very bland.  The pork belly was delicious and tender with some bites but other bites were super dry and overly salted.  The surf and turf was beautifully presented! The steak was cooked perfectly how I liked it, leaving it juicy with every bite.  It was beautifully seasoned as well so nothing was needed or added for flavor... The mashed potatoes unfortunately tasted and felt like I was eating instant mashed potatoes. I didn't bother to eat the asparagus because it looked and felt over cooked.  The lobster was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Butter was served on the side for dipping purposes.  Overall, the food was inconsistent but the service was great! I felt like everything was a bit overpriced for what they serve, but the scenery was romantic and the live music helped me rate this place a 4 star!  Would definitely come back here for drinks and live music!"}
{"text":"I have only had one comparable dinner to the one I had two nights ago at the Rusty Anchor.  The last time I had a dinner like this, it was at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant in Las Vegas in 2007!  That's how good it was! I enjoyed the steak au poivre with asparagus and a side salad, and a smokey cocktail.  My husband enjoyed the scallops, which were huge and also very tender and fresh.   Our companions ordered lobster bisque, and seared tuna.  The portions were large and of high quality.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and the potatoes were sublime.  The service was impeccable.   Like another Yelper, I would have to agree that the name needs to be changed as The Rusty Anchor sounds like something out of a Spongebob Squarepants episode and does not reflect the polished, upscale dining and entertainment experience offered here. This is a great place to take someone out to, or to celebrate a special event.  Also, there is a large deck with plenty of seats and a fantastic view."}
{"text":"Great food and view! I wouldn't regularly go here because the prices are a bit steep for my range but when you want to splurge this is a good stop. The view is exceptional and the patio is perfect for a summer evening meal. I got the Bacon and dill pickle Coated walleye and it was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. The sides were alright but the fish made the meal! I'm not sure I would go back but I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"I think we went on the wrong night or something, based on all the great reviews on yelp. But honestly, my boyfriend and I had such a blah experience that it's unlikely we'd try it again.   The guy who took our tickets told us when we got there at 8 that the kitchen was running 45 minutes behind because of some large parties. Should have taken that warning as an omen of the clusterfuck that awaited us, but we had already paid for the valet and we're looking forward to hearing the bossa nova.  The sarcastic, terrible service made me think I was transported back to the 90s Flats, and we were at Dick's Last Resort. when we declined buying a bottle of wine and instead asked for a cocktail menu, our server huffed and puffed away to get one, slammed it down and then walked away. Rude.  We inexplicably had two servers, and when our entrees didn't arrive for over an hour and a half (during which time we never got to order drinks or have water refilled), the vile first waitress came over and simultaneously blamed her serving partner and the computer and expressed that \"it wasn't her fault\" (we didn't imply that it was at any point).   We eventually (close to 10 pm) got our entrees - complete with some undercooked rice with his and an ice cold scalloped potato hockey puck and three limp asparagus spears accompanying my fish.  Every place/server can have an off night, and I swear we are not the kind of people who nitpick or have unrealistic expectations. But at just shy of $100 for only one drink, no bread, no water, abrasive service, and seriously mediocre food, it's enough for me to say Never Again.  Bossa Nova was good, though."}
{"text":"After last night, it's safe to say that my new favorite night out in Cleveland is dinner on the deck of the Rusty Anchor, overlooking the Cuyahoga River, and a show at the Music Box. Though the food needs a little tweaking, it's solid. The cocktails are top notch. Most importantly, the service is EXCELLENT. Jillian was one of the best servers I have had ever. I would definitely recommend the Rusty Anchor!"}
{"text":"I have always known this place as a terrific place to hear music that is more diverse, more intelligent and more hip than the pop stuff you get at the big concert halls so it was a nice surprise to discover that it can provide a really very good meal. I try to do the superfoods when I can so I was pleased to see the avocado paired with the shrimp appetizer. OK, OK, I confess it was a guilty pleasure that they put the bacon on also. Hard to pick out a fish entree from the 11 available options  but since I am a fan of piccata sauce I had the Mahi Piccata and very much enjoyed it. No wonder that the general manager came from Blue Point fish restaurant. Server Heather was fun and took good very care of us."}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch deal in town. $18 gives you a variety of breakfast foods, salads, fruit and breads.  Known for its Eggs Benedict. Yum.  Make your own burrito.  Nice.  Coffee, etc, extra. Full bar service with specialty Bloody Mary's starting at $10. Service was attentive.  Then, listen to the band for a few dollars more.  Excellent way to relax and hear good music and have yummy food. The wide view out the windows is worth it all. Nice occasion for out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"Higher end food, prepared well, (although we did get one cold pasta dish; corrected and brand new dish out shortly thereafter).  Not so extensive wine list, but enough to get by.    You're really paying for the atmosphere, which is worth the price.  Great beet salad, goat cheese salad.  Skip the meh calamari.  Lobster ravioli was yummy.    We were a party of 9 and had great service, with only one server/waiter.  Way to go Drew!"}
