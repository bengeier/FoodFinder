{"text":"Been here before, 1st time for my friend and we had a Deal Chicken coupon.

We arrived early for the sunset and were not dissappointed as the view is amazing.  We had drinks at the bar while we waited for our reservation and the sunset which we went outside on the balcony to watch for a few mintues.  The bar staff was attentive and nice quick with an offer for another drink and refills on the water. 

Our reservation time came and we were escorted to a window table in the dinning room, small, cozy and intimate.   Our three course meal was delicious! The complimentary bread was warm and the butter soft!  Perfect.   We had the carprese salad, seafood bruchette and the flat iron steak served with potatoes and green beans.   Our steaks were cooked perfectly and everything else was just as good.

Our waiter, (forgot his name) was a native Arizonan and we had a nice chat with him.

I highly recommend The Wrigley, but only if you have the money as it is expensive but with the coupon, it certainly was a great deal!"}
{"text":"My family and I attended brunch to celebrate our anniversary.  We had spectacular views of the city along with impeccable service.  We couldn't have asked for a better variety in the brunch buffet.  Crepes, omelettes, prime rib, tacos, lobster, shrimp, creme brûlée and mimosas were just a few of the tasty items we enjoyed.

Our fabulous celebration continued as we explored the grounds and the mansion.  

We will definitely be returning again!!"}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing dinner we have ever had.  The food was terrible, the prices were high, the service was indifferent.  The $13 glass of wine was the only thing that was good.  The people at the next table were sending things back as quickly as they got them (steak too tough to chew, food cold, etc.)  We called to ask about attire and were told \"semi-formal/resort casual.\"  People were in flip-flops, jeans, and even one wearing a baseball cap.  Sorry we dressed up - definitely out of place. Also, valet is pretty much the only way to park if you don't want to walk up a long steep hill - $6.00 plus gratuity.  There are MANY much nicer places to eat in the Phoenix area - wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time and money on this outdated restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I took advantage of the travel Zoo  half price deal, we ended up paying  $120 for a chicken dinner. We had the three courses plus one glass of expensive wine each and coffee. The food was passable nothing to get exited about. The service charge is based on the full price of the meal. We can go to Flemings have a great appetizer, steaks, bake potato, wine, coffee, desert and leave a tip for the same price. I consider this deal a rip off."}
{"text":"My family and I experienced dinner at The Mansion last week and enjoyed it as much as we did their spectacular Sunday Brunch!  I started with the Rock Shrimp and Calamari Tempura. I was so fresh and yummy; had wonderful flavor! My main dish was the Filet -- what a great cut of beef! So tender, and the red wine sauce really added the perfect touch of flavor to the meat. The horseradish mashed and veggies were great, too.  I can't say enough about the views!  Just beautiful!!! If you haven't had the experience, do check it out, you won't soon forget it :)"}
{"text":"We purchased a groupon for dinner.  We got married there several years ago and felt it was a great way to revisit.  We were so disappointed!  The view was spectacular as well as the mansion but our food was mediocre for such a nice place.  We were sat by the wine closet and were interrupted numerous times.  Clearly there was available tables we could have otherwise dined at.  When our coffee came at the end of dinner it was cold and had been sitting for quite awhile.  

We WON'T be back for the food. :("}
{"text":"Great location.  Great views.  Interesting Facility.  VERY marginal food.
We went there for my wife's birthday as someone bought us a gift certificate.  
Our server was great.  He was a great blend of courteous, professional, conversational. 
But the food was poor at best.  My wife's salad included old, rotted lettuce. The entrees were really second rate.  
We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Once again, the food and service was impeccable at Sunday brunch!!!  The food selection is great for everyone...  I am a vegetarian and also gluten intolerant and there was such a variety for me to choose from!  My favorite is their omelet station!  It's outstanding!  And they even had a pancake station that my friend still can not stop talking about!  Everyone is super friendly and helpful!  I had such an amazing second experience and very much looking forward to going back again soon!  So worth it!!!"}
{"text":"This venue will remain one of the places to show visitors and natives alike, the stunning view.  However, brunch is mediocre. One pays for the surroundings, not the quality of the food. There was an abundance of choices, however those items were nothing that elicited a wow. The wait staff was attentive, the Spanish Champagne good enough, the dessert tasty, but as a whole, items were lackluster.  It is a special place, but for really exceptional brunch offerings I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the Mansion on Sept. 15th 2012.  We were visiting from out of town and this was our first visit.  Needless to say it is also our last.  When we arrived my husband placed his Sony A65 SLT camera at his feet under the table. We didn't want to leave it in the car as it needed to be valeted.  Upon exiting the car at our hotel he realized he'd left the camera.  We immediately returned to the Mansion only to find the dining room dark and no camera. The table we'd eaten at had been broken down (we were a group of six and two tables had been joined) so someone on the staff had to have tripped over the camera when doing so. It was on the floor under the table.  The response we got from the management is that they talked with the staff and no one saw the camera.  Not true - the person who broke down the table had to have seen the camera.  Management said maybe another guest took it.  We don't buy that.  They have a thief on staff.  They claim up and down that they have no responsibility. Very, very poor.  That camera was stolen.  On our way back to the Mansion we never expected that the camera would not be there - this is a \"fancy\" place.  Highly recommend you watch your things very carefully if you go there. 
Also the food is way overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate our anniversary and were really disappointed.

The food was OK, but to be seated in a stuffy old room, which appears to be the central dining area was beyond belief!!!

We were there in the evening and asked if we could be seated on the balcony. Answer, \"That's for anniversaries\"! We said that's why we are here. The young and apparently inexperienced hostess all but ignored us and placed us at a table against the wall in the stuffy old room!

We went to the bar area after dinner, still looking for the attractions of the mansion. We found to much lighting at too high a level, obscuring the views of the city.

I have a voucher for dinner there and will try one more time. However, I am not optimistic .

There are a lot of other places in the Phoenix Metroplex to go where you are treated as a special guest and can easily have great views of the city!"}
{"text":"It is worth dining here for the atmosphere and view alone.  The Wrigley Mansion is beautiful and sits on top of a hill, offering a panorama of the city.  Our waiter was knowledgable, friendly, and provided great service.  The food, however, was rather basic and bland with smaller portions.  I expected unique flavors and dishes.  I would not say the food was worth the price tag, but it was worth a visit for the view."}
{"text":"Great all around experience. I enjoyed walking around the mansion and touring a bit before sitting down for the buffet. The views are great and the spread was insane, every kind of food you could want. The staff was great too and very helpful."}
{"text":"We were there for New Years with friends and the atmosphere is second to none with panoramic views of the city. The food was excellent as the Filet I ordered was cooked perfectly and the server was helpful with wine pairings. I would recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"After living in AZ for most of my life, I have finally been to the Wrigley Mansion! Who knew it would take this long and now I can't wait to go back! 

As a surprise, the BF made a dinner reservation here on Friday and it was great! We had a table outside and really enjoyed the amazing view and the atmosphere of this awesome Phoenix gem! 

Overall, the food was pretty good (loved the truffle fries!) and the service was good, although a bit slow, but none of that mattered because it is just too cool of a place! Most of all, you gotta love a night that starts with being handed a glass of champagne and told to go roam at your leisure around this gorgeous property with so much cool history! 

Really worth checking out and also a great location for large and small parties as they have multiple rooms that can accommodate groups! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. I'm a native and am very pleased that they've kept the place high quality. You get what you pay for but in that regard it only gets 3 stars from me. My last time here was a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch celebrating a milestone birthday for my mom. All you can drink champagne and amazing food except for the weak cheese bar and weak dessert bar. For what you are paying I would expect every element to be amazing. Service was extraordinary. When the tip is included some places will skimp on service but not here. Glasses always full. Quick to replace a creaky chair. And great conversation with knowledge of the mansion's history. Plan to spend 1.5 to 2 hours so you have time to pace yourself and then explore the house and grounds."}
{"text":"Poor service - mediocre food - and we made our reservations at 1:00 to have our annual girls Christmas party - and we're not informed we would have to leave at 3:00. Not a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Simply delicious and worth the 4 rounds of amazing food and endless drinks. 134 out the door including 10  extra bucks added to the gratuity that they include on the check. 
I would recommend to anyone but be prepared to soak it all in and be with the one you love for the adventure


We will be back I loved every minute"}
{"text":"Going in I was a little concerned about trying this place after reading some of the reviews here on Yelp but I received a voucher for dinner for two as a gift so since the major portion of the bill would be covered I figured what the heck. First off let me say that some signage would make it easier to find but after turning into The Biltmore Estates off of 24th just head towards the back to the white bridge and cross over it and you are there. Unless you like walking up steep driveways I suggest driving to the top and use the valet parking. Now the food. My wife and I ended up choosing the same items. The seafood cake which reminds you of a crab cake had lobster and crab, was deep fried, tender and moist and was dressed in two sauces that complimented it well as did the veggie garnish. We both had the lemon and spinach soup with risotto. The soup was excellent. Finally, we both had the Three Fish Neopaliton  with another version of risotto and veggies. It too was wonderful. We both had a glass of Seven Daughters Muscat which paired nicely with the fish. For dessert we shared a Chocolate and Blackberry Souffle that was truly a surprise. We began discussing when we may make a return visit for the Brunch offering. We are not foodies but we do know what we like and we are more than meat and potato type diners. We were both impressed. This place is on it's way to being one of the Valley hotspots."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the tour so much. HATED the dinning experience. Wish I could give it negative stars because of the horrible service. The server did not explain how the meal worked on what to pick, correctly so of course there was a price difference in what we thought we ordered. When we  mentioned this the assistant manager, she showed us the menu and said \"it says it right there\" and when we told her well he didn't explain it correctly and we weren't the only one confused she just said the same thing.  The chef gave everyone a dessert on the house so I mentioned that I had payed for a dessert. And since everyone else got it complimentary I asked why should I pay and her response was \"well I will just take their food away from them then.\" I never even got the right dessert that I payed for. Would not recommend it the food wasn't anything spectacular for the price. Would not be back for a dinning experience."}
{"text":"I was here on Saturday, June 4.  There were three of us.  Our server, whose name I forget, was delightful.  I took several picture of the staff and building.  And we felt comfortable asking to have dessert on the deck.  It was a completely relaxed, boozy type of evening.  The food was good, though the menu was somewhat limited.  I look forward to doing it again."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Well, the good things... hostess was pleasant and knowledgeable about the property and we took a self-guided tour.  Views were pretty.  Once we were seated it went downhill.  

Menu was fixed for the Groupon, so no items from the website menu were available.  Basically one could choose the entrée, but when my husband chose the Halibut, oops, no halibut tonight, salmon only.  I wanted the Roulade of Beef... when it arrived it was flat, grilled... not rolled, and tough as nails.  (I took it home, diced it for a taco the next day).  

Oh, yes there were two forgettable \"courses\":  the amuse was a tablespoon of, guess what, Halibut cevice!  (I swear on a my Mother's grave, not even a full tablespoon, but it was served in a Chinese soup spoon so at the least it was easy to eat all of it and not have to chase the tiny morsels around on the plate.  one bite) Then the soup...a clam soup with the clams still in the shell...in bowls that were chipped and cracked.  When we brought it to the waiters attention he just frowned and mumbled that he would mention it...and then a manager type person showed up and told us \"we like the rustic look of the chipped bowls\"  to which my husband asked, attempting to mask his incredulity \"so you actually buy them chipped for the AMBIANCE of chipped dishes?\"  The manager shrugged and walked away.  There was no side dish for the shells so we tried to balance them on the tiny dish below the bowl with little success.    

We decided to order dessert, which was not included in the Groupon.  (Coffee was never offered or suggested)   Carrot Cake.  One can \"assume\" that it is difficult to mess up a slice of carrot cake.  One can be in error on this too.  After about 20 minutes we were able to find our waiter and ask, jokingly, if they were baking it fresh for us.  He snipped at us that in fact it was being made fresh... that was how they did it.  I would have preferred this information sooner as we were really ready to leave this overpriced, snobby, horrid dining room that played bone jangling \"modern\" jazz too loud to converse over which luckily was interspersed with occasional softer music.  

Well the long awaited \"carrot cake\" arrived in a small ramekin... I will attempt to describe:  a treacly brown sugar slush was the first layer, about  1/2 inch thick.  I think it was supposed to be akin to a crème Brule with a torched crust, but the torch was probably out of gas so the crust was missing.  Then below that was another smooshy, slightly carroty (I know I am making up words here) very wet cake like smash of.... I can't find a word or even make one up for this.  

The waiter stated \"the dessert is on us\", gave us the bill (wine was $12 per glass), where the dessert was clearly charged at $7.  Paid the bill, paid to get our car out of valet hock and headed home, laughing at the long anticipated special anniversary celebration dinner I planned for my husband who had never been to the Wrigley Mansion.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Go for the tour and maybe a drink, but skip the unappetizing, tasteless food. The mansion is quite interesting to walk around on your own. Also the  Happy hour with the great view would be very romantic.   Unless you are really interested in a bit of history, skip the tour and walk around on your own."}
{"text":"Sunday night outdoors at the wrigley is wonderful!  Half price bottles of wine, a great buffet and fun, live entertainment.   Our waitress was not great, but it didn't really matter since it was a buffet and we had our wine and glasses.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I went to the Wrigley Mansion with 41 of my closet friends and family. Three days later I contacted Sarah and Megan to discuss a very very small discrepancy in the bill,  $26.00. They both took the time to email me to inform me, too bad!!!  

You can't post without given at least one star."}
{"text":"Please don't make the mistake by using this venue for your wedding, we did...what a huge mistake. They appear to be very accommodating and experienced ....what a major disconnect between staff ,, what we were told,  and what actually took place.
BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with a large group.  The setting is really unique for Phoenix as historical buildings are few and far between in Arizona. The Wrigley Mansion affords great views of the city and mountains with its floor to ceiling windows and how it is situated atop a steep hill.  It really felt like a classy brunch complete with white tablecloths and bottomless mimosas served by the waiters.

Brunch was buffet-style with a huge assortment of food - from waffles, to lobster legs, egg dishes, baked ham, and everything in between. I opted for the omelet station as this was the safest choice for me as far as gluten-free eating. 

The omelet station was great - a lot ingredient options including plenty of veggies and proteins. Even though there was a long line the cook was really friendly & made everyone's omelet to their specifications. I was also glad they had a huge selection of fruit.

Being gluten-free, I did not expect to be able to eat any of the desserts, however it would be a good idea for them to be labeled as they looked great, but you could not really tell what the ingredients were, etc. 

The house itself does appear to be a bit neglected, but at the same time features a ton of original features. It would have been fun to take the official tour and learn more about this historical home. 

Note: Make sure to do the valet parking otherwise the trek up to the top and back down is quite the hike - we had to give some people in our party a ride back down to their car!"}
{"text":"It's always a treat to go to Wrigley's for their Champagne Sunday Brunch! The views are amazing and the beautiful weather yesterday definitely topped it off. The food is always great (I never know where to start, and always eat way too much). The staff, including everyone from valet to our server, were very pleasant, helpful and seemed genuinely happy to be there.  Our server, I think her name was Elaine, was on point and made it a great dining experience.   Hard to pick, but my favorite was probably the salmon, and mimosas of course! I can't wait till the next time!  Also has great photo ops, the grounds are beautiful."}
{"text":"Wrigley For Halloween? - Save your money!
 
We decided to come here for Halloween and spend the pricey admittance fee because we had heard favorably about it from friends that had gone in prior years.  Bar style food was included,  free give-a-ways, lots of halloween like entertainment.    So we forked over the $50 a piece and thought this would be a lot of fun.  More like a ton of disappointment.

$50 bought us entry into the mansion and nothing else.  Oh, did I mention we had to pay for parking too? It was collected as you drove into the property.  That wasn't mentioned anywhere.  Drinks were small, WEAK and overpriced. ($7.00)  Not very decorated at all for Halloween.   They were serving food... appetizers were $10 a piece.  

We overheard complaints from other party goers on how Wrigley had \"cheaped out this year\". I had talked to a couple that had gone for the last 4 years and they also confirmed that this was not the Wrigley they had gone too also and they were also disappointed.

So my review.... I'll never go again.   Total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Went to an event there last night. Beautiful space. Service was horrific. The female bartender in   the main bar was rude and never did serve us. The place was woefully understaffed with several big events along with the regular restaurant, but she can't control that. What was SO frustrating is that she kept serving other guests, ignoring our party of four. After 15 minutes of watching this, we politely asked if we could be served. This clearly made it worse for us, she NEVER took our drink order, eventually another guy hopped behind the bar and took it. We thought about dining at the bar, but that was never offered and couldn't get her to sell us drinks. Hope the manager reviews this and talks with her. Everyone happy to wait their turn, but don't completely ignore some or get some so of system where you know who is next."}
{"text":"It appears, that after the Mansion's August hiatus, the menu was changed to Italian. For Italian, the menu was limited and the food was so-so. There was no flare to the menu and that is probably to coincide with the dreaded ambiance of the restaurant.

We requested a simple biscotti with cappuccino as a desert/after dinner indulgence; however, the restaurant that offers an Italian menu did not have biscotti available.

Maybe we will go back, but not until the new chef works through food creations and changes are made to the menu.

The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a better rating but it's just not as good as it used to be.  Went to Sunday Brunch with family to celebrate the holiday and a special birthday.  Service was okay but forgot coffee after ordering it and always had to be reminded to bring refills.  Food was good but not outstanding as it used to be.  Seafood was limited to 3 items and not easily accessible; meaning we had to ask for it from staff.  Very few vegetarian options beyond salad and vegetable sides.  Valet now has a fee and gratuity was included in the bill, which was not expected for a table of 4.  For a buffet the rate for gratuity was quite high considering limited service.  This is a great mansion with a fantastic view where we liked to visit for special ocassions.  However, the food is much better at other Sunday brunches for less cost.  This now has fallen from our preferred list of sites for brunch."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointing experience. Do not go here if you're under 40; they completely neglect you. Ended up cancelling my wine membership because of it. This place is just not worth it. Beautiful property, but horrible bar staff and management. The front desk woman is a pretentious nightmare (not the young one with the pretty long blonde hair - she's a peach)"}
{"text":"I don't fine dine as often as I would like but this was by far an experience for our anniversary.  The waiter and the whole experience was perfect.   There are few times you are really wow-ed in life that last and this was the best.  What made this a top notch experience was the location, food, and amazing waiter.  The waiter was very attentive but not annoying - he was extremely well trained and it showed.  Never felt rushed to get out and we spent a good deal time and enjoyed all the courses at our speed without someone sweeping in to take dishes constantly.  History and the house is very interesting end to the evening.  I can't recommend this enough.  It is fine food without the pretentious.  We had the filet mignon.  One thing we didn't know until we asked was you have to order side dishes with your meal so make  sure you ask.  I think we were so impressed we overlooked that on the menu.  It is very reasonable given the quality of the food.  Presentation, taste, and service were absolutely impressive.  You cannot go wrong if you take your in-laws or spouse here.  Make sure you reserve earlier online so you have time to roam the mansion and take in the history.  Best money I ever spent and I even tipped far more than I ever do since  it was so impeccable.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Wrigley Mansion on our first official date. To say the least it was amazing! 

Although parking may seem to be a challenge, but there is always Valley Parking, which is not too expensive. The view from this place is just spectacular - you see the whole Phoenix at your feet! 

Since I come from Europe I immediately appreciated the architecture of the mansion. The rooms are rather small to modern taste, but for the times when if was build, of course, these are just perfect. When you go, definitely check out the bathrooms! Most of them have a comfy couch where you can lounge for a bit, but don't take too long as there may be a line of people waiting after you :)

The food was great! We had duck and salmon. It came out of the kitchen really fast and was very delicious for our European taste buds. Service was not annoying, they allowed us some privacy, which is awesome for the first date :)

The hall where we ate had live music. I think they have someone perform every night on the weekend. And right before we left, we visited  the hall next door and learned to Swing dance with a group of regulars :) 

It was a very fun date and definitely worth the time and money!"}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.

I have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.

I started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entrée I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.

The beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.

The purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price."}
{"text":"WOW, perfect evening!  From the impeccable customer service and cozy atmosphere to the amazing food, it was certainly an unforgettable experience!  It's been three days since I've been there, and yet I can't stop thinking about the mouth-watering decadence...melt-in-your-mouth foie gras with fig....peanut butter crème brulee with fresh berries.  A little slice of heaven!"}
{"text":"Have you tried Fireside Sunday evenings? A band, outdoor patio seating, best view in the state, firepits, heat lamps, free buffet (if your table spends $20+ on drinks, easliy done! esp. since they have drink specials). Great for family, kids, older, younger, date nite."}
{"text":"I didn't stay to eat, so I really can not rate the food or service, The mansion was absolutely beautiful, its a great central location and I totally recommend it for weddings, events, or parties; but I was really looking forward to their Sunday Happy Hour at Geordie's on the Patio, so we tried to go on 4th of July. The only food available were a choice of 5 sandwiches:( hot dogs, chicken, burger, brats, mahi-mahi with a choice of one side.) Although I understand it was meant to be like a barbecue, and possible special event for the holiday, there were no options if you were a vegetarian such as a simple salad. The beer choices were Bud light, miller light, I think Corona and Michelob, so if you like a craft beer you are out of luck. I recommend the option for a selection of a few craft beers, and a little more variety in food. The Patio was definitely beautiful with a fantastic view, in a cooler weather situation would be optimal---there were no misters set up and there were only two umbrellas in the middle that shaded about 2 tables on the entire patio, so most of the seating was in the sun, and here in Phoenix it is a little too hot to be sitting outside for long periods without some relief from the sun and during the summer months it does not get dark until around 8pm. I was really looking forward to seeing Delcoa play, but by bad timing I guess we showed up during a break in between sets. I would have really liked this place under slightly different circumstances. The Happy hour definitely has potential."}
{"text":"Awesome Sunday brunch!  Love the views and the historic home!!  A local favorite! Such a great location!  Yummy food for lunch and dinner too"}
{"text":"My wife took me to The Wrigley Mansion for father's day and it was excellent.  Seating started at 11AM but they had a glass of champagne in my hand as soon as we got there.  I couldn't ask for or expect better food from a buffet.  My favorites were the BBQ Pork (crispy cracklins with moist, tender meat attached) and the Hangar Steak Eggs Benedict (perfectly cooked and south west seasoned hangar steak in a standard Egg Benedict).  The food food selection had a noticeable \"guy\" twist to it but the selection was pretty small.

The staff was generally excellent.  The only exception was our waiter who acted like the tip was in included, which it was.  Our dour waiter is the only reason I docked them one star and the only thing that might deter me from coming back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry,it just did not fulfill are expect ions.The chicken piccata was deep fried with a heavy potato purée.It was was unedible.It just went on and on.the only good thing was the wine to numb the pain of the worst I can remember."}
{"text":"We took the tour and had lunch afterwards. It was a thorough and enjoyable tour. Lunch afterwards was great. Views and food were both excellent."}
{"text":"I have now attended a few events at Wrigley, or \"The Mansion\" as I like to call it. 

\"What are you doing tonight?\"
\"Oh I am attending a little soiree at 'The Mansion.\" 

I want to live here,,,and be Batman...maybe Iron Man, I haven't decided for sure. 

Go here. Be Tony Stark, or Bruce Wayne for the night.

There is something indescribably awesome about donning the pocket square and having drinks and socializing in a friggin masion.

The drinks tend to be pricey but if they weren't I don't know if I would feel nearly as cool being here. 

When I live here I will throw crazy UYEs so you should all be prepared to dress the nines and party all night."}
{"text":"Big wine list. Impressive setting and location, and the servers were both polite and professional. I would say the food is about a 7, however.  As others have said, save the $15 and tour the mansion yourself."}
{"text":"The place is just beautiful with great service.

Perfect for a date or a private conversation.

The food was good but not impressive. Food wise I would give them 3 stars but the place and service made it up for the 4th.

I had the asparagus salad and the salmon. both were good. Period.

The bread was really good, though.

They have a great wine selection and the prices aren't that bad.

I'm a sucker for Riviera del Duero and they have plenty of them. Funny fact, the fist one I selected wasn't available. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"I wrote this to Open Table and they did not publish. DO NOT GO HERE! Sunday brunch on Valentines Day weekend was horrific!! From the start the chair was BROKEN! They just moved it to another table. If the health dpt went here it would be shut down. Filthy and disgusting. Bacon that spent about 30 seconds on the grill. Crepes that were HARD and rubbery. Taco bar with no spoons for the condiments. \"Steaks\" that no one would touch. Pancakes that look like a 5 year old made them. People walked around in disgust. The desert bar was rifled through and the leftovers were hard from sitting there for hours. The utensils had tons of caked on food from hours of use. The fruit and coffee were excellent...but for $115.00 for 2 that was some expensive fruit. The view is over rated, but the grounds are well maintained. Cannot believe that this was just a bad day. WOW!!!"}
{"text":"Booked this place for my wife's 40th and called them on the phone saying I wanted a reserved table and it was there all setup nicely. Our waiter was very pleasant and the food was good. A pity it got too dark for us to enjoy the environs but redirect would go back. It's a nice place to hang out and the view is phenomenal."}
{"text":"My sister, my boyfriend and I came here for the \"name your own price\" lunch on a Saturday. We parked at the bottom parking lot. (there's valet at the top entrance). And trying to be lazy, we tried to do a shortcut and ended up entering from the outdoor patio. People were looking at us all weird, not knowing where exactly we'd come from. We were able to get a table on the patio. The view you get here is so relaxing and beautiful. Sitting outside made us forget how hot it was, there were plenty of shade.  

We all shared the Cesar Salad and it had a generous portion of grilled chicken, the dish was good. For an entree, I ordered the Mahi Mahi with curry sauce and jasmine rice. The fish was cooked perfectly, but the rice was too over done. The bf ordered the cheeseburger..the burger was blah but the fries were good. My sister ordered the Vegetable Medley Pasta, it was just eh. 

Since you get to choose the price you want to pay, they hand you a blank check and you write in the amount. We paid just over twenty for all the food and just about the same for the tip. 

Our waiter wasn't the friendliest guy, but everyone else was great. The next time I go back, I'd like to take the tour after lunch and walk off some of the food. Also, if you're just short on money you can always just come and leave a good amount of tip."}
{"text":"I took my whole family to the Sunday brunch. The meal cost $49 per person. I will start with the beautiful view and the historic magnificence of this mansion. My daughter is getting married there in the coming spring so we thought it would be great to have a meal there together before the big event. It is a great site for a wedding. I wish I could say the food was out if this world. The omelettes were made to order and so were the pancakes which were good. I loved all the fresh fruit. The salmon was also good. However, the rest of the food not so good.   The croissant was dry and the prime rib was chewy. The seafood average. I so wish I could give this restaurant a glowing review. I can't even say the service was that great. They do keep filling up the mimosas but I had to ask for more hot water for my tea and my daughter had to ask for more coffee. I did enjoy the pianist! She was amazing. I think the meal is overpriced unless you think it is worth the view."}
{"text":"We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The onion soup was good, the caesar salad romaine was not fresh and it had too much dressing. My salmon appeared to have been cooked long ago and was served with nothing except for a few pieces of lettuce. Hubby's Halibut was so-so and the brussels sprouts were almost raw with no flavor at all.  The chocolate, no flour cake presentation was lovely, but the cake was very dry. Press Coffee was excellent.  I doubt we will go back.  Oh, we waited 15-20 minutes for our cocktails, too."}
{"text":"Living a few blocks from this beautiful spot and as a wine club member, I really am rooting for these guys. The new renovations are really nice, we've had some inconsistent meals in the past but really love the spot. However, the hospitality and price/value leaves much to be desired. On our last visit, although there were several seats at the bar that appeared open the bartender sternly said \"MY (really, your's?) bar is full. Even if that is the case, there is a much better way to handle that. Apparently everyone with a bunch of empty glasses and tea cups got up to watch the sunset. Funny, they didn't come back. We went into the wine bar where I ordered a $20 glass of chablis, only a five ounce pour. It's pretty much an industry standard (yes, I've been doing hospitality for 30 years and am trained as a beverage manager) to pour four glasses out of the bottle at that price point. The bill came and the glass of wine appeared at $25 - when we pointed it out the server said \"there's a typo on the menu\". Really, I thought there was a typo on the check?...... Also at that price point they should offer some sort of snack (nuts, etc) with beverages. Note, the salt will increase your beverage sales. The new menu is overly continental and snooty. Overall staff has a very haughty attitude not matched with the gracious hospitality and cleanliness one would expect from a luxury restaurant with a world class setting. Also bars need a good deep clean (noticeably smelly) and staff appearance standards are highly inconsistent. I really would love this neighborhood treasure to benefit from more professional standards and management."}
{"text":"My now wife and I just had our wedding at The Wrigley and we could not have been happier! The space is amazing, their kitchen is THE BEST and the staff made the evening perfect and unforgettable without being hectic.

The space itself - beautiful, elegant, charming.  We did not want to have to import or create an ambiance from scratch for our wedding, and after searching through many venues from barns to fields to deserts or gardens and ballrooms, we chose the Wrigley Mansion because of its charm and one of kind ambiance.  Its a truly unique venue that offers an unbelievable character. 

The kitchen cranked out some of the most delicious food you could ask for, all our guests were BLOWN AWAY by the appetizers and the main courses, there was not a single complaint and the staff took amazing care of us and our guests.  10 out of 10 no question.  

Weddings can be hectic and pricey, and we wanted as much of a \"turn key\" scenario as possible, the Wrigley Mansion delivered this to us for a great value with high end food, amazing views that you cannot get elsewhere in Scottsdale and an amazing staff that was there every step of the way to make our wedding the best - 100% recommend looking at the Wrigley Mansion for your wedding or event!"}
{"text":"Great menu...food was amazing. Server had a wonderful personality, but I rarely saw him. Absolutely beautiful here. Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"Love this place and it's a great place to bring out of town guests as well!! Great staff!!!"}
{"text":"We started out with the tour.  You can do it before or after lunch.  You have a choice of two lunch options.  A one course lunch for $25.00 or 3 course lunch for $35.00.  Wine, beer, or cocktails are optional.  They have a First tier somiere (sp?)for wine so they have a phenomenal wine list, if you are into that.

We got the 3 course meal.  Two sections have multiple choices to choose from.  Desert had one choice.  Everything was excellent and tasty.  

Service was spot on and very classy.  Some people come here dressy, like going to church.  Others are quite casual.  Its all good.  Inside is air conditioned.  You can walk around sell paced after your lunch, if you wish.  Was definitely a must see attraction and well worth the $$.  Also, people have formal events here like weddings and such.  So awesome."}
{"text":"Slightly awkward... But decent.. kinda over priced, kinda over hyped...but thats what i expected. Went here for my Beautyface's birthday dinner. I think we would try to visit the lounge next time, but I doubt we would return for the whole dinner thing. Should have sit on the patio instead of the stuffy dining area... Just not our cup of tea... the mansion is nice though."}
{"text":"I recently dined at the Mansion for the first time, since my arrival to Phoenix, many years ago.  Wow, was I ever disappointed.  I thought the food was horrific.  Actually no one at our table liked theirs.  It was tasteless and cold.  The salad was watery and tasteless.  The vegetables were suppose to be roasted.  There was no heat in the dining area that we were seated in and with dresses,  we were freezing.  The view was beautiful, that was it.  There are way to many choices in this town to ever go back.  For being at the Wrigley Mansion, I expected excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty disappointing for the price, and the drinks menu left much to be desired.  The music was ok, and the service was very close to on-point for the size of the party.  The space is tremendous; as many have said, it's one of the very few places like it in Phoenix with real history.  I just wish they would bring the kitchen and bar up to the same level as the location."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge a non-member fee to eat there, make it nice. The arrangement of tables was makeshift, the furniture mangy looking, there were flies fighting at the window, dirt in our water...twice!, and the main dishes were super dry. Our waiter was also some of the worst service I've received. He chastised me and my boyfriend for not being married, then did an awkward sales pitch for weddings there. He then came back to our table 5 other times to talk about the types of weddings they've done there, how much money other guests have spent there....all without us asking a single question. He rambled. The calamari and Bloody Mary were good and there's a great view of Phoenix. Would recommend for the happy hour, not for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing Staff!!! The view of the entire city is second to none, as is the service. Very thoughtful and caring staff who make sure your time there is absolutely pleasant. Whether your at the sports bar, or having there tasteful brunch/lunch/dinner, Wrigley Mansion caters in every way. I recently proposed to my fiance at The Wrigley Mansion and the staff from top to bottom were amazing in assisting throughout the setup/planning process. I'll be a member forever!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a tour and lunch. Very nice place, with million dollar views. The lunch menu was simple, but still had a variety. 

Different but delicious. 

Would recommend to anyone just for the view alone."}
{"text":"The views are spectacular!  The food is good, and the wait staff is very friendly.  Definitely a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We did the tour of the mansion with lunch to follow. The place is filled with so much interesting history we just loved it.  

Lunch was interesting....

They have a promotion going on that for lunch you name the price of the meal. I really thought, ok this may not be that good... But just the opposite. The plates were huge and the food was very tasty. I had the beef dip with white truffle fries and it was so much I couldn't finish it. My dad had the penne pasta with shimp. And where you'd think you'd get these itty bitty shimps, that is not the story here. They were very large and plentiful. My boyfriend had the veggie wrap and he enjoyed all the fresh veggies and salad. The hardest part was coming up with a price for the entree, it was all so good we averaged our meal between $10-$15 for each plate."}
{"text":"Was in the area and my girlfriend has never been there so went for a drink and watch the sunset on the patio....Amazing views and the service was great!!! Now need to try dinner there....Will be back"}
{"text":"I went to the wrigley mansion for my birthday.  I was so dissapointed.  I bought a travel zoo coupon so they gave a separate menu with not so appealing dishes.  I settled on the fish dish. It had very little taste.  It seemed like banquet food.  My husband and I each had a martini and the bill came to $60.00 after we paid for the $59.00 coupon.  They tack on the gratuity and the tax as if the meal was 120.00.   Food was fair, service fair.  I would never go here again"}
{"text":"Location/venue is beautiful. It has great history and is fun to explore. The bar is \"eh\" and the food really didn't match the atmosphere. They let their atmosphere carry their so-so restaurant & bar."}
{"text":"We went to yesterday's Sunday Champagne Brunch.  Outstanding!! $49 per person seems steep until you experience it and realize that it is well worth it.
There is a cook to order omelet chef ready to tempt you with an assortment ranging from vegetables, ham, cheese, etc (bay shrimp was not represented).
There was another chef at a prime rib & lamb carving station.  Tip: The shrimp & crableg offering is behind him.  I missed it until my refill trip.
There are separate tables for fruits, salads, pastas, deserts, etc.  
They epitomize the term \"bottomless\" mimosas.  Our servers, Casey & Prince, were always available to refill once you hit the glass is half empty stage.  The champagne and orange juice are poured separately so you see your portions.
When you return from your refill trip at the food tables, the servers have refolded or replaced your napkin.
The views of the Valley are outstanding.  We sat in the west wing area.  There are an ample number of windows so that just about any table will offer great views.  However, our table for two was right at the window. Great!!
Tip: The west wing dining room has far superior views compared to the north dining room.
Each Sunday Champagne brunch has a jazz sax player and a piano player.
Check out the library which has the original books provided by William Wrigley when he built the huge mansion.
We did not have time for a tour but plan to return to enjoy it.
Wrigley did more than just sell gum and build Wrigley Stadium in Chicago!!!"}
{"text":"We had the company Christmas party here a year or two ago.  I had made sure everything we needed was in the contract, but most importantly, the exemptions were spelled out (namely the liquor...)  Throughout the party, I was reminding servers what was next.  They forgot one appetizer until I brought it to their attention (and showed them a copy of the contract I had).  The food was almost mediocre.  That's one of the memories the staff still has: being surprised at how bad the food was.  

When I received the bill, the wait staff had been completely inattentive to the restrictions, allowing staff members to order a number of ports.  \"Nobody\" could help me that night, so I waited until the following week to get the issues addressed with the WM booking agent.  

In her exact words: \"You're lucky we kept to any part of the contract at all.\" What?!?  I repeated it back and she said Yup.  They do their best, but they don't have to honor the contract at all, and since she had our card number (for the down payment to reserve the space), there was nothing we could do.  

I will NEVER go back.  

Not as a company, and not me personally."}
{"text":"This is a direct quote from my wife after brunch, \"I am 100% satisfied.\"  Selection is amazing, value is amazing, and views are better than all of that.  Ask to get a tour- unbelievable history of the Wrigley family and the Biltmore area.  Request Ben to give the tour.  He knows his stuff!  I would STRONGLY recommend the Wrigley for brunch.  I will definitely be back to check out lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"A very good informative tour on the history of the mansion and the man himself. The tour guide pretty much talks nonstop for one hour, but she covers his whole life and we get to see nearly all the rooms and even the bathrooms of the place. Wrigley only spent a few months here a year, but built everything for his tiny sized wife. The views from alot of the rooms are epic and some of the photos of Wrigley's Cubs year's were interesting. The tour is $15 and it is worthy of your time. The mansion has alot of building secrets and if you just spend $5 and wander about yourself then you won't get the true feeling of the building."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! My wedding was held here today and ai have to say that things were extremely organized from the very beginning. The Mansion is amazing! The cook Christopher makes sure the dinner options are suitable to any and all palates. I had the pleasure of working with Megan to coordinate the wedding. Not only was she organized but she was very friendly and helpful in making sure everything ran smoothly. Thank you for making our day extra special. We will be back time and again to this wonderful venue"}
{"text":"The grounds of this grand old house made me feel like I was back in D.C.  The view of the sunset from the lounge patio won't make a Phoenix resident jump up and down, but it is understandable why the tourists become excited and start pulling out their cameras.  
This place is for grown ups, but it doesn't mean 20 and 30 somethings shouldn't come here to have a good time. In fact, the bar is just relaxed enough that Mill Avenue amateurs might not  feel too uncomfortable trying their hand at an adult drink like a highball glass(not a shot) of bourbon with a few drops of  water.  There is a classic look and feel to this place, no billiards, no plastic darts, video games or a juke box.  This is not a soda fountain, so practice drinking something that doesn't involve Red Bull or end in \"tini\" unless it is a martini    I've read some comments about the lounge singer, and all I will say on that matter is that I'm pretty sure he is not drunk during his performances, he is just having a good time, as was just about everyone who watched."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times for drinks, and have had dinner once so far. The grounds are superb, the restaurant was elegant and the food was tasty. I visited for dinner in January; the meal my date and I had was fantastic. The service was outstanding! Arrive at least 40 minutes before your dinner reservation so you can tour the mansion. Solid!"}
{"text":"I am pissed!  I have been attending the Wrigley Mansion for music on the patio for over a year now, and have been raving to all of my friends about it.  All the stars happened to align this last Sunday, and ten (10) of my friends attended with me.

I was embarrassed because it was no longer the same Wrigley.

In two weeks (since I was there last), all the rules changed.  The cool band, Delcoa, is no longer the band.  There is no longer a $7 buffet.  There remains half price bottles of wine, but they increased the price of the bottles.  Um, excuse me, but if I am going to a casual event on an outdoor patio, why the hell would I buy a $90 bottle of wine (discounted to $45...ooh, what a bargain)!!!?  I swear, even the outdoor lighting has been removed!!!

And they have no Facebook presence where I might have been notified...nothing different on the website to indicate a \"rebranding.\"

They did still have a good crowd.  I think the crowd follows the band, so all of these people were new to me.  But they were not prepared.  The service was very poor.  (Remember, I was seated at a table of 10...Hello!!!?  Cha Ching!!!?)

It's likely I won't be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend from outta town suggested we have dinner here last week. 

The mansion & it's history is what I really loved about it. We walked around and peeked in all the rooms before we ate. Kinda has a spooky vibe- heard it was haunted! 

Service for dinner was great! The food was just okay, I had the Filet and it was just so-so. I would not order a steak there again. We decided to indulge in caviar- pricey but yummy! 

We sat outside and the views were amazing. We even saw fireworks coming from a baseball game ?

I will be back for Sunday Brunch- heard that's their specialty! Bottomless mimosas & lots of seafood ! I'll update once I am able to go!"}
{"text":"High End ? What make this high end?  Thy serve mimosas....and that is why some people think this is high end. I am in the restaurant business...as i usually say before writing a review. So...once again what makes The Wrigley Mansion high end....anyone ? The food is sub par. The service is fine. They have taken away several of the better offerings. 2nd time there and both times i asked what am I missing? Sure the mansion is nice...but brunch lacks...ALOT. Food was really unappealing and just zero wow..or even  \"thats nice\". No real substance to anything food wise. Too bad it could be the place for brunch.......it is losing what it should be and worse it is showing the lack of true culinary innovation and in my opinion screams \" hey we are the Wrigley mansion .....oh and yeah we have some sysco mid quality food to prove it\". Real disappointment."}
{"text":"The atmospher in this place is great, but you would expect that for a huge mansion in central Phoenix.  Our food was good;  however, our waiter was brisk. We had to ask him to talk slower and repeat menu items as he went too fast.

Our food took 45 minutes.  Since we were on the tour this was a problem. We did not order anything that required a long cooking time.  Just a burger, mahi sandwich and a salad. So we quickly ate and paid the bill. Never had a chance for a cup of coffee or to even consider a dessert. 

If it wasn't for the mansion and the surroundings I would find another place to eat. The house is gorgeous and the stories are fun.  I like considering what it would look like when the Wrigley's built it.  This is one of the few homes in Arizona that would be considered American royalty.

PS - my friends bacon burger looked nothing like the one posted in their pictures."}
{"text":"I have to say, overall I was a disappointed in the Wrigley Mansion. The last time I was there was for a massive Halloween Bash, which was awesome! This time I was there for cocktails and appetizers. 

The service wasn't great until the third bartender took care of us. Megan was amazing and we greatly appreciated her! 

When my husband and I first got there we ordered the Cocktail of the Day which was a Berry Mojito. My husband doesn't love super sweet cocktails so he asked them to make the drink as least sweet as possible. Instead, they literally added sugar to the top quarter of the glass. Of course, this made the drink incredibly sweet. When he ordered the IPA beer that was suggested, they brought him a Kiltlifter which was the wrong beer. I asked for sliced cucumbers in my drink and specifically asked for them not to be muddled. While the cucumbers where not muddled, they were chopped into little bits that got stuck in the straw and may as well have been muddled. We went to order a flatbread and both options had Humboldt Fog Alfredo. Eww! I don't care for goat cheese and didn't have the option to alter the flatbread to something I preferred. The last bummer aspect was that valet was $10. I've never seen it that expensive at a restaurant before and had I realized that, we would have self parked. 

Enough of the negative points and now for a few positives. My husband ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders and did advise those were very good. I tried the homemade potato chips and those were delicious. My next drink was served perfectly with sliced cucumbers and great balance. Lastly, Megan did take off the Berry Mojito from our tab which was extremely kind of her. If we go back. I will definitely request Megan."}
{"text":"Best Halloween Party in the valley.   Get your friends organized and come to this Halloween party.   It is awesome.   I have gone two years now and am amazed at the creativity and boldness of the costumes.   It is a perfect venue.   It is really like roaming around in a haunted house.   Two live bands and the drink prices were reasonable.    Hey,  two girls were only wearing body paint!  Wow.

The view at sunset is just breathtaking.    Great place for a really special date."}
{"text":"Attended a Wine Tasting Dinner there on 01/24/17 with about 100 other customers. The room & ambiance was excellent and the staff were magnificent as were the wine selections which were offered by Master Sommelier Mr. Michael Jordan although his informative and amusing dissertations may well have given the Executive Chef panic attacks .
The dinner itself however must get a very mixed review.
The Amuse Bouche was an overcooked cold scallop and not very tasty. 
The first course was a beautifully prepared pan seared Sea Bass which was hot and the sides of Bok Choy, rice & lemon 'beurre blanc' were wonderful.
A great start but then the second course of Veal Tagliatelle was dreadful it was stone cold on cold plates, dried out from resting too long with dried out Chantrelles and little modules of veal which were hard to find.
The third course of Berkshire Pork Chop was lukewarm and mine was all fat with very little meat. The food was virtually cold and inedible to me.
The saving grace was the Ancho Chili Chocolate Creme Brûlée which was lucious & delightful.
With six more Wine Dinners coming up throughout their Spring/Summer, the chef must be given the resources he needs to enable him to purchase better quality produce and enough warming drawers to heat plates.
It may be necessary to stagger the serving to tables to allow the kitchen time to get quality food out to them.
If the management can ensure better food served hot, I would certainly attend future events but there are many kinks to be worked out."}
{"text":"Well I certainly wouldn't mind living here...unless spearmint flavored ghosts wander the halls after midnight. Anyway...I had a lovely evening here celebrating the birthdays of Matthew and Shannon and even Emily (?) whom I hadn't met. The place absolutely targets an older crowd but the indoor lounge space above the bar was comfortable enough for our group and nearly private. 

I'm not a huge liquor drinker so I missed out on the five dollar cocktails until 7PM and their wine list was okay but had very few by the glass options. The chef's taco of the night was cod and even though it was a frozen battered affair, the seasonings really brought it to life. The tortillas were a disaster though, they were literally pulled straight from the Mission flour tortilla bag and not even heated. sad. Oh i snatched a few truffle flavored french fries from Christina and thought they were just right...mmm french fries...

Wrigley's has a beautiful organic feel to it, the way it hugs the hilltop and the views are killer! Briana was very friendly and it was nice to see the chef come up to say hello too. The Friday night live music was not my speed, but god bless that man for singing his heart out to a practically empty room. I think this would be a great place for a private party, maybe a rehearsal dinner or business party."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our wedding reception at the Wrigley Mansion in late 2013 and have dined there numerous times since. The setting is extraordinary. The reception (both the prep and the event) left nothing to be desired. And our subsequent dining experiences are consistent in good cuisine, good service and great ambiance. As far as down-sides, the menu is a bit more limited than many restaurants, though not more so than other higher-end ones. Also, we have noticed a little bit of turnover over time. However, the product, the service and the experience have remained consistently excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Plan your day here. There are several tours which starts at 10 am, followed by 2 pm and 4 pm. They have lunch tours or have dinner and watch the sunset.  We did not plan on going here thus did not get to do any tour. We had dinner w/c was awesome. I had the osso bucco, tender  and delicious. My husband had the scottish salmon on a wood plank. According to him, it was delicious, moist and had no fishy smell. The best part of the dinner is the superb service we experienced. We were still able to go around ourselves and toured the different rooms after dinner. Btw, happy hour is from 3-6 pm."}
{"text":"Great music good friendly staff good food. GREAT VIEW"}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  Great for a date or a gathering with some friends.  Will be doing this again and recommending it to others"}
{"text":"Romantic relaxing atmosphere. Spectacular food and service. 
Hidden gem down the road from the Biltmore hotel. Had the lobster bisque, lamb shank, wine....so utterly delicious. Will go again for sure. Worth every penny....although I was lucky enough to snag a Groupon deal this time. Next time....I'll have to plan for it. They've got a Happy Hour too as well as live jazz certain nights. Enjoy the self-tour and save yourself the $15 to go through a guided tour of the Wrigley gum winter home."}
{"text":"Wonderful tour and a fabulous lunch with the ladies.  I can't wait to take my husband for dinner in the evening. The view was so great really look forward to seeing it at night"}
{"text":"I have to add to the chorus of 5-stars...My g/f and I were here a couple of weeks ago, and sat out on the deck of Geordie's sipping happy hour martinis and cosmos the likes of which only \"The Mansion\" can serve up. Our server was ultra-friendly and helpful as we soaked up one of the best views in the Valley. We had the pomme frites as a shared appetizer with some kind of bleu cheese topping - c'est magnifique! Cost was very doable. We also enjoyed wandering around the place learning the history of this beautifully and authentically preserved gem of Phoenix. Go as soon as you can, and yes - call ahead to make sure they aren't closed for a special event."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Phx in 97,  I was trolling the web and saw this place pop up.  Decided to make a reservation and take my daughter somewhere special for her birthday.  We the tour.  Everything was very interesting.  However, when it came to the food.  I was quite a bit disappointed.  My daughter ordered a hamburger/fries.  The burger was not well done and it tasted funny.  I had a salad, that again tasted as if it had been sitting in a dusty attic.  maybe I just went on a bad day?  It isn't a cheap place to eat either, you'll pay for the ambience and the name Wrigley Mansion. Went there again for a company function \"Annual Halloween Party.  Had a blast that time, didn't have to pay and the costumes were elaborate to say the least.  Great Fun!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a large group and we went on a tour of the mansion before lunch. We had the juicy fruit package which is $25. Included is ice tea or a soft drink. Alcohol is available for purchase. You can choose from a soup or a salad or a main course. Main courses are Italian steak sandwich,hamburger,chicken breast sandwich,margherita pizza, or pasta of the day. The main courses come with Tuscan fries or mixed green salad. Our group received both and they were served family style. We ate in Mrs. Wrigley's bedroom. There are other packages available that include dessert. We had great service and a great tour guide. I believe the tours are Wednesday through Saturday at 10am,noon,1pm, and 3pm."}
{"text":"Impressive. Breathtaking. Elegant. Classy. No woman would want to compete with that but the Wrigley Mansion will share the spotlight with you. It renders a time of such sophistication and beauty that should be bottled up. The grounds are meticulously maintained and food is wonderfully crafted. Service and staff are just stellar. Trust me, after a few drinks, you wish you could slip into your PJs and go upstairs. They leave you feeling like you're home. I can't believe people complain about valet. Hand over the $5 unless you want to work up an appetite or show off your calves climbing uphill, your date would not appreciate it in heels. And by the time you make it up to the top, you might miss the gorgeous sunset views. 

I love coming here for the champagne brunch alone. How many ways can I have my eggs!!! Everything is exceptional from eggs benedict, french toast to simply the fruit selection. It truly is an experience any native Phoenician should partake and certainly a way to seduce our visitors to fall in love with the desert. I recently spent my birthday celebration here and that was yet another lovely and memorable experience. Having drinks at Geordie's alone will leave you imprinted with a fantastic smile. With that said, don't come here if you want a cheap run-of-the-mill buffet. Stop over at Denny's or at the local diner. It isn't something you do every day. Much like fairy tales, they happen and are far in between, but the memory lasts a lifetime. Everyone deserves to be swept off their feet and the Wrigley Mansion will be your Prince Charming."}
{"text":"The view is awesome.  Way better view than from Hilton's Different Pointe of View.

That said, we bought the Travelzoo voucher for a dinner for two.  First course consisted of shrimp cake or butternut risotto.  The risotto was bland, and the shrimp cake was very flavorful, but the sauces on the plate were noncontributory.  

For second course we tried the tomato fennel soup and the green salad.  Chef Ramsey would've had a field day - the portions were vastly different among the group.  The salad was good, but not very proportionally or attractively plated.  The soup was ok but nothing to write home about.

For entrees we got the beef medallion and the trio of fish.  Portions are pretty small here..  the medallions basically looks like a fancified Banquet dinner.  The gravy was sweet and the dish was pretty tasty, but not for the price.  The fish over couscous was cooked well.  Not the most satisfying dish.

We got dessert of chocolate swirl cheesecake that the server said was \"phenomenal\".  I'd save the 8 dollars and get some Ely's at a grocery store.  The espresso creme brulee was more creme than brulee.  

Even with the voucher, the tab came out to about 55.  I had a wine (the worst wine I've ever had at a restaurant, it tasted like they had it open for a day and watered it down) and the cheesecake, but there was gratuity for original tab (120) and with tax, it was about 55.

All in all, I would have liked to check out the view during the day as well, but I definitely wouldn't come for the food.

The server probably could have been a bit more professional.  We had a large group and in the beginning he gave us a lot of attitude about the division of tabs.  Understandably overwhelming and maybe frustrating, but \"holy f***\" is not a very appropriate thing to say right in front of the guests."}
{"text":"Great brunch, unlimited champagne, best views. You can also tour the mansion afterwards with a drink in hand! Impeccable service. An absolute must when visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"Beautiful, but old.  Nothing spectacular about the venue itself, but absolutely worth it for the view.  The view from the restaurant and patio were incredible at night to nearly see 360 degrees.  Make sure you pay to valet and plan on staying a long while to take it all in.  Great way to see the metro."}
{"text":"It's a bad feeling when you walk away from a restaurant feeling that you've been ripped off. It can spoil the experience when you are focused on what you paid, and not on enjoying the savory feeling of the food in your mouth.

My wife and I, at the Wrigley Mansion for my birthday, couldn't believe that this place is racking up a high average review. It was unbelievably bad. The food was marginal -- so marginal that we wondered, are we in the same restaurant that these others reviewed? And the \"deal\" that we went in with . . .  wow, what a loser. We had a Travelzoo prepaid voucher, which was supposedly worth $120. That voucher was for an appetizer, a soup or salad, and an entree. According to them, this voucher would pay for food for two that would at its normal price be valued at $120. And they base their add-on gratuity on this inflated figure, as well as the tax.

What did we get? The appetizer was a one or two bite item -- two one-bite crab cakes, the size of quarters, and a teacup with one escargot in the bottom of it (our choices). The bowl of soup was actually a teacup as well. The entree we both had was a salmon, a very small filet, and when one of us expressed a concern about an allergy, they took the side dish away that contained the allergen and didn't replace it with anything. Most restaurants would have a baked potato or something to substitute. 

We ended up paying, after they added the gratuity in and the taxes based on the inflated retail price, nearly $120 for this dinner for two that included only two drinks, a well drink with house rum and a house cabernet.  That was our \"voucher deal\" price. That's absurd . . . the Salmon dinner could be had in a larger portion in any restaurant in town for $18-24. The cup of soup perhaps $5-7 and the microscopic \"tasting\" of an appetizer would be a courtesy item or certainly no more than a few $$. How does this equate to what we paid?

While the views are nice at the Wrigley Mansion and the place itself is unique, this operation is using it as an excuse to gouge. Don't visit this establishment -- seriously, like many others, you will regret it. Stay as far away as you can from Geordie's. Spend your money at innumerable restaurants with better value in other parts of Phoenix. (The night before we spent $50 at St. Francis and it was incredible)."}
{"text":"I hate giving this place only one star, because I love the location and the history. The service was wonderful and the staff was friendly, however I just can't give a $130 dinner a good review when it was so lack luster, tame, bland and out right boring. Perhaps they are catering to an older crowd that has dietary restrictions on flavor and spice, but their menu is dated - makes me think they haven't revamped it in 15-30 years. Their oso bucco portion was tiny and slimy maybe only 3oz and the risotto was bland. Had some cold shrimp spring roll? appetizer that tasted like they scraped it off the bottom of an aquarium. We went on a Saturday night expecting it to be packed, should have known the food was terrible. Please redo your menu!"}
{"text":"First Somm's Vault Wine Tasting & Member Mixer:  

with light bites on the front patio overlooking beautiful views of Camelback Mountain & the valley at Wrigley Mansion on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with light winds to keep us cool.  The hors d'oeuvres were very nice (had them before at a beautiful wedding there during the reception before our sit down dinner-which was very delicious) & enjoyed the wine selections especially WM Brut NV & Santa Digna Reserva.

{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour to check out the Wrigley Mansion after not being there for nearly 10 years.  We used to come for weekend wine tastings quite often and just stopped after they were no longer offered.  1/2 off wine and meatballs during happy hour...quite a bargain.  We enjoyed an amazing New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and a Slingshot Cabernet Sauvignon...so yummy!  Our bartender was fantastic and told us about the wine bar that would be opening...can't wait to check it out now!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here Friday night.  Our plan was to sit in the lounge, enjoy a few cocktails and have some appetizers and a burger.  This plan was thwarted when the bar tender looked at me like I was insane when I asked about their burger.  He told us they haven't had a burger in years.  The bar menu on their website clearly states that they have a burger which was perfect because my wife and I weren't in the mood for the fancy fare of their main dining room.

We sat at a table on their patio.  The weather was perfect and the view was even better.  We ordered our first round of drinks and yes they do jack you on the price but that was to be expected.  We then ordered some food to share.

* Flat bread pizza thing - excellent
* Beet salad - pretty good and pretty unique.  I can't explain it but it is worth a try.
* Oysters - not so good.  I have no idea why we got this but for some reason my wife wanted it so go figure.
* Truffled mac n' cheese - OMG - Best.  Thing.  Ever.

The mansion itself is beautiful but could use a bit of updating especially on the inside.  I do regret, however, not exploring the mansion as much as I should have.  We pretty much stuck to one small wing of the place but there was probably so much more to it than we saw.

Oh...and their parking situation is a complete clusterfuk.  The signage telling you where to park, where the valet is, and how to get to the mansion entrance is a complete joke and almost non-existent.  Would it kill them to have more/bigger signs and maybe some lights so you can see them?

** Pro Tip = get the $50 Local Dines gift cert for $25 ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Of course they will complain and try to tell you all the rules that somehow aren't listed anywhere.  They will even try to tell you what \"dinner\" food is and what is not.  Just tell them that if you want oysters and vodka for dinner then that is your choice.  If they want you to get a $65 steak in the main dining room they should clearly say that on the offer."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service.  The tour is a fun exploration of a funky but luxurious home.  An American castle.  I can't wait to go back for one of the jazz evenings and a Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I first heard about the mansion in the 1980s.  Always wanted to know more about it.  Recently I visited.  What are a tremendous place,  amazing service, excellent food,  great wine list?  

An experienced the is work the expense.  This equals value.  

Michael a skilled server.  He will make it perfect."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu with even greater price points. Well worth a late afternoon visit and you can't beat the views of DT Phoenix and surrounding areas. Their Flatbreads are a memorable menu choice."}
{"text":"This review is for the historical tour only (they also offer a tour-and-lunch deal, we did the tour alone). The Sunday brunch deserves its own review and is another 5-star in my opinion, if anyone is interested. 

To begin, our group of four, averaging age 50, were the youngest whipper snappers in the bunch, by a decade at least.  Which is fine, in this setting, a reserved older crowd was just lovely!  The mansion (or, as we learned, the \"winter cottage\") is a marvel and just beautiful to behold and to discover all the hidden gems within. But the high points really were brought to our attention by the knowledgeable and personable tour guide, who I assumed has a background in history and/or anthropology. I really don't know, unfortunately, I didn't ask but she was terrific!  Tour patrons are allowed to take any photos they want and I'll attach a few here. A great experience if you are interested in local history, or even moderately curious, and the views from the mansion truly can't be beat."}
{"text":"Brought my little brother here for his 17th birthday. He was absolutely thrilled with the lamb rack entree he ordered - he said it was the best dinner he had ever had in his life. 

We were both unimpressed by the service, however. Our waitress was very casual and made some awkward jokes. Her demeanor just didn't fit with the extremely upscale atmosphere of the place.

Our experience on the way out confirmed our thoughts on the service. I made a comment to the hostess about the Bar Mitzvah party that was going on in one of the ballrooms down the hall. She then unexpectedly said something along the lines of \"I don't like how Jewish people party.\" Not exactly the most professional thing she could have said.

Solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ok so I thought this beautiful place would be top notch dining and entertaining- little did I know I was wrong.....

The venue was great the service was comprable to being at McDonalds. In all fairness to the mansion I did buy a voucher from TravelZoo so maybe that was the catch- you get what you pay for! Ha

The evening started off well with my date and myself taking some very nice pictures outfront before we dined, having a drink in the bar - the server in the bar was great and we loved the happy hour prices~!!  Promptly @715- the terrible TravelZoo part began....we were seated and all was going well until it wasn't. 

From the stuffy waiter/waitress that rarely checked in on us to the comment \"we don't have a regular menu to look at\" we were continually amazed by the lack of service we were being served with. At one point we actually witnessed our waiter walk past our table carrying our bread and butter only to drop off another tables bread and butter before coming back to deliver ours. Later we noted this couple WAS NOT using the TravelZoo tragedy. Another annoying thing was that this same couple that was paying full price sat down after us and also got served their food before us! After the bread our table had crumbs on it and not once did our waiter offer to brush them off- something not expected but appreciated in high end dining. 

So overall I'm not sure if it was the venue or the TravelZoo tragedy but The Wrigley Mansion was not all I expected it to be! :-("}
{"text":"Want a beautiful mountain top patio with mountain and city views but lack the 2.5 mil? Than this may be a good spot. 

On Sunday nights, they have live music drinks and a buffet on the patio. While the buffet did not look even remotely appetizing but it was cheap ($5) the views, music and wine were decent. 

This particular evening the wine bottles were half off so they were only somewhat overpriced. I opted for a strong and sweet wine from Lodi ca.

One complaint I did have was our service my water never got refilled, I had to refill my wine glass, my chilled white wine bottle came without a ice bucket on a warm outdoor evening

This is a great spot for an early Sunday date."}
{"text":"Sure we only go with a DealChicken.com coupon but it's always great! Sit in the bar area as the dining room is very dated due to the mansions age. The bar area is much more, how would you say? relaxed and romantic. GREAT views from in there also!"}
{"text":"Our party of four went to the Wrigley Mansion Club and the experience was not outstanding. Everyone loved the view and we were able to see a partial sunset with our 5:00 reservation. 

The menu is very limited. We went during restaurant week and three of us ordered off the three course special menu and I ordered off the regular menu. I ordered the 8 oz. filet cooked medium. 

When the food arrived my steak was two small pieces of very rare meat. No chance this was close to 8 oz. The others in the group had ordered the smaller filet off the three course menu. One of their steaks was much bigger than the others. Like twice the size. I called over the waiter and he agreed and thought maybe someone else received the steak i ordered. 

The manager came over and took my under cooked steak away but did not realize I ordered off the regular menu for the larger 8 oz. portion. After about twenty minutes I was presented with two small pieces of meat that were cooked well done. I immediately cut into a piece and it was dry with no redness at all. I asked the waiter if he thought it looked medium and he just shook his head. 

Not the experience I was looking for and the total bill for the four of us with tip was over $300. I cannot recommend to friends or family."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and when I saw the travelzoo deal I jumped on it. I was trying to think of the best way to describe their food and it reminded me of convention center food.  I think they have catered to too many weddings and have lost the art of cooking quality meals.

This is also one of those places where you get the feeling that its cool to pay more for less. We were seated inside after requesting a patio seat and we brought the average age down about 30 years. It was hot and stuffy and the seats were so uncomfortable I had to take some advil when I got home. Had the worst french onion soup I've ever seen/ eaten (not sure how you mess that up?) and the salmon was too salty even for me.  I'm would not consider myself a food snob but I have eaten plenty of good food and this place just doesn't make the cut.  The only plus side to our dinner was being able to walk around the mansion and see the decor afterwards.  If we had actually been able to sit on the patio I\"m sure the view would have been nice.

In summary.... 
Average age: 65 
Food quality: sub par 
Decor: antique 
Bill with discount: $110 
Recommend? NO"}
{"text":"I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.

We were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.

We thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.

I can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.

We asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.

Our waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.

The starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.

The middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.

For dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.

I can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.

1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one star

SLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13
I read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Phoenix & a friend had recommended Wrigley Mansion. The mansion was a multifaceted gem. The dining was elegant with beautiful views from all locations. The food was excellently executed, and was the best high end meal I had while in Phoenix. Normally fine dining with tours and views, can be disappointing and not live up to the hype; the food here was wonderful in both taste & presentation. 

Moving beyond the dining experience, the tour of the mansion and learning its history was interesting & entertaining. Many of the rooms were converted to private dining spaces for special events or for use for weddings. The decor and elegance of each room was stunning, while still keeping historical memories alive. I appreciate the unique balance that the Wrigley Mansion maintained between being modern while offering a historical look into its intriguing past. 

Summary, go to visit the Wrigley Mansion. It is a treat!"}
{"text":"FABULOSO............ The ambiance, the wine list, the cuisine, the service, the views, the romance..... WOW!!!!!!!!! Mere words cannot describe this magical wedding anniversary dinner we had....."}
{"text":"I was there about a week ago for a function with the school I volunteered with. The location and the room we were in were great! They even provided all the students with a small tour of the mansion. Everything was great, but I can't say the same about the service.

Some of the servers (not all) were really rude to the students. When I asked if our table could get some more bread, the sever coughed up an attitude and dropped ONE piece of bread just on my plate. Our food was cold by the time it reached our table and it looked like it was thrown on a plate. One person kept asking if he could get an iced tea and he never received it.

 I know we're just a school function but the organization spent a lot of money for this event and there was a lot of very important people there. The location was really nice and the space was great, but the service needs some serious work."}
{"text":"I usually won't give a one-star review, but in extreme cases. I was horrifically disappointed with the food and the service. We were there on New Year's Eve, which should be a night in which they are on their A-game, but I guess they don't find that important. I ordered a steak, cooked medium. When I got the steak, it was cooked well done. It is very sad when a restaurant can't cook a steak. Then the service was disappointing as we hardly saw our waitress. I surely hope there is a new chef since I was there, because I think he worked at McDonald's before there."}
{"text":"I thought this place rocked.

We made dinner reservations for a Friday night for a table with a view.
We were in the inside portion of the mansion with a large party.

The food was great, views were great, drinks were great.
My favorite part was being handed a glass of sparkling wine as we entered.  Yay!

After dinner we explored the house.  Then we moved to the lounge and found a very, very entertaining and maybe drunk lounge singer (think of the band at the end of the Hangover movie)

I would definitely return for a fancy brunch or special night out."}
{"text":"I went to Wrigley with the Network of Business Women.  It was my first time there.  I had no idea where it was, but once I got there, I was pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere was so beautiful and relaxed.  It was a great place to have lunch.  I had a steak salad and it was absolutely yummy.  

Great history on the house...I need to go back for their free tours.  I think they are at 10 and 3 everyday they are open.  (Check on that first)I heard they have a great Sunday Brunch, so I will be making my way out there again.  I would love to hang out on their patio one fall morning or evening.  Either way it would be awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently were married here, and I can't say enough about how awesome this place is. When looking for a wedding venue, we were trying to find a sophisticated, classy venue that would wow our out of town guests and also serve some delicious food (hence, the Yelp review, we're foodies). And did we find that here. 

Between the gorgeous views, amazing food and historical richness, the Wrigley Mansion is the best choice we could have made. Our guests said it was not only awesome, but possibly the best wedding they had ever been to - and the food and venue were the top comments we received. Megan and her team do a great job in coordinating their weddings, making it a simple and easy process. But not to mention the fabulous coordination?, the staff were all helpful and eager to help us make our day awesome. The history alone makes this a wonderful place to visit, but the food is a whole other story. Geordie's restaurant is awesome and a gem of a quality restaurant in the valley - fine quality, well-prepared? food (get the filet and au-gratin potatoes, so good!)

I could go on forever. This is a must visit if you are in Arizona or live here. The views alone are the best around. And for weddings or hosting large events to wow - this one tops the list."}
{"text":"Megan at Wrigley Mansion went out of her way to make our reservation of 25 women during the Christmas holiday work especially when there was a mis- communication of the date!  We showed up and they had us down for the next day but they made it work beautifully!  The staff was wonderful the food was delicious and the views were spectacular!!  Everyone should visit Wrigley Mansion at least once."}
{"text":"Attended a private event here and was not impressed. Maintenance guys were going through fixing and replacing lights during the event because they weren't checked in advance. The room looked extremely low budget and the drinks were so over priced that Mill Ave looks cheap. The food was also very blah in flavor and not much for the cost of the place. I'd recommend several other venues over this place such as the The Monorchid (which I'd only rate slightly higher for location but the food was really good), The Renaissance Phoenix Hotel at Westgate which did a great job for our 2014 Christmas Party, or the Wigwam Resort where Luke AFB held it's last Air Force Ball."}
{"text":"I was more looking for Gordie's inside Wrigley Mansion, but a review here will do.  It was me and my friends birthday, along with another mutual friends daughters Bday.  I arranged for us all to have dinner at the Wrigley Mansion (Gordie's).  I made reservations ahead of time, I here walk in's are welcomed but reservations are strongly recommended because there are nights so busy there may not be tables available.

I requested a window booth seat and they made sure they accommodated this request since I arranged it two months in advance.  We had a delicious 4 course meal that my friends raved about for weeks after.  

The only down side to this place is it is expensive, the bill for the 4 of us was well over $200, but it was a special bday occasion so I didn't mind.  And also I don't think they do to go bags if you don't finish your food.  Because for me by the fourth main course, I was stuffed, and I had maybe a few bites of my delicious meal.  I waited for the waitress and I was going to see if I could possibly get a to go box since it was so expensive.  She asked if I was finished, I replied yes, and before I could follow it with \"can i get a to go box\" she put a dirty plate on top of mine.  I was a little shocked because you could tell I barely ate it.  But if I would have known that ahead of time, I would have FORCED myself to finish every last yummy bite.

Next time I go there, I won't be doing 4 courses, just 1 and done so it won't be happening again.  But it was a beautiful view and I was pleased with the entire experience."}
{"text":"Best view from a restaurant in Phoenix, best feeling of class when you are there.  Kind of tough to get to from the road, but worth it.  A grand old mansion with lots of interesting rooms."}
{"text":"The best thing about this meal was the view.  Because we had a voucher, we (along with many others) were put in a separate room with the tables and chairs they use for their events (weddings, etc).  It was a very limited menu and small portions.  The food was average at best, not super flavorful.  Our waiter was nice and the service was good....maybe a tad too quick.  We were thinking it was like the food was prepared like it was for catering and plates were made it advance.  The atmosphere was nice but I'm pretty sure we are not going back."}
{"text":"So I have lived in Phoenix for about 14 years, I have been to the Wrigley about 20 or 30 times over the years. First you want to valet, this place is nice, you don't have to dress up, but most people that are there are so it would be best if you did, because in Phoenix if you plan on parking below and climbing the stairs prepare to sweat. And if your dressed nice sweating is not an option. Valet is typically only $5 or $6. 

So in all the times I have ever been to the Wrigley, I have never had to pay just to walk around the grounds and look at things, I have always just took people that are in town and want an amazing view and a bit of history, if they have never been. This last time I went I was charged $5 per person...some daily membership fee or something. I was not too happy with this, especially since we were there right towards sunset, and none of the lights were on within the mansion, so it was hard to see everything.

 Secondly this place is not cheap by any means, a typical class of Merlot at the bar is going to run you $10 or more, which is outrageous considering the bottle price. And food here while it is good, is also a bit overpriced, you wont find a plate for under $15. 

Third, there is never a whole lot of staff around, walked into the bar to get drinks, and could not find the bartender, had to look for him. And guided tours are not always an option, if they are going to start charging $5 to look around, I expect all the lights to be on, and someone to walk me around the grounds and to provide more information about the grounds then the tiny little placards in each room. 

These were not made available when I was there, which is ridiculous considering they made me pay and it was just myself and one other person. 

All the rooms were dark, so we had to find light switches to see stuff. And they have moved a few thing around, which I found a bit strange. I would also say maintenance and housekeeping is lacking a bit, some of the lights were burned out, and things could be a bit cleaner, the Wrigley is quite old, but it does not mean it can not be maintained better, the place is starting to smell like dust. Not what your looking for if your planning an event or a wedding here, which allot of people do here. 

Definitely a piece of Phoenix history with a view that in unparallelled in Phoenix, unless your living in a highrise at the Optima or Esplanade or climbing Camelback mountain. 

Think management has dropped the ball a little thou, over the years. Still I would be willing to go back, just for the view."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to tour the Wrigley Mansion...so my husband booked us a tour with lunch.  The lunch was very disappointing.  I think that if there is a prix fix menu that the chef should know how to prepare every entree to perfection.  I ordered the field salad - super salty and the pesto chicken pasta.  The chicken had a layer of skin/fat on each piece and the pesto was very oily with very little flavor.  The staff was amazing. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating.  Our tour guide was very informative and fun.  I would recommend the tour but not lunch!"}
{"text":"As in Wrigley gum? 

Yep.

The story of the Wrigley Mansion confirmed this during my visit for dinner several weeks ago. 

It's atop a mountain so you get to see the city. Honestly, I had way too much drink there to even do a tour. But from what I remember, great drinks, good food, beautiful views, and a nice bar where we were able to catch some of the NBA playoffs.

Sure, a great place to have a wedding reception or party of such. It's not too big, at least where we were, so I'm thinking 75 people max would be comfortable. Again, I drank it up so I could be totally wrong.

Oh, the piano in the room to the left is apparently worth $20,000,000. I could type the word million but all those zeroes make a difference when you actually read it. My drunk ass even tried to play a tune. I vividly remember an employee of the mansion suggesting that I should step away from the piano. She pretty much saved my financial future.

Next time I'll do a tour so I can really appreciate what this place is all about."}
{"text":"I used to play music here regularly and the staff and service could not be friendlier. The food is outstanding and actually decently priced. The kicker-- the hilltop view of Phoenix. Breathtaking! There is also quite a bit of history involved here and the staff is pretty well versed on the lineage of the place.  The bar area is quaint and comfortable and attire seems to be anywhere from casual to semi-formal.  Wonderful place!"}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion reeks of old money and of another age. Located on a hill near The Biltmore. The Wrigley is a great setting for any occasion. The views are great, especially at sunset. The food is just ok. I had the salmon and it was a little soft and mushy. They also offer a wine club which can save you some money. After your meal, go explore the place."}
{"text":"We wanted to make Thanksgiving special.  The Wrigley mansion is a beautiful house overlooking the city.  My date and I were seated at table 40/1 in the formal dining room.   The food on the buffet was excellent.  The buffet offered options of turkey, ham, prime rib, and lamb.   There was also an area where you can order omelets or pancakes.   Tons of food with very good quality.    On the other hand; the service was unbelievably poor.    We had to virtually send up a solar flare in the sky to get the server to stop and give us refills on water or champagne.    Our server Steve didn't have that many tables either and it was not crowded at the 3:30 PM seating in the formal dining room.    I did notice our server had a different level of attentiveness for our table in comparison to his others.   It was blantently obvious at one point he passed by our table and we both had dirty plates and I motioned for assistance he responded I'll be there in a sec; but a sec was minutes later.  Instead he utilized his time to fill up water glasses at adjacent tables marginally empty and chat with guest who had already eaten.   Perhaps his lackluster performance as a server hinged on the fact that gratuity was already included.  If this is the case he didn't earn one dime of it.  $189.45 for two people is a reasonable price for a Thanksgiving brunch if service is at least average.  This was not the case here and I admonish management for not monitoring poor performance of their servers.  The mansion is immaculate and I may come back for a random  tour and lunch; but for holiday buffet I will err on the side of caution because you never know what server you're going to get here.  Overall this is 5 star venue with 0 star servers."}
{"text":"The brunch buffet has a great selection of seafood breakfast options. The ambience is fairly casual with lots of families. The view of Phoenix is unbeatable."}
{"text":"What an amazing event my daughter and I had today.  We went to the Wrigley Mansion for the Brunch, with an awesome view of the City at our window.  The Mimosas never stopped coming, the service with Steve, our waiter was superior.  The food was remarkable with an omelet station with everything you can imagine, the Prime Rib, Leg of Lamb, Shrimp and crab legs were everything you were hoping for.  All the other selections, too numerous to mention, were outstanding.  The deserts had a room of their own and looked delicious.  This is truly a remarkable gem in the desert."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying if your not in great shape (triathlete) don't even attempt to take the stairs that lead up to the mansion. I mean there really should be some warning that if your over age 50 you may not make it up there. So with that being said I think it is clearly a ruse to make sure you pay for Valet parking because if you drive to the top of the hill they will gladly park your car for you and you can walk right into the mansion. 

We had dinner at Geordie's restaurant because they were offering a $30 per person 3 course meal to promote restaurant week here in phoenix. The food was pretty good....not great. The service was pretty good....but not great. The Mansion was pretty good.....but not great. However the view was great....we got to see the sun sunset along with the beautiful mountains so at least that was a treat. We didn't have dessert but the offerings on the menu looked good...but not great.

So I guess you see my point this place is good....not great....so if that is what your looking for then Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were fortunate enough to be invited to a wedding at this beautiful venue last weekend.  Driving up the mountainside, you reach this beautiful building with incredible city and mountain views.  Due to the rain on Friday and Saturday morning, they had to move the ceremony inside, but it worked out perfectly.  The mansion was decorated for Christmas and it was so lovely.  

After the ceremony, the doors opened to the reception room that included floor to ceiling windows so that the views and sunset could be taken in by everyone.  The tables were set beautifully with gold chargers and nice silver.  The appetizers served during the cocktail hour were all delicious especially the quiche and the tomato and mozerrella crackers.  The bar was prompt and the dinner of beef tenderloin was great.  

Make sure you check out all of the decor if you make it up to the mansion.  The Wrigley's were definitely not minimalists!"}
{"text":"High above the city of Phoenix lies a mansion of secrecy!  Views of the great mountains to the North and South, while the high rises sit dormant.  Where my friends......?  

The Wrigley Mansion.....da duh da.......! (Thunder rolls and the lightening strikes -- haha Garth Brooks)

This place was not a joy to find, but it was definitely worth the visit.  Valet is a must here!  This ain't your ordinary \"restaurant\".  You are free to roam around the mansion at your own risk that is hahaha!  Yes, the mansion is said to be haunted!  Just don't go to the restrooms alone.  Needless to say, this place was a delight.  It's literally someone's mansion.  The view is amazing!

Sit down for a nice brunch with some of your favorite guest.  Mimosas flow freely so why stop at 2 wink wink?  The brunch buffet definitely has a variety of food.  Everything from crepes, Thai chicken, aged meats, prime rib, and tacos!  YUM!  Coffee is great and I would say better than Starbucks, yeah I said it!  

Finally, service...it's a fancy brunch I didn't think service is lacking in any way. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place for a special event.

A friend had his rehearsal dinner here a couple of months ago and everything was great.

Was up here this week for AZ Foothills Magazine's Best of 2011 party.  Great views, cozy decor. 

Check out Geordie's bar at sunset for a nice experience.

Be prepared for valet parking only."}
{"text":"Last weekend we went to Wrigley Mansion for the fabulous Sunday champagne brunch and it certainly did not disappoint! This was my 4th trip to the Mansion for special occasions, and I was sad to see how empty it was compared to the previous times I had been before! We had a 1PM reservation and by 2:30 we were pretty much the last table in the place.

However, the servers were wonderfully friendly and helpful and the food stayed replenished the entire time, which I appreciated greatly since it was such a quiet day. 
The best parts of the brunch are the endless champagne/mimosas and the variety of the buffett, especially the seafood and omelet stations. Last year we decided to try a different brunch spot and it was not even close to Wrigley. Plus, it is so reasonably priced! (around $40 a person) 

So in summation, if you are looking for a great brunch with killer views, look no further."}
{"text":"Love this place- amazing French food. Great drinks, great view. Service was impeccable. Very friendly and knowledgeable about history of the place. If you want an experience, be wined and dined with great views-go here. You can walk through multiple rooms, and balconies-great to explore on a date!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant because it's not cheap, but it ms sure with it.  One of those places where the steak is sooo tender it seems to kinda melt in your mouth.  And the views are hard to beat.  I've only had steak this good one other time in Vegas at a pace that cost significantly more.  Granted I'm no pro, and I havnt been everywhere, but it's hard to believe there are places that are too much better than this (at least for the steak)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not only do you get impeccable views, but the food and service is everything you'd want and more.  We got a guided tour of the mansion by Ben and our server Prince could anticipate a mimosa refill (which is everything...). I will be sure to be back to enjoy this experience, because that is without a doubt, what it was. Thank you for such an amazing time!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I spent our Easter at the Wrigley Mansion.  Great views and an amazing spread of breakfast and lunch options.  Ambience was great and the service was top notch.  Highly recommend letting Wrigley take care of the food and drink service for major holidays :)!"}
{"text":"I ate here this morning for brunch with my husband.  The building and grounds are beautiful, but the food was disappointing.  It was more like a fancy continental hotel breakfast, and definitely not worth $50 a person.  There were even store bought yogurts and pastries. 
The worst part of our experience was when we were leaving the mansion, a large group of African Americans had just arrived and we actually heard a waiter mock them saying, \"we've got fried chicken and collard green but where's the kool-aid?!\"  That was horrifyingly rude and summed up our experience that the building is the only classy part of this establishment."}
{"text":"Wow - this place was phenomenal. The view is amazing the food was great. Amazing venue for a wedding or company event."}
{"text":"The location is a 5 star.  So cool and full of history.  The appetizers were amazing but our main meal was just average.  I got the lamb shank and it was dry and disappointing.  They had a unique guitar player  for entertainment that played the guitar like the piano pretty cool to listen to and watch.  Overall it was pricey but unique enough to enjoy one time."}
{"text":"We were invited to attend a Wine Tasting special event hosted by one of my clients.  In the 2 yrs since we've lived here, we haven't been to the Wrigley Mansion, so we were very excited to come check it out. 

When you pull up to the mansion, it's a bit confusing to figure out where to drive....there's a self-parking lot at the bottom of the hill....walk up a large hill in 90+ degree weather, um....no thanks.  Ok, so we drove up the driveway assuming that's where the valet parking would be located....and it was.  

Beautiful views from the top of the hill.

We walked inside the mansion and were greeted by a hostess who directed us to the private event area to the left.  We enjoyed Wine and Cheese/Crackers/Fruit, etc that you normally find at a Wine tasting.  The Wine was very good and the room was comfortable.  After 30 min or so we were asked to move into the dining room area where we would start a formal Wine tasting with 8 glasses (4 White, 4 Red) of Wine.

The sommelier did a nice presentation about each Wine....however, she took too long and was a bit too in-depth for this group of people.  There were over 80 people and many of them were not Wine enthusiasts, so they were bored very quickly.....too much time between sips.  I personally enjoyed it, but afterward many people said it was too much info for them. 

Since the building is very old, the room we were in was not well insulated and got a little stuffy/warm....so if you're coming here during the Summer months, dress light.

After the event, we wandered around the mansion and took a bunch of pics of the artwork and rooms.  I'm sure there's a story behind all of this, but we were on our own and didn't have a guide to explain anything to us.

We picked up a flyer for a social club you can belong to here...?  Not really sure what that entails, but it's available.

Overall, I'd rate this experience 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up for the views and Wine.

Return Factor - 70%"}
{"text":"Love the Wrigley Mansion, such a classic piece of Americana, in our culture-starved Desert of a town. The views from the main bar and restraunt are impeccable, went there on a few occasions, usually for Blush, a Valentine's day event, once watched a monsoon storm trail it's way from the east patio area, and it was just one of those \"moments\". A little hard to find, be sure to look at the map before going. I am so happy the current owners have opened this property to the public."}
{"text":"Food, Service, and Ambiance that lives up to the Wrigley name.

It's been a good year and it was time to celebrate.  There are many expensive restaurants in the Phoenix area, but none with a history as rich as 'Wrigley'.  I'm a gourmet chef and so I'm pretty tough on restaurants - the food has to be better than I can prepare at home. The Wrigley Mansion Club exceeded that standard with no problem.

The quality and presentation of the food were excellent. The service was impeccable.  And as for ambiance, we were seated in the Mansion's formal dining room; what more can I say."}
{"text":"i love hitting up the wrigley mansion for a cocktail with a girlfriend. the music is generally pretty good and the bartender has always been entertaining. the place draws a diverse and interesting crowd for people-watching. 

strangely enough, since my first visit almost 7 years ago, i've had a strange recurring nightmare where the setting is the dear old wrigley mansion. i certainly can't blame the wrigleys, or anyone else for that matter, but it was worth mentioning.

to fully enjoy the experience, bring a friend ... someone that will notice what you don't, and vice versa. take the time to walk around. a tour isn't necessary, but will provide insights into the mansion you couldn't have gotten on the self-guided version. enjoy the gardens, the grounds, the ambiance, the splendor. imagine a time when people lived here. and take a short moment to be thankful to have access to this gem."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor--if you're planning dinner at Geordie's, find out when Chelsea works. AMAZING  server. Totally pro. If I was in the food service business, I'd steal her. 

Big dinner for 9. Lots of talking over one another (us) and it had to be a nightmare to take that order, and keep up with all of our special requests and us arguing about the changes we were making.. She handled it with with total aplomb, even making sure that Mother, who's very deaf, felt part of the action. Cocktails came as needed, the food was right, she checked in without being obtrusive, removed dishes as needed promptly--I just can't say too many good things about Chelsea. 

And the food was great--wonderful oysters on the half shell, that seemed to have come right out of the near ocean side. Oh, wait, this is Arizona-no ocean. GREAT oysters. Watch out for the horseradish, it's nuclear. Lots of apps to share, great entrees--we all left completely happy. (And that's hard with our crowd, trust me)"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance. Very attentive service. Seafood very fresh. Prime rib cooked rare but not running with bloody juice. I did not give it a 5th star because we four sat at a table meant for 6 and the busy room made it hard to have conversation."}
{"text":"Oh, Wrigley Manson if only I had the means to fix you up and make you the amazing gem I know you could be.
Phoenix is seriously lacking when it comes to historical buildings and homes. I have always been curious about the Wrigley Mansion so I was excited when we made plans to go here for Easter brunch. 

The brunch was good. Our server was friendly and funny. There was a decent variety of food and it was tasty. My only complaint about the food would be the desserts. They were not labeled, the cakes and pies were whole so people cut their own slices and they became a mess. Overall I just wasn't impressed. I've seen better dessert spreads at casino buffets. 

After the meal we wandered around the building, exploring the rooms, peeking around corners and checking out the history. The bummer is that it's obvious that the money isn't there to keep this place looking its best. Some of the bathrooms were run down (burned out lights, doors that didn't lock), in one room the curtains were torn, walls and flooring showed signs of wear and tear, and furnishings just looked tired in places. It wouldn't take much to clean this place up and have it look amazing. I'm sure when the Wrigley family lived here it was incredible and it's sad to see such a great home being neglected. I'm sure if they fixed it up they would book more parties and weddings and it could be a prime location in town. 

I hope someone will take the time and money to invest in one of our rare glimpses into Phoenix's past. If it continues on this decline I don't think it will last."}
{"text":"Of course the views are gorgeous!  However, don't go for Happy hour.  Hardly any room, and the wait staff really is not into that.  They served us well enough, but our waitress was impatient and tended to talk down to us.  We are quite experienced women and well dressed.  We tip well, and ask for only one check, so I do not know why they are like that.  Don't advertise for H.R. If you don't want to serve it.  The HR food was horrendous and all fried carbs.  We had mediocre steamed clams from the regular menu but HALF of them were closed.  Need a new chef."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to go for HH and watch the sun set on their patio,. Their appetizers are half price as are their wines until 6:00. The service is wonderful and the ambiance is absolutely beautiful. They also have entertainment around 7:00. I had their margarita pizza and it was good. it was $5.00 and almost too big for 2 people to share. The white wines are very good. $4-$5.00 a glass during HH."}
{"text":"TL;DR tour was okay but disappointing that it is all completely remodeled, with just pics of what it looked like back in the day, and lunch was underwhelming at best with a price tag of $111 for 4.

Our party of 4 signed up for a tour and lunch afterwards.  The tour was mediocre, we learned some interesting things but the whole joint has been remodeled significantly and each room just has a picture of how it used to look.  Tour guide was nice though.  Lunch, on the other hand, was disappointing.  We wanted to order off the main menu, not the limited tour lunch menu, which I had been told was not a problem.  Sat down and was handed the limited menu.  Had to request the regular ones and got a bit of attitude on that.  We ordered a couple appetizers and our meals.  Apps came and were good but we didn't get out meals until 1 hour 20 minutes after sitting down...what?!?  Ridiculous, there was only a dozen people seated.  And I had specifically ordered my sandwich without pickles and mustard.  It arrived without pickles but still had mustard on it, which was quite spicy and not to my liking.  Waiter returned and I mentioned that it was supposed to have been without mustard (yellow/brown with clear mustard seeds) and he told me \"oh, that's mayo\".  No sir, that is not mayo. Mayo was not even mentioned on the description.  I did not want to wait any longer for food to be remade so I just removed the bread (and thus the mustard and the melted cheese) and just ate the meat.  Total bill for 4 was $111 including the $5 fee for the ability to eat there, which is also crazy."}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion holds a spot in my heart already (its where the husband first told me he loved me, so romantic) 

This place is top notch and extremely impressive whether you are having lunch or just drinks. 

My aunt is visiting from out of town and I really wanted to give her a good time. I had mentioned that we should try to get reservations at the Wrigley and her eyes lit up! As it turns out, in the 30 years she has been coming to visit no one has ever taken her there! I called and was able to get a lunch reservation for the very next day! 

Everyone there is so friendly, from the valet to the hostess to the waiters and staff. Our lunch was AMAZING! I had the french onion soup and grilled veggie panini, soooooooooo tasty! 

After wards we roamed the halls and learned some cool facts about The mansion! 

This place is fantastic! If you want to impress a date, take them here for dinner! If you want to have a fabulous lunch (and let me note, not pricey at all, for 3 of us our bill was just barely over $40!!!) GO HERE!"}
{"text":"There's nothing like a good brunch and the brunch here is more than good.  Do yourself a favor if you live in town and sell some plasma at least once a year to come enjoy refueling your body with the delicious spread of the Mansion.  Between the view, the bottomless mimosas, the pancake bar, the seafood spread, and the elegant setting you're bound to have a fantastic Sunday.  

All of the food we sampled (which if I'm being honest was enough to overflow the bed of an F150) was of high quality and very good.  The seafood was especially great.  They had crab legs, oysters, clams, mussels, and shrimp to add to the ocean of champagne in your stomach.  

At $49/pp it's on the high end of the brunch budget but it is worth it to treat yo self or impress some out of town visitors.  If it's your first visit make sure to fill up your mimosa and stroll through the house after your meal.  It's a historic place and you might learn something other than \"how many visits to the prime rib station can I make before feeling bad about myself?\""}
{"text":"I have heard many things about Wrigley Mansion but only recently visited for a local food event. The parking was a little confusing, since you can drive all the way up to the top (which is valet) or drive only halfway up, take a detour, and self-park. Needless to say, I drove all the way up to the top the first time, turned around, and tried to find self-parking. It was a difficult 15 minutes because of how narrow the road is. Once I found parking, I walked up the massive stairs and entered a bar patio. Since I was unsure where the event was, I kind of wandered around until I found someone who looked like they worked there. Technically, I entered inside one of the restaurants (Geordie's) and was guided through the mansion to a different area where the event was. The parts of the Mansion I saw were beautiful but dated. It was like being thrown back in time and it was a unique experience. The room the food event was in was large and spacious with plenty of seating and room to mingle. Overall, it's a great venue for events."}
{"text":"Mussels. Barratta. Halibut. Frites. All great. We were staying at the Biltmore in Phoenix and this was suggested, with a small walk but what a great place. We had one of the finest meals ever overlooking a beautiful sunset and had the time of our lives touring the mansion and it's wonderful environs."}
{"text":"wow,, now this is a brunch. Prime rib, lobster, leg of lamb, shrimp, waffle bars, dessert room and all the usual breakfast stuff plus more.. it was crazy. The food and the service will not disappoint.. came her with my wife and daughter and walked around before and after brunch , will be back, Go cubbies!!"}
{"text":"Tried it out for Sunday brunch.  The mansion sits on a hill so unless you drive all the way up to valet at the front entrance, be prepared to take a bit of a steep walk. Beautiful venue, decor is very elegant with vintage, antique accents. A nice touch, they allow you to self-tour the various event rooms. The staff is nice! The food and selections are varied and delectable. The brunch price point is a bit expensive but worth the overall experience."}
{"text":"First time here, my boyfriend bought the Travelzoo voucher, and as far as voucher deals go I thought it was a very good deal.  The food was great.  Not excellent because it lacked a certain something, maybe fresh herbs or new ways of putting food together.  It was kind of old school, but that's okay every now and then.  The atmosphere was old school too.  The view, was the best I've ever seen from a Phoenix restaurant. Our server was excellent.  He was friendly, recommended his favorites, and also retrieved the Sommelier to talk to us about wines.  If you buy a bottle of wine you become a \"Wine Member\" which gets you I/2 price on wines from now on.  We will be coming back to enjoy more wine and a beautiful view."}
{"text":"I met some people here for a happy hour.  I had no idea this place existed.  Now I DO know.  

Situated near the Biltmore, this literal mansion has amazing views and  a great lawn. This is set up to be rented for events and such but they also have a bar and restaurant (and a great happy hour. You are free to roam the mansion and check out the various rooms and they also have a perfectly situated porch where you can watch the sunset.

The restaurant/bar (Geordies) offers a really stealthy happy hour from 3-6 pm with drink and food specials ranging from $4-$10.

Don't want to pay $16 for a glass of wine at *another* resort that has spectacular views/balcony?  Come here for a sunset drink!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding here a couple of years ago. The quality of service and food is outstanding. The sweeping views of city make this place a go to for dates, families, or anyone who wants to see the city from one of the best vantage points around. Definitely put this on your list of places to check out."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food at the restaurant, but the tour was fascinating. The smallest of William Wrigley's homes is still an amazing place to check out. You can walk around and see most of it for yourself, but it was nice to have a guide to give you some background about the house and the Wrigleys and Hormels.

The tour is $15 dollars a person, plus a $5 membership fee for the entire group. Not a horrible price for about an hour. There are also meal deals with the tour."}
{"text":"Went here on a Travelzoo coupon.

The mansion is on top of a hill. When you get to the top, there is only valet which is about $7-10. I suppose you can park somewhere along the side of the road on the way up, but it's a steep climb in heels.

When we arrived, the hostess continued to yack on the phone without even acknowledging us. As she finally ended her call, another person had arrived, and she helped them FIRST.

I've used a number of \"Groupons\" and the like, but I've never seen anyone restrict coupon usage to a limited menu, eck.

Service was sloppy and because of the coupon, it was automatically included at 20% of the un-discounted price, i.e. $20. 

After our second course, I noticed a bug on our table. When I called over the manager, he smashed it into the table cloth, picked it off, and left.

Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"The food was below average relative to the prices. I enjoyed the food, but it was not fine dining quality. Based on the prices (around 150 for two people), I expected something quite memorable, but instead it was quite mediocre. 

If you sit on the patio on a cool fall evening, this would be a nice place to have a few drinks, but I certainly wouldn't go for the food. Of course, the building is beautiful and creates a great environment.

Also, the service was very sub-par on most accounts. Even the hostess was unfriendly and didn't smile or say more than two words. The manager was friendly and the person who delivered the food was very friendly."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on business, and a few co-workers and I wanted to do something as a group. One of them saw this place while driving around, figured out what it was, and found out they give tours. We reserved spaces for us on the last tour of the day. They have different kinds of tours; just the tour, ($15), a tour with an appetizer ($25), a tour with lunch ($35), and a couples tour with wine ($80).
There is valet parking, and there is also free self-parking about halfway up the driveway. If you decide to use self-parking, there is a little bit of a walk uphill with stairs, but it's not too bad. We entered through the restaurant instead of the front door, because valet parking is where the front door is. There were quite a few people on the tour - about fifteen of us. My co-workers and I were definitely the youngest ones besides the tour guide. Lol. 
The tour guide was great! If you're her employers and are reading this, she had brown hair, was wearing all black, boots, and necklaces. She didn't stumble, and her presentation of information came off sincere and interesting. She was lively, and she was knowledgable. I would definitely recommend you take the tour with her.
The mansion itself was pretty. It was definitely older. If I remember correctly, it was built in the 1930s. I wish the mansion had a lot more of the original pieces, but i loved that you could go almost everywhere in the mansion and touch almost anything - besides the piano. The hand painted ceilings were my absolute favorite part, and the view didn't hurt either.
We enjoyed happy hour following the tour. They have half off appetizers and wine, as well as a few other things. It was a beautiful day, and the weather was great for eating outside.
Overall, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Wrigley Mansion has been an amazing partner for me! We work together for their special events! This is such a fabulous place to host a party! Working with Megan at the Mansion is incredibly simple, and has been so much fun! The views you can have during wedding or event are unlike anywhere else in the valley, especially if you have Chicago roots, you'll love the history behind the Mansion. Megan has done an amazing job taking the Mansion to the next level for weddings and events! She completely understands the industry, and how to make you feel special as her guest! It's such a great place to have a unique wedding with such a great Arizona feel!"}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion was built in 1929 and is actually just one of the many residences that William Wrigley owned. I read that this mansion is actually the \"smallest\" one he lived in. At over 16,000 square feet I would have hated to have William Wrigley come over to my place; he would have thought that I lived in a van down by the river by that standard (Lah-dee-frikkin' dah!). In the early 90's ownership changed hands when Geordie Hormel of the Hormel foods family empire bought the mansion. Small touches of his imprint on the house permeate through the building, such as the on-site restaurant named Geordie's and a few walls showing old photographs and news articles about Geordie Hormel's life. 

The mansion offers both self and valet parking. The self parking is in a lot that is a short walk up to the mansion but there's no sidewalk for you to walk up so you might have to dodge the occasional car coming down the road.

The mansion is stunning. You don't see architecture like this too often. The art style inside was an interesting hodgepodge of different eras. In some rooms it was very art deco (I felt like I was in a Bioshock hotel room before everyone wigged out and turned crazy), while others had wood decor that channeled more of an old European manor. Many paintings adorn the walls by various artists that span multiple time periods and styles. There's even a Renoir near the bathroom of the bridal room. Eclectic is probably a good word for this place.

They offer guided tours, tours that include lunch, or you can go wandering around the grounds and rooms on your own. We did a self-guided tour, roaming through each room taking in all the fantastic detail of the mansion. Since there are various articles on some walls about the history of both Wrigley and Hormel, we got the general gist of the mansion's life from conception to present day. I'd still be interested in taking a more official tour sometime later though!

Zoning regulations dictate that the mansion has to operate as a private club, so there are options to become a \"member\" of this club. The cheapest membership is $20/year and includes valet service, no additional fee for dining at the restaurant (Otherwise they add $5 to your bill), tours, and special events.

They have two restaurants here, Geordie's and Jamie's Wine Bar. Both are on the ground level and offer full service dining.

As a former mansion of the Wrigley family, it's too bad they don't offer Wrigley gum during your tour or dining experience. I could've used some Doublemint or Juicy Fruit after downing one of the delicious Spam Cubanos at Geordie's!"}
{"text":"This was the mansion of Wringley ( the creator or juicy gum) I have personally seen better and bigger \"mansions\" but it was still pretty nice and neat to see how wealthy people used to live back in the day.. the weird part - small bathrooms and marriage couples had their own separate rooms-  well I wonder how they used to have so many kids then... lol.
 The mansion is located in a hill so the view is amazing, the best thing to do will be going to the tour and eat brunch of diner in one of their rooms. I would totally recommend going to this place if you feel like doing something relaxing"}
{"text":"I have visited the Mansion Club the past two Saturday nights and find it to be as close to a private club atmosphere as you can attain in a public space. Drinks and apps in the bar followed by dinner. Great filet for me  lamb shank for my girlfriend. I will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I was invited to the restaurant at Wrigley Mansion for a \"Welcome to Phoenix\" lunch by a friend of mutual friend. I have heard of it but had no idea what to expect. I personally think the location and views over the Valley are very impressive. I had the delicious roasted red pepper soup and seared scallops. Honestly, both were fantastic. To my great surprise, we even met the chef, Christopher Gross. To say it was a uniquely great experience is an understatement. Next on my list is Jamie's Wine Bar, also located in the mansion."}
{"text":"I was hosted at the Wrigley Mansion for a feature on my blog. I expected my visit to be quick with sub par service due to the fact I was accommodated. Boy, was I wrong.

Immediately upon arrival, you are greeted by vallet. We used an Uber so it wasn't needed, but the greeter was so incredibly kind and cheerful. 

Walking in, you are almost overwhelmed by the beauty of the mansion. There is so much to see and look at - definitely make time to do so.

Let's jump to dinner because let's be real, that is the most important part. 

Our wait staff was impeccable and outstanding.
Every single one of them were kind with a smile on their face. I have never had a better experience with staff.

The food - my word. So delicious. I am vegetarian so it is often hard to eat places. They were extremely accommodating and checked multiple items on the menu to make sure they were vegetarian friendly.

I had the red pepper soup and veggie tart, both of which were delectable. My mother had a salad and the catch of the day which was \"the best sea bass\" she'd ever had. Then, I of course needed dessert and I had the chefs signature dessert. The pictures tell it all. I have never been so happy eating chocolate mouse."}
{"text":"Attended this happy hour with another couple arriving around 4:30 p.m. There are three tables that seat 6 people so we chose this option since the remaining seating area accommodates tables for 2. We were blasted by the western sun so with no protection, we were cooked to say the least.  The bigger issue on this balcony seating was the relentless shuffling of waiters moving buckets of ice , dishes and glasses , requiring me to get up off my chair 5 separate times. So annoying! However...the hamburgers
 were wonderful, juicy and cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the spam cubano sandwich and noted it was off the chart tasty....avoid the Salmon Blt...very skimpy and a disappointment. This place has promise but if we return....we will happy hour  inside....we will give it another try......."}
{"text":"This review applies to Geordie's at the Wrigley Mansion. Horrific. Comically bad.

The service and food are simply unforgettable - for how bad they are.

Yes, great views.  And cool venue.  However, I guarantee you will be disappointed with how you're treated and also the quality of the food.

The HH wine is mediocre.  The HH food options are less than mediocre.  The salmon special fillet (special on HH) literally had a huge piece of skin in the middle of it.  Gross! And the server said \"that's how it grows!\"  There was this dip of something or other that was inedible (see picture) for the bacon wrapped dates, also on HH.

We will NOT be back for the food.  Maybe for one drink and the view at most."}
{"text":"Top notch and great service to boot! From entrees to fresh fruit to a large assortment of luscious desserts. Hot and cold running drinks including brut champagne, beers and wines. We sat here almost all day...

The only downside was that the lamb and roast beef were not rare, only medium. And, there was a 20% gratuity added for two. The service was excellent with well schooled waitstaff. We gave another 10%."}
{"text":"The ambiance was amazing, the sparkling wine upon entry is a great touch, and the service was decent (although a bit young and inexperienced overall).

So with all the highlights out of the way, let's get on to my problem with the Wrigley Mansion.  The food was overall good, but not exquisite.  Of the four dishes that we tried, I would have thought we selected from the menu of a $15 per plate neighborhood restaurant, not a $25+ fine dining destination.

Then I ordered the wine, 2004 Rombauer Merlot, a very familiar vintage for me.  It was bad.  Next glass, different bottle, also bad (can't remember what it was, though).  I ended up with a glass of the house wine.  Bad wine is unacceptable for any restaurant, especially when wine can play such an important role in the meal.

Dessert was great, but I only know because I stole a bite from Catherine's plate.  I'm just not a desert guy.

Overall, I would say that yes I will go back as soon as they lower prices and downgrade the ambiance to be more casual, or fix the problems.  Until then, I can think of several better values for fine dining, mostly in the very same area where Wrigley Mansion competes for business."}
{"text":"I was bummed when Christopher's closed.  Their bar menu was one of my favorites of anywhere in town.  Well Christopher is at the Wrigley and the food and atmosphere is better than ever.  You
will need to join their club but for $20 annually for the social membership this is a bargain.  They even have a wine club that is an amazing value especially if their most recent events are an indication of their regular offerings.  My only disappointment is that they no longer have sweetbreads on their menu.  I wouldn't care if I had to pre-order them.  They are some of the best I have ever eaten.  The frog legs are delicious.  I normally avoid carbs but the Mac and cheese was so good I wanted to lick the plate.  This Wrigley will be a regular stop whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"Growing up, my father used to work at the Wrigley and take me to Sunday Brunch there and it was always a big affair. I remember the food being to die for and spending the whole day lounging in our chairs, exploring the mansion, and munching on the amazing food. My father passed away about 6 years back and I hadn't been to the mansion since. I went for the Father's Day Brunch with my whole family and having practically grown up in the mansion I was eager to see it again. I must say I was very disappointed. The mansion itself is gorgeous and I am sure the bar/lounge is lovely and that any events there are going to be spectacular, however our brunch was awful. We were seated at 11 (the first available seating time) and the food was cold and stale when we arrived. Even the bagels seemed store bought and a day old. There was very little selection, and by the time we got to the dessert room it was practically barren. I can't imagine how the rest of the day went from there. I understand it was the last Sunday Brunch before summer but it just seemed unacceptable to run out of dishes before the first groups of people had even had a chance at them.

The other thing I was really disappointed in was the lack of music. I remember every Sunday they used to have someone playing piano or some sort of live music but there was nothing other than some awful muzak playing. I asked a waiter and he said he had worked there for a year and in that whole time no one came to play anymore. I also realized, upon talking with the staff, that no one had worked there more than a year. I was quite disappointed as I couldn't remember all of the stories about the mansion and no one working there had been there long enough to learn them, and they were not doing any tours that Sunday. I also attempted to call twice for a reservation and could not get a hold of anyone who could say for certain when or if I had a reservation. I had to leave a message and was called back two days later with the information regarding my reservation. I know these last couple things aren't a huge deal but they just fall short of my expectations for an establishment that I know did so much more in the past.

My sister agreed with me that she thought things had fallen far below our expectations, and even my mother, who had never seen the real \"glory days\" of the mansion was a bit disappointed. Everyone agrees that it was nice to go back and see everything again, especially on Father's Day and the way I connect it with my dad, but every single one of us agrees it was not worth what we paid and we would not do it again."}
{"text":"Start with one penny and double it, then double the double, and continue doubling daily. You would be a millionaire within 30 days. Know anyone who could pull that off? Not me! For us working folk it takes two weeks of doubling down to afford Sunday brunch for two at Wrigley Mansion ($49pp). Worth it!  

The mansion is atop Telewa Trail close to the canal. The best entrance for check-in was on the SE side; upstairs from valet parking. The host was sitting there. But if you use regular parking downhill, then walk up through the pedestrian entrance on the NW side and make your way through the leftmost rooms towards the host. 

Table was already assigned and we were politely escorted to a white room with big windows. Lighting was wonderful and tables adequately spaced. As soon as we settled in, a server introduced himself to us and gave the banquet 411. Then glasses were promptly filled with freely flowing mimosas. They were refilled several times while dining.

Take a moment to give thanks. God bless Abundance. My belly is always on my mind and my mind on my belly. This quality buffet presented a fun bingeful experience for my appetite. Not my waistline though, BUT I am currently in the R&D stage of an invention that burns calories as I eat. It's patented! Binge buffeting is 'bout to be the shizith!

Binge. Did I say a bad word? I don't mean it badly. I chose to hit each food section only once and use one plate at each. So I didn't overstuff - loosely speaking. Let me paint the picture: I had four courses - fruit, salad, entre, and dessert and seconds on dessert, but who's counting... 

Food in the banquet room had been placed at six stations. I stood there with closed eyes pretending that everything was revolving around me. Fooooooood. Here's how it looked; going clockwise.  

1. At the long center table was about five hot pots. I remember a pilaf, yellow rice, sauteed vegetable medley, salmon in lobster bisque, and a meat dish. Veggie medley was mildly seasoned. Nothing dark green in the mix so I just took a couple pieces of cauliflower. The salmon was very soft and didn't actually taste like salmon. Maybe it was because of the bisque.  

2. On the south wall was the made-to-order pancake and omelet station. This section was manned and those men were a bit stingy with ingredients. Pans were small so my order for a pancake ended up being a weecake. When I asked to have it topped with fresh blueberries, about five berries were doled out. 

Mr. Omelet Maker was no less stingy. I requested more veggies because he only gave a pinch of my favorites. Literally a pinch.  
SUGGESTION: Let the diners self-pick ingredients into a small bowl which they can hand to the servers while ordering pancakes and omelets.

3. To the right of omelet pinchville was the dessert spread. I'm pretty sure I was the first binger to crack into them. Cheesecake, chocolate cake, 3 flavors of cupcakes, brownies, apple squares, apple tart, chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles, carrot cake, and numerous petite fours including one of pumpkin cheesecake. YUM! 

4. A few feet from there was the fresh salad table. Strangely, choices were few and there was only one dressing, maybe two. I remember a huge bowl of crisp romaine lettuce and another bowl of mixed lettuces, also a small platter of roasted peppers and things, olives, onions, capers, pickled condiments. Not much for a salad lover.

5. Along the north wall, was the carving and seafood station. There were slabs of red meat which a server sliced thinly for you, crab legs which he cracked for you, and other sea beings like shrimp were served cold. 

6. The table along the east wall was by far the longest and most diverse section - the \"breakfast\" station. On one end huge bowls of cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, pineapple, blackberries, watermelon, raspberries. The stars of the fruit show were pineapple and blackberry; both sweet and ooh so juicy. Raspberries were good. Watermelon was okay. Cantaloupe and honeydew unfortunately were unripened. Every bite seemed like rind.   

The breakfast table continued with cold stuffs like cereal, yogurt, jams, croissants and danishes, muffins, and then it transitioned to the hot items. There were three or four pots, one with seasoned potatoes. Most likely there was some kind of sausage, and maybe oatmeal too.

This club definitely caters highly to its customers. Staff was bustling nonstop to clear away empty plates and refill glasses. The bill was brought to the table after we finished - a first in my buffet experience.  

Minor annoyance: Every time we left the table, we'd come back to find napkins refolded and placed neatly at our places. So all morning the server was touching and retouching everyone's dirty napkin. 
SUGGESTION: Stop that! Leave my napkin alone OR give me a clean one. 

I would definitely come again, but at mansion prices the buffet is the only meal I would  consider returning for."}
{"text":"The food put out for Sunday brunch was both pleasant to the eye and the palate.  There was an excellent selection of dishes.  All the ones I tasted were excellent - and fresh.  Service by the restaurant staff was prompt, professional, and courteous.  Even at $49 per person, considering the food and service, this is a good value.

If you are not a \"member\" of the Wrigley Mansion, there is a $5.00 membership fee added to the bill.  This isn't some scam by the mansion, but a \"requirement\" of having the restaurant and bar in a residential neighborhood.  It must be a membership club in order to operate."}
{"text":"Cool historical place with a restraunt and venu for events. $5.00 group donation to wander around and definitley worth it for the views and history."}
{"text":"OMG is this place A-stinking-mazing!  Beautiful layout, beautiful staff!  I HIGHLY recommend vising this place for ANY reason you may have.  DO NOT PASS UP!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to The Wrigley for her first Mother's Day last weekend. I've been there before and just like my past visits this time exceeded my expectations! The Mother's Day brunch was first class. The variety of quality food was excellent. The service was exceptional as well. We brought our 11 month old with us so we had to alternate trips to the buffet. Each time we left our seat the staff had already cleared our plates, folded the napkins, and refreshed drinks and mimosas prior to our return. I love this venue and it's beautiful views! I would highly recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"This is one of Phoenix's best kept secret.  The cocktails are unique and when paired with the view of the city create a 5 star experience. We enjoyed the tour and the happy hour is second to none."}
{"text":"Check out the 1929 Steinway self playing piano. One of two in the world, the other is in the Smithsonian. The piano is valued at 28 million dollars and was willed to the Wrigley Mansion"}
{"text":"This place is worth 4 stars due to the history, architecture and view. If you want a unique experience for a birthday/anniversary ect...this is the place. The restaurant on site had great service, but food was average. I'm not dying to go back for the food, but man do they have a great basil/lemon gimlet. WOW. Come here if you want to go back in time to the 30's for a nice dinner and/or drink. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was so good as were the cocktails! I loved the shrimp cocktail because the horseradish was SO FRESH! The Wrigley Pear was also a wonderful surprise. The service was great, we sat at the bar early- and the staff were all so friendly. The mansion and views are beautiful. I'd give this place 5 stars if the entertainment wasn't so dated (sorry entertainers- you are talented. I just feel like I am being put to sleep for good.)"}
{"text":"If you ever have the opportunity to visit the Wrigley Mansion Club, jump at it!  I was invited to a dinner event here, and wow, it was incredible.  The Wrigley Mansion Club (WMC) sits on top of a hill, and there are white lights all around it.  

I went into the powder room and there were two restroom stalls behind gold painted doors.  The toilets were extremely low to the ground - wow, they were definitely shorter than typical ones.

I asked for a Coca-Cola and they said, \"Sure!\" and handed me some stale Pepsi.  After that though, I had the most amazing balsamic vinaigrette on salad.  Everyone else at my table raved about it too.  For the main entree, we were served mashed potatoes, broccolini, a mild fish, and a very tender piece of steak.  Everyone got a different size piece of fish, and most of the steak was medium rare.  But it was a very nice cut, and the meal was very protein-heavy!  The views were incredible as we looked north toward the skyline.

The best part (beside the salad dressing) was the dessert.  The people who usually do not like dessert were raving over the cheesecake.  It had sort of a flan-top, a couple berries for decoration, and the most perfect vanilla-flavored shortcake crust.  It was delicious.  I would love to visit for brunch!  This place would be amazing for a wedding reception of about 100-150 people!"}
{"text":"We went with 3 other couples for Sunday brunch. We had been before, but only for fathers day, which had been a great experience both in the food and the setting. 

This brunch, however, was very disappointing. Food quality and selection was mediocre and definitely overpriced at about $45/person. Very different than what was offered on fathers day. The service was good.

The setting is worth going for once. Ideally go for a drink or regular lunch. Both day and nighttime views worth going for once. On a nice day the outside offers great photo opportunities.

The mansion sits on top of a hill with a 360 commanding view of the city and outskirts."}
{"text":"This would have been a five star review, but I'm holding back two stars due to the new renovations. I did not even take any pictures of them, because in my opinion they were so distasteful. Apparently Jamie Hormel the owner is doing a one million dollar renovation of the place, which includes these big sparkling chandeliers and bright blue walls, which do not match any of the homes original style. I would describe the light fixtures as something a rich 16 year old girl would want in her bedroom, if she had no taste at all. In my opinion the walls of the newly painted bright blue room, should have been painted teal blue, since that was Aida Wrigley's favorite color, and the home features many teal colored pieces, including Aida's floor to ceiling teal blue bathroom. The property is called Wrigley Mansion not Geordie's fourth wife's mansion, I wonder if his 3rd wife had better taste. I bet she did that's why she's not mentioned in this tour. Aside from the distasteful remodel the tour was spectacular. I can't remember our guides name but she had really nice long blonde hair, and knew everything there was to know about the mansion, the Wrigley's, and even the Hormel's. The bar staff was also very friendly and the drinks were made perfectly. Overall I had a great experience."}
{"text":"So its not really a 3, more like 3.5 but not yet a 4.

We stopped here before our reservation at a different place for drinks and appetizers. It was our first time, so we asked the lady at the entrance where to go and she sent us to the bar, but then the bar sent us all the way back. It was a little unusual that staff doesn't seem to be on the same page. 

After we got seated, we ordered some drinks and appetizers. I ordered a mixed cocktail with gingerbeer and the bf ordered their special drink of the week. We also ordered the meatballs and the buratta board. The meatballs were a disappointment, for a place as pricey and nice, you would think the food would back it up. The meatballs were very tough, and tasted way overcooked. My bf liked the buratta board, but didn't think it was anything special or amazing. 

But the drinks and the view somewhat made up for the lackluster food. The cocktails were extremely tasty and strong as well, and you really can't beat that view of the sunset over Phoenix. 

Come for the drinks and stay for the view"}
{"text":"Such fun Halloween parties!  Love wandering around.  Beautiful place.  Fun to be with a group.  

Attended a Christmas Business party there one time.  Great food and service.  

Always a good time!

Oh, and I really wish they had a coat check.  Hauling around my coat at the Christmas party was a drag."}
{"text":"We had a beautiful day at the Wrigley Mansion. It was a rainy day, so being from Chicago, we were just going to take a quick look around. The AM manager Damien was a wealth of knowledge who joined us at moments to teach us about what we were looking at. We really appreciated his love of history and his excitement transferred right to us. We then decided to stay for happy hour and Stacy was the sweetest addition to our day. We are so grateful to have spent our cousin's day in such a beautiful welcoming place! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Wrigley Mansion is a fun stop as a tourist, though a little expensive for what it is. $15/person+$5 for one member of your group to become a trial member gets you a tour. We waited about 30 minutes and a tour of about 15 people was off. One of the coolest parts is the playing piano you get to see right at the start, but the house is fun and learning about the gum King is interesting. Our tour guide was great and seemed genuinely excited about the Wrigley family. The only knock on the place is we got a lot of \"unfortunately we can't see that\" on the tour because of private events and reservations going on. We just barely got to see the piano. I don't have any answers for that, but it made us feel like we were missing out. It is still a fun thing to do if you have the time."}
{"text":"Had a deal, it was not worth it, it was  a ripoff.  First there are too many steep concrete
steps to walk up, with only one sided railing, cannot walk up with 2 people, and, then there are more concrete steps to restaurant.  Restaurant is not visible, it is all the way
a top, and, it is high.  This place is as old as it was built, plus the deal the food is rationed you are not getting good portions, there is no desert or drinks included, and there is an 18% gratuity plus.  This place is not accessible for the disabled or the
handicapped, it is really dangerous."}
{"text":"I had great expectations that we were in for a treat when I made reservations for the Wrigley Mansion.  I had visited years ago for one of the best brunches I remember.  Saturday evening, for dinner, was an experience that left us very disappointed. 

I tried to make prime time reservatios and only 5:30 and 8:00 were availalbe.  I am unsure why.  The restaurant was not full.  

The views, outside, were fantastic.  The view, as you entered the main dining room, dissapointing.  My dining partner actuall said \"Is this a buffet?\"  The room was filed with round tables for 6-8 and our party of 2 seated at one.  

Dinner began with a nice wine presentation and that is where anything good about the evening ended.  

We had the TravelZoo voucher and were disappointed to learn they increase the price to the value, they set, on the food - $120.  Tax and tip were both figured on the higher price.  

The first course butternut rissoto = good and shrimp cake - over breaded and fried.

Second course - unseasoned greens with cheese, pecans and a little bit of something on the plate and a vegtable dish drowned in balsamic dressing.

The fish dish was good but if we had not been so ready to have the evening end it would have been disappointingly small.

The table next too us asked how we suggested they get drink service, after seeing our server so attentive to us with the wine.

The best part of the eveing was when a couple received the Birthday dessert and everyone in the restaurant sang him Happy Birthday!

The valet employee was fantastic.  He shared, twice, that the Club card would be a good investment if we were to visit only twice.  We saved our money on the card since there will be no second visit."}
{"text":"Whoa! What an amazing place, with even more amazing views of Paradise Valley opulence. Hey, this IS the former mansion of the Wrigley chewing gum dude!

It's been awhile, but I do remember being awestruck the first time I visited. I have been back recently for casual networking functions.

The dining rooms are unique and elegant with original masterpieces on the wall, the food is exquisite, the service is 1st class all the way.

If you want to blow someone away - take them here."}
{"text":"I have had several meal at the Mansion Club. There is NO membership by the way, well ok its like $10 a year. Jordie Hormel, the owner (recently passed away) needed to do that to annoy the neighbors. Good for him. There are some great stories there.

The Club has started a \"pay what you think its worth\" lunch. The menu is quite wonderful, London Broil, A fantastic burger, Caesar Salad and a few other things. The meal is awesome, kudos to the Chef. By the way if you ever want to have a Sunday Brunch that you won't forget, go there on a Sunday. It is pricey BUT you won't find a wider selection of food, and I mean great food, seafood, steaks, soups, appetizers, and don't get me started on desserts.

Ok, back to pay what you think. While that part is true, they bring out the bill and you fill in what you want to pay, what they don't tell you is that iced tea is $3 and there is tax and of course tip.So it will still cost you around $10 if you put down $5 or $6.

I had a meet up there with a friend, we both know the place well. Guess I try to keep lunches under $7 these days. Our waitress was wonderful, and the chef did come by the table to say hello. 

We got to sit outside, we requested that. It was nice, but the umbrellas had to be moved a few times to cut off the suns direct rays.

I have no problems with the food, its the best. I wish they were a little more open on beverage costs. They also offered a dessert menu that was extra, and I hate to admit it but I passed. Items were $5 each on there, and the list was pretty impressive for a midweek lunch.

I'll be back but be ready to pay $10 unless you put down $5 or less for the actual meal."}
{"text":"Visited for AZ restaurant week. It was evident that the service is highly diminished when you aren't there for their regular dinner service or perhaps when you're a good twenty years younger than their typical patronage. The table behind us received outstanding service. Our server was curt and mostly ignored us. This was after they switched our server with no notification. One minute we had a one server and the next a different one appeared (this was after we said we were there for restaurant week) No refills offered for water or second round of drinks. Waited far too long for the check. Servers, bartenders, and managers displayed unprofessional behavior throughout. Food was basic quality (I would expect more given their pricing). Chicken and steak we ordered were dry, salad was nothing special. Flourless chocolate cake was dry. Plus $6 fee for valet? Far nicer restaurants in Phoenix offer valet for free. This place is not worth the time or money. Won't be returning or referring."}
{"text":"We had a lovely evening at the Geordi's, the restaurant at the Wrigley Mansion. First, we toured the mansion, then had a wonderful dinner while a wonderful jazz group played. Our server, Mike, provided excellent care. The jazz group is top class yet the lounge was surprisingly empty! What a waste!! Will be back!!ashdbxgf"}
{"text":"Great venue! We had a fabulous brunch overlooking the city. The food and service were great! We can't wait to go back and have a sunset cocktail:)"}
{"text":"A-OK.  Had a 150 person work dinner here.  Nice job--pretty good food--EXCELLENT wine choices"}
{"text":"Had the best brunch! Great selection and the endless mimosas can't be beat. Service (Prince ) was impeccable, never had to ask for a thing. Will definitely make this a more frequent weekend spot. Took a tour with Ben, and told me all kinds of stuff about phoenix I didn't even know. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here to take a tour. However, we arrived before their scheduled opening time of 11:00 am and we were told that the next tour was scheduled for noon. The price of that tour is $15/person but the receptionist advised that we could take a self-guided tour for $5 for the three of us. She indicated that the guided tour takes less than an hour. The three of us spent a little over 30 minutes looking the place over. It is a beautiful property and the mansion is interesting with great views. We were happy with our tour but we would have been unhappy with the expenditure for a guided tour."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Wrigley\"s Mansion but definitely not my last. Had a late lunch yesterday and I had a great experience, the service was outstanding, the meal very tasty and the place is on a hill overlooking the Valley and downtown Phoenix.
Tour the mansion a bit and is a beautiful Spanish style with beautiful paintings and furniture from the times when the Wrigley family vacation at that home. 
They offer a Sunday brunch that I will be trying soon as the sitting is a the ballroom where the views are the best."}
{"text":"Awful Easter brunch experience.
The whole experience started going downhill as soon as we reached the bottom of the hill where we were made to park and jump on a shuttle that was packed with no seats available. I actually had to put the baby seat on the ground because I got l yelled at for not holding onto the bars and I had no seat to put the baby seat onto.
Once we got to the lobby, total chaos as everyone from the bus was blocking all walk ways trying to desperately find their table. 
We finally found our party who got a room with 3 small windows and poor views of the golf course. The room we super hot as the AC vents seemed as a very late afterthought.
The food was the worst part. They ran out of deviled eggs within 10 minutes so they just hid the fact that they were ever there by removing the plate and the sign.
The only thing that bore any resemblance of Christopher's food (the reason we picked this dump on a hill for Easter brunch) was the bread. This bread also disappeared within 10 minutes and never reappeared.
The crab was hidden behind the carving station and we were only given two claws at a time after having to ask for it. Not too much of a problem though as the crab was bad. Probably refrozen after a previous brunch where people weren't allowed to get too much of it. This wasn't King crab or anything special.
The meats were just chewy and the desserts mediocre.
80 dollars a person for a brunch worse than a 25 dollar casino brunch. But I guess it's up on a hill and it has historic significance and people flock to it anyway but there are much better options around town and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Decent food, incredible ambiance, nice wine flight.  Great place for a romantic dinner or happy hour if the weather is warm.  Dress up and impress your date!"}
{"text":"Best brunch I have had in a very long time. The service is beyond excellent. I couldn't finish a glass of water or mimosa if i tried. The servers worked as a great team and made sure our table was always cleaned when we went for more food and our glasses filled. 

The seafood buffet options (king crab and shrimp) were tasty as were all of the meat options (lamb, roast beef, bacon covered port roast). 

The only knock I would have against the food was the deserts, which mainly were little layer cakes. They tasted stale and prepared long before they were served. 

However, you will impress everyone you bring with the amazing views of the city."}
{"text":"This is about the 5th year in a row that we have had Sunday brunch at the Wrigley Mansion for my Father-in-law's birthday.  Every year we have had a great experience....until now.

There were subtle cost savings measures that appeared - things like placing the more expensive food items (shrimp, oysters on the half shell) farther in on the serving table such that it wasn't as easy to reach, especially for senior citizens.  The dessert selection was also less and portions appeared to be cut smaller.  Not only that, but the price of the brunch went up from roughly the mid 30's a couple of years ago to $45 now.

The most shocking thing however, is that the hostess (Annabelle) actually came over to our table and asked us to hurry up because there were people waiting for tables.  And this happened even before we received our bill!  It was shocking and frankly, insulting.  Even the waitress who witnessed this exchange was visibly embarrassed.

I understand that the economy is tight and you need to generate revenues, but asking customers to leave is not the right way to do it.  It's really a shame.  The food is decent and the atmosphere and views are incomparable, but to me, customer service is paramount.  I'm pretty sure we'll be finding another venue next year."}
{"text":"Is it an historic mansion, high above Phoenix, with a famous history of who's who? Indeed. Was it a fun venue for a concert by CeCe Peniston? Absolutely. Did I enjoy the limo, wine in the dressing room and VIP treatment from their staff? You bet your sweet ass I did. 

But the smell. Seriously. Like my geriatric Aunt Helen's closet. Or the community room at a convalescent home. Or Bea Arthur's hair. 

Here I thought it would smell like Juicy Fruit."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars to very few places. The Wrigley Mansion has earned it. My wife and I had Sunday brunch there. The food is buffet style and was exceptional in quality and variety. The views from the mansion are simply stunning, but what in my opinion earns The Wrigley Mansion the fifth star was the exquisite service by the staff. We plan to return often. It is over an hour drive for us but worth every minute!"}
{"text":"Ambiance, food, tour guide - all top-notch.  We had an excellent time at the Wrigley Mansion while visiting our daughter in Phoenix.  Sunday brunch included a wide variety of food, including king crab legs, lamb with bolognese lasagna, macro bowls, fabulous fruit and cheeses, etc. You can load your plate(s) up with whatever you desire and go back for more.  Unlimited mimosas, excellent table service, and a desert bar that offered a little touch of everything for everybody.  We opted for the guided tour after brunch (while walking around with our unlimited mimosas) and learned the unique history of the Wrigley Mansion, and its inhabitants.  Gum, Spam, Elvis, all-in-all,  a fun afternoon!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, I wanted to tour the Wrigley Mansion and learn the history of the family who owned the Chicago Cubs organization. The $15 per person guided tour lasted only 30 minutes due to an on-site wedding, which blocked off more than half of the house. This was not communicated to us at the time of our booking. The main entry was stunning, namely the hand-painted ceiling and spiral staircase. The two upstairs bedrooms were cleared of original decor and only contained a framed photograph of how the room looked when the Wrigley resides there. It was interesting to learn about Wrigley's various ventures, from chewing gum to a tiling business to a cotton-based paper company. Fortunately, the tour concluded in time for us to enjoy happy hour pricing (half off glasses of wine and $3 drafts!) at Jamie's Wine Bar on the main floor."}
{"text":"Overall a splendid guided tour of the Wrigley Mansion.  Victoria shared lots of family history with us, history of the Wrigley empire, and features of the mansion itself.  The views from every room are incredible, makes one wonder why the Wrigleys just made this their \"winter cottage\" but with 5 other homes, they had their choice picks.  Loved the stories of how generous Mr Wrigley was with employees.  And from the style of even the servant (chauffer's room) quarters, the family/employees were treated well also.  Plan to spend a little over an hour on the tour.  After the tour, you are welcomed to explore the house on your own, neat.  If you do NOT spend the $10 for valet parking (which would be worth it if you are bringing an aging relative for Brunch), then its a good bit of stairs from their regular parking lot to get to the entrance.  Many original pieces of furniture, including the rare, special-designed Steinway player piano - what a treat!"}
{"text":"Austere and heavily caters to weddings and special occasions. I was expecting a furnished home. My friends and I showed up for a tour and lunch. We were given a restricted menu. Unfortunately my steak sandwich and fries tasted as though it was left over from hours before. The waiter showed up when it was time to go. I told her about the meal. She offered to replace it but it was too late. The rooms were sparsely decorated. One outstanding plum was the player piano that knocked your socks off."}
{"text":"DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE DOUBLE YOUR FUN! - TWO Yelp reviews in ONE

Why aren't \"Wrigley Mansion (Club)\" and \"Geordie's\" separate listings? It's gummed up.

ONE. WRIGLEY MANSION: 

\"Shoooooow me the way to go home, I'm tired and I wanna go to bed.... I had a little drink about an hour ago and it's gone right to my head.... wherever I may roam, on land or sea or foam... you can always hear me singin' this song....show me the way to go home!\"

Wrigley Mansion is my home!

I feel like I'm in my Grandma's house in Chicago. Or...singin' along in our best falsetto with the player piano in Leslie F.'s basement, like a couple of after-Catholic-school-fifth-grade-lunatics-still-in-our-plaid-skirts at 3pm on Tuesday.  \"Shoooow me the way to go home...\" Man, weren't we rebellious?  Fifth graders singing out songs about drinking. 

But what does all that have to do with the Mansion? 

I like the view, the lights, the lions. I like the ceilings, the railings, the Lincoln. I like the rooms, the history, the man. And just like the Hormel Family (who now owns the place) ...I love the player piano. It's a 1929 Steinway - one of two remaining - and it's the reason that, when the Mansion was up for sale ... the Hormel Family purchased it. When Wrigley died, he willed the piano to the house - the two shall never be parted. You want the piano? Welcome home!

On our most recent tour of the Mansion -thank you, legal beagles from NM for letting us partake of your par-tay ;) (btw, great venue for events) - the piano played its \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" It's still  functional and has the original twelve rolls with which it was sold. I'll spare additional details...it's worthy of your visit. (Website has tour info and about why it's a \"Club\" and at what level of membership you may wish to join.) 

As for the mansion: resist the urge to compare to \"other mansions\" from an opulence standpoint. This, by the way, was the smallest of his many homes - he only spent a couple weeks a year here.  If you're from Chicagoland, I think you'll have a natural appreciation for the \"Midwest man\" who came to the desert, who loved (tile from) Catalina Island...who, if he was in it to \"wow\" the neighbors - he probably did it considering this was completed at the height of the Depression. (Hey, if you own these 10 acres, this lovely hilltop and the Biltmore, not to mention a ball team and a most of an island...isn't that enough?) The whole Mansion is worthy of your visit. 

TWO. as for GEORDIE's - bar and restaurant located in the Mansion...as far as the food goes, I'm not as sure...

\"William Wrigley Jr. died here January 26, 1932 of \"acute indigestion.\" as reported by the \"Phoenix Gazette\" in a newspaper clipping that is framed and hung in the upstairs hallway. 

Eat at Geordie's and you'll suffer the same fate as Wrigley Jr!? Irony. Just some fun facts and decidedly not since my husband safely consumed his steak. However, I didn't risk it when up against the \"Frutti del Mar.\" Bad clams? I don't know...couldn't find 'em. Or was that the mussels? It was both. I've never had a shellfish so far outta the shell. The ones that were still in the shell were shriveled and unappetizing.  The manager was a perfect combo of personable and professional and between him and the awesome bartender, all was made right. \"Service recovery\" truly counts in the service industry and while the food was not right for me, the service was exceptional. 

(Note, I've taken creative liberties here as \"Geordie's\" was not around (of course) when Wrigley lived here - he had a kitchen staff and all that. Geordie's is named after Geordie Hormel - not only heir to the Hormel Family but also a musician and recording studio proprietor - who died in Paradise Valley, AZ in 2006 - of, I'm assuming, probably not indigestion.) (And upon further research, I find it's \"Geordie\" himself who purchased the mansion so I'll have to get my facts straighter. More questions for the tour guide.) 

I'd hate to hate on Geordie's, so we'll shelve the restaurant main courses and, at a later date, tiptoe back in with appetizers and so forth, but as for the bar area...

With an array of seating outdoors overlooking the Valley, a nice indoor bar area with television and a \"library\" adjacent... with wines around $9-15 per glass (discounted at happy hour) and fun libations evoking Wrigley (\"Doublemint Mojito\"), the bar is definitely up to snuff! That means that... 

There'll come a point where \"you can (still) always hear me singin' this song...\""}
{"text":"Family of 5 adults. We had a fun time! 
Beautiful views.  The tour was about 45 minutes.  Check in by entering the restaurant bar Jamie's. (Located by the valet service stand. We parked nearby.  Plenty of parking.  You will walk up the steps then up a hill to the house)
Once inside you will be directed to the desk to sign in for your tour.  

When you are on the tour there is an option to use an elevator to tour the second floor if you are not able to take the stairs.   We loved the tour!  
The lunch afterwards was pretty good. The views are amazing!  Loved learning so much about the history of this home.  Casual dress"}
{"text":"If you don't have much time, here is the short version of my review of Geordie's restaurant at The Wrigley Mansion Club.  Beautiful building, seriously scary food. 

My dinner began with the Caesar salad, which consisted of wilted lettuce, white flavorless dressing, industrial size baco bits, teeny tiny  chopped pieces of old tomato, with a piece of fried parmesan plopped on top.  And then the piece de resistance  - my entree, described on the menu as roasted, crisp-skin chicken with risotto and garlic sauce.  It would be helpful at this point if you were to close your eyes and imagine the type of food that arrives on your tray as you sit buckled into an airplane seat.. Hold that  image in your mind and you will then know exactly what this dish looked like, it looked like airline food.  And worse, it tasted like it. My meal ended when I leaned over and, as discreetly as possible, handed my plate back to the waiter and whispered in his ear - Unpalatable.   

Or I should say, the meal would have been over if the waiter hadn't then brought us free dessert. To simplify things,  I'll stick with the airline analogy as I describe that dessert.  You know the kind of brownies that a person might buy from a vending machine at an airport?  O.K., imagine if you took those brownies out of their wrapper and put them on a plate and then took a jar of marschino cheeries, opened the jar and let it sit on your kitchen counter for a long, long time (maybe years) until the cheeries and syrup got kind of tacky and sticky and THEN you poured that shit on your brownie from the vending machine.  At Geordie's restaurant at The Wrigley Mansion Club they call that Cherry Jubilee."}
{"text":"This place is amazing top to bottom. This is the place I bring my wife for special occasions and every time we are amazed on how good the menu is and how friendly the staff is.  This is a must see place if your in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was the first time I'd been to Wrigley Mansion while it was open.  I had a \"private tour\" by an employee once and got to see everything and it really is a great place.
Went for a birthday party and we had dinner.  $5 for valet parking, which is really reasonable, I think.  Especially in heels, cuz this girl ain't walkin' up them thar stairs.  
We had a private dining room, about 25 or so of us.  Wait staff did an awesome job dealing with such a huge party and handling our bill.
If it weren't for the food and price, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I started with the leek tart, which was amazing and a great portion size for an appetizer.
Next, had the Tuna Nicoise salad.  This is where they lose a star, and it wasn't just me voicing a problem with the size of the portion.  There was definitely plenty of tuna on it, but as Erin said \"You'd think they would have put more of the cheap stuff on it\" meaning there wasn't a whole lot of salad.  And the roasted potatoes that came with it?  I had two cubes of HARD potatoes.  They were barely cooked.  The tuna was perfectly seared on the outside and still nicely red on the inside.  If it weren't for that, I would have been horribly disappointed.  $43 for an appetizer, a salad and a bottle of Pellegrino.  (That included the gratuity added for such a large group).  
Wrigley is all about the ambiance and view, and it surpasses what you could describe it to be.  Seeing the city at night and being surrounded by cool peeps is what really made the place!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best brunch spots in town, but you better come hungry.  It's a great spot to bring folks from out of town or relatives you need to impress but my favorite is our \"ladies who brunch\" crowd. When you first walk in, look for the little closet to your left.  The entire thing is \"papered\" with the silver sheet of Wrigley's gum wrappers. It's great to see the sense of humor in a place that could otherwise be a bit overwhelming.

Membership to the Wrigley Mansion Club is just $10 a year, so it's affordable for all.  We originally went when my friend got a members email about a discount they were doing for their first brunch of the year.  Half price was an awesome way to do it, though the $42/person fee isn't really bad at all for this level of champagne brunch.  

The food was really quite good and displayed very nicely in different rooms based on the type of food.  This was a great opportunity to go from room to room and back to your table again.  After brunch it's great to grab a drink at the bar and hang out outside to just enjoy the view.

Final note - yes, valet is the only way to go.  I can't imagine trying to even remember where I parked my car on this large estate!  I leave that to the experts!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for brunch after having a great 'staycation' at the Biltmore.  Bottomless mimosa, great service, huge buffet (prime rib, lamb, oysters, shrimp, salmon, pork belly tacos, Omelette bar, cheeses, salads, gourmet mac and cheese, desserts and more!  I. Sunday's they put out their opened bottles of wine from the week...fun to try a glass of something new!  Management is superb!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I just can't give a good review here.  I got two Travelzoo vouchers, which many would argue is an attempt to increase traffic when a business isn't thriving or is in its off-peak season.  

Some friends at work decided to make it a group outing.  There were 14 of us.  I paid $120 for four, so I could bring visiting family.  The original \"value\" of the meal is $240.  What a joke!  It says in the fine print that a gratuity of 15% would be charged at the restaurant on the original \"value\" of the meal.  Not true.  Gratuity of 20% was added to my bill at the end of the night.  This wouldn't be so bad if the server/bartender wasn't so HORRIFICALLY unfriendly, rude, and unprofessional.  Really, dude?!  You made over $200 for the 2 hours you spent serving us!  He would have made more if he had been nice.  It was made clear that we had bought discount vouchers, the gratuity was already included, and our service reflected that.  But guess what?  Those are 14 people that will NEVER patronize your business again.

Let's start from the beginning.  When you park, you are required to valet your car to the tune of $7.  Note to Geordie's.  Every other establishment in town that is doing well offers free valet.  

We arrived 40 minutes early to enjoy the views and a glass of wine on the patio.  I should have known when I went to order wine and was ignored for 10 minutes that the tone for the evening was set.  When I asked for a glass of sweet white for my dining companion and the bartender said \"we don't really have one\" I was officially turned off.  Naturally when we sat for dinner we were offered a wine list boasting hundreds (I think 650) bottles of wine.  Really?!  None of those bottles are white and sweet?  No riesling?  No gewurtstraminer?  

When we finally sat, the server ended up being that very same bartender, who made a huge deal about the check splitting and where we sat.  He actually cussed during the process.  So unbelievably unprofessional.  I have never felt like such an inconvenience at a restaurant.

We all ordered our meal from a pre fix menu of what appeared to be traditional Applebees fare.  When you title your poultry option at a fine dining establishment \"Corn Flake crusted chicken\" you have to know what you're in for.  The portions were decent but I had bland risotto and a confit of vegetables that turned out to be a cold, pasty, flavorless mess.  I tried the chicken bacause I typically order chicken.  It was cooked to chewy and also flavorless except for a mushroom \"sauce\" which I'm guessing came from a Campbell's soup can.

I ordered a bottle of Tempranillo to the tune of $77 which was decent.  Best part of the night, in my opinion.

At the end, the bill came.  $169.  I had already paid for the voucher, so naturally I thought it was a mistake.  No.  I was charged the $77 for the wine.  OK.  $62 gratuity.  That was hard to stomach.  That's 20% of the pre-discounted $240 meal and 20% of the $77 wine.  Sorry, the guy was a jerk and undeserving of 20%.  Especially since the fine print stated that a 15% gratuity would be charged.

The last $30 was tax.  $30 in tax!  Do the math, folks!  They charged me tax on the original $240 price of the meal.  Even though the sales price of the meal vouchers was $120!  I don't even think that's legal!  Charge sales tax on a prediscounted price?  Do you go into a store and buy a $100 sweater on sale for $50 and then pay tax on the original $100 price?  That was ridiculous.  Mind you, I had already bought 4 glasses of wine at the bar and tipped the (lousy) bartender for that.

Sorry for the lengthy review, but I'm gonna bottom line it for you.  I love  dining out.  In this economy, I understand that fine dining establishments have to nickel and dime you to survive.  But Geordie's is NOT fine dining!  It's actually quite awful!  All told, I spent over $300 for a really sub par meal and I was treated poorly to boot.

Get it together!  They either need to hire a real chef and provide a true fine  dining experience, or cater to a different clintele.  Although I can't think of anyone who would enjoy their food.  I would rather eat at TGI Fridays..."}
{"text":"After a tour of the home, we enjoyed a lovely lunch in the formal dining room on a Thursday afternoon.The mushroom soup was magical!  We took advantage of the combination tour/lunch package which was pricy but worth the experience.  I chose the $25 option, which allowed one lunch item and a soft drink.  My husband choose the 3 course soup, sandwich and dessert for $35.  My pasta was really just average.  Lovely views from patio would make this a terrific spot, especially at night."}
{"text":"This brunch is amazing! Buffet is the best so you have so many options. The quality of the food is incredible. Omelette station, waffle station, prime rib, lamb, crab, salmon to name a few.. the service is incredible! The view is second to none. I 100% recommend for a brunch for two or to bring the whole family! What a great experience I couldn't ask for anything better. Shout out to Dillon for exceptional service and to Kevin the wonderful manager!"}
