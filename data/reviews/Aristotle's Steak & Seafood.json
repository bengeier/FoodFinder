{"text":"This is a \"made for tv\" special about a 30 year old restaurant that is in dire need of a makeover.   6 guests total (avg age 65) for the evening, extensive 8 page menu. Everywhere from escargot to raw oysters to prime rib to fish.   Sorry, that big of menu, that little turnover... Come on  Glasses were spotty, ambience was cluttered and dusty. Looks like an old Greek diner from the late 70's. They even played the theme from the Godfather, although I would have liked a meal that was fit for a the godfather...  Vodka martini was old school - very impressed   Whole pickles were good as a free app.  Salad was crisp and blue cheese dressing was fine.  Prime rib was large, but was in the back sitting after being cooked for a day or so, not fresh.   Veggies were not fresh, baked potato was average.   I am not a fan of a place that has a looking great bar, and when you walk to it, there are different stool heights, old magazines clutter, glasses all strewn about the place, no working TV, ZERO PLACE TO SIT!!!  Not to mention the fruit flies...   If you gut this place out, deep clean, and then cut the menu in half - winner.    As for now - loser."}
{"text":"Felt very rushed.  Food is either great or mediocre, tonight mediocre.  Its our anniversary, they were informed, nothing special.  As I said very rushed."}
{"text":"Visit this pillar of the community at least once a year. Our most recent outing was Jan 24 for a family birthday. Made reservations in advance just in case but it was a Tuesday night and really wasn't required. Arrived at 6:00pm and found only one other table occupied so pretty much had the place to ourselves. Service was immediate. Menu is extensive although most of the seafood items have no available pricing (ask server) due to cost fluctuations I assume. 5 of us were at this particular dinner. Comfortable seating and pleasant surroundings. Just the way it always has been. Began the meal with a couple of starters. Fried calamari and a dozen escargot. Serving sizes were average. Escargot is served in the shell rather than in a mushroom cap. Wine list was good. Various regions and a few selections from each. Entrees range in price from $30 to \"ask server\". I guess if you need to ask you probably aren't ordering anything that doesn't already have a price listed. Steak selection was good as were the seafood choices. Some pretty hefty cuts of beef. Tried the Aristotle cut of prime rib. Came on its own plate as there wasn't room for the sides which included choice of potatoes, rice or fries, veggies with cheese sauce and house salad. Ordered the Ceasar salad as have had it there before and it's done at the table and is delicious. The only downside is they charge you the same price as on the menu for the Ceasar salad rather than just adding a few bucks to upgrade from the garden salad. The rib steak was also quite the size and the salmon was fresh. Everything came hot and cooked to perfection. The service was tag teamed between two of the regular waiters so you never went without. Overall another satisfying experience. Everyone left quite happy and reeking of garlic. Just the way it's supposed to be. Would have been a 5 star but $400 for 5 people (2 bottles of wine at around $35 per) with no shellfish, desert or other drinks is still a bit pricey. Nonetheless we will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place. The waiters and decor are dated but the prime rib is perfect and the tableside Caesar salad was excellently done."}
{"text":"We have frequented this place several times over the years and it never disappoints. We have gone with large groups, small groups and most recently just my hubby and I. Service is always prompt and friendly. Servers are attentive and polite. The food is worth every penny. Seafood is fantastic, steaks are cooked perfectly. Fisherman's platter is my favorite I can never finish it so be prepared to take some home. My husband always orders peppercorn steak 14 oz and it looks like a mini roast. Always fantastic. When we were in a larger group chicken Neptune was a favorite as were the fish entrees. This is old school at its best. We recently went to the chop house and were very disappointed and hungry. Aristotles, as far as I'm concerned, is where you want to go for an amazing meal and great service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a very negative experience when we went to this restaurant for Valentine's Day. Even though the restaurant wasn't busy, we still waited 20 minutes to get a table... with a reservation. When we got a seat, the host didn't give us menus. Like I'm sorry, do we need to look at a version on our phones to look at what to order. Next, came the bread. The bread was obviously frozen and microwaved then served. There was so much butter on the bread it made it soggy. If I wanted to clog my arteries with grease, I'd go to the McDonald's down the street. I ordered the veal Oscar and my boyfriend ordered the filet wrapped in bacon. Our appetizer which comes with the course were salads. We both ordered the house salad with balsamic dressing. The salads came with just a drop of dressing and most of the salad were the ends of the lettuce stocks. We didn't even eat it. When the food came, mine looked like a flip flop covered in baby puke. The carrots were mushy, the broccoli smelled like a sweaty foot and my rice was cold and overcooked. There were crab shells in the crab meat. I honestly thought that the \"hollandaise\" sauce was microwaved Cheese Whiz\". My boyfriend's steak was very undercooked for a steak that was supposed to be medium rare. It was still mooing. His veggies were also and mushy as mine, kind of like baby food. The steak also came with a baked potato, which he never got. Everyone in the restaurant were older. probably about 50+. After this experience, my boyfriend and I will NOT be coming back and everyone who said this restaurant was good is INSANE. THIS RESTAURANT SHOULD BE ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. This place is a dream. The service is fantastic, so friendly, knowledge and just the right amount of attentive. The place is beautiful, although it's very classic looking, it's a warm, comfortable place to be in. There is even a huge fireplace in the back of the main dining room, always on. Very beautiful and elegant restaurant.   But the food. I always get the lobster tail dinner. It's always done perfectly, and the portion is a great size. The rice and veggies are done very well and compliment the lobster.  So good.  My husband gets the prime rib dinner, big enough to kill a horse. Then we sit there and eat in total silence because the food is so good and we don't want to miss a single bite.   But my favourite has to be the Caesar salad prepared tableside. The servers have perfected the preparation, with the old fashioned wooden bowls and the fresh ingredients.   Every major event in my adult life was celebrated here. Engagement, pregnancy, birthdays.  And will continue as long as they keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. I once visited almost 20 years and remembered their Aristotle's platter for 2. I returned specifically for that! The decor is dated, the water glasses dusty and the menu had a missing page and a stain on the cover. Massive dill pickles, olives and toasted buttered bread are complimentary. The oysters we ordered weren't shucked properly and you needed to use a utensil to separate the meat from the shell. The tray for the Oysters used was not ideal to retain the ice when it began to melt.  When the Aristotle platter arrived, all was forgiven. Two bacon wrapped filet mignons (a little under seasoned but buttery tender and cooked a perfect medium rare), a split lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, a pile of large scallops and king crab legs with a side of rice, broccoli with cheese sauce and baby carrots. It's a lot of very delicious food. Try as we might, this night, we were bested by the platter and had to take some of it home. This platter is epic! It's the main reason for the 4-star rating.  Then back to poorly made espresso with grinds in the cup and even on the handle. But that platter though!  Service was friendly, professional and purposeful.  A martini, a pint of beer, a reasonably priced bottle of Rioja, 2 dozen oysters, 2 espressos and the Aristotle platter with tax and tip was just a hair under $400."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years as an alternative to Topiarys or La Castile. Excellent food and service. The rib steak is the best and the garlic bread as has been previously posted. The comparison of this place to the Keg or Moxies is ridiculous. This is far better than any chain."}
{"text":"Another solid old school steakhouse.   Menu reads just like Zorros on the other end of Mississauga.   Table side Caesar salad every bit as good too.  I recommend the chateaubriand for two, Caesar salads, and ribs (they are grilled though, not smoked)   Friendly service, free garlic bread and pickles, can't go wrong.  Bathrooms need a serious cleaning and update however."}
{"text":"3.5 to be exact. Came with a group of 4 on a Friday evening. Had a reservation but was not necessary as when we got there, it wasn't too busy.  They serve you complimentary olives, pickles and buttered bread. Let me tell you, the bread is AMAZING!! It's warm and drenched in butter and that's pretty much what makes it amazing lol. You can fill up really fast on these if you don't limit yourself.   I ordered the regular cut prime rib, medium rare. All dinners come with a salad, veggies and your choice of rice, baked potato or fries. I opted for the baked potato as it was the closest thing to mash potatoes. C'mon, how can you have prime rib without mash? Anyways, the main dishes did take awhile to come out but it wasn't as noticeable to me as I had filled up on bread and my salad. My one friend opted to not get a salad, so the wait was more noticeable to her as she was starving.  My prime rib was HUGE (see pic) and juicy! It was cooked to perfection. I wasn't too crazy about the veggies as they put hollandaise sauce on them. I hate hollandaise sauce. The baked potatoes do not come loaded. They only offer sour cream and horseradish. They forgot my friend's side order of mushrooms and when she mentioned it, the one server seemed to be put off?? I don't know why that would be, as it was their fault and not ours. Nonetheless, they cooked it up pretty quick and brought it out. Everyone seemed to enjoy their different steaks.  I asked the server for a dessert menu and he stated he could read it out for us. There were four different types of cake. When I asked how much the cheesecake was the server kinda laughed and asked how big is it or the cost? I said the cost and then he laughed again and made a joke \"in US dollars or Canadian?\". I mean maybe that's his humour, but I was pretty much put off by that. We didn't end up ordering dessert. Oh and it was around $7.95 for the cheesecake.  Our servers were really friendly in the beginning but some of their attitudes started to change towards the end. I don't think I'd come back here but the prime rib was excellent. I'll give them that. Oh and their bread! Lol"}
{"text":"Took a group of people here for a business dinner.  Kind of old school and not very busy during the week. Had the Caesar salad prepared table side - it was awesome. We ordered a number of different things like prime rib, filet, rack of lamb and fish.  Everyone loved the food.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak and lobster - we have been going here for years, and usually return for special occasions."}
{"text":"This is a great place for an Anniversary dinner when you have money to spend.   Seafood was excellent. Highly recommend the escargot and oysters."}
{"text":"Staff: 8/10 Atmosphere: 6/10 Food: 4/10  The wait staff was friendly and prompt.  The portion sizes were large.  Unfortunately, the praise stops there.  I food was very underwhelming.  I started with an appetizer of mussels in a tomato-based sauce.  Many of the mussels were either unopened or only partially opened.  That is not a good sign for freshness.  My main course was seared veal steak Oscar style topped with asparagus and hollandaise sauce.  The hollandaise was nearly flavorless and was separated.  The crab was a rubbery to the point that wondered if it was imitation.  This most certainly was not the worst restaurant in which I have eaten, but it did not measure up to the level described by other reviewers."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my experience here. The service was just so so. To start, they seemed put off that I only wanted water. Sure, it was 6pm and possibly time for a cocktail but I had a big report to review when I got home so needed to stay alert! The salad that came with the meal was a joke. Pale looking iceberg lettuce with various bits of carrot and celery. I choked down half of it. When they took the plate, instead of taking the knife with it and providing a clean one for the main meal, they just tossed it on the table cloth to have with the main.  My main meal came which was the special \"rainbow trout\" but my veggies ( sad looking baby carrots) had a hair in it so it threw me off the whole meal. It was a business dinner so I didn't want to spoil the meal of my colleagues so I kept that tidbit to myself. I ate half the fish...I was hungry but it wasn't worth the calories. Drenched in butter and didn't taste good at all. At that point I was looking forward to coming home for a bowl of cereal and since I was still hungry after that, I was fortunate to also enjoy freshly baked muffins from my husband.  I am glad they are opening a new steak place in the mississauga area. (Argentia and Mississauga road) because they need another one close to the office. This place is way overpriced for the poor quality.   Go to the Lucy's next door or better yet, drive down to JJs for their peanut sauce chicken!   Sorry no pics since it was a work dinner but it wasn't worth it anyway."}
{"text":"The food was certainly not the quality we were expecting.  We ordered the chateaubriand for two as well as the new york steak.  The chateaubriand lacked any flavor. The new york steak was acceptable.    The service however, was very poor and took away from our experience.  We were not offered drinks until at least 20 minutes after seating. They took our dinner orders about 20 minutes later. The martini was poorly made. The re-make wasn't much better and they only managed to spare one single olive with my dirty martini   Nobody checked on us even once to follow up after the main entrees arrived.  Quite unimpressive for a restaurant that claims to be a high-end steakhouse. It is not on par with La Castille  Zorro's, Chop  or even any of The Kegs. The men's bathroom was disgusting and filthy and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in the last 24 hours.  I don't even expect this sort of service at a rest area Tim Hortons.   I usually prefer the non-franchise options which is why we decided to try Aristotle but in this case, the Keg would've been a much better option."}
{"text":"Missed the Caesar salad so had lunch today, fantastic as usual, prime rib and horse radish , cooked medium was excellent, can't say enough about this gem ,"}
{"text":"Aristotles is great!! You ever go to a cliche overpriced restaurant like the keg and they only offer one soup? Not at aristotles because they care about their customers. You always have at least two choices whether it be the soup or anything else. Don't give in to sub par chain restaurants like the keg moxies Montanas Jack Astors etc. choose the family owned business."}
{"text":"Recommended by the hotel staff When we drove up it seemed like s strange place for a good restaurant because it was in a strip mall   The theme was Greek Here is the collective view of the group I was with  Good rib eye steak, lamb shiskabob Shrimp appetizer was bad so stay with the calamari   Excellent service  Place was here for twenty plus years so must be doing something right or the hotel takes a cut for recommendations   Either way it was good"}
{"text":"Pretty generous servings. Served us olives and  pickles with garlic bread! That's unique.  We ordered veal oscar, monk fish, chicken neptune and 14 oz ribeye. Eveything came with rice, vegetables and an additional baked potato with the steak.  It was a pretty chill evening being a Wednesday night and the server was helpful and nice but I think he would be on any night.   Decent prices and good sauces this place  is great for dates, family dinners or other special occasions."}
{"text":"Sat night out with friends. Fast to seat for dinner, 4 in party.  Courteous staff, easy going servers with loose description of food as oppose to other restaurant more detailed.  ie  Special was veal chop.  Would have been nice if servers described it as a 20 oz veal chop grilled and served with carrots and broccoli.  Veal cut was nice for presentation and tasted okay.  Appetizers were clam chowder served with fresh clams and fried calamari.   Salad was crispy but a little too wet.  Moisture not spun out, or drained, from a bag.   I not a big fish fan but the Grilled grouper tasted great. Huge portion of about 26 oz.    cappuccino was okay.  I like more foam but cups were small at 12 oz.   bill was about $200 for 4, plus tip."}
