{"text":"Came here with a group for lunch and was very pleased to get to know this spot.  Service was excellent - quick, unobtrusive balanced with helpful.  I'm a sucker for duck of any sort and the confit was the perfect portion and very very tasty.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the bartender. Looks like a real bro who cares about important things like hockey and the quality of coffee at Tim Hortons. True Canadian brah. Food, service, cocktails on point but this guy's fucking amazing."}
{"text":"Another one of those places that tries to market itself as upscale and don't quite hit the mark. Food pricey, small portions but average taste. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Really nice food expertly prepared with good quality ingredients. We found the service to be really good.  Everyone was friendly and quick to serve us but stayed out of the way so that we could enjoy a nice quiet meal. We had the cheese soufflet and the crispy duck to start and they were both amazing followed by the tenderloin and the sable fish which were again, delicious. For dessert we had the iced nougat and the sorbet which were both really nice. 

Very exceptional restaurant. My only (small) complaint was that I found the wines by the glass list to be a little weak. I drink red and my wife drinks white so a bottle, of which they have some great choices, wasn't an option. I started with a glass of the pinot noir but found it really weak and flavourless. Again, not a huge issue but when you're paying over $200 for a dinner for 2 you expect a certain quality, even from wines by the glass.

Having said that, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant that definitely defines the experience of \"fine dining\"!

It was the time of year where it was my boyfriends birthday where I wanted to take him to a nice restaurant.  After taking into consideration places like Charcut and Notable which were rather high in price, I settled my decision on Blink Restaurant based on its reputation of fine dining with an intimate atmosphere and its rather reasonably priced menu.  Boy am I ever glad I choose this place!

Located on Stephen's Avenue and 1st Street, Blink looks extremely tiny from the outside however looks can be extremely deceiving, because as you walk in the room is actually quite large.  Shaped like a long room, the tables were nicely spaced apart from one another allowing diners to have an intimate dinner and not have to listen in on other people's gossip.  The mixture of new and old pieces of decor complimented the dark brown and white hue of the restaurant allowing for a nice open atmosphere of comfort.  Upon walking in we were warmly greeted by the hostess who promptly seated us in a comfy booth.  Blink's menu is of European style dishes with a contemporary twist on the garnishes, spices and oils used in the cooking.  While most of the dishes for seafood, chicken, or beef are priced around the $25 to $35 dollar range, vegetarian dishes are priced at a reasonable $20 per dish.  Although it sounds pricey, do take into perspective the dishes that you are ordering and compare them to other restaurants where they are all actually very reasonably priced.  My boyfriend ordered the special for the night which was a ribeye steak while I ordered a vegetarian gnocchi dish along with wine to accompany our dishes.  As we waited for our meal to come, our server was highly attentive in refilling our glasses of water. 

The wait for our meals was a little lengthy - however I can't complain as my boyfriend and I who are rather light eaters never get appetizers...which also applied to this dining experience.  However the wait for the food was definitely worth it as the food that was beautifully prepared was equally delicious.  The steak that my boyfriend ordered was cooked to precision as what a medium rare steak should be.  My gnocchi dish was a little small in size for the average eater - however the flavours of the dish where the mix of garnishes and spices excused the small portions as the dish was quite tasty. 

In the end the dinner came out to around $100 dollars (tip included) - although it was a rather pricey dinner, I had no issues footing the bill as my boyfriend and I had a great experience not just in food, but as well as service. 
All in all, I definitely recommend dinners to try Blink restaurant out where its wonderful for intimate dinners with your loved ones.  If you want exceptional service and food, along with a restaurant that doesn't have attitude and isn't jammed packed busy, then Blink may be for you.

Based on boyfriend's recommendation - the 9\" ribeye steak"}
{"text":"I brought an out of town business client to Blink because he was sick of chain restaurants while travelling and considers himself a bit of a \"foodie\". His request was to go to an independently owned restaurant with locally sourced offerings and a chef inspired menu. Having been here previously I knew this was the place for him. It doesn't hurt that they have a fabulous location only steps away from some major hotels in downtown Calgary. He was pleased with my choice. 

They have a fabulous wine list and even if you don't want an entire bottle of wine, their glass selections are still fantastic and (being from the U.S.) he was happy to try some different, Canadian wine offerings. 

The carpaccio and scallop starters were perfect. The carpaccio was melt in your mouth and the scallops were cooked to perfection. His main course of halibut was cooked beautifully and he loved the squash purée side. My steak was cooked to perfection, but was a bit fatty. Guess that is to be expected when you order a ribeye!

Our waiter was attentive, but not 'in your face' and was able to time the meal at our pace. The ambience was subdued and not overly loud allowing a normal conversation at the table considering the small space. it is essential to have reservations at this restaurant and parking is non-existent."}
{"text":"Although the Calgary Stampede crowd was heavy we were able to get a nice table on the patio. The waitress was very nice and had us wait in the bar while they reset the table. While we waited we tried their signature martini's. Try the Lychee martini, it's unusual, with a flower like aroma, but not too sweet. The halibut fish and chips were superb! Everything from high quality fresh fish, lite batter, and cooked to perfection without being too greasy. The fries were excellent as well. I would have given them a five, but they didn't handle the handoff from the bar to the patio well. Another waitress gave away our patio table and fortunately another patio table emptied so we had to wait a little longer, but were good to go."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good waiters, great food... I have been here about 5 times in 2012 and will continue to be a patron for years to come. I loved the rabbit when it was on the menu, please bring it back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking forward to this restaurant during Stampede after many people recommended it to us, and after reading the many positive reviews on Yelp.  It seemed to be a great restaurant in the middle of Stephen Avenue, and so we grabbed a seat on the patio, and anxiously awaited our meal.  From what we saw, the menu seemed to be quite interesting, with a number of dishes that caught our eye.

I had decided on the lobster & risotto, and my wife had decided to go with the chicken.  We wanted to share the cheese souffle as an appetizer.  We were about to order, but we inevitably asked the waitress for what she thought was some of the best fish / meat dishes.  She recommended the herbed halibut, which was served with polenta and broccolini.    My wife switched to the tenderloin, which apparently was \"fantastic\", and based on what we read from the Yelp reviews, we switched to the gouda macaroni to begin.

We were starving and so hungrily ate the starting bread.  45 minutes later, our macaroni was brought... to the table beside us.  It took 10 minutes for a waitress to come outside and take the dish away, and another 15 minutes for us to get a fresh one.  At least they didn't just move the dish from the other table directly to ours!  The macaroni was bland, lacked salt, or really any other flavour.  Highly over-rated in my opinion.

After another 45 minutes, our meals came.  The \"herb-crusted\" halibut looked more like a square slice of a frozen entree with a perfectly cut pesto puree placed on top.  It was served on top of a cylinder of polenta.  The whole appearance had a cafeteria-like feel to it, which would have been fine if there was taste.  The combination of flavours didn't work well, and there was no \"crusting\" at all - it was all a mush on top of a well-cooked piece of fish.

The steak didn't fare any better - my wife didn't finish it.  She ordered medium rare and got more of a medium - and the flavour in the meat was lacking.  Don't get me wrong, the beef itself was good - I mean, it is Alberta, but there was nothing beyond the cut of meat in the meal.

We decided not to opt for dessert as we noticed the table beside us had theirs look like the same frozen entree appearance - a perfectly cylindrical hazelnut nougat.  Plus we had been waiting far too long as it was for our food... the bill finally came, and it had 5 drinks on it that we didn't order.

To summarize, the food was nothing spectacular... which was unacceptable given that this is on the pricier scale in Calgary.  The service complemented the poor food as well.

We won't go back."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend on Friday night for my wedding anniversary.  Every single thing we ordered was delicious.  The waitress we had seemed to be very busy, even though it wasn't that full, but there was a host or manager person that was very attentive and picked up any slack in service we had.  He even brought us a complimentary starter since we were there for a celebration.

We ordered the Soufflé, Scallops, and the Albacore tataki.  I'd probably skip the Tataki, it was a bit bland.  Three starters might be a bit much, but I usually enjoy small plates better than a large entrée.  The waiter brought us the Beets because it was our anniversary, and we really enjoyed it.  The Scallops were my favourite of the starters we had.

For mains we had the Tenderloin and the Halibut.  Both were delicious and we could not finish either of them.  This meant we were much to full to sample any deserts.

We drank the Alex Gambal Chardonnay and it was fantastic.  Incredibly hard to find to purchase, so have a glass or two while you are there and think of me!"}
{"text":"Went with a group on the long weekend.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  The cheese soufflé was my favourite appetizer and I ordered the halibut, which was fantastic.  The best part of the dinner was the desserts.  We ordered pretty much every dessert and passed them around the table.  We ended up ordering several extra of the raspberry dessert (I forget what it was called).  I will definitely go again the next time I am in Calgary!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal at Blink a few weeks ago.  It was one of those places I kept hearing about, but we just never found the time to go, which we regret now.

We had the salumi cheese appetizer, plus the wild mushroom soup. Both were fantastic and we were literally licking the pesto sauce for the salumi off the plate.  They have beautiful, crusty bread, which of course is a secret where they get it from *darn*

My husband had Moroccan chicken, which is a bit disappointing; I thought it tasted fairly bland, but it was well prepared.  My rabbit with gnocchi was amazing and I had to hide it from my husband who kept stealing bits off my plate.  We both shared the sticky toffee pudding, which was a bit of delicous, suprisingly very light, sweetness to end the evening.  The room was modern but had a slight romantic feel to it with warm grey tones and candles in the evening.  We sat  near the window in an alcove. Fine for summer, but a bit chilly for fall weather.

Service was very good, but  slightly fake at the beginning, and our server seemed to warm up to us in the end; other staff were very warm and friendly.  This place is a winner and our new \"to go\" place when dining after work downtown."}
{"text":"The service you get from Lesley and the food Chef Richard creates is a unbeatable combination in Calgary. Other restaurants can learn from Blink that a simple elegant decor, well trained staff, reasonable prices, and the best food can exist in Calgary. This restaurant success is portable..it can match with some of the best restaurants in NYC, San Fran or Vegas. I hope they find the energy to open another Calgary Restaurant."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!!!
had the surf and turf a while back.... craving it right now..
good service, good food, good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've only been during \"The Big Taste\", so my experience may not represent a normal night at Blink.  

We liked the decor- simple, modern and sleek, but still warm.  We were seated near the back with a view of the (bright) kitchen and the bar.  We noticed a cute-looking booth at the front with a great view of the street outside- worth reserving for a small group in the future!

For dinner I ordered from the Big Taste menu.  My starter was a salad of endive, pears, parmesan and walnut.  It was delicious.  My entree was the ricotta gnocchi (with black chanterelles); it was also very good, but not a filling portion.  I don't know if they serve a larger portion outside the Big Taste season.  Dessert was an ice cream sandwich with homemade ginger cookies and caramel ice cream- again, really good.  

Overall service was friendly and attentive, although after our meal while I was in the washroom my friend overheard the staff complaining about getting a small tip from another table.  Definitely unprofessional.  Another small complaint is that similar to other 8th Ave restaurants the basement washrooms smell a bit like sewers.  I know it's (probably) not their fault, but if I'd been paying full price for that meal I'd be expecting top food, service AND facilities."}
{"text":"Tasty rich food with lots of veggie options. Portions a wee bit small though"}
{"text":"I am from Miami and I was in Calgary in business and wanted to take my customer to a nice restaurant. This place was perfect. The service was excellent and the food as well. I had the filet and the tomato tart.  Both were outstanding. However the best was my drink. Be sure to have a Negroni. Best I ever had. The beautiful lady at the bar even told me what was the secrete ingredient.  Don't miss this place. Do make a reservation it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Had an excellent beef short rib entree.  I don't have much else to say because we were here for a super late dinner where we ate and left.  I will be back to try a more complete set of dishes off the menu and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"I can't type to much right now,  busy stuffing my face with amazing food and drinking fantastic wine. You should come join me."}
{"text":"Delicious. Beautiful. Indulgent. I will definitely be back. The English sticky toffee pudding was amazing! 

My only complaint? We were sat right by the window which was a little on the cold side. But they had these soft woollen blankets ready on the seat for sissies like me."}
{"text":"Best food in Calgary, bar none!
The menu changes with the season to ensure its freshness, and being a bit of a foodie, I've become obsessed with their offerings. 
I have yet to order a dish that I haven't fallen in love with. 
Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to Blink for lunch and  dinner and was fairly impressed both times. Atmosphere wise Blink has nailed it, cozy chic without being overbearing or stark.

The menu is interesting, I can't say I was over the top in love with the food. My pasta tasted...plain, and the Cod Brandade doesn't hold a candle to the one at Una.  My lunch dining companion raved about the rabbit and my dinner dining companion loved the fish. 

That said, I have to rave about the side dishes. The mac and cheese (oh yes I am huge M&C fan) was excellent, as was everything else I tried. The wine list is interesting, bigger than some and fairly diverse. 

I found the service to be attentive without being suffocating or lacking, it struck exactly the right balance.

Absolutely a go to for me again. Blink is one of those rare cases that can can serve both as a business lunch spot or a special night out destination."}
{"text":"Visited Blink for the first time this evening for a wine pairing with NZ producer Forrest Wine.  I won't get into the details of the dining room but can be described as simple elegance. We started with appetizers of beef carpaccio, tuna tartare and arancini. The beef and tuna were splendid but I found the arancini to be on the salty side. This paired well however with the Cava paired to it which redeemed it. First course was a beautifully presented beet, radish and goat cheese salad. The texture of the wafer thin sliced vegetables paired with the creaminess of the goat cheese was a smashing success. The second course of gazpacho and chilled tomato soup was ok however the prawn and pea spring roll was dynamite. The 3rd course was a duck confit with gnocchi and morel mushrooms. This was literally plate licking good and reminds me that I should always order duck. Dessert was a lemon cream with strawberries. Each course was expertly paired and the service of the kitchen and wait staff was impeccable. This is a special dining experience that was worth every penny. I'd go back and think that due to the seasonal nature of their menu should be revisited.

A worthy splurge!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch often because the ambiance is relaxing and the food is always good.

This week I ordered the peach and apricot salad, and it is to die for.  You'd think a salad couldn't be that outstanding, but it is.  I also had the wild salmon, and it was delicious - the tapenade and croquette is the perfect complement to this satisfying dish.

My only hesitation with rating Blink 5-stars is their dinner portions.  The food is just as good as their lunch menu, but the dinner portion size is a little bit on the light side.  Despite this, the food, atmosphere and service is so good, that I can't justify giving it anything less than a 5-star rating.

Compliments to the chef!"}
{"text":"After reading so many excellent reviews for this place, Hubby and I were really excited to try it for ourselves. Maybe I was simply too excited for it, but overall, we weren't impressed. The room is beautiful. Nice high ceiling, beautiful exposed brick walls. Absolutely lovely. The food was also lovely.

So, now you're probably thinking, what's the problem then?

Well, in our case there were a couple of problems. 1) the portion sizes. Neither my husband nor myself are big eaters, but the entrees were small! We were both still hungry after our main dish. 2) the service. There was nothing completely wrong with our server, but he certainly didn't go above and beyond for us. Nothing stood out about the service as being particularly warm, thoughtful or skilled. The server hadn't even drawn our attention to the fact side dishes are separate from the main courses. As a result, we ordered our mains, they arrived, we saw there were no sides on our plates, we ordered sides and they arrived after we were done our entrees. Overall the pacing in general was just off. We wanted to enjoy a leisurely dinner, we ordered a bottle of wine, etc., etc. but our appetizers came out very quickly and our mains weren't far behind. The other issue we had with the server was that I explained, when we first got the menu, that I'm gluten-free. I asked for advice about what items I could order...he said everything was an option for me as they're good about tweaking things as needed to accommodate dietary restrictions. I settled on the duck confit salad as my appetizer and then the server tells me it can't be tweaked as there's soya sauce in it. Wish I had known that before getting my heart set on it.

Would I go back? Probably not. It was an expensive meal and though the food was tasty, there just wasn't enough of it and the service wasn't polished enough to justify such an expensive night out."}
{"text":"Go between 5 and 6:30 for the special prix fixe menu! It's fresh farm ingredients  brought to the table. I had the rabbit rillette (very good), the flat iron steak (can't go wrong) with descent risotto and the sticky toffee pudding is worth it. Anyway price, ambiance, service and wine list make this a must try."}
{"text":"Blink - A flash of flair and freshness!

It was my birthday this week, so decided to try Blink Restaurant on 8th Avenue. And what a delightful surprise and gratifying experience!  The restaurant resonates with local recognition and accolades and so it was with a certain degree of scepticism that I decided to book a table for two.
 
The restaurant is situated in an old and historic downtown building with its interior brickwork beautifully restored. The contemporary interior design and furniture complements the modernization of the old building elements and creates a wonderfully stylish and vibrant atmosphere. It is by no means a \"quiet\" restaurant and I would not suggest that this be used for a romantic liaison. Go somewhere else for that.  With the hard surfaces on the walls, floors and ceilings, the place gets noisier and noisier as more people arrived. The place was alive and people were enjoying themselves at their tables in animated and pleasurable conversation.  The space vibrated and reverberated with a joie de vivre, so sadly lacking in many other similar establishments around town. Some guests may not like this, but I do, for my particular kind of celebratory occasion.

The food and service was exceptional. They emphasise sourcing of local fresh produce and products and it shows in the meals placed before you. Skillful cooking, impressive presentation flair, and of course, attentive and knowledgeable service.  I've bitched many times before about our younger generation of  restaurant owners and chefs not knowing the difference between service and HOSPITALITY....I'm pleased to say, that these folks get it! 

The twice baked aged cheddar soufflé with braised leeks, scaled cream, walnuts and frisee was my starter, and was beyond superb. Would \"exquisite\" be a more appropriate description? My mains comprised the roast sea scallops and crispy Berkshire pork belly, with butternut squash, rainbow chard, honey, maple, and splashes of bourbon mustard. If was a born Calgarian and not a transplanted Cowboy, I would have licked the plate as well. But fine dining insists on maintaining a decorum of etiquette.
 
Now interestingly enough, my wife ordered the braised lamb, which looked marvelous, and she tells me that it was wonderfully tender, however, she was disappointed by the lack of sufficient seasoning. She felt that the meat and braised sauce was tasteless. I would never argue with her when it comes to taste and seasoning! So unfortunately, the lack of sufficient seasoning by the chef (and I have no doubt that the Chef will argue that it was seasoned sufficiently - although if he is British, bland roast and meat is considered very palatable) resulted in my wife being less than impressed with the lamb.
 
They also have a superb collection of wines and a great selection of champagne and sparkling wine choices.

Blink is a super, sassy and superior restaurant and rates on an international scale. However, while they deserve to get a five star rating, I feel that their limited menu choices, sadly inhibit that top level of international distinction."}
{"text":"Second time I've given 5 stars and well deserved.  I thought it might be overhyped and I would be let down but ohhhh no.  Went there with my old lady for our anniversary and we did the full tour. We had 2 appys; the cheese souffle and the scallops were both pretty good...the scallops also came with some sort of pork that was basically just deep fried fat chunks but I think that was the point.  The menu is a bit tough to interpret and I had to ask a few questions so you might end up with a suprise or two.  We each had fish for our entrees, and I think the halibut was better then the salmon but both very well cooked and seasoned. For dessert we had the chocolate tart and the hazelnut nouget with raspberries.....the raspberry dish was the best dessert I have ever had and this isn't my first rodeo, so don't think that I would say that lightly.  We also split a bottle of Tawnee wine (sweet but tasty) and our total bill was $200 including tip.  Not too shabby in my books considering how much we ate.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here, food was very well prepared and the flavors are clean and harmonious. Service was also very pleasant."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner of scallops and Berkshire pork belly while my colleague enjoyed the halibut, which was beautiful and came with fiddleheads - always a treat in my book. We arrived right at the beginning of the dinner seating at 5:00 because we had to write an exam at 7:00, and the waitress was very understanding and attentive and wished us luck when we left. What we really appreciated was the unobtrusive background music. Seems to be the thing to pound your head with trance over dinner these days, but for us distracted, stressed out, slightly ADD, slightly older folks, it is nice to find a place you can still talk without having to yell. If I had my way there would be an \"age-friendly\" category on Yelp - how about it, guys?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been to blink before and commented on how phenomenal the food was, so he decided to take me here for a little Thanksgiving celebration. 

The atmosphere of blink was mellow and relaxing. The contemporary decor and the exposed brick walls adds a nice touch. The lighting was dim, and the noise level was average. The restaurant is  an 'upscale'  fine dining place. It can comfortably fit larger groups of about 8-10 people (restaurant has a capacity of 62). It is probably best to make reservations, because although it is Thanksgiving weekend the restaurant was quite busy and full when we arrived.

The menu items are a bit more pricey than your average Moxie's restaurant, but I definitely thought that it was money well spent. Our waitress was phenomenal. She was very attentive, polite and her timing was great (she gave us just the right amount of time between ordering/finishing drinks, dinner and dessert). I would definitely say that I had a pretty good experience at this restaurant and that I would recommend it to friends.

Food wise, we started off the night with a blueberry hot tea, which consisted of blueberry liquor, some cinnamon, a slice of orange and earl grey black tea. This is the most unique form of tea I have ever tasted, but none the less I was quite impressed by it. The blueberry liquor was very mild, and the cinnamon added a delicate flavour. I was never a big fan of strong liquor so this was definitely to my liking.

Next, we went straight to the dinner menu. I ordered the chef's special halibut which came with sushi rice, pickled beech mushrooms, and warm sesame vinaigrette. The halibut itself was delicious. It was soft, moist and cooked just right. The sesame vinaigrette was very unique it added a tinge of sourness to the mushrooms and rice, but it was not overpowering. I personally have not decided on whether I like the sesame vinaigrette or not yet, but its definitely different.

My boyfriend for dinner ordered the Roast breast of Noble Farms duck, which came with scalloped potatoes, almond purée, green beans and Santa Rosa plums. The duck was absolutely delicious, it was tender, juicy, and flavourful. The scalloped potatoes were made quite well. However, the almond puree seemed to have been a bit sweeter then my boyfriend remembered. The puree was a bit sweet to my liking as well.  

Finally, we had dessert. I had the Iced hazelnut nougat with fresh raspberries and raspberry coulis and my boyfriend had the Liquid centered Valhrona chocolate cake with crème fraîche sorbet. Both were phenomenal and left us both quite satisfied with our choices. The iced hazelnut nougat appeared to be a smooth little ice cream cake, but the hazelnut nougat embedded in the ice cream definitely did its justice. It added a nice texture contrast and a delicious crunch. The fresh raspberries and raspberry coulis was a bit more on the sour side and complemented the iced hazelnut nougat well. The Liquid centered chocolate cake on the other hand was a warm dessert. Like a chocolate molten cake it had a liquid inside that just floods your mouth. The difference though is that it has just the right amount of chocolate that isn't too rich (I'm not a big fan of chocolate cakes because I find them a bit too rich). It is complemented by the fraiche sorbet which was more on the tangy side. 

Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favs. I can't say enough about the menu and wine list.

The duck is the best in Calgary, one of the best in Canada.

I like the atmosphere so I tend to show up for a bottle of wine and the cheese plate to spend an evening. The cheese plate comes with an offering of raw honeycomb which is great.

If you sit at the front and look out at the heritage buildings it feels like France or Italy in the evening, which helps pass the time in Calgary.

Definitely recommend Blink"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time visiting Blink, and it definitely won't be my last!  From the french bread served after placing our order, (the REAL french bread as made in France, not the North Americanised version you get all too often in restaurants these days) to the amuse bouche (a fantastic corn soup with truffle oil-to die for!) to our main courses (mine-a perfectly cooked seared then oven roasted halibut-my husband also really enjoyed his chicken dish)-and sadly, we were so sated after all of the above, we had no room left to try the dessert list-next time!  

The chef shows his pedigree with the beautifully presented and executed dishes-he was a sous chef under Thomas Keller at the French Laundry, and the pastry chef (who makes the incredible french bread at the restaurant) is from France and is about to open a bakery adjacent to the restaurant- I will definitely be making trips there when open!  The service was exemplary - our waiter was attentive without being intrusive, and he had such a friendly and unpretentious manner.  All in all, a wonderful experience - the only downside was trying to find parking close by, but that's Calgary!  It's wonderful to see restaurants of this caliber operating in Calgary!"}
{"text":"To me, Blink is like an old friend that I catch up with from time to time. The visits are few and far in between but each time I'm there, I'm reminded of the good times - or in this case, the good food!

The special of the day was pork belly with summer veggies, how could I say no to that? To me, pork belly is a close second to bacon!

The atmosphere here is great, it's a smaller sized space to so it doesn't get too crowded, therefore you can come here to catch up with an old friend (and not have to yell) and enjoy an amazing meal.

To balance my rich and savoury meal, I ended off with a sweet iced hazelnut nougat topped with fresh berries - highly recommended!

Stephen Ave is quite saturated with restaurants, so it can be overwhelming to choose where to eat. But if you want quality in food, service and atmosphere, then head to Blink. Like me, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Always so good. The service and the food make this restaurant one of the best in Calgary."}
{"text":"I really loved every minute of my night out at Blink. Came in after a symphony show for dinner, a bit on the later side. I have to agree with the other reviewers, they really go over top with the service here - and it is the attention to details that make all of the difference. The food was excellent, our server was very knowledgable and helpful, and the ambience was perfect. All in all, this one stays in the pocket for when I want a gauranteed fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"I have heard really good things about Blink, so I was really excited when I dragged my date here. It has a beautiful atmosphere with modern decor integrated perfectly with the exposed brick. The tables had these large chairs that were very comfortable. Being a bigger guy I did appreciate larger chairs to rest my large posterior. 

For drinks we had 2 glasses of Big Fire Pinot Noir ($12/glass). This was the highlight of the meal for me. It was just good stuff, perfect to loosen one up before a great meal.

We had the mushroom soup ($9) and as starters Squash soup ($9). The mushroom soup was perfect, so creamy and smooth. The squash soup was surprising thin and light. Not like a butter nut squash. 

For a main course we had the Beet Salad ($13.50). It was light and refreshing. Almost tasted like a spring type dish. We also had the Rabbit ($33). This guy was from Lethbridge. It's always good to eat a local little one of these guys. I like the fact that most of the ingredients are from Alberta or BC. They go out of there way to let you know about it. Service was good. Pricey.

{"text":"My friend and I love anything to do with goat cheese, so almost immediately we order the tomatoe and goat cheese salad ($13.50).  Almost as quickly as we had ordered it, we had devoured the perfectly tasty salad.  We tried to be patient and enjoy it, but it was just too good. 

I can absolutely  never turn down lamb, especially when I know it was going to be good.  And Blink is one of those places where you just know that it is going to be good.   I ordered the grilled leg of lamb for $32. As I had suspected, it was mouth-watering.  The whole meal had been perfect. 

The service was also really great and they were very well informed.  They helped us picked a perfect bottle of wine for our meal. 

The day I went, we got a private table right by the window.  It was snowing outside, but the atmosphere couldn't have been more warm. 

They also hold cooking classes the last Sunday of every month.  I actually haven't gone to these classes yet, but if they can make me cook food as tasty as what is on the menu, I'm going to register ASAP."}
{"text":"Blink is fabulously elegant, and one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Calgary whenever I'm jonesing for a ritzy dinner. This is an excellent choice for a special celebration date or a classy business lunch. Food is delish, but portions are small, so if you have a big appetite you might to choose somewhere that gives you more bang for your buck. However, if you're all about taste and presentation, Blink won't fail to satisfy. Staff is attentive but because of the venue, just borders on snooty but it's tough to be warm while being intensely formal, so I give it a pass. Great place if you're looking for something special!"}
{"text":"i thought this restaurant was aight. food was good overall. the Alberta hangar steak was the best dish of the 4 i tried. The meat was very tender and flavorful. The red wine sauce it came with and the potato were perfect complements to the meat. There was also an arugula pesto and large pieces of bacon. Would have liked to have seen double the potato since I like my potatoes and meat however. the risotto was also quite good. so make sure to get one or both of those if you go!"}
{"text":"This year I decided that Christmas lunches were going to include visits to new restaurants that I've always wanted to try but never got too.  Blink was quickly added to the list.  We were lucky and got to sit in the front window table.  Great people viewing!  It's seems a bit chilly at first but if you put one of the lovely pillows behind your back, it warms you up immediately.  

Our waiter was very attentive and had a great sense of humor.  He was a great help with choosing our meals.  We started with the albacore tuna on toast to share.  it was tasty but a bit salty.  We chose 3 different entrees (the fried chicken, the sea bream and the duck) but we traded a bite of each so that everyone could try a bit of each.  All were very good but I would have to say the duck won hands down.  Unfortunately that's not what I ordered.  I had the fried chicken and it was awesome as well.  I'll have to go back for the duck!  We shared the creme brulee and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  

Overall a great meal and great service."}
{"text":"I would lick my plate if I thought it was acceptable.  Been here two times in the last month while in town on business.  Service is friendly, smart and helpful.  Food is exquisite - dessert fabulous."}
{"text":"I have dined here a couple times already.  Each time, the food and service were impeccable.

My ratings are below:  

Environment - Ambiance is very warm and cozy.  It is low lit, not a large room, but, cozy...

Service -- Hostess was very polite.  Took my coat upon arrival and put it on me when I left.  Very nice touch to this...

Food

Appetizers:  
1.  The SCALLOPS!!  If this restaurant did not serve anything else except scallops, it would survive.  I have had scallops in many restaurants around the world.  By far, the scallops prepared here are FAR and AWAY the best that I have ever had.  I would recommend making two orders of these and call it your dinner.  It is THAT GOOD!!  I practically licked the plate clean.

Entrees:
1.  The Lamb -- I would not recommend this dish.  It was average.  The presentation is nice.  They cut up the lamb and shaped it like a tuna can mountain.  It is served over a bed of peas (kinda too much peas).  It was an OKAY dish -- I would go back to the scallops... :)

2.  The Quebec Veal Osso - very good dish.  Meat was tender, flavorful, and very good.  It is served with a side of risotto.  Honestly, I don't think the risotto is a good compliment to this dish.  Preferably, some green vegetables would hit the mark ... ala broccolis and asparagus..  Otherwise, this dish was very good.

Dinner for one - one appetite, one entree, water, and tip would run about 60 CAD.

It is well worth it and I would highly recommend this establishment.

Cheers,"}
{"text":"Great service and absolutely delicious!  We had the salmon app, the pork shoulder and the halibut.   All were excellently prepared and served beautifully.   Oh, and we enjoyed their signature drinks as well.   I had a 'clockwork orange.'   Delish!"}
{"text":"I travel a fair bit to Calgary for business and was looking for a new restaurant to try after hitting all the top steak joints.  I believe I have had my best Calgary Meal so far at Blink.  I did not have one bite  of my meal that I did not savour and enjoy.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"A couple of nights ago a close friend and I headed over to blink for a quiet meal before heading out dancing.

I found the atmosphere to be quite cozy and welcoming. I loved the fact that we were greeted as we came in and I thought the 'Chef's Table' featuring the daily specials was a very nice touch.

Our server was nothing short of professional and I was impressed by the menu as it offered its own vegetarian section. I opted to order the 'Saute of Polenta' which was excellent and my date ordered the halibut which he thoroughly enjoyed. The prices were steep ($17 for my meal, $33 for his) however I was happy to find out that Blink uses only the freshest ingredients, which all happen to be locally-grown. So not only were we enjoying a meal, but we were supporting the local market as well - win/win situation! 

Blink is definitely the kind of place you'd head to for a romantic evening out, or somewhere you'd go to have sparkling conversation with a good friend. it's the kind of place where intimate conversation is possible and it is the perfect prelude dinner spot before going off elsewhere to dance the night away."}
{"text":"Our first dinner at Calgary was at Blink, a trendy restaurant specializing in local ingredients (especially Okanagan peaches) and some pretty creative flavor combinations.  Our trip from SFO was somewhat rough - nearly 2-hrs flight delay so a nice dinner would really patch things up.

Blink definitely exceeded our expectations.  We enjoyed all the dishes, had good and friendly service, and some pretty good desserts.  The food came out slower than we're used to, but that's OK since the food was prepared perfectly.  So 5-stars!  We ordered:

Peach Salad: Arugula, candied pecans, Prosciutto, Parmesan, and some really soft and sweet peaches makes for a very tasty and refreshing salad. (5 stars)

Cured Salmon: Similar to smoked salmon but here its cured with salt and citrus to impart some sweetness.  It goes on some toasted rye bread with mustard seeds and a salmon-flavored cream.  Unique taste and quite good. (5 stars)

Wild Halibut: It came with a fried chicken skin (?!) and was served on a bed of corn, chanterelles, and spinach.  Fish was seasoned and cooked well, and was best eaten with all the other components. (4 stars)

Hanger Steak: Seasoned and juicy medium-rate. Calgary (Cowgary?) is famous for its beef so this dish was a great way to start the trip!   I'm used to seeing french fries, but Blink's version had a nice potato cake and some nice sides of pickled onions, shiitake, and bacon lardons! (5 stars) 

Pear and Lemon/Ginger Sorbet: Couldn't taste the ginger, perhaps the lemon and pears overwhelmed. (4 stars). My wife liked this dessert but mine was much better....

Bruleed Peanut Butter Tart and Ice Cream: Wow - I'm a huge PB fan and here I get it served two ways, with sour cherries and peanuts. (5 stars).  Great end to a great dinner!"}
{"text":"For the pièce de résistance of our epicurean Easter 2018...

Blink was the icing on the cake. We experienced outstanding, down-to-earth service despite it not being a toddler-friendly place. We have a usually well-behaved toddler experienced in grown up dining with us but our server just went completely above and beyond to ensure that we had a great experience. And great experience is exactly what we got. It involved moving some of the fancier décor out of her reach and creating a \"toddler-friendly\" dish of white cream gnocchi (not necessary as she would eat anything but it was appreciated).

Dinner was the kind you'd want to climb a mountain for so you can shout to the world how amazing it is. The duck was so expertly made, it might have ruined all other duck breast dishes for me and I've had a lot of duck in my lifetime.  We \"helped\" our toddler with her gnocchi; it was too good to be wasted on a 2 year old (ha ha).  I'm usually not a big fan of gnocchi but their version blew my mind. I find it to be a terrific sign when you can taste the individual ingredients in your food and the gnocchi did just that. Fluffy, chewy goodness with hint of potato.

My better half had the Cantonese pork dish (char sui) and it blew him away as well.

I couldn't take pictures of the 3 desserts ordered; they were inhaled as soon as the plates hit the table. Bottom line: really good food at Prairie portions, decent prices and excellent service.  If I could rate 12 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  I had potato crusted Halibut.  It was delicious.  If I return I'll give the Sticky Toffee Pudding a miss just not my thing.  Ice Cream was really nice."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this restaurant the last time I went. The food was bland and not much creativity was incorporated into the dishes. I don't think I would come here again."}
{"text":"Came back a year later, and still, heavenly.  Happy Birthday to me.

This time, we started with mushroom soup and a beet salad. The beets, while something I usually hate, were prepared so well that I was willing to negotiate. The mushroom soup, a perfect earthy and creamy prelude to dinner. We went with three amazing dishes for mains. First, a chanterelle gnocchi hit all the marks, with the right texture of dumpling supporting the amazing local fungi. Local \"Peking\" duck was presented in thin, rare slices, lightly sauced, and convinced a skeptical Russian duck fan that this high-end cuisine was indeed worth the effort. Since it was my birthday, I went with the tenderloin, medium rare, with a lovely risotto side. I rarely order pure steak at restaurants, but this had the quality, saucing, and presentation that exceeded what I could do at home. The desserts were heavy on the nuts so I could only taste the sauces and icing, but my companions were extremely happy with everything.

The wine list was great, selection was good, and the pairings were well-advised. Service was friendly and accommodating (we showed up 30 minutes early due to the difficulties of coordinating three people from three hotels, yet our table was already waiting for us).

This place is indeed a destination. Every trip to Calgary demands a visit."}
{"text":"Bad service. Forgettable food.  

Our server was very curt, hardly spoke any words to us and was not attentive. We opted not to have alcoholic drinks which seemed to really turn the waiter off to us. When we asked about items on the menu, he failed to elaborate and give us any more information. The food runner had more to say to us than our server and was nice enough to actually explain some of the dishes. 

The corn soup ($12) was by far the best thing we ordered and was a well rounded dish. The beef tartare ($18) was served with a sauce that was very displeasing to the palate. We had to scrape the sauce off to enjoy the beef which, by itself, was good. The rabbit and pork terrine ($18) itself was just ok, but again this dish was also served by accompaniments that had to be avoided. The berries and carrots that came with the terrine had such strong and unpleasant flavors. Shouldn't the other flavors of the dish make it better, not worse? We ordered the hanger steak ($37) medium rare. The outside of the steak was slightly overcooked and a little too hard and crispy for my liking. I'm more than happy to pay high prices for really good food, but Blink fell short of expectations. 

We opted to skip dessert, having been disappointed by the overall experience here. Save your money and your appetite and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Second time we have been here and it was even better this time. We sit at the bar area, as it's great to be interactive with the chef or pastry chef.  I have nothing bad to say at all about this place . We had salt and pepper chicharrones for a snack to start, then some amazing corn soup with Parmesan tuile. Main course for her was the halibut, and I had the hanger steak. Both were goddamn brilliant!  Her halibut was cooked to perfection, and she is picky about her fish (needs it on the very rare side). I normally don't like hanger steak since most can't cook it correctly, but this was amazing. 
The head chef was in front of us making some deserts as we were finishing our mains, and we got to talk a lot to him about how things were so good. And he was more than happy to chat to us about everything. And a very nice surprise, he bought us both our deserts!  Can't say enough about this spot. You won't go wrong with Blink. Love the seasonal inspired selections!"}
{"text":"Came here for Taste 2015, and had a great experience.  Service was spot on, and the food was excellent.  I wouldn't say the prepared menu for the event was the greatest out of what was presented in their regular line up, but it was just enough to get me to want to come back.  We definitely enjoyed this first experience and look forward to come back and have another night at Blink."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?

We were visiting Calgary for a family reunion of sorts.  We have a number of foodies in the group.  One in particular researched a number of restaurants prior to choosing Blink.  We were excited to have a great meal.

The Good:  We called on a Tuesday for a Tuesday (6/5/2018) reservation.  No problems there.  Also upon arrival, the initial service seemed good.  Thats were the good ends.

The Bad:  The restaurant was not busy.  Only 7 tables being served during most of the evening.  The initial waitress that took our drink order was friendly but we received another waitress to take our food order.  The service was atrocious!!!.  After our initial order was placed, we were never asked in the 2 hours there if we wanted any refills on drinks/cocktails.

The soups that came as appetizers were all luke-warm and flavorless  Everyone that ordered soup (5 people) agreed on this assessment.  We then waited for over 1.5 hours for our food to arrive.  Prior to this, we flagged the waiter down to inquire about our order and the delay.  She seemed completely unapologetic and dismissive.  After our food arrived, we also found the gnocchi to be luke-warm and bland.  We asked to speak to the manager, and he just claimed the kitchen was backed up because of add-on tables. (The restaurant was not busy at all).  He also seemed unapologetic and dismissive.  In his defense, he did comp the soups.  

One of our worst meal experiences ever.  
Terrible service, luke-warm food, flavorless food and poor management accountability."}
{"text":"BLINK and your food is gone in seconds because of their incredibly small portions.
While the food was good and atmosphere is nice, the food portions left all of us hungry. I had the scallops for lunch and I was served 4 luni sized scallops and a teaspoon of spinach for 19.50. I won't be back."}
{"text":"When: Friday 25 of March 2011.
Vibe: the place was busy and happening
Where; At the Bar.
Bartender: Daisy. Great service.
Food : The souflé and the beef chick braised. 9 on a 10..
Great service and food. One of the best restaurant in Calgary..

{"text":"Since their unhelpful online menu does not offer price guidance, I will: average prices are $22 for lunch entrees and $33 for dinner entrees.

Excellent food and service.

Had lunch and dinner here over a 2 day business trip.

Had the tomato & cheese salad + quiche for lunch and corn soup + halibut for dinner.  All were great.  Wine pairing recommendations also great.

Amazing free sparkling water that they create with their own system.  Not overly carbonated and it tastes so good.

Service was professional, helpful, and efficient.  We had only 45 minutes for lunch and told the host this on arrival.  Server arrived immediately to help us order, kitchen got food out fast, and we enjoyed a great lunch and weren't late to office."}
{"text":"Blink is still one of my favourite fine dining establishments in downtown Calgary. I can always count on delicious food, excellent service and a beautiful atmosphere. 

This time, I started with a tomato bisque soup which was nicely balanced with notable tomato acidity which was a lot of fun. My tagliatelle with a poached egg, pancetta and Parmesan was perfect. To finish, I had a peach Melba which was very refreshing.

I'll be back, soon :)"}
{"text":"I would love to give this a 5 star rating, but I find the price a little steep for the amount of food you get. That being said, it was wonderful. 

We came here for family birthday dinner. They say you can park under Germain hotel and they will reimburse you, but there was no parking underground, and it was only 6pm. We luckily found parking on Stephen Ave, which is another reason why I hate coming down to this area, I don't have the patience to deal with it. 

Very nice inside, loved the decor, we were close to door, which was a little chilly, but not too bad. We had an awesome server and who was somewhat accommodating to me being a celiac. 

We started with the beef tartare, which I would say was probably the best I've ever head, he said the had chips he could give me, so I had something. He didn't bring the chips, had actually forgot to inform me that they weren't able to do the chips as they only serve them during the week (WTF?). Sensing my frustration and unimpressedness, he came back with chips he went all the way to their storage and got for me, which was super nice and above and beyond. 

For dinner I had the steak, which they were able to ensure it was GF, and was delicious. I shared some of my husbands pork and it was super good too. Little dry but not bad. 

It is a wonderful place for a nice night out, but prepare that it is pricey. And parking can be a nightmare."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous...ridiculously amazing, super, fantastic, phenomenal - need I go on?!?  I enjoyed one of the BEST meals of my life...I wanted to lick the plate, but knew it wasn't appropriate at such a classy place!  The restaurant's atmosphere is perfect...comfortable, classy and relaxing.  The service is top notch - my server made me feel very welcome and was very charming.  Now, the food...I ordered the duck with cherry and green beans.  I ate every last bite and wished that there was more to eat.  You must visit Blink...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for a post-work-event-dinner and even though we arrived 7 minutes before the kitchen was closing, they were really sweet to let us come in for a meal. The service was incredible, despite our lateness, and she really did not seem annoyed at us. 

On to the food and wine! Our waitress made some great wine recommendations and we were all happy with our choices. The food was lovely. I had salmon which had a really crispy skin (my fav) though was a bit salty for me. My friend's steak was probably the star though. A perfect medium-rare and with a pea puree that tasted like a garden. mmmmm.

Dessert was good - I recommend the rhubarb tart over the lemon cheesecake or chocolate mousse, but want to try the rum soaked cake next time. I'm not sure what kind of coffee they brew but the espresso was really nice as well. I really don't have anything bad to say about this experience!

Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"This business owner had the nerve to complain to the Globe and Mail that she will have to give her employees a livable wage with the province's minimum wage hike. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here today.  The service was great and the food was very good.  The asparagus soup was excellent.  The arctic char was very good.  Definitely a place to return to."}
{"text":"Stopped by Calgary en route back from Banff and to our home (New Jersey). The atmosphere of the restaurant is chic and it has a great ambience. I was a bit worried as we were in hiking clothes having come from Banff and as we are not from the area, we were not sure how acceptable it was especially in such a nice restaurant. While we were a bit underdressed for my comfort, we were seated without problem and received exceptional service from the hostess, assistant servers, and our main server Ken B who we thought was exceptional - friendly, attentive, energetic. We had a stuffed mozzarella zucchini blossom special appetizer which was out of this world and nothing like we've ever had before along with a duck pate appetizer. Both were very good but the zucchini blossom really stood out. For entrees I had the homemade ravioli which I thought was okay- it was stuffed with ricotta cheese and also had walnuts - I thought the combination made it taste quite dry, however the flavor was there and the texture of the pasta was on point. Husband had the Alberta chicken dish and it completely blew us away. The chicken skin was thin and crispy - I am not a chef by any means but I feel like must have trimmed every last bit of fat of the skin yet somehow got the meat to taste so juicy and flavorful and the skin to be perfectly think and crisp - nothing like we've ever had before. Of course with such outstanding dishes, we had to proceed with dessert where we chose the chocolate tart and strawberry shortcake. Both were good, but I favored the latter with the basil ice cream. I would give the food 4.5 stars and the service 5 stars. If ever we visit Calgary again, we will for sure make it a point to stop here."}
{"text":"Great food and service for large group business lunch the other day.  All were very happy with their choices.
However totally unsatisfied with handling of our reservation for their private room for our party of ten.  We had purposely reserved the room for its privacy and size and had out of town guests.  They bumped us out of the reserved room without confirming with our party. No apologies were given.  Even after calling back to ask for an explanation as we didn't want to create a scene at the restaurant we were given no apologies or reasonable explanation for their actions.  Totally inexcusable for their staff supervisor J who fumbled the reservation."}
{"text":"Completely phenomenal. I went with the Ricotta gnocchi, oyster mushrooms, wilted spinach & almond crunch dish that was so good. Try some of their Lapierre a ville - Morgan Gamet-noir wine!"}
{"text":"Just passing through Calgary and looking for a place downtown so we dined there last night and I can honestly say the server was fantastic. She knew the menu and the wine list, plus she made a great recommendation on the wine. If that was all there was to it, it would have been five star.

The room is pretty, but we came for the food, and like the room it was cold. The appetizers were great. The entrees were bland and just not warm enough. After reading the reviews on yelp and in every magazine I picked up in Calgary, I expected it to be better. The least we need is hot food on a cold night. I don't know how to say it any other way. 

Maybe we caught the place on an off night, but probably won't give it a second chance. I would suggest you try somewhere else. Because at that price point you shouldn't have to wonder. If Blink is there in two years, I would be surprised."}
{"text":"I went here for the Open Table Taste of Calgary whatever whatever. It was a 3 course set menu that spoiled me forever and bumped me up a dining bracket.

We brought our own wine. Corkage was $15 and well worth it although their wine list looked good too. 

To start I had a souffle that words cannot describe. It was so light and fluffy I didn't believe it was egg at first. It feels like your eating mouse almost. 

Then excellent fresh bread and butter, and the risotto WOW!!!!! Since eating theirs I have eaten 12 others, and tried to make my own 4 times now. Nothing compares. Nothing is even worthy to be on the same table as what they made. It was truly a work of art. I wish I could cook 1/6 that good. It was so flavorful.

Then dessert came. I completely forget what it was (6 months later finally writing this review) all I know is I liked it a lot at the time.

The atmosphere is romantic, modern, and has this excellent vibe to the place. 

The service.... oh the service... I've eaten at a lot of places in Calgary. From $5 burgers to $250 a plate 5 star restaurants on the bow. None have matched that of the service at blink. I think that is where the name comes from because every time I would blink my wine would be refilled along with my water. Our server was a ninja. She just glided in without disrupting our conversation and took such excellent care of our table. I felt like Royalty!

Now we have moved to San Francisco, but next time we are in Calgary and looking for a celebratory meal this is where we are going."}
{"text":"Service and food were amazing. We went here for my birthday this past weekend and it was a wonderful evening! My fiancé and I shared the octopus to start, we both got the hanger steak as mains, and then shared the chocolate tart for dessert. The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgable and attentive. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'm not trying to be critical of this restaurant but I simply couldn't give it anything more than two stars.  The service was great.  It deserves a five star rating.  The food and price are not in correlation with each other.
I had a flat iron steak which came in at $24.50.  My buddy had the same with a $9.00 bowl of Mushroom soup.  He told me the soup was delicious so I think its fair that I tell you that.  I told him that for $9.00 a small bowl of mushroom soup should be.
The steak was not good.  It was a very tender cut but it had no flavor.  It did come with a sauce that certainly helped but I have had it's equal at a truckstop.  The difference being that for $25.00 I got a half-tank of gas as well as a poor steak there.
I tipped 20% on a $66.00 bill because the service was that good but I don't ever see myself going back when there are so many choices downtown."}
{"text":"Visited a week ago.  Awesome service.  Food was cooked perfectly.  Had the cheese souffle, great but something missing in the flavor.  Duck for dinner, perfect.  Duck breast, and duck leg.  Both fantastic.  Cocktails and wine selection unique and vast."}
{"text":"I love local food, but I am on a budget. I decided to check out Blink to be fancy for lunch now a couple times. First I'll say the food I've had there is DELICIOUS. The atmosphere is upscale, but welcoming and the service is lovely. 

So, should be five stars, yeah? Okay, maybe I am cheap but the prices were a bit outrageous for me. The menu doesn't state what is local or not, so I don't know if I am paying the \"indie tax\" (which I am fine with if explained to me) or not. My quiche was delicious, but small-ish and $17.00. I ordered sparkling water and for a small bottle they charged me $7.50! For water! I was shocked. Because I'm on a budget, I cannot go back. But if I made more money, I'd probably check them out more often."}
{"text":"App: Seared scallops & roasted pork belly, butternut squash purée w/ course mustard and flakes of fried squash chips. They were spectacular on their own but these ingredients all in one bite... studded velvet richness beyond compare. Nothing crazy inventive but done VERY well.

Entree: 1yr aged risotto with wild & cultivated mushrooms, boschetto. And here's where I go a little Guarnaschelli on the chef: Did it \"need\" 6 different kinds of mushrooms? Did you cook them all together at the same time... as in, some were moist others dry, grainy and woody. The rice was cooked well, perfect seasoning and tasty cheese. However, if you're going to charge $30 for rice, mushrooms, stock and herbs... get it right?!"}
{"text":"A great spot for a classy business lunch!  I have hated peas since I was a kid, but their pea risotto is fabulous.  Nice to know there is a spot downtown where I can have lunch with clients and not feel guilty after!"}
{"text":"Our service was very good. Hangar steak was good. Ravioli was good.  Maple Apple crepe cake was really good.  Good food, good service, but nothing was \"knock your socks off\"."}
{"text":"I was overall underwhelmed by my experience at Blink.

The restaurant offered nothing terribly unique and though the food was excellent (tortellini, risotto, beet salad), it did not set itself apart from many of the exceptional offerings in other Calgary restaurants.

For the price, I'd rather spend my money at an establishment that exudes more passion for the dining experience."}
{"text":"STILL HUNGRY!!!  
I took my colleague and a client to Blink this past week.  It was the first time any of us had been there.  So, let's just get to the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
THE GOOD
-The food was very, very tasty.  I ordered the Arctic Char, and it was delicious.  Presented well - almost too pretty to eat.  
-I enjoyed the ambiance - the older buildings in downtown Calgary have great charm.
THE BAD
-I said the food was good, right? It was, but there just was not enough of it.  I'm not a heavy-weight eater, but this girl still wants to be satisfied.  Fish in itself is not normally a hearty meal, and so you need to give it more substance with ample sides. I do not, I repeat, I do not want to spend close to $30 to be hungry. I was literally licking the herbs off the plate.
-We waited 45 minutes for our food - and this, over a business lunch hour just is not good.  Does delicious, quality food take time? Absolutely, and I don't mind being patient in a fast-food world, but this was just too long.  20-30 minutes max. 
THE UGLY
-Our pretty-boy host was either having a bad day or a bad life. I give people the benefit of the doubt as we all have crappy days, but the first face that greets you in a restaurant should make you want to sit down, eat, drink and stay.  The sight of our host almost made me turn my heels and leave.  

Will I return? Not on my own volition.  I will not be taking clients, friends, family or random strangers ;) here again.  For the same amount of money or less, you can have a full, happy tummy, be served quickly and with a smile in several other downtown places - Pampas, Moxie's Grill (yes, I know it's a chain, but downtown location is good), Cactus Cub, etc."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my time here. I had the Korean beef, was delicious.

The servers were very knowledgeable about wine and the food. We ordered a selection of desserts. Sticky toffee was amazing."}
{"text":"Blink is one of the best restaurants in Calgary.  Always make a reservation as it is routinely full in the evening even on weeknights.  The food is excellent and the portions aren't too large.  I really like taking my wife here - it's a great \"ladies restaurant\", dark, romantic, busy but quiet, smallish portions, great food and a very good wine list .  The mac n' cheese at lunch is excellent.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Calgary.  I always have a outstanding meal and dessert.  They are exceptional at the wine pairings.  The service is always stellar especially Ken.  My sister and I always have a fantastic time when he is our server and has been with Blink for a longtime.  Really appreciate a quality place like Blink and struggle to try other places downtown."}
{"text":"We did a 'date night' here. Awesome is the best word to describe it. It's not a 'family' type restaurant. It's a couples/business type place. The food was exceptionally good from the appetizers to the dessert. The duck was exceptional. We loved our dessert. We would definitely come here for a special occasion. The prices are a bit high but it was worth it and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Don't understand why this restaurant is rated so high.  The tomato soup is just okay, the buffalo mozzarella is just okay, the halibut is not good.  Overall this restaurant is not that great for four starts.  For the price, I am sure there are others much better in Calgary."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service, amazing high class food that is mostly local. The piña colada is delish!! Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I was already writing my review in my head, including a potentially controversial three rating, as I sat waiting just a little too long for my main course.  First of all, I was a little put out by the $18 wine by the glass - 5 ounces! Maybe I'm old school, but at those prices my waiter shouldn't be wearing jeans and we should be eating from table cloths.  Next, while technically the waiter was correct, our \"shareable\" selection of starters - Elk Carpaccio and Albacore Tataki, were both a bit small and awkward to share amongst a group of five.  

But here's the rub, the food is spectacular!  Between the five of us we had the arctic char, Risotto and the beef. All were excellent.  And the desserts, wow!

So I gave in and moved my rating to a four. I wouldn't recommend it as a place to take growing hungry teenagers - like I did! A bit too nouveau cuisine and the prices are just a bit high for the portion size.  I not sure if these prices can sustain the current economic downturn given that expense account dinners are becoming more rare.

None the less, the food is excellent and well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great experience overall..

Halibut is prepared exceptionally well...
Wine selection is varied and well-stocked. 
Lovely dessert.. Apple strudel with something and rosemary...
My business guests enjoyed the ambience very much.
One of my guests felt she was a little cold indoors, and the waitstaff brought her a blanket. Now, I call that service

Kinda pricey - $100 Canadian per person, with the wine.

But well worth it..."}
{"text":"Absolutly amazing food. Starter: peach salad and main course: the chicken & the hailbut. desserts: lemon pears & pb&j tarte. The tart was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Overall it has a great atmosphere and I enjoyed the decor. They were one of the only places on Stephen Ave that could accommodate our group for lunch.

I had the mac and cheese which was very nice and cheesy and great for a cold day and it also came with a side salad which was ok but nothing special just some greens with a vinaigrette. 

The disappointing part of the visit which really took away from everything else was the poor service that we received. The place wasn't overly busy but our server seemed to be quite focused on serving other tables and not ours. He wasn't very helpful with providing gluten free options for those who had dietary restrictions, when we asked he said anything can be gluten free and then excluded over half of the menu which was a bit frustrating. 

As well when we asked for change at the end we were snapped at and given some serious attitude. Although we were a larger group and gratuity was included in the bill no matter what it still would have been nice to have some courteous service.

The food wasn't good enough to justify going back so I think we will stick with other places from now on."}
{"text":"Went to Blink with a group of ladies and we had an awesome experience. While the menu is fairly small, there's quite a variety and there should be something for anyone. Including, as it turns out, vegans - the server was quick to point out dishes that one of the attendees could eat with little to no modifications to ingredients.

While on the higher end price-wise, the food quality is definitely worth it. Everything we had was exquisite. We stuck with appetizers mainly (cheese plate, gyoza, beet tart, scallops), but those who ordered mains were also impressed with their meals.

The server was attentive, kept filling water glasses and made sure we had everything we needed. The staff were very friendly overall.

I'd love to come back and try the cocktails, mains & dessert. Definitely a must-visit!"}
{"text":"We did a booking on Open Table , an was not disappointed . The pork chop brine an lamb sirloin with a mint sauce was really lovely . An for dessert we had  the creme brûlée . Our server Nick was very attentive to us . An was even able to talk to the Chef Hideyuki on how he made the mint sauce for my lamb sirloin ."}
{"text":"Blink was crazy dope!! Awesome drinks and even better food!!  The Foie Gras is the best I've ever had!!  Great atmosphere . . . will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Nice space with great food.  You can watch the very professional kitchen at work.  My waiter had been out for a while which led to some confusion about specific menu items but all in all a great place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner here and was quite impressed.

They had no tables free (reservations starting at 9pm if we wanted) so we opted for the bar.They offered us our drinks and brought some bread and butter. It didn't take too long for food to arrive.
 We had the cheddar souffle to start (shared) and then he had the goose, I had the tenderloin.

Both dishes and our appetizer were absolutely delicious. My only criticism was that they were a touch heavy-handed with the salt on the root vegetables. Our bartender-server was pleasant and the place wasn't overly loud, nor pretentious. It's definitely a classy place, somewhere I'd recommend for an anniversary or other special occasion. It isn't cheap, but it's definitely delicious.

My only complaint, and it's actually pretty off-putting is that we were charged $4 for water. Still water. I asked for tap water. I have no idea if that's what we got or not, but who the hell charges for water!?

Anyway - aside from that (which is enough to actually make me re-think going back since that seems like a sleezy cash-grab), it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews. But I will write it just so people don't waste their money in this restaurant. First of all service is standard nothing over the top good. Now the food, God was it mediocre.  My fiancee and I went on a Saturday night. The restaurant was half empty, partly due to the bad economy I guess. We ordered smoked salmon and saqush soup for appetizer, hanger steak and Lingcod for entree. Smoked salmon tasted ok, squash soup felt like the the chef just dumped a mixture of sugar cream and butter in there. The entree is even more disappointing. Hanger steak was 39 bucks for 5 small slices of steak in some kind of weird sauce. There were also other small pieces of  mushroom, bacon and onion on the plate which didn't really work with the steak. Lingcod tasted like it came out of microwave way over cooked. Anyways, our bill at the end was 142 with two drinks. If you want to spend a good night of fine dining don't go there. There are way better options on the same street. We wish we had gone to HY steakhouse."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  I found this gem (thanks Yelp) while visiting the boyfriend in Canada.  Initially, the ambiance here is perfect for a date night, birthday celebration or just for a nice dinner.  Although Blink is upscale, it doesn't feel stuffy.  The menu isn't too large, which I appreciate as it signifies quality food.  I head steak and the tomato pie.  SO GOOD.  The other half had pasta which was equally amazing.  The service is impeccable as well.  Finally, their wine list is on point.  I will definitely go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience in Calgary. Had the salmon special with a great Chardonnay.  Great service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch - had no freaking clue the room was so lovely - the only word that comes to mind is serene. I felt comfortable and relaxed and ready to enjoy lunch with a glass of wine but once again I discovered (as many of the places in Calgary do) they carry Strongbow, yipee !!
They use alot of local ingredients - presentation was second to none - I would absolutely go back for dinner on a date because the lunch was divine and I only had the daily soup which happened to be roasted red pepper.  
The server was knowledgable and just a bit fun, which I love in a server so overall a fabulous experience !"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise. After checking the rating on Yelp, I booked it without looking at the menu. I needed something gluten free and dairy free and I found just the thing. Salmon, potato risotto, broccoli and a delicious chocolate torte. The atmosphere was relaxing, simple and soothing. The servers were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Overall, the meal far exceeded my expectations. It was fantastic. Clean and fresh flavours. Simple and elegant."}
{"text":"If you are in the downtown Calgary area and looking for one of the best meals possible, you have to check this place out.  I have been here numerous times and have yet to have nothing short of an amazing meal.  The menu changes with the availability of locale fair and the wait staff is always knowledgeable regarding menu choices.  I haven't figured out why they always ask if you have a reservation when there are plenty of seats available, however if you are in town for a short stay, be sure to reserve yourself a spot to ensure you get to experience one of the finest dining spots in Calgary."}
{"text":"So delicious! The wines are reasonably priced too! 
We shared a bottle of red and the seared sea scallops, grilled squid and pork lardons and the braised lamb shoulder. 
Both of us left full but rushed, when we arrived the server told us we could be out by 7:40 for our show but the lamb arrived at 7:40. So sadly we had to eat and run! But it won't stop me from going back! Such an interesting space, it looks tiny from the outside but like a Tardis it's bigger on the inside!"}
{"text":"Had a great big taste meal! 

This was my first time trying blink and when I first walked in I was in awe of the place. You definitely don't get this impression while walking on Stephen ave. from outside it seems small and that it would be cramped on the inside but it's airy with high ceilings and nice decor. 

We went on a Wednesday and felt very under dressed as most of the guests were on business lunch and wearing suits. No biggie though

Our table wasn't ready just yet so I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar. They don't really have a seating area. It felt kind of awkward sitting at the bar while waiting because I wasn't greeted and I didn't even feel like having a beverage as it was lunch time and had to go back to work. 

But at least it wasn't too long until we got our table. Seats are comfy on the booth side. I ordered the butter leaf lettuce salad to start, Arctic char with risotto, and the pavlova for dessert. Salad was great! It had a light dressing and these crispy onions that were nice and salty. My Arctic char  was beautifully cooked with a nice crispy skin and it paired very nicely with the rich risotto. Although my risotto was a little runny, which probably means there wasn't enough TLC when making it, right? And lastly the pavlova was difficult to eat without being messy. Definitely could not eat it with a spoon so we pretty much just stabbed it with a fork to break off into bite size pieces. 

I got to try the rigatoni that my friend ordered and that was simple and delicious. And the toffee cake was awesome!! It came warm, not too sweet and just the perfect ending to a rich meal. 

Service here was excellent! Can't say much about the regular menu and the price but the big taste was definitely a good deal and great sampling that I would try this place again one day."}
{"text":"The proteins on our plate were delicious. The duck was melt in your mouth perfect., but potato terrine was very greasy.  Albacore tuna was cooked perfectly, but polenta was a little bland.  Our server seemed very bored and uninterested (long day, I guess).  Would rate higher if we had better service. We will try again."}
{"text":"Eating here made my Calgary business trip bearable and now I wanna go back!  Although I found it a bit pricey I understand that most Calgary restaurants are pricier compared to Vancouver.  The rabbit was superb, probably the best I've ever tasted.  The cheese souffle (appetizer) was just the right amount since it was a very rich treat.  I had dessert envy, since I ordered the sorbet assortment I should have known I would have had dessert envy.  The frozen nougat dessert was a favorite amongst the people at the table.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dinner with the girls brought us to Blink. I was initially really annoyed because I could NOT find the place for the life of me, and downtown parking is super frustrating. Once I arrived (and promptly smashed a glass of my girlfriends red wine...yes it was one of those days!) I allowed myself to relax and was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is small, but it's cozy and intimate. Since I was late, I didn't get a chance to try any appetizers, but the remaining scallops and cheese on our table looked wonderful. I ordered a Lychee Martini and it was delicious! For dinner I had the Beef Tenderloin, which I debated on since it seemed to be one of the most expensive items on the list. But I thought, I'm having a bad day so screw it! I'm going to order what I want. I was so glad I did because it was fabulous. We ordered a few more drinks and eventually the Earl Grey Creme Brulee for dessert (DELICIOUS). I was really impressed with the food, as well as the service. They graciously comped the wine that I spilled which I thought was very nice of them. It was a pretty pricey meal, but a really nice experience all together."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of the reviews I thought for sure Blink would have 5 stars in the bag. i'd have to say it was a little underwhelming. I love the ambiance, it's a great place for a date or fancier dinner while still being trendy! 

The food was amazing, the portions were  a little small but the food was definitely good. The wine itself was 6/5 stars, it was so delicious and I loved sitting near the wine rack! Server was great, and I actually don't really have any complaints other than the fact that it was a little pricy. That being said Blink is missing a \"wow\" factor. I don't know what it is, I can't in fact put my finger on it but it's missing something. And that something is keeping me from giving Blink a 5 star review!"}
{"text":"Blink looks narrow and long from the outside. From the inside, though it is still much longer than it is wide, it's not as small as I initially thought.

Blink has impressed me from the get go. I made a reservation through Open Table. The day of, Blink called to confirm the reservation. When I arrived, our table was ready and waiting. My coat was hung in the coat room with care and I had hopes that my tablemates would all soon be there.

We were a table of 8 and ordered drinks and shared a few appys. We settled on the golden and chioggia beet tart, British Columbia spot prawn gyoza, and a plate of cheese from the charcuterie menu. I also ordered green hubbard squash with sage and potato gnocchi. Blink is one of the many restaurants that sources all ingredients locally. I think it shows in the flavour and freshness of the food. My favourites from our meal were the beet tart and the gnocchi. The first time I ever tried gnocchi was in Italy, so I'm always a little weary of eating it in Canada. Blink did this dish justice.

It may have helped that the restaurant was not all that busy during our visit, but our experience was nothing short of immaculate. As Danelle W mentioned, one of our dishes was modified easily to include goat cheese on the side and with no fuss from our server to accommodate one of our guests."}
{"text":"What a delightful experience!  Everything on the menu looks fantastic, and we have enjoyed anything we've ordered.  Tough choices every time.  Last night we had the Duck Breast (garnished with roasted local crab apples!) together a sweet potato pie and confit of the leg.  WOW - that was a surprise and delicious! We also enjoyed the Field Mushroom soup!  Both outstanding - and when I say that I'm comparing to the likes of San Francisco and the west coast foodie culture...  Lovely, but not shi-shi or high-brow.  Looking forward to going back already.  And - it's always nice to meet the owner, who was working hard too!  Worth checking out - especially because they also support local organic farmers."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Blink in a few years. It was absolutely amazing then and Happy Happy Joy Joy it knocked it out of the park again this weekend. My two suggestions on this menu right now are the caprese salad and the morel mushroom risotto . If I could have taken one to go in my purse I would have ! Instead I'll be coming back much sooner this time."}
{"text":"The cheese soufflé is as good as it gets. We've been to Blink a few times in the past and it's never been a disappointment. I do wish parking was simpler on Stephen Avenue but it's not Blink's fault. Try to reserve the seats beside the large windows for a fun evening of people watching."}
{"text":"My friend had been raving about this place for a while and we were finally able to check it out together! I love most of the restaurants on Stephen Ave. There is just something about that particular area that I love. Great location and therefore definitely a great place to take out-of-towners if you are looking for something a little more upscale and delicious. 

I ordered the short rib and I seriously tore that meal apart. Haha. I feel bad for my significantly high intake of red meat this week, but o just couldn't resist. It sounded so delicious and I just had no self control! The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful. It was accompanied by a few fingerling potatoes, onions and a few bits of bacon. (Just a few of my favorite things). Dessert wise, the sticky toffee pudding is something you should not pass up on. Its great for sharing and quite moist! Overall, I was smitten!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a co-worker at Blink earlier this week. 

They now have a small patio set up with a snack menu from 2-5pm (previously they were closed at that time). 

We dined on the patio so I didn't get to check out much of the interior decor, but the service and food here is A+

I tried an albacore tuna tartare appetizer. The tartare was served as a ceviche type dish. It came served with some homemade tortilla chips for scooping. My co-worker had the scallops appetizer which also looked nice.

I tried the special of the day for my main - it was a fillet of arctic char served a top a square of potato gratin served with a bit of kale and cauliflower. Absolutely delicious. My friend had gnocchi.

Portions looked a bit small but they were actually quite filling. I felt stuffed afterwards. Much too full to try dessert.

We didn't have any alcohol, so the bill was actually quite reasonable ($90 for the two of us including tax and tip) ."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 12 yr anni here on a Friday night. I thought it would be packed but it wasnt , which wa a welcome change. The food was great. The Foes Grais Parfait on breoasch is AMAZING! I had the special salmon , it was wonderfu! My husband had the duck and it was good, not really any thing special. They have  a great wine list. dessert was great as well. The crem brulee and the choclate cake was devine!
Service was good. She was very attentive, although she seemed as if she was a bit scared.. Maybe ishe just started working there.?
I will def be back. 
So far one of the best places Ive been to in Calgary!!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here. Ordered the pork belly and it was cooked perfectly. The service was also way above average. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Good enough... The appetizers were very good, and the wine was good as well... The service was ok... And the place is beautiful ... There is nothing to complain here... Also, the location is very convenient, so I would definitely go back there again.."}
{"text":"Every dish were beautifully presented and pleasing to the palate. We took our parents here to enjoy a lovely dinner. First we were warming greeted by the hostess that accommodated our request for a quiet booth table. 

We were all very cold from the sub-zero degree weather and our personable & very sociable waiter quickly provided each of us with a cup of hot water with lemon. 

For appetizer, we ordered the lamb tartare. The tartare was delicious, quite an interesting flavour on wonton chips. Great appetite starter. 

For our mains, we ordered the braised beef cheek, monk fish, and risotto. All of them were amazing. I would recommend you to try to beef cheek because it is so tender that it feels like it just melts in your mouth. The risotto was delicious as well. I liked how their portions were perfect - you don't have to worry about leaving here hungry and unsatisfied. 

Thank you to the staff at Blink for providing us with an enjoyable night - great food, atmosphere, and service. We look forward to dining here again in the future."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a friend for a Christmas friend date. From beginning to end the service was impeccable.

The menu is small but there's excellent choices on it. Appetizers will run you from $9 soups up to around $13 for things like tataki. The mains are $28 to $38 but average at about $33. I had the tenderloin of beef ($38) and my friend went with the Sable fish ($33). The beef was so tender I almost didn't need a knife to cut it. It just melted in my mouth. The side's were earthy vegetables which included beets and turnips. Also there was a tasty red cabbage compote. The veggies were nicely braised so they stayed crunchy and firm.

The wine list here is almost endless. You can order by the glass ($8-20), by half bottle, or full bottles ($45-240+). It was hard to choose but eventually decided on a bottle of Twenty Rows from Napa Valley ($75). It was a little fruitier than what I like out of a Cabernet Savignon but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

For desert my friend and I shared a sticky toffee pudding ($10). It was warm and moist and thoroughly soaked through with sauce. It was the perfect way to end the meal.

To finish the night I had a glass of Merlot, of which the brand escapes me at the moment, and my friend had a Riesling.

The total bill including tax and tip came to just shy of $300. A great value for the quality of ingedients and service you'll get here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great dishes all around. Loved the cheese and charcuterie, the tomato tart was incredible. The lamb was delicious, decent service, biggest complaint was that the restaurant was cold and drafty all evening. Nice atmosphere in a cool part of town."}
{"text":"Great food in Calgary.  Salmon was perfect, mac-n-cheese was also delicious!  During our Stampede visit to Calgary we were walk-ins for dinner at Blink one night.  We ate outside so I cannot speak to the inside setting.  Service was great from start to finish and the food was excellent.  There was no kids menu but my kids loved the mac-n-cheese and so did I."}
{"text":"Came wandering in on a Monday night while on a business trip. Plenty of well dressed people enjoying dates or business dinners. Still plenty of room for those without reservations. Grabbed a seat at the bar and had a nice Spanish GSM while waiting on dinner. The roast duck was perfect and I will definitely stop back by to try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"If you're within 100 km (70 miles to my paisanos) of Calgary , don't miss this foodie experience.  It was worth going out on a  -8 Celsius night.

I was there on a cold winter night with a colleague, but as soon as we entered the door the gloom faded away.  The hostess enveloped us in her warmth as she took out coats and showed us to our table.

Michael, the server, actually made recommendations.  And they were all terrific.

Appetizer:  scallops that were like velvet. \"Roast sea scallops, chick pea puree, black olive & espelette spiced canola oil.\" (Anyone know what \"espelette\" means?)

Main courses:  

1. Organic rabbit from Lethbridge, which I take it is a small town south of Calgary.  (I think the organic bunny was a regular at Lethbridge Bikram.) It came with \"rainbow carrots\" that were sweet and lovely.  This dish was extraordinary.  

2.  Short ribs of beef.  The meat was falling off the bone and luscious.  Thank you colleague for sharing a bite or two.

Dessert:  English-style sticky toffee pudding with butterscotch sauce.  Pudding means dessert in Brit speak.  This was a fabulous rectangle of a gingery, molasses cake soaked in butterscotch sauce.  It is way better than it sounds.   

Great food, great meal, beautiful restaurant.  Extraordinary service without an attitude.  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"We sat outside on the patio along the pedestrian street during stampede week. Three of us had the halibut poached perfectly in olive oil accompanied by an assortment of root vegetables and peeled cherry tomatoes. The flavor combination was excellent and paired well with the Valenciso roija white wine. Another person enjoyed the beef steak dish. For dessert, we had the ice cream and tiramisu. The ice cream was flavorful but melted too fast. The tiramisu was creative with a very small amount of shredded lady fingers, mascarpone rolled in a chocolate tube and a small side espresso ice cream which also melted. Overall the food was very good but the portions were small. Fine as a business meal but I would be disappointed if paying myself."}
{"text":"Recommended by work friends and was on the list for a long time, finally got to go a week ago.  Walking in, was suprised by the size, from the street I thought this would only be a 10-12 table place but was quite expansive and has a big bar toward the back.  Greeted and seated quickly, and got our choice of table since it was a bit early on a weeknight.  Food was really good, the lamb sausage and lamb loin was incredible - a very unique dish with miso gnocchi.  Also got the halibut which was good, but not in the same league as the lamb dish.  The cheese plate starter was nice, got a salad as well which was just okay.

I would not hesitate to recommend, but not sure it would be the first place I would come back to for a meal at this price (expensive!) in Calgary."}
{"text":"EXPLOSIVE!!! 

That's all I can say. I had an amazing meal. Starting with a Brunello, well I had to ask my waitress Zack what he recommended. He told me to pair it with the Duck breast (I haven't eat meat in 2 years, but I just decided to go for it ... I've been craving for meat in a while). It was delicious, a feast of flavors in my mouth. The meat was tender (duck can be hard if it is not cooked properly), the swiss chard was incredible, and the veggies were to the point. Later he gave me the dessert menu and I wanted to try them all, but again asked him what he recommended... the orange posset. OMG this is one of the most refreshing, flavored, distinct dessert I had ever tried. 

The place is gorgeous, good for groups and families. Have a nice lounge/romantic environment and is not to loud. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable. The best part is that you can tell they are enjoying their job. Or maybe that's a Canadian attribute of been super nice to the public which I find extraordinary. 

Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Living downtown, we set out Friday night to see what was new and exciting on Stephen Avenue for diner. Behold, we discovered a number of places we \"knew\" but haven't tried. After reading a few outside menus we made a stop  -Blink!!

Blink looks so small from the outside, and so narrow - however, once inside it is quite long and looks wider than expected. I was impressed immediately with the decor and ambience of the place. It was warm, welcoming and comforting (I was also kinda freezing from the walk over). A very friendly hostess quickly took our jackets and gave us a two seater by the brick wall - which reminded me how old some of these buildings are.

The waiter was fine, he did everything he had to - but wasn't overly friendly or welcoming..but he was \"ok\". We ordered a bottle of wine (that I forgot to take a pic of as I really liked it) and ordered some dinner. The menu looked delicious overall - and was limited due to the elaborate nature of each dish. I like that kinda place. My dinner mate ordered something he didn't even recognize which was kinda funny (Osso Buco) and I jumped to the vegetarian section (30 days in on this new venture and it's still rather disappointing when you eat out ). I ordered the fried polenta with root/winter vegetables. Both of us ordered french onion soup  - because it's always amazing. The menu had an array of seafood appies, small salads and the mains were basically a couple types of fish and one of each meat \"type\".

Soup arrives and is delicious, of course. Unusually made as it was broth with one small crust-ini floating in it, but good. The Osso Buco looked delicious and came with a nice (kinda bland) risotto..but I was told the meat was delicious. My polenta was a small serving, but I quite liked it to be honest. The vegetables were quite yummy and a puree of something across the plate went well with the polenta. We proceeded to share a dessert of bruleed lemon tart with creme fraiche - which was pretty delicious. I ordered an ice wine from Austria which was recommended and delicious as a pairing.

Overall, a solid meal and decent service. I really liked the restaurant itself and would like to try again to be honest. For a Friday night, it was 60-70% full and service was timely and not rushed."}
