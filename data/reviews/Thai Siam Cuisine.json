{"text":"Not great. That would be the summary words.   Satay was processed. Not fresh.  Pad kee Mao was salt + soy sauce + msg with a small dash of chicken and noodles. I think I drank about 6 glasses of water due to this dish. 1/5 Ginger chicken was bland and also not fresh. Not as offensive to the palette as the pad kee Mao. 2/5 Pineapple fried rice was over salted and over peppered. 2/5 Yellow curry was sweet and a welcome authenticity to the meal. 4/5  Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Value for money: 3/5"}
{"text":"Two words to summarize this restaurant: fun and fresh.  I visited on a Monday night and found Thai Siam to be very quiet. Only two other tables of diners were there the whole time I dined. (Less than 20 tables in the whole restaurant.) The decor was very welcoming. It was modern and simple, like a little piece of zen with candlelight, greenery, and Asian-inspired statuettes and figurines around the one room.   For a starter, I ordered the Tom Kha Kai. It's always nice when this soup can be made vegetarian! There was a good mix of veggies in the soup that made it feel healthy and fresh. The veggies were sliced in a fun way, not just your regular ole' looking veggies.  As the main course, I selected the Veggie Kee Mao. There are a couple things that made Thai Siam's Kee Mao slightly different from the Kee Mao I'm used to. There were little little pieces of cilantro and lettuce in it. The cilantro added just enough of a taste that was something different from usual, in a good way. The lettuce didn't really have any flavor of its own, but I suppose it added a bit more green.  Another difference was that slightly thinner noodles were used than what I'm used to.  Thinner than typical Pad Thai noodles. Not necessarily a bad thing, just different. It makes me wonder what is traditional or authentic for this dish!   There was also a good mix of veggies and tofu with the noodles. These veggies were also cut quite artistically, which made it more aesthetically pleasing. The taste was good, though slightly greasy.   Good vegetarian options and, more importantly, good flavor and value. Come here for a simple and tasty Thai meal in a pleasantly simple atmosphere. Think: fun and fresh!"}
{"text":"Tried their pad thai to gauge the food.  Pretty good flavours though a bit on the salty side (was still very thirsty hours later!).    Went back a second time and tried two curries -- green and the off menu panang curry.  Both were just terrible. Green curry was watered down and had very little flavour.  Panang curry had frozen peas and carrots instead of fresh vegetables and was really really sweet.  I would say that their attentative service and the loyal clientele that enjoys canadianized thai food keep it in business."}
{"text":"I order takeout from Thai Siam once a week and I'm a creature of habit. I always order the vegetarian pad Thai and it never disappoints; Sweet, savoury and spicy! I have tried many other menu items as well and I am always pleased. The owners are always friendly and gracious."}
{"text":"We were actually heading out to Swiss Chalet (which is in the same plaza) but decided to try this place instead. What a pleasant surprise! We were promptly seated by a friendly waiter who also recommended a strategically placed table so we would't be faced with the cold wind coming in the door every time it opened. Nice big chairs made it easy to balance the carrier for my younger one and easy to climb up for my older one. We were offered a booster which was nice because many places only have high chairs.  The slightly dim lighting and muted colours made for a cozy, almost-romantic feel, but the decor is going to be outdated pretty soon (doesn't matter, we were there to eat). There is enough seating for probably 30-40 people and it filled up quickly. They also appeared to do a lot of takeout business.  The menu was not as extensive as my beloved Siam Dish in Burlington (which is now sadly gone forever) but selection was still ok. We got the spring rolls, green curry chicken (mild for the kids), pineapple fried rice and pad thai. Tea to drink. The tea was a little watered down but otherwise stayed hot and lasted us for the whole meal. My older one had water which was thoughtfully given to him in a HUGE styrofoam cup with a lid, a straw and a fun mini cocktail umbrella to keep him busy. The waiter was very in tune with us because he mentioned his kids were similar ages and he knew what it was like to juggle eating out with kids.  Spring rolls were standard and came 2 to an order with fish sauce. I could have used another spring roll but that's ok. Pineapple fried rice came with shrimp and lots of pineapple. Very good. Pad thai was very good too (didn't appear to have ketchup!) Green curry chicken was good but not the best I've had. The portion of steamed rice we ordered to go with the curry was too small. I would recommend ordering another one if you are going to have curry.  The bathroom was an individual bathroom but I couldn't for the life of me find the lock so we took a chance. Only saw the lock on the way out as it was hidden below the door handle (I guess it was designed that way for aesthetic reasons). My older one enjoyed looking at all the decorations in the washroom because I guess some of the classical Thai dancers look like shiny, new superheroes he didn't know yet. Also the King of Thailand looked like one of our relatives in a weird way.  The service at this place more than makes up for the food and an extra bonus is that it is run by real Thai people (we know, because we heard them speaking Thai). Will be back."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food, and friendly service. They also do take-out, which is excellent when you're craving Thai. Everything that I have tried from here has been good. If you're in the area & want Thai, stop here."}
{"text":"I ordered green curry, from the pic on their website it looked like it had all the typical veggies you see in this dish such as eggplant, baby corn, peppers, onions etc. When I opened up the dish at home it only had some green peas, zucchini and lemon grass (I think that's what the third veggie was). The broth was tasty at least.  Also, I ordered a side of rice since it didn't come with it (it usually does). I don't mind paying for it but I do mind when I'm charged $2.50 for maybe 3 spoons of it. Come on, it's just rice, the cheapest food out there. If you don't wanna spend money on veggies at least fool me with some rice."}
{"text":"Bite to eat after catching a movie.  Quaint resto nice modern decor fits about 60 people.    We ordered Mango salad, crispy rolls, veggie pad Thai, cashew chicken.  The salad and rolls came before our drinks.  The crispy rolls were really fresh, crispy, and yummy.  The mango salad was also very good.  I personally found the pad thai far too salty and not as subtle in the mix of sweet, sour, savoury that is supposed to be Thai.  The cashew chicken was okay but there was not a single cashew in the dish (likely they forgot to add them).  Service was friendly and quick.  Might try some of the other dishes.  They seemed to have a steady stream of takeout for regular customers."}
{"text":"Super surprised by this little place. Stopped here for lunch break and they have reasonably priced lunch combos that taste fantastic and fresh.   Also they are happy to accommodate any vegetarian requests for those who don't want the meat.   It's not a big place so I'd say come for lunch earlier than later as they get pretty full.   I'm excited to try them for dinner sometime soon"}
{"text":"This is a decent place for lunch in an area where there are not a lot of choices. I've come here about half dozen times in the last two years. It's been consistent -fast service, low prices and reasonable quality. I usually have the salmon or the shrimp lunch specials. Both meals come with a ball of rice, a tiny spring roll and side salad. It's the perfect portion size for lunch."}
{"text":"Pad Thai  The noodles were cooked well, el dente with a little bit of chewiness. The chicken is plain chicken with no marinade which wasn't bad because the sauce they use was sufficient. The sauce was mildly sour and had the perfect spiciness for me (medium, you can choose your level of spice). I would've liked the flavours to be more pungent but it was good. For me, it wasn't too salty as most people say. The whole dish came together with cilantro, bean sprouts, peanuts and lime.   It was quite pricey for the dish at $14~ with tax in.   The decor is quite nice with many pieces from Thailand.  I spoke to one of the owners who mentioned the original Thai Siam is south of Bangkok and is closing after 45 years. He has another location in Houston as well.   I would come back for their lunch special ($10+tax) if their portions are the same as what I paid for."}
{"text":"Excellent taste, very decent service, friendly staff, tiny but intimate small room with agreeable decorations. I ordered the coconut soup named tom kha kai. It is a chicken and mushroom soup in coconut milk broth with lemongrass. It was the perfect slightly sweet and sour taste with a little spicy kick to it. I went for medium for spice level although it was pretty spicy. So don't go too spicy if you think you can't handle. I continued with fresh mango salad. It comes with double roasted cashews and a cilantro dressing. Very tasty.   My husband got the green curry with tofu and vegetables. He asked for mild spice level and it was really mild and smooth. Overall everything was really tasty.   If I have to mention a downside, they might improve a little on the rice. It was a bit overcooked although didn't taste too bad.   The restaurant is suitable for families and children. There is no stairs so it's accessible for a wheelchair or stroller. They except credit cards."}
{"text":"With previous locations in Thailand and Houston, Thai Siam has finally cracked into the nerve centre of eastern cuisine: The Upper Oakville Shopping Centre.   OK so it's not a culinary capital, but a Thai restaurant is a very welcome addition to a plaza best known for Swiss Chalet and Harvey's. It's a small and narrow spot but elegantly decorated. There are the obligatory elephants of course, and modern touches like bright red tiles and and mirrors on the walls. It was virtually empty when I visited, but not creepily so.  I always test a restaurant's pad thai, and my DC tried the shu chi shrimp, which was 2 out of 4 chilis on the menu. Neither dish was really that spicy which was disappointing. It was all just OK. That said, it was pretty inexpensive (about $10 for each entree), so I would definitely revisit to sample a few other options on the menu.  Obligatory Title Pun: Give it a THAI.  Menu Readability: Clearly done by someone's nephew with a pirated version of Creative Suite.   Need to mention: Really enjoyed the crispy rolls here.  What this place teaches me about myself: I've spent too many hours at the UOSC."}
{"text":"Hands down the best thai restaurant... Ever! I've been to Thai Siam many times and the food is consistently good. I'm vegan and they lovingly adjust many items to be suitable for me. Everthing I've tried is great but I continue to go back for the veggie pad thai and tom kha kai soup. The owners are incredibly friendly and take time to get to know the regulars."}
