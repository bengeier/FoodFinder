{"text":"A sazerac made with Jim Beam and it's $13? Hmmm sorry but step your game up. The bar wants to act like a \"speak easy\" with craft cocktails and serves up drinks like that.  I'd like it to as a nice environment overall though."}
{"text":"Head upstairs within \"The Grand\" and you'll find Sanctum! Sanctum is The Grand's speakeasy. However, it's only opened Fridays and Saturdays from 9pm to midnight. 

They have an interesting and creative cocktail menu. I ordered an Absinthe Frappe and it was delicious! Sweet and refreshing. It came in a pretty tall glass for $9, so well worth it.

The lighting is dim but romantic, and the decor is dark and victorian. There's a balcony where you can enjoy the live music of The Grand from above.

This is definitely an ideal date night spot, very intimate and seductive. Gorgeous bar and wonderful drinks! Also, the service was fantastic, the bartender was very personable and patient."}
{"text":"What a great speakeasy located in downtown Phoenix!  The bar offers about 8 different cocktails that the two bartenders whip up while guests enjoy in the quaint indoor space as well as the lovely patio.  We enjoyed The Old Cuban - a delicious rum cocktail topped off with champagne.  We arrived right at 9pm last night, so we were the first to arrive and get our drinks.  This place is such a great addition and I hope they extend the hours further."}
{"text":"This was maybe one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had in downtown Phoenix! This place is a little difficult to find, but once you do, you're transported (maybe that was the lavender gin?) I don't know, truthfully. The bartender the evening I went was Nicholas, and he was sensational. He would make recommendations from the menu on what to drink based off of your likes and dislikes. I sat out on the deck with my cocktail (which was something he whipped up with the lavender gin). The ambiance of this place is something out of a Wes Anderson film, and if you know anything about those, they're a little kooky. 

This is worth a trip on a downtown bar crawl! Don't miss it. Only thing is their hours are very limited."}
{"text":"This place is magical. We stumbled upon it while hanging out at the coffee shop/bar below and I'm SO glad we did. It was a highlight of our trip for sure. 

The bartender was awesome. He made me an amazing lavender cocktail, told us about all the spirits he was using, and then personally escorted us to the best seat on the patio to make sure we had a good time.

Sanctum really went all-in on the speakeasy vibe and I loved it so much."}
{"text":"Great venue no real craft cocktails.  Need to work on execution of speak easy offerings or egg whites higher end liquors. I suggest owners go to Ostrich and Under Tow to see what is missing at Sanctum.  I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"The bartender is amazing! Let him make drinks for you, give him an idea of what you like and he will make you something very delicious based off of that! Definitely is a hidden gem! Has that speakeasy vibe. Plus they have really good food downstairs to get on your way out (try the onion rings)."}
{"text":"Our dive crawl through downtown Phoenix continued to the 'Sanctum'. Nestled above and to the rear of a trendy coffee shop, this \"Speakeasy\" would be a secret except that there is a large sign on the outward door that advertises the locale. We walked up the steps, and next to the door were two men speaking at a table with a German shepherd guarding the entrance. We ventured in.
We went in not knowing what exactly to expect, and one of my friends excitedly said she wanted to have a martini \"Mad Men\" style. She had gotten my Old Fashioned at the prior locale, so I got her vesper. I think the expectation was Vodka, but they were making them the old way with Gin. It wasn't a bad vesper, I enjoyed it, however, one really has to like gin to do it. 
We had fun looking at the devilish paintings in the hallway, and taking fun pictures with them, and even though the girls weren't a big fan of the drinks, it was overall a good time."}
{"text":"Sanctum is a speakeasy locates in the Grand cafe. When you enter there are stairs that take you up to the second floor. You'll be thrown off my the tables and chairs and people studying. Continue toward the only door on the second floor. Once you're inside you'll see that it's a small space. You'll immediately walk into the bar and see that the menu is also limited. 

I got the Blue Wallis. For me it was too strong. I got the vibe that this was a no substitution, no nonsense kind of place so I just didn't finish it. My bf loved his drink though so there's that. If you're not a fan of strong drinks this might not be the place for you. I guess it's partly my fault for not asking but I was overwhelmed by the scene.

I will say that I doubt it is like this all the time but when we went there were a group of people who were dressed in cosplay. They all seemed to know each other and weren't particularly rowdy until Jesus showed up. Yup, you read that right. The bartender quickly called security and that was handled but I guess you never know what happens at a bar. 

All in all, I think this is a really intimate space. If that's the tone you want to set then this is the place to go. Drinks are on the stronger side but I'm sure they do well drinks also. I'd suggest going at least once just for the experience."}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome place and experience. As you step through the doors you step back into time. Expect to spend some time here because the bar tender takes his time and listens to what you like and can make a customized drink to your taste if you prefer. They allow you to try the liquors before they make your drink to make sure that the finished product is perfect. I often tell people of this place and the fantastic charm that it offers. I have been back several times and will continue to come to this unique place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my phone died so I didn't get a chance to take a picture of this amazing place. the bartender made you feel welcomed with just his smile. An expert at what he does. Takes you on an adventure as he prepares your drink. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing. Just extraordinary."}
{"text":"This tiny little speakeasy is tucked away in the back end of The Grand's second floor. There's a doorbell, but all you do is push the door and wander on in, past the images of an ever-sinning devil, to the bartender for your drink of choice. 

The lighting is soft, the music is smooth, and the cocktails are strong. If you're looking for a place to close out a date night, you've found it on their big comfy couch on the far wall. Also fun is peeping through the portholes out to the downstairs bar of The Grand. Go ahead and make up crazy date night stories for those strangers, while you sip your sazarac."}
{"text":"Through the expertise of The Grand GM, Chris, and its talented service staff, Cierra, Nicholas and Jason (sorry if I mis-spelled anybody's name!) my 40th birthday soiree at Sanctum (the speakeasy inside The Grand) went off without a hitch or worry. The service was fun and friendly and even accommodating to special requests, like my \"mocktails\". The food was delicious and plentiful and the drinks were strong! The decor, lighting and hidden, password-required entry created the perfect setting for a 1920s prohibition-style theme party. It was a night I will never forget! I would recommend this venue to anybody looking for a speakeasy-style party experience."}
{"text":"Sanctum was an amazing experience!!  The bartender Nicholas is a cocktail artist and his drinks are delicious and complex.  The ambiance and antique eclectic décor creates a unique atmosphere that you have to experience.  The speakeasy is small and only open on Friday and Saturday nights from 9pm to midnight.  This place is great and a must see!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday at around 9:30pm. This place is only open on Friday and Saturday from 9pm-midnight so I'm glad we were able to stop by here since we wouldn't have any other time during our trip.

This place is above The Grand on the second floor. There's a door that you can walk through that will take you to a tiny room that can probably seat like 20 people total. 

All the drinks are about $12-13. I ordered the sazerac which tasted really good. My girlfriend got the blue Wallis which she did not like because it was essentially straight gin with a dash of blue curaçao.

This is a really nice speakeasy with a cool ambience. The drinks are really strong (a lot of them contain absinthe) so be prepared for that. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! You have to go to the second floor above the coffee shop. The drinks are a little pricey but the bartender was so friendly and made it worth it. I highly recommend!"}
