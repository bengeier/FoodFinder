{"text":"So I use Yelp every time I want to find a new restaurant to try. Well, this one has been on my radar for a while and I finally tested it out a few days ago. And o.m.g..... I should have tried ita long time ago.  It's a (seems to be a permanently parked) food truck in a church parking lot. Once you know you're looking for a truck, it's easy to find.   First visit we got the seafood gumbo and a crab pot. They didn't make it to pictures. Lol. My friend is a man from New Orleans and even he was impressed. So much so, that he declared we were going back today.  The food is made to order, so the pots take 25 minutes (ish) to make. But you can order online or via phone and pick it up!  So today I called to place an order and learned that the gumbo had already sold out (horrible news)!! So we ordered the catfish, with BBQ beans and Mac and cheese, and the combo pot (snow crab and shrimp with potatoes, corn, sausage and rice).   This time I got photos (not great ones), after we started eating.   My friend had the catfish, and reported that it is nicely breaded strips, Mac & cheese is good (but mine is better ), and the beans were good.   I had the combo pot, and it was as delicious as the crab pot was the first time. Spice level is on point, rice is perfectly done (and buttered!), and the corn/potatoes/sausage are all cooked in the same spices so they are awesome as well.   We'll be back again soon, next time hopefully before the gumbo sells out!"}
{"text":"This Food is Absolutely Amazing, I had a hamburger that melted in my mouth, Ive never in my 30 years of life and also being southern born and raised had anything better. I encourage EVERYONE to try it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. There is no other southern food, sea food, or BBQ place that you will find all wrapped in one, for affordable prices, and the BEST Food period hands down!!"}
{"text":"Order was sent in but never made, and their card reader wasn't working anyways. Literally no choice but to pass and get my food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. The I ordered BBQ ribs with greens and baked beans. The BBQ ribs are great and the greens too but I expected the beans to taste in BBQ baked beans not chili. Kinda disappointed but not bad. They could use a little more help with their service. Too much of a long wait when you order online and give an option to pick up on time. Unorganized on that part"}
{"text":"Checked it out on the last Friday of Lent, figured I'd have a Catfish Po' Boy. Did not disappoint. Crunchy catfish strips on a French roll made fresh. I'll have to come back to try the BBQ. Being at this spot for two months is good, hope they stay and do well."}
{"text":"coo quick food to go place..great service and greater prices..i will be back..shrimp sandwich and burger was very good"}
{"text":"Amazing good with the beat prices . Can't beat the rib tip special. Comes with 2 sides for 6.50 Not to mention best collard greens in town ! Everything down to the sweet tea is awesome.  Great group of gentlemen working here as well !  This is my second time here and will be back once a week !"}
