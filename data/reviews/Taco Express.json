{"text":"This place is surprisingly very good. Portions are plentiful and the food is quite good. Burritos are huge!  Trust me, the food is better than the place looks. I'll be back."}

Everything we ate tasted very fresh and full of flavor.... certainly homemade. We will definitely be coming back and I shall be recommending this place to my friends!!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos in the Charlotte area hands down! If you are looking for a real authentic Mexican cuisine this is the place."}
{"text":"Loved the tacos, chips, cheese dip!  Great service!  First visit but it won't be our last."}
{"text":"I may have liked this place if I had gotten a burrito, but the tacos were disgusting. And since I paid $10 for 4 mini tacos, that doesn't help either."}
{"text":"Don't be turned off by the location. This place is amazing! I couldn't read the menu but the cashier was friendly enough to explain my options. I ended up going with the tacos 2 chicken & 1 steak, my friend ordered a burrito. Everything was fresh and flavorful! I will definitely be back!"}

{"text":"Taco Express moved from HWY 29 to the location on Dale Earnhardt previously occupied by Fresh Off the Grill. The menu is simple with Taco's, Sope, Quesadilla, Tortas, Burritos, & Huaraches all sold A la Carte. A few plate specials offered on the specials board.    The Sope was large and flavorful topped with steak, lettuce, crema, and crumbled cheese.  The chorizo taco hit the the spot on a homemade corn tortilla.  Sauces served at the table included a verde and rojo.  Chips were served complimentary with Roasted chili salsa, chips were less memorable than the mains.    Glad to have this option so close to work, I will return."}
{"text":"Great authentic tacos. I love them. Every Tuesday, is taco tuesday & they're only $1. Great friendly service also."}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas and chips plus sopes, any true Mexican knows that's authenticity. I lived in Mexico for 12 years and go back often, Taco Express' al pastor tacos have a flavor that reminds me of the real street tacos in Mexico City (I was in the city literally a week ago). The food speaks for itself, easy menu to understand, and if you're new to REAL Mexican tacos, they will help you through the process. The environment is very welcoming to all kinds of people, so you don't have to be Mexican to fit in, as a matter of fact if you're not from Mexico then all the more reason to visit this place for that realness. Great service, smart owner and good food, what else do you need?"}
{"text":"The best Tacos I have eaten.  They remind me of the the time I spent in Mexico.  Authentic and flavorful"}
{"text":"This place is fast food Mexican definitely an upgrade from Taco Bell lol but still it's fast food not the greatest Mexican food but convenient it's fast and cheap and they give you plenty of chips which is nice not a bad place."}
{"text":"Estaba por el area de kannapolis buscando un lugar para comer en mi descanso de trabajo cuando mire este lugar y me llamó la atención por qué no lo había visto antes,entonces decidí probar mi suerte y vaya sorpresa que me lleve! Es un lugar pequeño y sencillo pero el lugar está limpio y la atención que me dieron fue muy buena,en cuanto a la comida es muy buena comparada a las opciones que hay alrededor, mire el menú dónde venía una quesadilla y decidí ordenar algo así y para cuando me dieron mi comida se veía idéntica a la foto del menú! Es muy sabrosa la comida con buen sabor y buenas porciones de comida y sin duda alguna este lugar es uno de mis nuevos lugares favoritos para comer tacos y platillos típicos mexicanos. Muy buen lugar Taco express lo recomiendo a todos."}
{"text":"My husband and I are always on the hunt for new places to try and we stumbled upon this tiny taco place that's 5 minutes from our new place! We were in the mood for legit tacos so we tried out Taco Express.  Oh my, we are in love!  Our favorite has got to be their sweet pork tacos and tamales. I could eat them all day long if I could. The only thing is I wish the tacos weren't $1.99 each but about 99¢ each. $2 for a single taco is a bit pricey in my opinion. Other than that, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok well my wife and I decided to try taco Express for the first time Tuesday night we will not be back we both ordered the steak barreto I  ordered mine with no tomato arrived covered in tomatoes found the steak to passable but the rice and beans very bland with no taste shame had high hopes"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good taqueria in the area. Then I found this place. Being a vegetarian is hard when you love Mexican street food. They made me sopes with avocado, instead of meat. It was amazing! My husband had the tacos and loved them. It's a great place."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the shady exterior. After all, everyone knows that the best tacos come only from places that look sketchy. These are the real deal - street tacos like you see in LA or San Diego, right here in Kannapolis. Tamales were great. Horchata was sweeter than I like, but authentic. Check it out and find your new taco happy place."}
{"text":"This place no longer exists, Amigo Taqueria is now operating at the same address. which is real good."}
