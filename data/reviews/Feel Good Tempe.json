{"text":"Feel good people + feel good beverages = an absolutely better feeling, YOU! 

I'm absolutely sold on this establishment. The customer service alone, is extremely impeccable. I went today to try them out, and the hype is REAL. 

I got one of their teas and I am gliding through the rest of my work day. Ambiance - 10/10. Clean, vibrant, & spacious. Excited for my many visits"}
{"text":"Mmmm Refreshing. Super friendly service. A great way to start the day! This is my 3rd time here this week just to try the varieties in the menu. I'm already loving all the drinks I've tried."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the smoothies are super chalky. Paid $7 for a small smoothie and took a drink and threw it away. I was drinking chalk. My coworker and I tried to pay together because it was cheaper and she rang us up separate. 2 stars because the workers were really energetic and polite, but I can't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Best customer service I've had in years. And the offerings are good for you! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Khalil and Alicia and the rest of the Feel Good team always greet you with a smile and they take the time to learn your name from the first time you visit. The shakes and teas are amazing both in taste and quality. If you're looking for a midday pick me up, after gym protein shake or just a tasty treat definitely stop by and check them out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  The staff greets you with the most warm and genuine smiles!  The atmosphere is upbeat, with sports on the TVs, and the music gets your body moving and your feet tapping with out being overpowering or too loud.  The smoothies taste exactly like they are named.  My personal fav is the Orange Creamsicle!  Get to this place and enjoy it all!!!"}
{"text":"I have found my new go-to place for post workout smoothies and energy teas!

The first thing that you'll notice about this place is the energy! This place provides great service and from the first moment I walked in, I feel like everyone knows each other, and everyone acts as if they're all at a big family reunion! I love the vibes of this place! 

Very sleek and modern looking on the inside, FeelGood Nutrition provides you with high quality and awesome tasting post workout smoothies that are macro friendly and absolutely incredible!!!! I've had the low calorie Nutter Butter smoothie and I'm hooked!!! It tastes just as good as it looks!!! Very Instagram worthy to snap a few pics of your drink take a selfie in front of the \"CHILL\" background, OMG they even have color changing straws!!!! They really think about everything to make the customer have an awesome experience here and to not just feel good, but feel great!!!! 

I was helped by two people, Alicia and Khalil and they're full of contagious energy and make you wanna put a smile on your face!!! Not only are they providing great service but they also are super informative about nutrition, how to feed your body after a great workout, and make you stay energized throughout your long day! 

I highly recommend going here, and I will start coming here and bringing friends!

Tips: 
1) they're only open from 10am-2pm so make sure you get in before they close
2) get the Nutter Butter smoothie, it'll change your life
3) drink the smoothie first after your workout for post workout protein, and drink the tea to make yourself energized and ready to start the day!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up close to where I work, and I think I'll be going there pretty often! The owners were very friendly and fun to talk to, and they have a very cool and unique selection of smoothies and teas. I tried the Nutter Butter smoothie and the sweet watermelon tea. The smoothie was among the best I've ever had. The tea was sugar free but still quite sweet, but otherwise also delicious. Next time I'll just ask for less sweetener and I think I'll love it as much as the smoothie. I can't wait to go back and try their other flavors!"}
{"text":"I make time in my schedule to come in at least 3 times a week. The vibe of this whole place makes you feel incredible! 5 stars is not enough. The staff is happy and sincere. The music is always on point. And the place is sparkling clean. So happy to have a spot in Tempe to Feel Good!! The tea gives me energy all day and the shakes are light but keep you full! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"The owners are super friendly and my pb and j smoothie was pretty tasty. I thought I would feel intimidated walking in because I know the premise is to promote a healthy lifestyle but, I didn't feel any pressure. In fact it felt very welcoming."}
{"text":"The Pros 
-Friendly service
-Charming and Clean interior
-Pineapple tea was refreshing and sweet (and while it WAS sweeter than I expected, I still enjoyed it. -- LOVE that their teas sugar-free and only have 3g of carbs per serving!

The Cons
-Prices are not indicated clearly anywhere, so (unless you ask) the pricing is a surprise at checkout. I really hate when businesses do this as it just comes off as dishonest. ((But it's just as much on me for not asking beforehand.))
-The shake was great in flavor but the texture wasn't ideal.  Maybe longer blending is necessary (or it could be just the powder that's used.)  

Give it a try for yourself, you may love it"}
