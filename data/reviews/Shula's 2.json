{"text":"Excellent food!!! Order for room service and the southwestern egg rolls were divine loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm into my second week at the Hilton where this restaurant is located and the food, service and personnel are amazing. I've had 7 different entrees so far,  the calamari, sweet chili shrimp and more than one hot wing app. All were delicious. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Awful...pathetic....waste of space! I am staying at the Doubletree that houses this place, and I stopped in to get a couple of sliders and fries to go.  Had a cocktail while waiting, and everyone else who ordered after me ( all 4 of them) were getting their food while mine apparently sat in the window getting cold and soggy. I had to ask about it, received a bag with a styrofoam box containing my food and when I opened it was disgusted to find it not worthy of a Shula's.  Mgr. Al P. didn't offer to return my money, but, did offer a free drink.  Believe me, youll need it to choke down what they're servin up.  Try the Bob Evan down the hill, gotta be better than this dump."}
{"text":"We stayed in the hotel associated with this restaurant. We got the combination platter appetizer. It had spring rolls, fried ravioli, buffalo nuggets and spinach dip. It was pretty much freezer food and I mean like year old freezer food. Very disappointing. I make better fried food at home from the wholesale club. For the entre I got the Cowboy steak. I have never seen a prime rib steak sold as a cowboy steak, but it might a location thing. The prime rib steak was excellent and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  I ordered blackened snapper  and it was delicious.  Not too many options for those with gluten sensitivities.  I was not disappointed in my dinner selection at all.  The hostess was very attentive and made us feel comfortable even after the diningroom had closed.  A+ customer service!"}
{"text":"Food quality suck! Got stake it was burned up; got baked potato stink or looks rotten; save urself from this dump"}
{"text":"The food here is not good. Stayed at the adjacent hotel, dined here twice, here is the recap,  Dinner  Appetizer  Tuna - Over priced, odd texture  Dinner - Grilled Salmon, burnt aspragus and wilted sweet potatoe fries.   Had breakfast the following day bc i was short on time. The buffet food was medicore at best. Bad coffee, runny scrmabled eggs and off tasting bacon."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch.  Very comfortable atmosphere, very friendly staff.  I had the meatloaf sandwich and we split an order of potato skins.  Although the meatloaf sandwich was a little pricey at $9, it was very tasty and filling.  The skins were crispy, the way I like them.  My friend ordered the chocolate lava cake which she said \"was to die for\".  Can be expensive, but they always seem to have Groupons!"}
{"text":"I only ate hear because i won a free gift certificate from wmms. The service was horrible. Which i had heard from other people that i work with. There was my party of 2 a group of 6 that had already paid and a couple at the bar that were just drinking. SO i was expecting better service the waitress was soooooo slow it was rediculous. I would have rather eaten at outback we were in the resteraunt for an hour due to her turleness, THANK GOD IT WAS FREE. PLUS its a steakhouse with only THREE steaks on the menu what the hell. WILL NEV E R GO AGAIN EVEN IF IT IS FREE"}
{"text":"Service for me is CRITICAL in any business, especially when it comes to food.  At this Shula's we experienced some of the worst service ever.  Started off fine, we were seated quickly and the restaurant was not even half full.   Each of us were given paper menus of the specials or featured dishes.  Then there was one full menu for 6 of us to share.  mmmmmmm did they run out?  There were only 2 other tables in the room we were in with people sitting at it.    When the waitress finally came to take our drink order, we already knew what we wanted to eat, we'd been sitting there at least 10 minutes.  She refused to take the  order and said she'd put in the drink order and be back  in a moment to take our dinner order.  Well, she didn't come back for almost 10 minutes and she was short a drink.  She went back to the bar, again without taking our food orders and came back 5 minutes later with the missing drink.  At the same time a food tray was brought out for a table nearby so she went there to serve those people.  Fine, they should have hot food, but she didn't come right back,  It took almost 20 minutes to take our food order.   When the food did arrive, one of our parties orders was missing.  She said someone from room service took it.  After most of the table was finished eating the party with the missing food was finally served.    At the time she brought our food, then the missing food and another time later we flagged her down, we requested the check, telling her we were all expected in a meeting soon.  It took more than 15 minutes for her to bring that after we made our last request.  All we got was, \"we're busy - Sorry for the delay\"  Busy?  Did I mention there were more empty tables than full tables?  There were many people dressed in shirts with the name Shula's scurrying about?  OK, there were some people there, but I'd hardly call it Busy!  While the food was great, I enjoyed my salmon, my date enjoyed his meatloaf, the experience was dreadful.  Sad that a hotel with such great staff has a restaurant with staff that was so awful.    The final insult was when the individual who didn't get his food until long after everyone else stopped by and spoke to the manager on the way out, he was told \"well, we're busy\".  Not sorry, not is there anything I can do for you, not here's a drink coupon,  come back and have a beverage or appetizer on the house.  Not even, we're sorry, just \"we're busy\".  mmmmmm  I wonder why they have all those tables in there if they can't even handle the place when it's less than half full.  If you have plenty of time and patience, the food is good.  But if you are there at a meeting and need to be somewhere soon, leave the hotel and walk to the restaurant down the street to Delmonicos where the next day I had the best food and amazing service."}
{"text":"Had been looking to try this location for some time: Very Disappointed !! Here for a birthday dinner, filet was overcooked twice, other items lukewarm and frozen onion rings. Nothing like Shula's in AL. Won't return!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Shula's.  Our group was seated in a quiet area as requested and our drinks were served right away.  However, our server did not return for quite some time to take our order and it was over an hour from when we were seated before we received our orders.  My French onion hamburger was OK at best.  The bottom was soggy and it was very salty.  Our server was accommodating about getting extra drink orders, water, etc.    This restaurant met our needs -- a group of friends getting together who wanted to talk and be heard.  Other restaurants we considered were too noisy for that purpose. We would probably go to Shula's again."}
{"text":"do not eat here... Shula's 2 was terrible, actually the worst... first of all, they served my bro a beer w/no head... meaning it was flat... who sees a beer thats flat and serve it anyway... my bro said it didnt taste right so it was probably a leftover one that someone didnt want...   then, no bread served until dinner which TOOK AND HOUR... its not like there was a mad rush, the place was 3/4 empty... then they brought out one kids meal for one of my nieces when they served everyone else and the server said 'the other one's coming'... who the hell serves part of a meal to a group and not for everybody... even in the crappy chains i eat at i have NEVER experienced that... i had to say something and blurted out 'are you kidding me,' and then she had someone else bring out the last order, some bread, and refills (finally)... she should have comped those stupid chicken nuggets... it's not like Shula's 2 couldn't afford to create customer satisfaction than the ten bucks they made off a kids meal...  its not like this place was a dive bar... for what it cost to eat at Shula's 2, this kind of service, from the bar to the kitchen to the server rated one of the WORST dining experiences i ever had, and i'm 57... this was on a friday nite too, so you'd think they'd be better equipped to bartend and cook and serve...  the least they could do is contact me and give me a substantial discount to go back there and stop talking s%$# about the place... feel free Shulas 2 to email me what you're going to do to make up for this: violetfl@aol.com.... they are so lucky my brother and sister-in-law are kind people... they didn't ask for any discount and tipped fully... if it were me, i would've found the manager and get in his face, and tipped a buck...  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY... just go to a chain restaurant and expect to not have great service instead of being totally disappointed, appalled actually, at that Shula's 2... Violet"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Shula's -I thought it was great.  Excellent club sandwich and amazing coleslaw.  Very nice wine list and good service.  The atmosphere was just right - not too loud but not dead.  I will return."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, and let me tell you, they make a damn good burger here.  I'm a fan of places that combine different cuts of meat in their burgers, and Shula's didn't disappoint.  The different flavor combinations are all terrific.  There were three of us having lunch, so there was a lot of sharing going on.  The french fries are skin on and salted perfectly, worth the extra calories, and far tastier than the cole slaw.    The appetizer platter was perfect for the three of us.   None of the items were greasy, and the chipotle dressing for the egg rolls, was divine.  The only rub is finding this place,  it's located inside the Double Tree, but the signage doesn't really let you know that."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. We wanted to like this place as it's very convenient for us, but after two terrible experiences we will never go back. The service was terrible, the manager made excuses, the food was average. With so many great places to eat in Cleveland, I would not put this on my list to ever visit again."}
{"text":"I just love this place...I always order the Filet Mignon, and my husband orders the cowboy Ribeye and they are excellent. Seasoned well.  Cheesecake is to die for..."}
{"text":"Sweet chili shrimp was cooked well and the sauce was great. However, when's it comes to  the cowboy cut steak, it was lacking a crust and tasted like it had been frozen. Kids meal were normal fried chicken and grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and def good to support a local legend in the NFL.. Had dinner with the wifey & the steaks were mediocre.. 2 stars at Best for the price!"}
{"text":"Really great food and a nice atmosphere with a good view.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It was New Years Eve... The only available time was 8:15- but when we got there it was half- empty. There was maybe 3 tables fill in the bar area (out of 20?) and the more formal area was half full. Really?? The ambiance was simply that of a hotel restaurant - disappointing. Our party had 4 adults (age 32-40). The food was ok. Not too expensive so that was a relief. Service was good until we received our food- then our waitress's disappeared for over 20 min (the others swear it was 30 min). When we asked another server he was great and took care of us and explained she was splitting a check 18 ways. Ok- but have someone cover your tables while your gone. Overall- disappointing and will not return nor recommend."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a little pricey for a sports bar but everything I've eaten here has been very good. The burgers are good and I've had steak as well. It's good quality. Maybe the higher price and the casual atmosphere turn some people off. I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Ugh. Just ugh.   I bought the Groupon and made a reservation, not that it was necessary since it was very dead. It's a nice place. A good set up and nice furnishings. As we were seated the host who I think was also the manager (???) commented that two tables were dirty and grabbed a towel to clean it. I appreciated that...but that wasn't the end of our cleanliness issues.  We ordered the appetizer sampler. The ravioli, wings and spinach dip were good. The southwestern egg rolls tasted as if they'd been frozen and weren't appealing to either of us. We did like the plate of sauces that came with everything. My husband really enjoyed the blue cheese dressing.   I had the French onion burger. The cole slaw that came with it was good but I was so stuffed from appetizers that I took the burger to work the next day. The first couple of bites were okay until I found a dark hair in my burger. I have blonde hair.  My husband had the blue cheese burger. He immediately started feeling nauseated while we were driving home. His silverware with dinner wasn't clean.   We gave up on this meal and got desserts to go. He got the cheesecake and I did the chocolate lava. While tasty, it's very chocolatey. We both just had a few bites and then tossed it. It was just overwhelmingly rich.   We won't return. I don't know how this place stays in business with their prices."}
{"text":"I only dined here because I was staying at the Doubletree (where this restaurant is located). The service and food were quite awful.  When I walked in, there were literally no staff in the place. No one at the host stand, no one behind the bar, no servers waiting on tables, etc. There were, though, a couple of tables of customers and a few patrons sitting around the bar. It was literally 10 minutes before anyone appeared.  I sat at the bar and waited another 15 minutes before the bartender acknowledged my presence or asked what I would like (there were only 5 other people sitting at the bar - and all already had drinks and food). During that 15 minutes, I helped myself to one of the menus stacked behind the bar (despite this being noticeable to the bartender, it didn't move her along at all).  After finally being afforded the opportunity to order a drink and some food, I waited with extreme hunger. And good thing I felt like I was starving - there is really no other circumstance under which that food could have been eaten. My two sliders were brown hockey pucks on cold buns. And, of course, condiments just weren't going to happen (there was no way I was ever going to get that bartender's attention again).  Needless to say, during the rest of my stay at the Doubletree, I never set foot in here again."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet is delicious! Great selection. Amazing bacon- the comedian Jim Gaffigan would have a field day. :) They have an omelette and waffle making station- I tried both during our stay at the Doubletree- delicious! They have hot food like french toast, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, potatoes, and then fruit, cheese, yogurt, and many types of muffins and breads. They have a good mix of toppings to put on your hot oatmeal. They have grapefruit and cranberry juices. You can have orange juice if you request it. The coffee is extremely hot for some reason.   Our only complaint is that the service seems disorganized and confusing (though some servers are very friendly). It wasn't clear if you seat yourselves. Our first morning we couldn't figure out how to get coffee- there were a few servers going to all the tables but ours- finally we got up to find someone and asked where the coffee is. We walked to another table to find glasses for juice. It seems like the same person running the waffle and omelette station has to get people drinks too- then other people have to wait. It seems like it could be organized better and that there could be much better communication between the staff. This is probably (hopefully) just the case for the morning breakfast buffet, but I thought it was worth a mention.  This actually is the best breakfast we've had at a hotel we've stayed at- the hotel package we chose included this breakfast but we are aware that other rooms didn't have it included. We would have paid for it straight, though, that's how good (selection and taste) we thought it was. It would be five stars if not for the confusing service."}
{"text":"Would not go here again. Went on a groupon, still wasn't worth it. The Times Square strip was supposed to come with a mushroom sauce with mushrooms and I had two canned mushrooms inside a sauce that tasted like it came from a lean cuisine. Potatoes were blah and definitely tasted frozen as did the veggies. My fiancé's steak which he ordered medium came out gray, I felt bad feeding the leftovers to our dogs. The calamari \"fries\" lacked any flavor. Breading was worse than McDonald's chicken nuggets and the \"calamari\" tasted like nothing, I have real doubts it's even calamari. Server was nice. Nothing else good to say. Avoid!"}
{"text":"The food was just OK. For those prices I expected more, a lot more in flavor, portion etc... The drinks were over- priced. The atmosphere was nice but small tables for a party of four. For my husband and I we paid 94 bucks for 2 chicken dishes and 4 drinks. Plus 12 bucks tip equals will not return. I only ate here because a Resturant.com gift certificate.    Thats great! I'll give you until mid 2017...good luck."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in a few weeks because the first time we enjoyed the food so much!  I think that it might be slightly inconsistent because while the service was still great the second time, the food wasn't quite as great.    I really liked my steak sandwich... The meat was tender and all of the flavors worked together really nicely. I would most certainly order that again.  The burger wasn't as flavorful and was slightly dry, but another member of the party enjoyed hers a great deal so it appears to be hit or miss  The consistently delicious component was the cheesecake... It is absolutely amazing.  There is a raspberry compote next to it on the plate and I cannot get enough. I could go just for dessert!"}
{"text":"We ate here in September 2015 for a late lunch.  The bartender Al was also our Server and he was friendly. We ordered the Nachos Supreme and it was the best nachos we had eaten. There was real meat and cheese, guacamole and sour cream. There was more than enough food for 2 people. We ordered the Club sandwich and it had lots of ham and turkey and it was very good.  We also ordered the steak sandwich which had a regular sized steak in the bread and the meat was tender and not like chewing gum. We were pleasantly surprised after reading some bad reviews,  We will return in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for work over the past 7-8 years, and frankly I'm surprised it's still here. Food quality is mediocre to poor, and overpriced. Not a good combination. Better choices in this price range nearby."}
{"text":"I ordered the NY Strip. It was ok but over. I ordered medium-rare but it came out medium.  It was a decent meal. I wasn't blown away by any means but it was decent. I've had much better steaks at several other places. Also was very nice even though he talks pretty fast."}
{"text":"I didn't read the other reviews but I believe three stars is a real disservice to this restaurant. I usually don't review places at all if they are not four or five stars. So you will notice I give only good reviews. I am sorry, I don't have time to badmouth a business who is not up to expectation but if you please me, I have to take time to acknowledge it. The mixed appetizer platter was very tasty. The New York strip, mashed potatoes and asparagus were divine. I left here very, very happy! So to all the haters who like to give poor reviews to flex your muscles in a world where you feel powerless, stop being a yelp bully. Give fair reviews."}
{"text":"Beyond awful!  People I was with had steak that tasted like it was cooked in rancid butter. This restaurant used to be top quality.  Very expensive too even with coupons.  Pass on this place.  Spend your money elsewhere"}
{"text":"We had a large group last week on a Thursday night. Overall, the food was OK and the service was awful. Our group was larger than they anticipated and it really gave our waitress fits.  She kept telling us that she left at 9:00 so whatever happened, as long as she got out by 9:00, she was good.  Overall, she was rude and probably didn't deserve the tip that was automatically put on the tab. Drinks were slow and God forbid you wanted a second one. Food was OK but my wife ordered the portobello burger and I don't think there was a mushroom on that bun. For almost $14, it was a rip off.  My steak was good but due to the large group, it was almost cold when they brought it out. Overall, I probably would go to Delmonico's before I would go back to Shula's."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an appetizer with my wife, ordered fried ravioli, and nachos. Both were well prepared and flavorful. Service was very  good and fast. A nice evening."}
{"text":"I expected it to be a heck of a lot worse than it was based on Yelp reviews.  Both service and food were good. I was concerned the restaurant was completely empty. I agree with other Yelpers that the location is very low rent--crooked photos on the wall, tables not bussed clean, and a giant unfinished painting project visible to customers in the dining room.   Though the staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome. I was kind of shocked for an empty dining room to be asked three times if we had a reservation.  This restaurant was one of the many featured in the county corruption probe, it was a favorite of fatcat politicians... I can see why because it was kind of quiet and the food was generally good."}
{"text":"The food was terrific. I got the Texas tails which i was thinking would be small chunks of steak but it turns out are several 1 1/2\" cuts of steak that were very tender. Other than the constant bombardment of \"how's your food\" this place is great. I will return."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there the other day. The service was ok. I had the filet and my wife had the filet medallions. My steak was excellent. My wife got 2 small medallions. There was no bread or salad with the meal. The waitress only came back once to ask if we wanted refills. The bill came to $86. I've had steak dinners for half the price and they were just as good. They also added an 18% gratuity. If the service had been better I wouldn't have minded as much."}
{"text":"I attended a private party here on Saturday, January 6, 2018 and it was by far the worst experience I have had in a long time.  The place was filfthy!! The service slow and non interactive and the food totally disgusting!!! There were hardly no customers in the resturant that night but yet our service were beyond slow!!! The client who booked the private party had brought in birthday decorations earlier in the day to be set up and of course the \"management\" did nothing!!! Many of the \"staff\" was so inattentive because they were to busy looking on their cell phones!! It was so disgusting. That place should be closed down immediately!!! In fact I will be calling the \"food police\" and reporting them.  They have to have a lot of problems!!! DO NOT GO AND EAT THERE!!! HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Meh.  We used a groupon to visit this location a few months back and felt a little disappointed.  It's expensive and a \"steakhouse\" but also a \"sports bar\" so it's kind of a confusing atmosphere.  I got the filet medallions and was disappointed.  My first medallion was well-done, despite ordering medium rare.  The next one was completely rare.  The third one was well-done again.  The portions were kind of small, especially given the price."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars solely because the bartender was nice, though incredibly slow.  Sit down - wait 10 mins for service; order a beer - wait 10 mins for said beer; ask for water - wait another 10 mins; order food...you get the picture.  Granted the bartender was alone serving the entire bar area, but there were only about 10 people in the place.    Typical subpar chain food, on par with maybe a TGI Fridays.  To be fair, I don't eat steak, so maybe that's amazing, but everthing else was disappointing.  I asked how the fish sandwich is cooked and whether its greasy - specifically saying I don't want anything overly greasy or oily.  After the bartenders assurances, I ordered, and naturally, it came so soaked the bun was soggy.  No bueno.  The veggies were also soaked in oil or butter - I didn't care to eat enough to figure out which.  Side saled was the lone thing I actually ate, and it was a very basic side saled, nothing more, nothing less.    Slow service, horribly unhealthy food...luckily I leave tomorrow, because I wouldn't be back.    Also, I know its nit-picky, but the server didn't even seem to notice my plate was nearly untouched.  I don't expect anything free, nor did I want anything else from this place, but a thoughtful staff should want to know if a customer is unhappy.    Stick to coaching, Don."}
{"text":"We have the ribeye steaks with asparagus and bake potato. It was very good, nice clean place, great service, will come back."}
{"text":"This could be a great lunch destination for local office workers given the good experience with the sweet potato soup and asian chicken salad today, but I can't get over the terrible service and overall feeling of a sad, neglected establishment when I walked in.  I had hoped to get a quick meal by walking in right after the lunch rush and attempting to sit at the bar.  The waitress looked a bit surprised and almost slightly disappointed that I had come in looking for service.  I gave my drink orders and asked to see a menu and was slightly surprised to see the waitress walk towards the back kitchen to get drinks without acknowledging the menus sitting right in front of her.  I had half-considered reaching over the bar to grab a menu while she stared at her phone on the way back to the kitchen.  After placing my order, I inquired about the spare copies of the Wall Street Journal at the front and if they were available for guests to borrow.  I had to repeat my question twice as it seemed like the waitress wasn't paying attention at first and responded with a blank \"Wait...what..?\"  Her head came out of the clouds soon enough and responded that someone just left them there from that morning.  A different waitress delivered my food who was bright, welcoming, and cheerful as she also offered pepper for my salad (why couldn't she have been working the bar that day?)  The salad and soup were wonderful as mentioned before.  I had expected cheap chain food and was surprised at the quality of the dishes.  Unfortunately, the first waitress came back as I was finishing my salad - ready to take my plate before I had finished - and acted surprised when she came out to find I wasn't done.  She hovered at the nearby register seeming like she was pushing buttons to act busy while I finished so she could get rid of me and hastily get back to her phone.  Will I come back?  Not until I start seeing stronger reviews of the service at all shifts at this establishment.  Especially not after hearing two kitchen staff converse between the bar and the host table about their recent sexual conquests as I tried to finish my soup."}
{"text":"This has been around for a few years and remains popular.  Nice selection of steaks with some seafood and chicken entrees.  All steaks are made to order.  The items our group received were are prepared well.  Service was attentive.  Overall, though, this place seems a bit dated, like about 20 years dated.  Given the menu prices, you can find better food at many of the steakhouses in the area for a similar price."}
{"text":"I want to let you in on a very disappointing evening me and my family had at Shula's 2 steak and sports on 6200 Quarry lane 44131.  Let me just preface this by saying we have been there a total of 3 times, and they have been increasingly worse than the last.   On the night in question we all ordered steaks.  I got the filet(32.00) and my friend got the Strip.  The complaint is not about the food.  The food was PAR at best.  When ordering a filet you expect an experience for your money.  It wasn't anything special.   Here is the problem.  We had 1 coupon, and 2 25.00 gift certificates.  The manager named \"Al\" told us that he could only accept a total of 50.00 per table.....so he would not accept the coupon.  I asked \"how is this so\".....i mean gift cards are MONEY WE PAID FOR.  Why not accept the coupon?  Anyhow this is the bottom line.  We have been there 3 times and have paid about 100.00 per visit.  The service and the food have been below grade as far as im concerned.  We still have 100.00 in gift cards that have an expiration date in April.  Needless to say, the gift cards will go unused. NEVER GO TO SHULA'S.  AND THE MANAGER \"AL\" HAS A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"I ordered the BBQ bacon burger.. wasn't great and wasn't horrible. They cooked it as requested, medium. I wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce. I think if I had it without the sauce it would have been much better."}
{"text":"Came on a Groupon and loved our visit. We will be back. These guys do a dann good steak. My strip steak was perfectly medium, veggies were tasty and holy mashed potatoes! I could have eaten a plate of the mashed potatoes alone. For dessert, the key line was a wonderful choice. Service was great. The waitress was attentive and polite. She had a big party seated next to us but handled her tables well."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed here before, but out of convenience (staying at the Doubletree to swim with our 7 year old granddaughter) we decided to eat at the in hotel Shula's 2. Now hotel restaurants are usually disappointing, but this is really disappointing. The staff need to be trained, get some manners (don't just throw the folder with the bill on the table without saying a word! How about asking if I want dessert? Etc etc). The kids offerings were very very limited - and very very bad, not to mention pricy (my granddaughter just couldn't eat any of her tough, old chicken fingers for $7). My wife said it best by saying \"mediocre is generous\". My Miami strip was mediocre for sure and her tuna salad looked and tasted less than that. Has Don Shula ever visited this place? We have free coupons for breakfast here but as you will note from my previous reviews of this sad place, I will drive and pay full price anywhere else rather than try this place again for breakfast. What a waste! No wonder there are so many, many empty tables prime time on a Saturday night :("}
{"text":"It was in the lobby of the Doubletree I was staying at, and if you know much about business events, it's all about how much play can we do tonight to outweigh the insane day at work.  So first drink was down there.  Decor was very nice. Wooden bar, well kept.  I like the size of the big square bar.  I'm glad the bartender didnt ask me more than twice if I was sure I wouldnt be having a drink and it was nicely filled for cocktail hour.  I guess when you're spoiled by Shula's you're not dying to try ones in Cleveland.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but this was pretty bad. Ordered a simple steak and baked potato. The steak was tough and when the server went to refill my water, she had the water pitcher over my plate and stuck the pitcher IN my potato! Seriously, there was some sour cream on the pitcher. She didn't even notice. Didn't notice when she got to the kitchen either as she didn't come back and apologize. Really? As it turns out, we were basically done anyways, so we just got out of there. Even if you are staying at the Doubletree (this is in the Doubletree), do yourself a favor and walk across the street to the Winking Lizard. Really."}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this...but for hotel bar food. The dinner was pretty good and the beer selection adequate."}
{"text":"Just wasn't that good - especially for the price.  I had the scallops.  The entree came out with the scallops on top of some corn salsa.  I think the corn salsa was just creamed corn, which was kind of depressing.  Again, the food wasn't terrible, I've just had way better food for much less money.  The fact that the place was almost empty on a Wednesday night leads me to believe that others probably share my sentiments.  I've eaten at the Shula's in Tampa, and this place doesn't even come close to the Tampa location.  Again, not terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I found out about this restaurant through groupon....so why do I feel ripped off? First off the atmosphere is dark and depressing...and the food was not much better. Boyfriend ordered medium burger.....and when it arrived it looked more raw then cooked. My food(blue burger) was not anything special. If you are thinking of eatting out try to avoid this restuarant if you can."}
{"text":"I stay at this Hotel on business , the Restaurant has been average at best the last few years but keeps sliding downward. The go to was always the Steak sandwich and Southwestern Egg Rolls but the last few times they are bland or undercooked. Just so many better options around."}
{"text":"The food was good. I got the Time Square strip and my girlfriend got the roasted chicken. Service wasn't too bad, but no bread on our table and salad was extra. Plus they put our tip on the bill, we almost tipped more than necessary. We felt it was overpriced and won't return"}
{"text":"Was coming back from a day in Cleveland and needed some takeout to bring back to the hotel room. Daughter got a ham sandwich on a pretzel bun with fries. I got the Asian salad. Good food for the price. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I am a regular traveler and stay at the hotel.  My review is based on the fact that I sit at the bar and work, can enjoy sports, cocktails, a bite of what I want with the kitchen open until around 11.   Because I am regular I realm enjoy the bar staff.  Al and Matt have my cocktail waiting.  Lots of TVs so you can get the game you are looking for.  Food is ok.  Not high end steakhouse good, but bar/steakhouse good.  I have sampled all if the menu and had a few misses, but, for the most part it is good.  I am good with it being a place to have a cocktail on business.  Beats the lousy parking at Winking Lizard."}
{"text":"Great place to have a steak. Mine was cooked just right as was my sons.Everyone was very pleasant and a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"TGIF food meets ex football coach meets chain dining experience. I had the Milanese chicken. It was served quickly but without flavor. I found the menu to over priced for the food quality. I watched other patrons being served other dishes and none was interesting. It's attached to the hotel where I stayed so at least I drank without worry. I will definitely venture out rather than visit again."}
{"text":"1st visit here .. food was decent .. service was friendly but I would certainly not rush back .. what drew us in this 1st time was a coupon offering a free entree up to 25 dollars .. we both opted for the Times Square strip meal .. simply put, the price point is 25 dollars so we got one totally free in order to maximize our coupon discount .. started w/the fried ravioli .. tasty appetizer .. we both asked for NO MUSHROOMS on the plate w/the steak & were told they are in the sauce so she would gladly tell them no sauce in addition .. the plates came to the table .. sauce was over the asparagus but that seemed acceptable .. began eating & we both discovered mushrooms UNDER our steaks .. very odd .. we simply pushed them aside .. neither of us is allergic .. we just HATE them .. smashed potatoes were good but could have been warmer .. both steaks were cooked to an acceptable medium rare temperature .. if we got another coupon we would consider a repeat trip"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for the Father's day feast and also had my 50th birthday party at this establishment.  We have been treated very well and the food was always very good.  Staff was always friendly and fun.  If you are looking for the posh, stuck-up atmosphere of the \"finer\" steak houses, that's not the intention of Shula's.  If you are looking for an upscale steakhouse with a sports theme, this is your place.  Or if you care most about good food, then an even better reason to dine at Shula's."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here 4 times and had great dinners every time. The wait staff was friendlly and attentive. We had a great time. The steaks were done to perfection. We talked to the chef and the manager also.  We highly recommend it. Their gumbo is also the best, but it's not available every day.  Best to go at dinner during the week for best attention.   We don't drink, so I have NO idea how the bar is.  I joined their email club and got a GREAT coupon for my birthday...ANY entree with the purchase of another. I had the Cowboy ribeye and it was FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! My husband had a cowboy steak it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I had the pecan crust salmon omg so good. Best place in town, I would definitely recommend this place. Great atmosphere, service and food."}
{"text":"Matt & Al are great bartenders!! Beer & Drinks are amazing as well as the food. I highly recommend the Tenderloin Tips!! Melt in your mouth. It is under starters but that paired with a side or salad is a dinner. I will definitely return when I am in town for business."}
{"text":"I was stayed in Doubletree hotel in Cleveland when NBA Fianl was on 2007. They have Shula's Steak House in Hotel, so I was stop by for some dinner and few beer at the same time watching game. Their steak was really mouth watering and melting in mouth. Really good place to eat."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was good. The restaurant itself was kinda \"Low Rent\". I've been to other Schula's locations (Chicago & Florida) and they were much more fancy than the one in Independence."}
{"text":"I've been to this hotel and have had multiple meetings here for work. We had a meeting this week in Shula's private room and once again I wasn't too impressed. I had the dilemma of selecting 2 stars or 3, but ended on 3 since the food I had was decent and the service was good.  Shula's is your typical hotel restaurant and nothing special - overpriced, decent food, and somewhat run down. The restaurant is more of a hotel bar and the menu is fairly basic. They have a lack of healthy options on their appetizer menu, and a majority of their food was fried or fairly unhealthy.   They do have a few good salad options which are decent for lunch time, but again nothing special or out of the ordinary. I'll eat here again if we have another meeting, but wouldn't go out of my way to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"I would give this less than 1 star if I could. They have a bug infestation. Where are the health inspectors??? Ack - don't even think about going here"}
{"text":"Me and my fiance dined there for the first time on Valentine's Day and everything from the service to the food was horrible. Waiter was nonexistent and was not warm or friendly, coffee was cold, wine was rancid, our steaks were overcooked, sides were room temperature at best, and the quality of the steaks was not good at all. The manager came over and we explained why we were not pleased he said he would take half off our bill then gave us a gift card to return. He only took half off the entrees as well. But whatever, at that point we just wanted to get out of there. We had no desire to return. Last night we were driving home from a visit to Columbus and decided to give them another chance and order take out. We ordered the appetizer platter and the bbq burger. We were barely able to eat any of it. The spinach dip tasted very odd, the fried ravioli and boneless wing tasted like it was fried in old oil, and the egg rolls just were not good. The burger was beyond over cooked, we asked for medium and it was a hockey puck! Needless to say we will not return. We gave them two chances and they blew both of them. Also, very overpriced for the quality of the food. Delmonico's right next to the restaurant has comparable prices, great service, and amazing quality. If I want a great meal and experience I know where to go and definitely where not to now."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from a 3-star restaurant in a DoubleTree Hotel, but I was drawn in by a Groupon and left well enough satisfied.   The prices are a bit high for the atmosphere and service. The restaurant could really be occupied by any business owing to the weak decor. There is a light sports bar theme, but overall the atmosphere is pretty cold - literally too.   I'm not sure if the guests were hotel guests or locals, but the bar was busy enough on a Thursday at 7p. The dining room however had no more than 3 occupied tables, mine included.   My food was good. I ordered the twin filet medallions from the Signature Entree section of the menu. These were definitely good and something I would get again. The medallions were covered in a peppercorn sauce. They were served with smashed potatoes that looked like they spent a bit too long under a heat lamp. But the garlic and Parmesan flavor was good. The seasonal veg which was a blend of grilled peppers, zucchini and carrots were good as well.  As I started writing this review I thought the overall 3-star rating was a bit harsh. But now that I've outlined my opinion I must agree. I won't be getting a craving for anything here. Certainly if I want to spend $30+ on dinner I have many more exciting options. Nothing was bad. Nothing was wow. Everything was just A-OK."}
{"text":"Good TVs, nice casual atmosphere, bartender is friendly, but service is slow.  They really should have more than 1 bartender out, since that is where everyone sits.  The food was ok - the steak was cooked to my medium rare temperature, but the quality was WAY off for a $30 steak.  It tasted like a steak from a low end chain.  Plus, there was no Worschestire sauce - all they had was Shula's- which tasted like A1.  Not great.  SO had the tuna, which seemed ok.  Since it was my birthday, the bartender gave me a cheesecake dessert, which I really like!  Who doesn't??  Not sure if I would go back when there are so many other places in the same area, but if you are staying in the hotel, it is a sold choice."}
{"text":"We like Shula's!  We travel, and have eaten at several Shula's around the country. We have been to this one several times. Always guaranteed a good meal. We like sitting at the bar and watching sports on the TV. We often get the special. Fish, steak and burgers are very good. Presentation is nice. Service is always good and friendly at the bar, and table servers are pleasant, too. Check out Happy Hour for reduced brews. A relaxed and happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We made our resevation through Yelp which was quick and easy. That was about the best part of the whole experience.   I started with a mojito martini which was pretty good, not too strong...just how I like it! My boyfriend had a beer...cant really mess that up too much.  We had the calamari fries and boneless wings for appetizers. I would suggest both of these as they were both very good!  For dinner, I ordered the chicken caesar salad and I was NOT a fan. The chicken tasted like it was water logged and there was waaaaaay to much dressing on it. Caeser salads are my favorite so I was pretty dissapointed. My boyfriend had the BBQ burger with fries and he liked it a lot.  The service was just OK. By OK I mean not good and almost bad. We had to ask several times to get water refills and our server was not very tentative to our table at times. There were a couple of times that I felt I was 'bothering' her.   I also noticed that the table next to us had food complaints and through my observation I did see that the staff was good about replacing his food and getting him a new meal.  In reading previous Yelp reviews there was a lot of mentions of TV's everywhere through out the restaurant. There was 1 TV in the dining room and space for another TV that seemed as if a TV was once there but never replaced...hmmm.  We had a Groupon so that is why we decided to try Shula's 2...It is probably safe to say that I will not be back."}
