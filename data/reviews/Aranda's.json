{"text":"This place is awesome! They have such good food and drinks and it's so cheap! The atmosphere is awesome and so is the waitstaff!"}
{"text":"My search for a good Mexican restaurant finally turns up some fruit--right here in DeFo.  My initial impression wasn't great, when we sat down at the (sticky) bar to order a margarita--all of which are pre-mixed.  But we were intrigued by the huge menu, which had a lot if really authentic looking choices.  The BF and I ordered the parillada Mexicana--a veritable sh!t-ton of food, with chicken, pork, beef, chorizo, and shrimp.  Guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, rice, beans, and tortillas come on the side.  With the exception of the shrimp, which were overcooked, the food was delicious.  And we had tons left over for lunch the next day.  The atmosphere is laid back and comfortable, and the staff are friendly.  I foresee many happy returns."}
{"text":"Our experience at Aranda's was excellent. We had the enchiladas Poblanas and also guacamole. Both were great. I grew up in Texas and studied in Mexico. I am used to spicier food. This was milder but still very satisfying. We recently moved to the area and agree that this will become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Yummy crispy chips and flavorful fresh salsa.  Had a delicious mojito and my husband enjoyed his huge margarita.  I had the chili rellenos.  It was very yummy, and a giant portion.  My had tacitos and really like them too."}
{"text":"Just went for lunch.  Ordered a pitcher of margaritas which was really a pitcher of lime drink.
Have had margaritas in the past and they were very good.  I doubt that I will order any in the future."}
{"text":"We were in town from Arizona and in the mood for Mexican food.  We decided to try Aranda's although we expected to be disappointed.  Wow were we wrong.  We love good Mexican food and Aranda's has some of the best we have ever eaten.  My wife had the three chicken enchilada combination.  The chicken was moist and the sauce excellent.  I had a steak and shrimp dish.  It was also great.  If we are in the area we will return."}
{"text":"Our restaurant of choice when dining out in De Forest.  Menu seems more authentic than the typical chain Mexican restaurants.  Service for us has always been very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and very kid friendly.  Outdoor seating is a big plus on summer evenings and the prices are very reasonable.  I'm usually not much of a chips and salsa fan but I can't get enough of it here.  Not a spicy or chunky salsa, but I personally find it delicious."}
{"text":"Very cute place with attentive and friendly service. Great alternative to going downtown. The chips come out warm and are served with spicy and fresh salsa. The food is in line with average Mexican place."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place out me being Mexican and from Cali , I had heard  it was good but!!!!! I don't think I'll be coming back! The Spanish rice was crunchy and it def was not what I expected. Margarita was good but had a wierd taste and disappointed it was a premix."}
{"text":"Glad I found this gem! One of the best chimichangas I have ever had! Not to mention the cute charm of the restaurant and amazing prices! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite place for Mexican in the Madison area (and worth the drive, even from the west side). From a girl who studied abroad in Mexico and is crazy picky about Mexican food, it's a tough designation for me to give. 

The service is always friendly. I could literally drink the salsa--so good. I normally get the chorizo/chicken type fajitas and even the next day as leftovers they're awesome. The rice and beans are just better than average, but really they're just about the same everywhere."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town.  Ranchero steak is fabulous.  Tres Maria's enchiladas also great.  Great chocolate milk.  Margs are strong. Patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great prices! One of my favorites.
Oh and the margaritas are awesome"}
{"text":"This place is fiya!!!! I recommend the pig pot!!!!!!!! The burritos are huge and delicious"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a Mexican restaurant in the Deforest area! That being said there's alot of great Mexican places in the Madison area . The food was ok ,the margaritas tasted like over sweetened warm kool- aid . McFarland has an excellent Mexican restaurant with drinks to match!!"}
{"text":"The food here is authentic Mexican, has a great atmosphere the people here are very nice . I had the chicken enchiladas Verde and the food was  very good. They keep you with a  supply of warm chips and salsa which actually was too much for me but it was  very nice of them to offer .This little establishment is nestled into downtown De forest WI."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food! I enjoyed shrimp quesadillas and my boyfriend had tacos. All of our food was of great value. The place is simple and clean. I would recommend to come back. 

I would not suggest to get the XL margarita...it is 3 drinks in 1!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Went on a Saturday night and had great service.  Food was good, although wasn't crazy about the ground beef burrito.  Beef was a bit mushy texture.  Chicken and steak was great.  Fresh chips and salsa was also great.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Aranda's continues to be one of my favorite places in the DeForest area. The service is always outstanding, and everyone who works there is very friendly.  Their employees always act like they want your business, and that they want you to come back.  

I highly recommend all of their lunch specials.  They're all good, filling, tasty, and a great deal.  They always bring warm chips to the table, and my one small complaint is that their salsa is thin and juicy, and a bit bland.  It would be great if they'd upgrade their salsa with more 'solids,\" or even replace it with something closer to a pico de gallo type salsa.  

I've enjoyed just about every meal there, with good, typical Mexican food at an extremely reasonable price...all backed by great service."}
{"text":"Fast service, good food. Reminds me of La Tolteca on Sun Prairie, same menu looks like (could be same owners? I haven't really check). The menu is huge so you'll sure fine something you like."}
{"text":"Really great Mexican restaurant! Went based off their great Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! I recommend the Pollodel Mar - chicken and shrimp on a sizzling skillet with quest sauce topped with a onion blossom & pico YUM! Bottomless warm chips and salsa as well. Would definitely make this a regular trip!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is by far the best Mexican food you can find in the Madison area. It is one of the few that we keep going back to. The newly remodeled interior is themed and cozy. My fianc√© says they have his favorite salsa in all of The Madison area. Service and food are fast but not rushed. I highly recommend the Burrito Juan (pictured) or the vegetable quesadilla."}
{"text":"Mexican meets DeForest! Expect friendly service, generous-well-priced portions and margaritas for days.

With only a few dining options available in DeForest it's so nice to see something that's not \"all american\" burgers & sandwiches. Lots of Mexican dishes for veg and non-veg eaters. Most combinations come with beans, rice, sour cream and gauc. Unlimited chips and salsa arrive immediately to your table and margaritas aren't far behind. 

Food is what you'd expect at a local Mexican restaurant in the Midwest. It's a bit more on the bland side, but there are a plenty of spicy condiments at the table to \"spice up your life.\" Friendly, quick service combined with plenty of free parking make this a place to catch up with friends or for a weekday date. 

As reviewer Michelle C mentions you really do get a \"shit-ton\" of food here!"}
{"text":"I've always had great food here. We eat here once every other week. The service is always great, the drinks are well made, and the food is delicious. My only complaint is once or twice on a take out order they forgot my tortilla shells. Other than that I've been completely satisfied. Chips are always fresh as well."}
{"text":"Visited for our first time. Fast service and the food was REALLY hot and good!  Best chicken chimichanga I have ever had. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican fare in the Madison area, hands down!  This is a family favorite of ours and we also dine here often with other friends as well.  Great for young kids, lots of TV's, super fast and friendly service, never ending supply of chips and salsa/con queso.  Can't say enough good things about Aranda's.  We've eaten here countless times and plan to continue into the future."}
{"text":"Sadly, I am rating this lower than I normally would simply because of service. My boys and I checked this out on a whim last Friday night. It was about half full when we walked in. All of the booths were taken, but there were plenty of tables in the middle. They seemed to have been set for larger groups of people and I was fine with waiting for a booth to be available. However, we were the first to walk in and wait in line. At least four families walked in after us and were seated first. I finally asked and they sat us, so I'm not sure what was up with that. It wasn't a pleasant experience, but with how busy it was I understand the chaos. 

The chips and salsa were good. The salsa bowl is massive so I don't think you have to worry about running out of it! We also ordered guacamole which my son gobbled up in a hurry. 

One of my boys ordered the kids cheese quesadilla. It was just as you'd expect...tortilla and cheese. He loved it. My other son decided to order mac n cheese...at a Mexican restaurant. I'm pretty sure it was boxed, but what should have we expected? My kid was the weird one ordering mac at a Mexican restaurant. Ha. 

I ordered the veggie quesadilla. It was really good even my kids liked it. We will be back. It was definitely the best Mexican restaurant we have had in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to eat a family lunch on the weekends. Food was very tasty and a wide enough menu for some very different tastes. Cast and very friendly service. Table was clean and the servers don't hover as you eat manufacturing a tip. A little weird that the bathroom is shared with other building tenants and in a back common hallway but not so weird that we won't be back. Great price, i have a family of four, with two hungry boys and the meals were less than $30 for all of us. Great food for a very good price."}
{"text":"Middle of Wisconsin, craving Mexican. Did not have high expectations. This place completely pleasantly surprised us! Soft chicken taco was full of flavor, chips were hot and fresh, salsa as perfect as salsa can be. Try it! Try it I say! You should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, prices were very good, large portions and great fajitas.  The steak was much better than the chicken. Chips and salsa were fresh but the salsa was a bit bland so  needed to add hot sauce to the salsa for more flavor and heat. They have 4 different hot sauces to add to the meal but they were overflowing and dripping down the bottles...need to be cleaned and wiped down between customers - that's the reason they're not 5 stars.  Nevertheless would return for the steak fajitas."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Chicken Fajitas and Carnitas both were fantastic. Fajitas for one could probably be split between two but I finished it off... Yum. Fresh warm chips and salsa great as well. Certainly seems very authentic. Big menu with lots of other tempting items as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican restaurant! I have frequented here for a few years now, and it is one of the best restaurants in De Forest. The Taquito's Mexicanos and the Flautas are phenomenal, and I rarely wait for more than 15 minutes for food. Great service, and fantastic food make Arandas a place I am proud to have in my home town"}
{"text":"Stopped while traveling on vacation. Food was delicious! Service was excellent! Fountain pop tasted watered down. Nice little place to eat in a nice area. Would recommend and would stop again if traveling through."}
{"text":"The place looks great and feels like a Mexican restaurant should. The beer mug was ice cold and the plate our food was served on was hot, unfortunately  the food was not. I don't know how this could happen but both my partner and I had different things and they were just warm at best. We didn't make a fuss rather than send everything back we just ate it. There was a language barrier with our server so it would have been hard to explain what was wrong anyway. They do serve chips and a very good salsa with the meals and if the food would have been the right temperature would probably been very good. As it was it was hard to give it high marks. We would probably go back and try again and be more assertive if the food was not hot enough. Others who eat here seem to like the food so we just had the wrong day. Someone in the kitchen wasn't  paying attention I guess. Not good for new customers."}
{"text":"Aranda's is pretty spectacular. I'm not sure if it's a blessing or a curse that they're located in DeForest, because on the one hand the restaurant is a bit out of the way to attract people coming from Madison or Sun Prairie, but on the other hand DeForest's small town nature easily lets Aranda's stand out as a great restaurant. 

The salsa to start you out is superb - a perfect balance of cilantro and spice. I am also a huge fan of the Mojitos here! I love the drink's appearance in the glass mug with sugared rim, but what really makes them excellent is that the mint flavor is stronger than the lime, making it less acidic and, in my opinion, more refreshing.

I ordered the Cristoval's Special and my bf had the carnitas and we were both extremely happy with our meals. 

I say that Aranda's is worth going out of your way."}
{"text":"Great food, great margaritas!!
Service is super quick too. BUT...There's been a couple times where I've had bones from the shredded chicken.
Other then that it's been good!"}
{"text":"Stopped for an early dinner.  What really stood out was the service was awesome!  Our waitress was 100% right on the money.  She stopped by at exactly the right times and knew exactly what was needed.  The food was better than expected - we shared flautas and chimichangas.  And not to get too graphic, but a lot of times mexican foods leaves me a little odiferous later on, but I saw no ill effects this time.  The warm chips were tasty.  5 Stars Aranda's - we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and great people! The staff are always friendly and prompt with their service. The food is piping hot. I am huge fan of their salads, although many are probably not going to Aranda's for salad since the tacos, burritos, and enchiladas are also amazing. Don't miss out on the margaritas either. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. The staff gets a little frazzled sometimes when it gets packed, and the service could be better. But the food is great, and that's what you're there for anyway. Try the Arroz con Pollo and cheese dip!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how great the staff is at this family owned restaurant. I've never been so well taken care of. I only stopped for drinks but will definitely come back for food. The margaritas/coronaritas are fantastic. The chips are fresh made and the queso is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Got the burritos verde. Tasted very good. However I asked for no sour cream and the waitress even repeated it back to me but they put it in it. The service was fast and they checked up on us a couple of times so that's good. Prices were reasonable. Salsa and chips were fresh and I liked how the salsa wasn't super chunky but I would have liked it to be a bit spicier. Will probably go back sometime."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've never had a bad meal here and I'm totally willing to drive 30 min to eat here at least once a month. So far its one of the best places to get my Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food.  Definitely beats driving down to Taqueria Guadalajara and fighting for a parking space and waiting for an available table to open up.  Warm tortilla chips are a nice extra touch.  Restaurant is clean and spacious.  Staff is friendly and relaxed."}
{"text":"This place is legit. The chili verde is really good. The pork has a nice crisp on it, just make sure to ask for corn tortillas if you want them. Apparently folks in Wisconsin must want flour. The large margarita is really big so heads up. My kids enjoyed their smiley fries and American food (eye roll). Will be back for sure. I usually try different stuff every time I go somewhere but this pork was so good, I may stick with it."}
{"text":"Had the chicken quesadilla.  It was served fast and delicious.  The strawberry margaritas was good.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. I spent 25 years in a Mexican community and it's the most traditional Mexican food I've found in this area. Large portions and delicious. And many vegetarian options. And if it's not on the menu, they make it happen."}
{"text":"Great good, great ambience, great staff. You can tell cleanliness is a priority for Aranda's. We ordered   the molcajete, Aranda'a Rib-Eye Special, and caldo de pollo; just great!  The guacamole and salas (both hot and mild) were fantastic with chips. This has been my best experience at a Mexican restaurant in Wisconsin (and I know my food)."}
{"text":"We are from Texas visiting Wisconsin and decided to try this place based on Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. The food was very comparable to the TexMex we have at home. The chips and salsa were also very good. If we are ever back we will visit again!"}
{"text":"We got pretty bad service. We spent a total of two hours there and were only eating for 15 minutes, tops. The margarita was gross. The food was pretty standard Americanized Mexican food. I'm not really sure why this place has such good reviews. I'd try again, but this was my second go at it. Meh. Just, meh."}
{"text":"Great food, plentiful portions, and quick, courteous service make this hidden gem in De Forest worth seeking out. 

Whether composed with steak, pork, seafood, or simply vegetables, we've been generally impressed with the tacos, fajitas, burritos, and more. However, the chile relleno was a bit disappointing. The margaritas are good and the prices are very reasonable. 

Aranda's consistently serves a better plate of food over the closer offerings in Sun Prairie and on the east side of Madison, and does so with a great atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"We had the Lindo's special and the Special Dinner. Both excellent.  Very fresh and tasted homemade. Service was great restaurant was clean!  Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"This IS excellent!  Warm chips and good salsa!  Helpful server who gave us direction with a new menu. Large portions of tasty food!  We will be back!  Attention to detail!"}
{"text":"This was a nice quiet place to come in and have a late lunch.  Portions were excellent and prices very reasonable.  They really rate 4.5 stars but I won't round down from 5 star ratings.  They served my chicken quesadilla with no guacamole, sour cream, or pico de gallo.  What gives?  Otherwise this was a good place that I'd definitely come back to."}
{"text":"Love this local restaurant... we walk, we drive, very convenient! GOOD food,  great friendly employees... fun place to gather"}
{"text":"Cinco De Mayo Redemption!

The food was awesome! The service was back on top! The server was great; he got refills on chips and drinks quickly! The Shrimp a la Diabla was spicy and awesome! My wife loved her chicken chimichunga! My sister-in-law loved her quesadilla and queso cheese dip! And the margaritas were huge and hit the spot! This visit was five stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican restaurants are hard to find. More often than not the good is bland and leaves a lot to be desired.  

Not with Aranda's.   The food is amazing.  I had the Mondays special which was a massive chorizo and pulled pork burrito covered in verde sauce.  It was amazing!  Very flavorful.  I wish I lived close to this place.  

The service was good, the beer was cold, and the prices were right.  

This is a 5 plus star establishment.   If you're in the area stop by. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Mexican restaurant I have EVER been to! From the amazing margaritas to the best tacos and burritos ever! The owners are amazing people who work hard for everything ! I'm glad I'm within walking distance from my most favorite restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"Big fan for Mexican at this price, especially in a local eatery. I've tried a whole bunch of different items on the menu, and my wife usually has chicken. It has been good every time. Love the chips and salsa. Love their variety of hot sauces. Love that I can walk there from my office. Very good food all around!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service, very very economical and fair price for big portion of food. All of my friends and I were really happy for choosing this restaurant after a long day trip."}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times but this was the first time posting.  Have never had a bad meal yet and keep trying different items off the menu.  Even the soup is delicious."}
{"text":"We came to Aranda's because it was close by and because of the rating. We were visiting from the west coast and we were not sure how good Wisconsin/Mex food would be. We were not disappointed. The food was great. We were there for lunch and the service was very fast. Great selection of bottled hot sauces. The salsa was ok, but I like a little more heat than others. The portions were large. I brought some of my lunch home in a box."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Had the Carnitas which I get whenever I find them. These were among the best I have had anywhere. Great service. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Who knew that I would have to travel to De Forest WI in order to have the best fajitas I have ever tasted? I was traveling through for work and saw this place had good reviews and was close to my hotel. Soooo glad I came, the fajitas were on point with the best caramelized onions and peppers I have ever had! Will for sure come back next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area from Texas (with a lot of Mexican and Tex-Mex food) and stopped by this location on my way to Wausau from the Madison airport while on business. Decided to come here because it was on the way and was during lunch time...after reading good reviews on Yelp. The place definitely has a hole-in-the-wall feel to it...it was very enjoyable.

It was around 2 pm when I stopped by today (Sunday), and I was the only person in the restaurant. The waitress was very attentitive and helpful. I started with a cup of queso w/chorizo It was pretty good...a little to watery for my personal preference, but pretty good flavor nonetheless. I ordered Aranda's Special with steak and shrimp. It came with 3 flour tortillas, sour cream cheese, guacamole, pico, beans, rice. The food was very good and authentic. Very glad I stopped by!"}
{"text":"Aranda's is DELISH!! Me and my husband's favorite place for some awesome Mexican food! The owner and all of their waiters and waitresses are so down to earth! Everyone is alway eager to serve you! Our favorite waiter is Fabian! The margaritas, mojitos, and of course beer is wonderful! They have a huge menu and literally everything we have tried is good! My faves are the shimp tacos, burritos verdes, and burrito croqueta! YUM! You always get fresh, crispy chips and salsa! They have a very good white queso dip too and of course guac! In the summer we love to sit outside too!  Awesome place, awesome staff! They also own La Tolteca in Portage and Sun Prairie!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The building was clean and decorated well. The staff were wonderful, specifically with our son. We plan on being regulars."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and definitely won't be my last. The food is delicious, service wonderful and friendly. What a gem to have in such a small community."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to for a great meal. Great food and service is very efficient. A lot of food for what they charge. Recommend it for family gathering."}
{"text":"Off the chain! Real Mexican deliciousness, authentic food, warm atmosphere and great margaritas"}
{"text":"Update: 10/13/17 -  we haven't been here for a while but they have expanded! More seating means less waiting!!! It looks great inside with new furniture and a lot more seating. 

Wow... incredible food. The chips and salsa were pretty average but they give you A LOT!

When we arrived, we were the second to be seated.  We waited a while to get water and for the waitress to take out order. They were completely packed. A sign of a good restaurant. 

My boyfriend ordered the chimichangas which he enjoyed. I asked for a recommendation between the   Enchiladas Lemon Lime and the Enchiladas Verdes. Our waitress recommended the Enchiladas Lemon Lime saying the drilled chicken is really good. 

After ordering, the food came pretty quickly. And boy was she right! The grilled chicken was tender and juicy and had a great flavor. There was also a cheese sauce on top of the enchiladas which was AMAZING! So amazing that it's making me drool just thinking about it. With a name that includes lemon and lime, the dish was not sour. My boyfriend ended up finishing my dish. Unfortunately for me, my tummy isn't a huge fan of cream. I ate a wee too many bites of the oh-so-yummy, creamy dish. 

When the waitress came back asking how things were, she mentioned I could get the enchiladas with the cream sauce on the side. She also brought me a to go menu and suggested trying the Swiss Enchiladas without the Swiss cheese. It's definitely piqued my interest. 

We will definitely be going back! So excited to have found a good, no, GREAT restaurant."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences of my life horrible service got brought the wrong food twice had to ask three times for things was completely ignored all this and we were one of the only groups there"}
{"text":"We discovered this place while on a bike ride. It's has good food and margaritas! It's nice to have some variety in this small town."}
{"text":"Food was not very good ordered tocos and was not satisfied had no flavor what so ever"}
{"text":"Great place, good food. The service was very slow, but we seemed to hit a peak time (5pm?)"}
