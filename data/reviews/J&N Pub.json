{"text":"They serve Cevaps which is great for Oakville - otherwise it's a drive to Mrakovic in Etobicoke or Golden Flame in Hamilton.......that said,  they aren't prepared properly on the \"lepinja\" as they should be so I won't be going back unless I'm lazy to drive elsewhere. hopefully they do it right in the future."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  Good food. Good prices. Good portions. Good service! Best part is the food is actually made in house! No cookie cutting here! I will be a loyal customer for years to come. My only complaint is the dessert menu. Its weak and lacking chocolate.  The decor is blah. But the food is what i come for. :)"}
{"text":"I live in the area and would really like to say this is a great establishment but the three times I've visited so far have been very disappointing.  During the three visits the issues ranged from flat beer and confusing service to raw chicken wings.  The worst was trying the spaghetti and meatballs.  No sauce, and meatballs visibly burnt on one side.  When I sent it back, no replacement food was offered and they still charged us for the plate.  I'll try the location again when someone else moves in."}
{"text":"Used to come here when it was house of wings for UFC fights and 2 4 1 wings.    New owner who is WAY better than the old owner (who actually makes sure you're enjoying yourself, has a personality and isn't a KGB dictator!)  ,  bringing in open Mic and live music , home made eastern European cuisine specials.   No more fight nights, and hasn't made any decorative changes.   It's been pretty quiet the few times I've been in,  but in fairness were at odd hours.  Good watering hole if you live near by,  but not my top choice"}
{"text":"Wow this is one sad looking neighbourhood bar. It looked like a a mix of old run down bars mixed together. Maybe got a deal on some repo stuff? The menu looked like the 70's flashback with cherry cheesecake to finish off your fried everything. We ordered calamari and some beer. After the undercooked frozen appetizer we didn't venture any further. Don't be sucked into the only 5 star rating. Be warned it sucks"}
{"text":"This place is so welcoming and warm. And the food is great (had the beef stroganoff)!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this bar. The \"manager\" discriminates against people with mental illness. Please, please, please educate yourself. Send these ignorant people at this bar a message and steer clear of their establishment."}
{"text":"I went in to check this place out about two weeks ago and it was pretty brand new. The owner said they had been open for about three weeks. There was still a bit of renovation to happen, with regards to the seating, but other than that it was great.  I had a half rack of ribs with fries and the ribs were surprisingly good, they even had a bit of spice to them, which was nice. Now for the fries. As I've mentioned in other reviews I can be picky about fries and the fries here were... GREAT! I was so pleased. You can tell that they're hand cut and fresh, non of this frozen-fry nonsense. The two people I was with both enjoyed their meals. One had fish and chips and the other a burger. Both of these people can have a lot of criticism towards food, but we all were really happy with our meals.  They have a daily special and they can be pretty good, so it's worth checking out there menu. I have a feeling that this may become a regular spot for me, it really was that good."}
