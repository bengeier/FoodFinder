{"text":"Getting a seafood pancake for $9.99 is a pretty good deal, especially because it's the same size as seafood pancakes many Korean restaurants in the area sell for like $16-$18. That being said, it could also be better. 

Pros:

Half of the pancake was crispy, or well, most of the edge parts of that side were.
There was a decent amount of octopus in there.
There was a lot of green onion.
The price was good.
If you ask them, they'll give you roasted grain/barley tea. 


Cons:
Half of the pancake wasn't crispy. It was slightly thick at parts, and that was chewy and not particularly pleasant. I'm not sure how they sent out a pancake that was that uneven looking in color, but okay.
I think octopus was the only kind of seafood in the pancake. That being said, the amount of octopus in there did kinda make up for the lack of other seafood. I'm not sure why they couldn't just call it an octopus pancake.
The green onions were in really big pieces. I like green onion, but I don't like to bite into just green onion.

I wouldn't crave the pancake here, but I wouldn't mind ordering it again."}
{"text":"Went to the food court at Galleria to grab some food after work. I have ate in this food court quite a few times before. Seems like this store location has changed hands. Not 100% sure, but I think it wasn't called Jin Mee before. Anyway, we bought the beef short ribs broth and the seafood Tofu Soup. Both of them was disappointing in terms of the meat we received. The beef one only gives us three small pieces of meat. Any other korean restaurant I goes too will have at least twice the amount. And the seafood tofu soup is like all tofu plus one shrimp and a few small pieces of seafood. Ridiculous. Will never go back to this store. There are so many selection within the block."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Korean Pork Bone Soup and a Korean co-worker recommended this place, not too far from our workplace. It's located in the food court of Galleria Supermarket. The pictures of the other dishes on their menu looked tempting but I decided to stick with my original thought and craving.

It was still literally boiling in the bowl when I picked it up from the counter and I had to wait a while for it to cool down before tasting it. It looked good. Mmm, it tasted good too. The broth was very flavourful and the meat was fall off the bone tender. It was accompanied by a bowl of purple rice, kimchi, and a couple of other condiments.

While I can't say it's the best pork bone soup I've ever had, it was tasty and filled the void quite well. I might try a different dish next time. Yes, next time..."}
{"text":"Since the change in ownership, quality and quantity have gone down while prices have increased across the board.

Gave them about 5 tries before giving up on them.

Their takeout kimchi stew is less than half of what used to be provided while increasing the price. I've uploaded a photo with a business card beside it for scale.

Many Korean options in this neighborhood (or even food court)."}
{"text":"Located in the food court of Galleria Supermarket Jin Mee specialises in Korean Hot Pot dishes.  Found myself in the area and decided to grab a bite in the food court.   My Korean food expertise is limited to Kalbi, Bulgogi and Pork Bone Soup so tried the #0 Combo which was the Marinated Pork Ribs in Hot Pot.  

When they mean \"Hot Pot\" they really mean \"Hot Pot\"!  Not spicy hot but temperature hot!  The pork ribs literally comes out boiling in the broth so give it a few minutes to cool down a bit or you'll scald your mouth in it!  

Its actually not bad at all as the marinated pork ribs are in a spicy sweet mix with rice rolls and bean sprouts.  The combo comes with purple rice and 3 sides (Kimchi, Sweet Potatoes, Daikon Radish).  All for $9.99 plus tax.  

Service was polite and took about 5 minutes or so to get the food.  Its not the best Korean food I've had, but it's a good value for money in the food court."}
{"text":"Jin Mee is a good place for lunch if you work around the Yonge/Steeles area. It is inside the food court in the Galleria supermarket.

I can't say much about other dishes, because my default go-to is the pork bone soup, which they do a pretty decent job on.

A year or so back before their store name changed, the pork bone soup is of variable quality. One of the big no-no's for pork bone soup is the pork not being tender and there have been some not so good ones there. 

Ever since they have changed to \"Jin Mee\", I find their pork bone soup to be quite consistently good (tender and flavourful). Can't go wrong with that for under $10!

There is no ambience to speak of, being in a food court and all. So I would recommend going there alone for a quick lunch only."}
{"text":"Affordable Korean food served at Thornhill Galleria Supermarket Food court. Cannot expect the quality is as high as the regular restaurant, yet the portion is generous and quality is decent. 

My family favourite is always the Beef Soup with rice. This version is not the milky color and rich beef bone soup. They give you sea salt that you can adjust the saltiness on your preference. 

The rice cake soup is nicely done as well. Portion is generous with rice cake and some beef in eggy broth. 

Beef bulgogi has big portion but a little dry. Wish they would put more sauce on it."}
{"text":"Was doing some shopping at Galleria when the hunger bug hit.  I saw a smallish food court with a good spread.  I was tempted for kfc ( korean fried chicken) but the 30 minute wait was a little too much.  Saw the selection of food offerings and was pulled in by the smell. I tried the pork bone soup and their version is a much cleaner broth with good flavor accompanied by wild rice.  The food is good and very fairly priced."}
{"text":"Foodcourt stall selling Korean dishes in Galleria grocery store.  Picture menus hanged overhead with English names and prices of different dishes.
I ordered Pork Bone Stew and waited in the foodcourt for my order number to be called out.  That took around 5 minutes.  For $7.99, the meal consisted of pork bone stew; purple rice, and 3 side dishes.  The stew was spicy, but didn't have the myriad layers of flavors found at other restaurants.  $7.99 was an ok price, though i have seen cheaper with unlimited tea, which this place did not offer."}
