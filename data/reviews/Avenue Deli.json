{"text":"I had my reservations when the dark haired girl at the counter looked me up and down and walked away. After she charged me $22 for soup and a sandwich. After pointing out the discrepancy I was met with a blank look of indifference. After searching for recent lobotomy scars and finding none, I surmised that she just couldn't muster any sort of customer service etiquette. The other girl made our sandwich without so much as asking us what kind of bread we wanted. However, the food was tasty but waaay overpriced"}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered the large Reuben .
The sandwich was loaded with smoked meat but the sauerkraut was not fully drained and left the bread soggy. The smoked meat was okay but seemed like the flavour was washed out.
They do not have a fryer so there are no fries or poutine just a side order of potatoe chips.
My wife ordered the full smoke meat sandwich which was loaded but with too much mustard. 
Overall if you are craving for smoke meat sandwich this place would do in a pinch"}
{"text":"If you've driven down 33rd avenue, I'm sure you've seen this deli. It's hard to ignore the store with the words \"Montreal Smoked Meat\" printed in bold in the windows.  I've driven past this deli so many times thinking to myself \"I have to go there\".  I finally went today and I must say that it didn't really impress me.  I had imagined more of a Montreal \"Schwartz\"-esque  experience but it turned out to be more of \"safeway deli meat\"-esque disappointment.  
Let's start with the positives.  The service was pretty exceptional.  My meal came out to $10.50 and I only had a $10 and $20 bill and so the guy at the counter hooked me up with 50 cents.  How often does that happen?  I actually also like their menu.  The primary focus of this place is the montreal smoked meat.  The simplicity and the focus on smkoed meat was appealing.
I opted once again for the basic.  For me, trying out the most basic item on the menu is the easiest way to figure out how their kitchen is.  So I ordered the traditional montreal smoked meat on rye with mustard.   It was pretty neat to see that there were a variety of mustards you could order.  I fact, if what they were trying to sell was mustard, then they're doing a pretty good job.  Anyways, seeing that this place really prided itself on montreal smoked meat, I mistakingly thought that I'd be getting a sandwich filled with smoked meat marbled with fat and flavored in a subtle saltiness that made you ignore the grease dripping down the side of your chin.  I was a bit disappointed to get smoked meat that reminded me of the pre-sliced stuff you get in the vacupaks beside the deli in the supermarket.  The meat was salty and it just didn't seem like it was all that to rave about.  I felt like I could make a sandwich like this at home with a microwave, a jar of mustard, two slices of rye and a few slices of montreal smoked meat from the Safeway deli.  Mucho disappointed..."}
{"text":"(this was written by my boyfriend)

In the Marda Loop area 2 stores beside El's Fusion is a Deli I've always walked by after dining at El's and always wondered if it was any good. 

Went there on a beautiful Easter Sunday and decided to give it a try with the girlfriend. Now, the place is known for it's smoked montreal meat sandwiches and it's real milkshakes, so that's exactly what we ordered.

There is the traditional montreal smoked meat on rye bread with chips, coleslaw, and a pickle, or you can get the \"Reuben\", which has added Polish Sauerkraut and Gouda Cheese. It's also grilled too so it's warmer and toastier. I gave the traditional a try and the girlfriend had the Reuben. If you haven't had Montreal smoked meat sandwiches before, then be advised that you should definitely like mustard or it won't appeal much to you. You're given 5 choices of mustard (Frenchs, Dijon, Horseradish, Spicy Honey, some kinda pepper one, and a House which is a combination of them all). We also ordered an Apple Pie milkshake and a Cremesicle one which is orange/cream flavored. Those were apparently the two best.

Tasting:

First of all, I have to say the milkshakes tasted amazing! I saw the guy make it and it didn't look that special at all but it was delicious. The apple pie milkshake was simply tropicana apple juice with cinnamon for flavorings and the cremesicle was tropicana orange juice. The only downfall was that it no where as thick as you would find at Peters or Fatburger. The shakes are also bigger if you dine in because they're served in the metal tins used to make the milkshakes. As for the sandwiches, the meat was sliced very thin and the House mustard had a great flavor with everything. However, I do somewhat like horseradish so you'd probably be better off with a different mustard choice if you're not. I would definitely go with the grilled (Reuben) because the cheese and the toasty bread make the sandwich much more appetizing.

Service:

The guy serving us looked like a teenie-bopper but he certainly knew what he was talking about and provided us great service. He really had a passion in his job which is hard to find these days for his age. 

2 shakes, 2 sandwiches ~$35.00

They also have other sandwiches with turkey, smoked salmon, and soups which we may try another time. I enjoyed my visit this time around though.

Value: 3/5
Food: 4/5 [Gotta like the mustard though!]
Service: 4/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"I think this might be the best Montreal Smoked Meat in Calgary.  It is called a \"deli\", but this is a bit of a misnomer as they mostly do sandwiches, and of the sandwiches they mostly do smoked meat - they also have great shakes.

I usually get the Ruben, it is made with what appears to be quality ingredients.  You get a choice of how many ounces you would like for the meat (6, 8 or 10) and the type of mustard (apparently homemade, but somehow i doubt this).  Inside and outdoors, seating is very limited.  Prices are a bit high in my mind.

if you are in the marda loop area, dining choices are not limited so IMHO, visit other places first, unless ofcourse you need a smoked meat sandwich"}
{"text":"This visit was our first visit after wanting to visit for awhile. The montreal smoked is absolutely delicious! Tender and warm. We got ours to go and they boxed it up so nicely!! It was awesome!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some delicious smoked meat! The prices aren't that cheap, but it's totally worth it since the quality is awesome!!"}
{"text":"this is the place to go for a smoked meat sandwich.  so many options for mustard type, I went with Honey Spice and my mouth created a lot of drool.  it comes with potato chips, a pickle, and some coleslaw.  The Hero is the sandwich.  enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really great sandwiches and milkshakes, great staff, cute location/atmosphere.
It is a little pricey, but I think the quality of food is good!
I had the Reuben sandwich which was delicious, and quite large for a \"small\". More than enough food with the sides.

Would recommend, would (will) go again!"}
{"text":"I mostly strongly dislike going to a place for a meal and not having table service.   To get food here - you must stand and order ... then take it yourself on a little stupid tray to your table.  Not my thing.

My wife went to school in Montreal ... and loves this style of Delhi.

I'd never go without her ... and try to avoid doing even that.

If you like Deli's ... I think this is probably fine.

... but ... maybe I would like going to a deli ... if the staff was way crazy passionate about the thing ... the smoked meat ... or the crispy chips.

Meh - I think this spot is just A-ok.
You can eat here."}
{"text":"an okay sandwich at this place, NOT A DELI..  nothing compared to king of subs in terms of price and quality.  like myers and grumana this is for the hipster to pay extra for the working class meal.  name is misleafing if you think you are going to get meata and cheese here you are mistaken"}
{"text":"Ate at Avenue Deli this afternoon.  I was really excited to have a Montreal Smoke Meat sandwich.  The staff was really friendly.    Service was great.  The restaurant needed a cleaning.  

The smoke meat was disappointing.  It was tender and moist but had little to no flavor.  Coleslaw was good and the pickle great."}
{"text":"I had a great experience for my first visit at Avenue Deli. Wasn't quite sure what to expect when I walked in as I don't eat red meat, but there were several options for me to choose from (having to decline ingredients on one or two). 

I had the roasted turkey (sans ham) and my friend had the chicken pesto. Both sandwiches (well, I had mine in a pita) were delicious. The chips were an interesting side - but it's cute that you get a choice as to what flavour. I very much enjoyed the coleslaw as well, although it was a little salty. I'm a fan of when coleslaw isn't overly creamy/saucy and this one fit the bill.

The restaurant is small, so I could imagine that takeout would be the only option during busier times. We happened by mid-afternoon so it was nice and quiet at the time. Also enjoyed being able to have a latte with my sandwich (coffee lovers unite).

The milkshakes were tempting but I resisted.

All in all, I'll probably drop by again."}
{"text":"I've come here many times. Really good sandwiches. One thing taking it down a notch is now having experienced a real Montreal smoked meat sandwich from Schwartz in Montreal. They got it figured out there. Oh well. When in cowtown you have to improvise right?"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here on a number of occasions. The service has always been great. The staff is very friendly.  The sandwiches are always good and piled high with meat. I'm a fan of the chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Related to Mrythe's Deli on 11th St SW, they serve the same smoked meat as their sister resto.  But that's where the similarities in menu ends, as they chose to serve the ever-popular Nathan's hot dogs instead of Montreal steamés, and what I believe to be 2 or 3 different soups from scratch.  Also, more like a diner than a deli, they also offer different sandwiches and milkshakes, but no poutine or fries.  Good place for a meal overall, though it's ok for smoked meat when compared to Kickers and especially La Belle Patate.  Definately worth a meal or two on a lazy day if you don't have a car to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place positively surprised me with the classic sandwich!! It was delicious!! Sooooo tasty and the mustard was amazing!! The size was perfect for me! And the prices reasonable... The place It's not fancy but I would definitely go back, as he sandwich was really good ... The only reason to have 4 stars and not 5 is because The service was just ok... Not very friendly.. But I would still go back for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"This ordinary deli is located in Marda Loop on the corner of 33rd Avenue and 19th Street SW.

Its primary focus is sandwiches.  They have a couple of different sandwiches to choose from, a couple based around lox.  There are a few of sandwiches, as well as breakfast bagels, the are associated with lox.  This sucks for me because I'm not the hugest fan of lox.  I prefer a veggie option or plain ham or beef.  There are a couple of those sandwiches too, so other lox-unlovers don't stress.  They have a newly instated breakfast-to-go menu, which is nice for people on the run.  However, it's not the largest menu I've seen.

I purchased a vanilla latte from Avenue Deli, which took some time to make.  I could forgive this if it were a littler busier in the place, but I was the only customer.  I waited in the store for close to 4 minutes before finally receiving my beverage.  Upon arrival, my drink tasted a little bitter.  I'm not sure why, but my guess would be that the espresso sat too long before being mixed with my milk.

It's a cute little shop with some nice people working the place.  My favourite quirk about the place was the giant jar of Double-Bubble gum they had sitting by the counter.  It was a help yourself kind of deal, but I only felt comfortable taking two.  

Avenue Deli wasn't my favourite shop, but it served its purpose none-the-less.  If I'm in the Marda Loop area and in dire need of a sandwich, I might go back.  Otherwise, I won't go out of my way to visit this deli."}
