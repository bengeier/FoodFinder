{"text":"On the whole, am rating this 3/5.  The food itself was fantastic.  The Laffa, meats and hummus outstanding. As good or better than its main competition.   It loses points for disorganization (hopefully this will work itself out).    Standing in line to place order (Tov Li style) is remarkably inefficient.  Seating limited, no waiters, which seemed necessary for this type of establishment. No kids menu, which would have been nice.  Kids have to share a regular menu item, which may be no problem for some, but having a kids menu is convenient for when there are 3 kids and sharing is a challenge.   They forgot to include the salad which was included in the meat platter.  Despite bringing to their attention, it never came.  Portion sizes adequate, price point a little high but not exorbitant.  In all, will return because the quality of the food trumps the negatives, which hopefully will be resolved in time."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from some online community. I live downtown so for me the trip up north for some good humus was something special.   So here are my review:   The Good: 1. Very clean and spacious  2. Lafa (the bread) is very tasty and highly recommended.  3. The servings arrived very fast  The Bad: 1. Humus - total disappointment. For somebody who knows how good humus is supposed to taste this is a disgrace. I tasted better humus in a supermarket in Toronto and I lived in the middle east for 20+ years. This humus feels like a paste with very industrial taste. No sure if they are preparing it on the spot even.  2. Matbucha Salad - total joke. It felt like tomato rague, no spices just plane tomatoes and some strange paste.The price is unbelievable - 5$+tax for very small salad plate.  So so:  Falafel - not that bad, but I tasted better in Toronto. The price again is outrageous -3$ for 3 falafel balls.   In conclusion: For Canadians who never lived/visited the middle east it will suit. But again many Lebanon locations provide very similar experience - why drive that far.   For people who know how it should taste it will be a total disappointment."}
{"text":"What better way to spend a warm summer night.   Eating outside at Saluf was a perfect choice.   We ordered the hummus & shawarma plate and Saluf fries. The food was freshly made and beautifully presented.  Their hummus is the best I've had. The staff was very attentive making sure we had enough freshly baked laffa to go with our dinner. I can't wait to return to try the laffa sandwich and other dishes."}
{"text":"Went with my friend Raoul and our kids. Loved the food, service, and ambience. Very clean and affordable. Staff was very fast and   friendly. Great salads, falafels, soup. I'm a veggie so didn't try the meat. A great find in the middle of an industrial area. Go figure... but it really really works. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"As a former Israeli who misses the Israeli Hummus so much, I have tried many places around the GTA to look for the old good taste. I finally found it. In Saluf. The wonderful taste of home."}
{"text":"I love the food, amazing service and great environment.  I've been there twice and have been happy both times.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really good hummous, very unique. Order the hummous with warm chickpeas, you won't be disappointed. tell them to start you off with two laffahs."}
{"text":"Hearty humus, Luscious Laffas, Smily service. This place is solid."}
{"text":"If you crave for good Humus you must visit this new place. The taste is amazing as the humus is done daily from natural material only and does not include oils and other fat. Very healthy too. For a start order a plain humus and enjoy its taste with freshly baked laffa. Overall 5 for the Humus. The rest of the food is good and fresh (4) but as it is Kosher meat the price is about 10% higher from non kosher places. Closed on Saturday. Better to call to check if the place is open."}
{"text":"Saluf, you had me at hummus.  As a self proclaimed hummus helper, I headed in with high hopes. The open concept design w/ sky high ceilings was inviting. Think neighbourly coffee shop meets rustic cottage, something that looks like it would belong in a hipster street downtown. Unfortunately, the food did not quite step up to the plate.  What we got:  Hummus with chicken ($9.99)- I'm quite biased as a hummus helper, because I don't think you can ever have bad hummus. With that in mind, I have to say this was one of the more bland ones I've tried. Protip: you can ask for two extra laffahs at no charge.  Chicken shawarma w/ laffah ($9.99)- Coworker got this. He was not impressed. Also thought it was a bit lacking in flavour. Protip #2: If you're on the hunt for shawarma, it should be noted that Nina's Shawarma a few blocks down offers a cheaper option ($4.99) with more options for toppings.  Basically, a decent place to lunch if you work in the area (especially if you care about how nice your lunch spot looks, you don't have many other options in this industrial area), but nothing to drive out of the way for."}
{"text":"I go to Saluf for lunch at least 1 to 2 times a week, I love their food, its fresh, clean and always good.  My favourite is their Falafel, it is as good as it gets. Friendly service and Kosher too (if you care)"}
{"text":"Located in the industrial area of Vaughan, its business probably focuses on the lunch hours for offices nearby and weddings/event. But I was amazed with the beautiful open space inside of the restaurant. Hummus is a must try. Huge portions and very friendly!"}
{"text":"I write this review fully knowing that its completely opposite from what has already been written on this place.  My biggest issue with Saluf is that the food wasn't exactly revolutionary there. I mean the laffas are small and fluffy (which is great for dipping into Hummus) and easy to manage which was great but for a place that prides itself on the \"Hummus Place\", I found it bland and OK if anything. I mean yeah I could have eaten a whole thing of it and not noticed it before I was done, but I was missing that craving 2 hours later that would cause me to go back in the end.  I ordered a Schnitzel in a laffa and wasn't too impressed with the whole thing either. the Schnitzel was hard to find in the laffa and it wasn't packed tight enough that the whole thing kind of fell apart upon eating.   It's kind of interesting over all. If you compare the 3 big Kosher Shawarma places in Toronto, they all kind of fall in different extremes of the spectrum where Saluf falls in the lacking of flavour and Ba-Li Laffa falls in the opposite of having WAY too much. Dr. Laffa is still great and falls right in the middle of it for me.  I'd still say check it out for your own sake. I mean this place just opened. So there are bound to be kinks along the way. I just wasn't too impressed so far."}
{"text":"This place is nicely designed and super clean! Very modern!  The food is delicious as well!  I found this place because I like to have a healthy lunch while I'm on the road (I'm a Sales Rep) and this was the perfect solution in a sea of Italian restaurants.  The staff was very friendly and I enjoyed that they serve your table but you don't feel like you have to spend an extended lunch there.  This place is perfect for those who are on the go during the day but still want a nice restaurant experience."}
{"text":"I love the rustic set up and the spacious interior of Saluf.   Shawarma ($14.99) with Garden Salad and Rice - Chicken was well seasoned and tasty, portion is quite good - A hit with the toddlers in our group as the two year old could not get enough of the rice  Hummus+ Tahini ($9.99) - I am not the fan of the hummus, it tasted bland with no seasoning maybe it is the healthy version? and I was quite disappointed - with 3 adults and 2 kids, we were given 1 small piece of Laffa to start. I have to chase after them for more.   \"Juice\" drink ($2.50) and LemonNana ($2.99) are kind of pricey. Maybe should have drink a Black Malt ($2.50)  Service is good when the \"owner\" is around. He came to our table and checked on us a few times.   I am in no rush to come back to Saluf for their hummus but I had a sample of their Falafel mini balls, which was quite amazing!"}
