{"text":"Quick update to my inital review - I would rank this place a 3, maybe 3.5, based on my past few visits.  I've ordered from here a 3-4 times since my initial review and the food quality is either top notch or a bit \"iffy\" - I'm guessing depending on who is cooking.   My last batch of Pad Thai was pretty rank - which is leading me to check out alternatives in and around the area."}
{"text":"This place has now been replaced by \"Thai Delicious\"  Have tried the Pad Thai Lunch special and will say that it was very good.  Hot and our soup was excellent.  I am now encouraged that we have a decent Thai restaurant in Whitby.    Will try the dinner delivery and follow-up with a review"}
{"text":"Food is ok. I have certainly had better Thai food. My major issue is that this place is really expensive. I have no problem paying for quality but it's just not there. Salads are really oily and main plates are over fried. Not going back."}
