{"text":"These savages forgot the tzatziki sauce on a delivery order for a gyro platter.  How dare you what am I some kind of animal? For shame"}
{"text":"Walked In walked out.  Stopped by this place as I've heard people from east coast rave about the food ( name recognition ) . 
Was very excited to try it out . 
Upon arrival I noticed how dirty the seating sections were . 
The food ( tomatoes ) did not look fresh and u could tell they had been cut at the very least 1 maybe 2 days in advance. 
The gyro meat bin where they keep the meat after it's been cut and sitting to be served had almost no meat in it and what little meat there was had been sitting in a pool of oil . 
The energy of the staff was very low , I interpreted this as they could care less bout quality and cleanliness . Just there to collect a check. 
Sorry I will not be Dining here as the lack of care to food and cleanliness come through . 
The saving grace for this Resturant will be the location (heavy traffic ) and name recognition . 
Such a poor example of this type of food."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I was underwhelmed after all the hype. The white sauce is basically garlic sauce mixed with salad dressing, the food is decent but nothing special, and it's on the more expensive side compared to other shawarma places. Not really in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Tres bon service, rapide. Super bon poulet et gyro, ils devraient juste revoir leurs portions de viande par rapport au riz et ca serai parfait"}
{"text":"I have no idea why the staff here works so slowly. They work in slow motion. Even when there are so many people waiting. Must be a technique to get the line so long."}
{"text":"What's the deal it's overhyped! I have high expectations but nothing special ! It's a good try but I'm not coming back"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing experience.   Spent 45 minutes in line to get takeout, and was ultimately not provided with any sauce whatsoever.  The chicken was dry and completely without flavour.  The gyro was a bit better but not in the least memorable.  The portion sizes were also small compared to similar places.  

I was excited to try this place given the hype, but honestly, much better food can be found elsewhere across the city."}
{"text":"Went here during the soft opening and the food and service was excellent! Can't go wrong with the chicken & gyro combo with extra white sauce. This will be my new go-to spot when I'm especially hungry while on campus!"}
{"text":"Minus the street food experience of New York,  the food was good. I had a combo plate, beef and chicken. Portion size was large. The staff was friendly and fast service. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch with a friend on a late sunday afternoon and there wasn't a big line. I got the chicken platter and my friend ordered the chicken combo platter. I haven't had such worse food in a while. The chicken tasted awful, the pita was stale and the lettuce wasn't fresh at all. I  am not very picky with food, but this was the worst experience I have had so far eating middle eastern food here in the valley. My friend had the same view and we both were extremely disappointed with the food. Lucky to have not fallen sick after the meal. Definitely not coming back again."}
{"text":"Best gyro platter I'm town! From NY and I've been to halal guys many many times. Same great taste n so happy they are here! Easy on the red sauce cuz it's really hot. Been there 5x since they opened just a few weeks ago. Thinking bout their food is making me crave it right now! Go get you some too!"}
{"text":"At first when I went (3-4 months ago) their portions were great. Now there's way more salad and their amazing meat is less to see in their plates. It's definitely a place to try, and a new taste compared to all the other repetitive Arab food stores nearby. Overall great service. Their larger plate is very hard to finish; if it's your first time try the smaller one. Jalape√±os add a great taste to the plate too."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Once you run out of the hot sauce you're basically left with a meal you can find at any cheap Greek place for half the price. The white sauce is bland. Way overrated."}
{"text":"Almost 10 years ago when I went to NYC, I remember being amazed that there was a halal cart on nearly every street corner. Unlike here in Toronto, back then we would have to go to a local Canadian Tire for street food. Although I've never tried 53rd & 6th, or any other location of The Halal Guys before, I did try the competing carts. The first chicken over rice with white sauce I had was so good that I had it nearly everyday that I was there. It was that addicting. I can't say the same with The Halal Guys TO.

I was in the area a few hours ago so I stopped by to get a regular combo (chicken & gyro) platter to go. I found it to be just ok. They were cooked well and I didn't find it dry. What really made it was the white sauce as it goes well with it. I also preferred the chicken over the gyro since the gyro had the taste that you would get tired of eating after 2 bites.

The portion was small and it was overpriced for the value that you get. I wouldn't go out of your way to go here as the food is ok at best."}
{"text":"Generous portions, good food and great value for the money! Highly recommended! I got the chicken wrap and it was filled with juicy delicious chicken! Their white sauce is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great gyros and chicken! Great food and great prices! You can't beat what you get for the price. 

The white sauce is great! Always ask for extra! Now the red sauce or the hot sauce is very very hot! It is tasty but be careful it is HOT! Now understand I can take heat and this stuff is very hot!"}
{"text":"Yes, I am an addict of gyro and halal food..that is the only reason I believe I gave Halal Guys of Montreal couple more try. I believe its their service, amount and etc you get depends on who serves...

If I get one with extra meat I can enjoy their food on lunch and leftover for dinner ($18CAD). If I get 2 regular for me and my better half for lunch, then just me for dinner.

Quality of their food gotten lot better over time. Minus 1 star for price."}
{"text":"Had to try this place as I am a regular at Boustan and shwarmaz. Ended up waiting in line for about 30 min which was expected as it was the second day after opening. 

I order a chicken and gyro wrap, a gyro wrap and a large chicken and gyro platter to feed 2.

Unfortunately I have to say the wraps were really a hit or miss, for $7 a wrap you would expect a pretty stuffed wrap.. Wrong I got about 1/4 of meat as expected and a whole lot of salad. Portions were very inconsistent, however the taste of the gyro meat was decent. Stick to the platters and hold off from the spicy sauce!

I'll have to stick to my shawarma special or boustan creation for a few months until the halal guys get their stuff right."}
{"text":"Gyro plate is delicious and not on the heavy side. Beware of the hot sauce though, it's extremely hot!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to relive my memorable NYC experience of a few years ago. Sadly, I was extremely underwhelmed and disappointed that they don't live up to my memories.

I ordered the regular sized gyro and my boyfriend ordered the combo plate which has gyro and chicken. The plate comes with more rice and salad than meat, and some stale pieces of pita bread. The meat was tasty, but a tad on the dry side. They give you that white sauce, and a smattering of hot sauce. But neither of those were enough to add moisture to the meal. I remember the white sauce being so amazing in NYC, that someone stole a whole bottle of it right off the food cart when I ate there.

The place was packed, and the air conditioning was on full blast. My meal got cold about halfway through, due to the extreme temperature. For the price they are charging, I was expecting a mountain of meat, but I finished it all before all the rice and salad was the bulk of the plate. Iceberg lettuce and tomatoes does not a salad make.

No offense to the franchise, but the NYC food cart experience is unparalleled."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very simple menu but great bowls that I'd go as far to say is the tastiest I've had in AZ. Great serving size and fast prep. I did a combo of the white sauce and bbq- perfect together. I did light sauce since they tend to put a lot on (I think most people would prefer more but I'm more health conscious). Most of the excess calories and sugars come from that white sauce (but it is super yummy). I actually think the bowl without pita and light sauce is a healthy athletic option- good quality calories in a good blend of protein, carbs and fat.  EXCEPT: I wish they made the white sauce with better ingredients- if they used olive oil instead of nutritionally poor oils, I'd eat it way more often (I avoid bad fats as much as I can). 
Definitely still 5 stars and a big plus that they are open pretty late. Phoenix area just doesn't have much in the way of variety in late night food. Cheers"}
{"text":"Okay so 

Food was 3/5
Its good but not in any definition special, but then again they market it based on their legendary popular name so that gets our hopes up, no?
So, don't be afraid to give it a try. It's quite decent except for the pita/flat bread thingy smells like plastic and a tad too soggy, but that's minor considering this is a fast food place.

Food portion 3/5 
They need to balance out the amount of lettuce n rice, mine didn't come with nearly enough rice.

Service 4/5 
Quick n courteous, just need to be a bit more clear of the procedure in the sauce section.

Packaging 0/5
My lid was loose ( I told them Togo) so use your best imagination to picture my lunch.

Price: Not cheap, but Arizona experience 25% minimum wage increase in January 2017, not their fault. 

So I probably need to comeback in a few months to give them another try once they work on the kinks."}
{"text":"Dissapointed. Ive seen images of the food on their insta page & looked amazing. I was sad to see how overpriced it was & food tasted blah, no seasoning on the chicken or meat. I was looking forward to this place & it let me down."}
{"text":"If you've never had Halal Guys before, the food is good and filling. The white sauce is delicious and the hot sauce is super spicy. Bought the regular sized mixed meal for $14 (after tax). The reason why it's only 3/5 is because I've had the original in NY. Comparing the two, the NY one is $6 (no tax but in USD) and is packed almost overflowing with food, while the one in Toronto is carefully scooped to have only a specific amount (which is a fair amount less than the one in NY has). I also miss the original lamb/beef mix but now it's just beef, which isn't as tasty."}
{"text":"Well where do I begin! This is not halal. They have no lamb and the food is tasteless! Being from the east coast I feel I have a vast experience with Islamic food! This fast food Islamic type of food they claim to be was so utterly disappointing! I really wouldn't waste your time!! Also, the kids they have working for them unfortunately don't have enough experience to even speak loud enough so you can hear them. I guess I have to go to ny if I want great halal!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Halal guys the first time at the beginning of the summer in July. Wow, the flavor was amazing. My wife and I split a large combo plate of chicken and beef and ordered a side of falafel. We flew in that morning without eating breakfast so we were both pretty hungry and that platter and side filled us up, all for under $20. We loved the white sauce (I'm more of a sauce guy than my wife, so I loaded it on) and their hot sauce is very hot! I like spicy but a few drops is even pretty spicy. I preferred the beef over the chicken but my wife liked both equally and I still thought  the chicken was pretty good. The falafel were fresh and hot and very good as well. We got the platter loaded( onions, olives, and jalapenos.) The kalamata olives are excellent so I would recommend them if you like olives. The only thing I wish the platter had more was the pita bread since there was so much food and I like to make a little sandwich with the pita. The next time we ordered the exact same thing but with an extra side of pita. 

The first trip (five days) we went to halal guys twice and we made another trip two weeks later and made sure we hit halal guys again. I wanted to try the dessert but each time I was too full to  try them. We went during lunch time each time and they were not super crowded. The service was excellent and pretty speedy. I feel the value of the meals was awesome especially since it is pretty close to the strip where everything is overpriced anyway. I know on our future trips to Las Vegas we will definitely hit Halal guys."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. 
Got a gyro in a bowl and while not great it was good and I would have again. Gyro was beef not lamb. Next time will need to order double meat as regular is only ok amount in my opinion. 
If I want a true gyro I would go elsewhere but for a good solid linch I would get this easily."}
{"text":"The chicken platter taste good, however the beef is so so. They raised their prices, but with a local discount is fine. The servers are all very nuce Nd not stingy so I would definitely come back for that!


Skip the baklava its too nutty that it is bitter  and i expect it to be sweet but there was a bitter aftertaste."}
{"text":"First time here with co-workers, received enlightenment that the hot sauce was too spicy so I decided to try it anyways because I like spicy, the sauce was a little bit spicy so I just got jalape√±os instead. The sandwich was great and fresh! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Ok to good Food...but the lineups are long and you may have to end up waiting an hour almost on busy days."}
{"text":"I have a stomach ache as I'm writing this from the food I bought at this place. The food was absolutely disgusting. I was really hungry so I ate it anyways - bad decision."}
{"text":"Halal Guys has so much hype and it is all well deserved! I went for lunch an had the Gyro+Chicken Platter combo which comes with delicious orange-coloured rice. I asked for diced tomatoes and asked them to not include lettuce. The sauce they put is the main attraction. They have 3 options: hot sauce, white special sauce and bbq sauce. I got the whit and bbq sauce they put on top of the food. Wow was it amazing. It cost me with fountain drink around 13$. Their menu is so simplistic and i enjoyed the seating environment, it's very casual. On top of all the food halal. Quality is high and I will definitely come back. I am a believer. I hope they maintain the quality and service for years to come. Much success and hope they open another location in Scarborough. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just got back in town from Manhattan where I ate at the original Halal Guys street vendor's stand. I had to try our local spot for comparison. 

This place would get 5 stars if they seasoned the meat a lot more and were a little more generous with the size of the pita wedges. Also, the pita bread in Manhattan is served hot with a crisp bottom and soft top. Here it is served as narrow, all around doughy wedges. Everything else (aside from the price) is the same. 

It's ethnic food, go heavy on the seasoning guys! If you don't need to swish with listerine afterward, you're not doing it right! People love the original for a reason."}
{"text":"Just like the food from the Halal cart on 53rd and 6th Ave (Avenue of the Americas) in Midtown NY.  A little more expensive here and the portions smaller, but way cheaper than flying to NY!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY so was very excited to come here.   The place is a well run machine,  always a line up (about a 5 minute wait on a Saturday) but the workers are great, have everything down, and are super quick. Very impressed since it has only been open a few weeks.  The workers were super nice and it was a great feel. 

For me it's some of the best in the GTA.  That damn sauce,  you can't beat Halal guys' sauce.  I had the falafel, it was very good...and again you can't beat the sauce.  But everything is super fresh,  very good rice.  Even the left overs tasted fresh that I had. 

So happy to see the Halal guys in Canada,  had an amazing first experience,  go go go go!"}
{"text":"For some reason i remember this place so much better in NYC.  Also they went through 40 orders in NYC in about 30 mins where like 30 ppl took an hour to go through in Toronto.  Food is still pretty good and you get a decent plate for like 13 bucks.  Wouldnt go back again though if I had to wait more than 10 mins.  Not that muchbbetter than other places in Toronto to yam."}
{"text":"The service was fast, the staff were very friendly. They offered us free baklava with Yelp check in. Gyro platter was delicious but beware, the hot sauce is extremely hot! Overall, a clean and nice place for a quick delicious bite."}
{"text":"Firstly, parking, if you drive here from a far place like I did you want cheap parking, the street right next to this restaurant had decent priced parking 2.50 for half hour, you won't find cheaper. Next, I think this restaurant is a bit boosted due to the American locations, it was alright it wasn't the best shawarma type meal I had, you could find better this food was average. Prices are okay not too expensive, average considering plate pricing for shawarma, 3.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for friendly staff and clean environment. Which is why I averaged it at 4. I think they could have fresher vegetables and the food could be hotter then it was. Other then that it was an alright experience."}
{"text":"Great food for game night at home watching the Steelers.  Love the combo platters and Baklava."}
{"text":"As much as I really appreciate the food and sauce of the halal guys but it's really disappointing to learn that they are completely OVERPRICED! 

While in New York, it only costs usd $7 but with full platter, loads of meat and rice... here in toronto, it costs $12.95 with hst , plus it's only half of the portions compared to the New York original store. They are rather petty with its meat (and even rice).

Don't think they are going to last if they don't adjust the portions."}
{"text":"Service was slow because they were understaffed today. But the workers that were there were working as fast as they can and remained friendly and professional. Kudos to employees who can maintain good customer service despite the lack of resources and support! 

Food is always delicious here. My first time having their hummus and it is AMAZING. I want to order a whole jar of that stuff!"}
{"text":"Great Egyptian/Arabic food
The food tastes great & fresh 
I had the Chicken & Gyros (Big)  plate  13.29$ you can also have a small plate for 10.99$
It was fresh came with salad, Rice & white sauce ( tahini sauce) Plz Try the spicy sauce (really hot) if you like spicy you will love it. 

I will go back for sure"}
{"text":"I tried one at NYC, it's WAAAAYYY BETTER than this one. 

The portion is so little for the price. The meat was dry and the rice is so greasy.

One thing that I hate the most is their service. not sure because it's new, the line is moving really slow. The people who are working on the line are not paying attention to what customer said, so we have to say it 2-3 times and it yet still wrong."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about. Place is mediocre. Came here during dinner time, not busy at all. Order the combo platter and hubby ordered the gyro sandwich. My combo platter was very bland, had to add a ton of white sauce to make it somewhat edible. The meat was super dry, more like dehydrated meat and the rice was hard no flavor. I have to say pictures look better then it taste. Don't be fooled!"}
{"text":"Never posted before but felt like I needed to post about this restaurant. Save you're money, Boustan & Shawarmaz just down the street with authentic sandwiches that taste amazing. But I guess since it's a NYC joint people are excited about this place. Overpriced with no flavour. Nothing authentic about this place. Oh and no garlic sauce?!? And their spicy sauce is too spicy"}
{"text":"Halal for life. Still not as good as the original but the employees here are nicer."}
{"text":"I love the food from this place!!:))
However... I have to say, the portion is too small compared to the ones in NY. I understand the CA$ + the rent would increase the price, but I really wished they'd put more rice instead of the lettuce.

I also wished they warned me about the extra charge for the sauce. I ordered to have the sauce on the side (just like how they do in NY!) and realized later that they charge $1/packet for the sauce. If I knew, I would've just had them put the sauce on my plate in store:("}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend, as a famous place from New York.   To be honest, I was not only disappointed but suffered hugely from their red sauce.  When I arrived, I noticed a group of four people eating their meal.  I asked them if the food was good. One gentlemen, whose face was reddened by the heat of the red sauce, said. food is good, but do not go near red sauce.  
I ordered combo.  I like spicy hot food and chillies,  and have taken such food all my life.  So I decided to try the hot red sauce, which was labelled such.  It did not have a label, extremely hot sauce or some other label indicating the extent of heat of sauce.   

Heading to the warning earlier on by their customer,  I took, two small drops of the red sauce on one leaf of lettuce.   Upon intake of the lettuce leaf with two drops of red sauce,  I immediately,  started to choke, started coughing, eyes started to water.   

I quickly took some water and food to neutralize this extreme physiologic response to red sauce,  but situation died down only 10%.

I was very uncomfortable throughout the meal,  infact I was coughing for upto 25 minutes after the meal.

 THIS RED SAUCE SHOULD BE LABELLED EXTREMELY HOT SAUCE, USE WITH CAUTION.  Please do not  think of it as the standard red sauce one gets in restaurant. 

Rest of food.  White sauce - great sauce.  Chicken - not great.  Beef - great.  Service - average. Cleanliness -  average.  

This is a small place, seating limited, only four table, with four chairs in each table,  barely any space to move.  Tight space.  Also,  customers could be within a few inches of your table,  while in line for food. I do not like people standing in line, almost touching the table table,  while I am partaking meal.

I am hard pressed to give a rating of two stars and this is because servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Finally this placed opened after months of driving by and seeing no activity!

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the food. I have had Halal Guys numerous times on my trips to manhattan and was thrilled when i heard it was going to open up shop in T.O. but in the end the food turned out to be so-so. To me, it didnt have quite the same taste as NYC. The portions were smaller than what i used to get in NYC (skimpy on the orange glowing rice and the meat as well as I had the combo platter). The white sauce and hot sauce were as great as usual though. The rice seemed a little under cooked as it was firmer than i liked.
It was decent but for the pricing they charge ($9.99 for a small and $12.65 for a regular) there are better options elsewhere in the city. I may give it another try here but I will still seek them out whenever I hit NYC though.

TIP: I went around 2pm and there were only a couple of people in line in case you want to avoid the line ups."}
{"text":"This is literally some of the worst food I've had in Toronto, hands down. The chicken was tasteless, they have no toppings and the 'famous white sauce' was also pretty bland. Will never go back here, it's all hype. So many better options for middle eastern in this city."}
{"text":"Not as good as the NYC food truck, but good enough for me to remember the city with every bite. Love those food portions (y)"}
{"text":"Worst Gyro ever.....just please put the name NYC away....has nothing to do with food cart on 6th Av....you guys close at 4:30 and the meat was pilling up on the grill....it's like you serving dogs....what a shame."}
{"text":"These have been popping up everywhere in So Cal but the lines were always way too long to try.  I accidentally ran into this location while looking for something else.  I'm glad that I saw it because it was exactly what I needed.  I got the combo and it tasted great.  Be warned, the hot sauce is crazy spicy.  The kick is real!  I do well with spicy food but I prefer to go a little mild with this dish.  The hot sauce takes all the flavor away from the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good. One of the better I have tasted in the Tempe area. Not quite up to par with flaming kabob, Phoenicia or hummus Express but I imagine it's good drunk college food at 2 am."}
{"text":"Wish this could be better. I love Mediterranean, but this simply isn't my cup of tea. Basically, you have the option of getting  beef gyros or chicken (leg meat) either in a platter (you make a salad out of it-lettuce, tomatoes, rice) or a sandwich. Hummus is offered as a side. But it's pricey. Portions are decent sized though. 

As for their vaunted sauces, the red sauce is literally fire (and figuratively too lol), but the \"white sauce\"? I was expecting a decent garlic sauce, or maybe a tzatziki. It's mayo based, which may be great for some folks, but I find the concept disgusting. I went straight with the red. 

The hummus gets a solid 3* too. Not too bad, but not memorable either. It's pretty sad when the best hummus in Vegas is probably at Sababa, which is an Israeli place, and their's is maybe 3.5*. 

But this is typical dining in local LV. You're in a shopping center with 6 restaurants, the arguably best one got shut down last year for almost 100 health code violations, a decent pho place, and soso Izakaya one, and of course, the de rigeur massage parlor. 

If they're going to blow up my Instagram for a month solid before opening, I expect better. Now I do admit to being a snob, and I try to be fair, but this was still a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but the workers are amazingly friendly and funny. The best service hands down from any food chain. Jhonnie was very helpful and generous about the menu options and suggestions! Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"The Halal Guys. What can I say? Wow.
Went here for the grand opening festivities. They were giving out free Falafels for the people waiting in line while the employees came out and chatted with us. Overall, it was a pretty cool atmosphere.
The food though. I've been to the original one in New York and the newer one that opened up in Los Angeles and I can see with certainty that this one is pretty much on point. Food was fresh and delicious, restaurant was clean and tidy, and the service was amazing. Oh yeah, speaking of service, the manager there (I believe she was the manager. If she isn't, promote her), Stephanie, is an amazing individual. She goes out of her way to take care of customers and make them happy. 
10/10 would come again. FUEGO."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. One of the most tasteless gyro wraps I have ever eaten. The meat was dry and there was way more lettuce than there should have been. Lastly, their white sauce is nothing special."}
{"text":"Friendly service! I got the combo platter (half chicken, half gyro) for about $9-something, and it was a great portion of food. The meat itself was somewhat dry, but the white sauce saves it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to go to the hot new restaurant in town and when we got there we had to wait an hour just to get in the door. Yes it was opening day but in a chipotle style restaurant you expect them  to be fast. We were still excited to try it though because we had heard such good things about it and were very disappointed with the food. The white sauce was just mayonaise and they put a ton on and the hot sauce was very good but they put way too much on. The lack of pita bread was quite sad, they give you 3 little peices in their largest meal size and you really need it with food like that. I wont be going back soon anytime soon even with my half off a gyro coupon."}
{"text":"I've tried the combo, falafel platter, and baklava and loved them all. Really big portions so each plate was enough for two meals for me and the $1 extra to get the large is worth it. Ordering is Chipotle style so it goes by really fast. Come in with no expectations and you'll enjoy your meal more.
Don't be shy with the white sauce because each packet is only 60 calories! 
I've been craving Halal Guys often so will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went on their grand opening day as I have been anticipating their arrival for a couple of years.  Like the first time I had it in NYC, it did not disappoint, absolutely loved the combo platter I got!! Customer service was awesome, food was amazing, so glad The Halal Guys are finally here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The place is easy to find if you're familiar with Chinatown in Vegas. I arrived and it wasn't busy at all. The people there seem to be a bit friendly. A lot of side chatter (obviously not work related) while ordering my food. I ordered a Gyro Regular platter. It was good. The lettuce was fresh and had a crunch to it. The white sauce is awesome and the red sauce is INSANELY hot but it was great. However, my Gyro meat was sitting in a nice amount of oil because it was the left overs and had to be drained a little bit and they hadn't put out the fresh made. Hopefully next time this isn't the same result..."}
{"text":"The ordering line starts right at the door - so if there is a small line up you will have to push through people to get in line.  A single plate of either chicken or beef is almost 14$ with tax - 2-3 dollars higher than Boustan or Basha's.

The plate comes with a rice, lettuce and chicken or beef. The is completely tastless. There is absolutely no flavour to the chicken. They load it up with white sauce - so you end up eating a mixture of sauce with tasteless chicken and rice - it was disgusting. 

I rarely ever throw away food - but I took a few bites and threw away the rest. I felt sick to my stomach. 

I word of advice to the owners who are reading this. Do yourself a favour and have the original halal guys from New York come visit your place and verify every step of the your cooking. There is something wrong with your food - it is disgusting."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for my Mediterranean food. I love getting their combination platter. They always give me an extra bit of rice since I don't eat their sliced tomatoes (I feel that tomatoes that are pre-sliced get soggy/lose their flavor so fast and then become bland). They always try to make their food as fresh as possible, which is why I don't mind waiting a few minutes for fresh chicken or beef. It's also a nice perk to get a small discount as well for being a local who buys pretty regularly.  Always enjoyable.  Also,  if you like baklava, their baklava is pretty  good according to the bf. Happy eating! :9"}
{"text":"Great food and short wait.  I'd prefer if there were more meat considering the price, but all things considered, it tasted great!  Ordered the Combo platter and would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"After all of the hype, I went in with high expectations. Sadly, I walked away disappointed. The food was bland. The special white sauce was not special at all. The service was good, quick and friendly, but that didn't make up for the lackluster food. Bummer."}
{"text":"You get a choice of sandwich or small / regular platter, chicken / beef or combo. I picked the regular, beef platter, with a fountain drink, came to $16.36. While you do get a lot of food, Overall it was too salty / greasy for my taste."}
{"text":"Cheap meat, under seasoned, white sauce is in a packet - not fresh. Heed this warning, save yourself!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Saudi Arabia, Shawarma is sacred for me. And so when I heard about Halal Guys coming to Toronto in the form of an actual restaurant, I was overjoyed. However, my experience at this shawarma place was the worst I have ever had in Toronto! The chicken was bland and felt undercooked, the bread for the sandwich was yeasty and soggy and the white sauce was watered down to the point of being bland as well! The hot sauce was distrubingly hot and the taste was nothing like any middle eastern place. With just lettuce and tomatoes as veggie options with the meat it was an insult to the delicious and well known Middle Eastern dish called 'Shawarma'. Shawarma lovers should stay away from this place at all cost!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Halal Guys and love this new branch on St Denise! It's spacious and clean, and the staff are very friendly and accommodating! Waiting for the Halal guys to open in Ville St Laurent where I'm certain they'll be a great success!"}
{"text":"A Taste of New York in Montreal! I had the gyro and chicken plate with salad, their signature orange rice, fluffy bread and the amazing white sauce! I loved everything, the meats were tender and juicy and portions were huge, I couldn't finish my regular size plate! The Halal Guys is a must try and definitely worth the long line which move very quickly and efficiently! Staff are very nice and helpful! Only negative thing I can mention in hopes it will improve is the messy dining area and service station where the sauces and cutlery are...it was very messy, sticky and in disarray! Also I wish they would provide small containers to put extra sauce in  instead of taking the whole bottle to the table while others are waiting for it!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The new management doesn't seem to care about the staff or customers. Nobody is friendly or recognizes repeat customers.  Most if not all of the former crew and staff from when they opened are gone and now nobody really knows what they are doing. 

The one shining star at night is Alex the only person I recognized as being there a while. He deserves a promotion at least he knows the way this brand works."}
{"text":"Had the combo chicken platter.  The taste lived up to its expectations hence the 2 stars!. New York still wins hands down on so many levels (larger serving, free for extra white sauce to go, and way faster service)
My friend ordered a small combo platter and I ordered a regular size, yet the meat portion was the same!
Fountain drinks were flat and watered down!
Disappointing overall experience. If you're coming from new york and comparing the two, prepare to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Generic, low-quality, fast-food. Gyro plate was bland and very salty. Generic and tasteless rice with iceberg lettuce salad. The Famous white sauce tasted like mayo. Hummus/Garlic sauce, potatoes (actually french fries) included for extra, no taboul√©! Horrible place compared to Boustan or Basha. Very disappointed after all the talk about it. I have yet to try the original location in NYC."}
{"text":"Quick, clean & delicious! I will definitely be coming here at least once a week  (P.S. Hot sauce is REALLY hot. Like fire in your mouth and other end hot.)"}
{"text":"I've had the halal NYC experience and these guys are a disgrace! They not only skimp on chicken and rice but \"fill up\" the box with an unreal amount of salad - we're not paying for lettuce and tomatoes buddy! Secondly, they are rude and think way too much of themselves! Clearly not coming back here and sticking to my earlier choices in tempe!"}
{"text":"Was excited because I moved here from New York and loved the original Halal Guys. Unhappy to report that it's not the same.

Firstly they give you far less meat than they do in New York. Charge me more if you need to but don't be stingy. 

Then they ask for extra money for a packet of hot sauce while allowing you to help yourself to as much hot sauce as you want from a bottle. 

Franchise businesses are not for everyone."}
{"text":"10/10 Would eat again. 
Had the Chicken/Gyro plate (Large)
Chicken - was a bit dry.
Gyros - perfect.
Rice - Nice, but could've gave me more
Pita - Nice.
Sauce - Good
Hot Sauce - Hot"}
{"text":"the worst shawrma I've ever had... It's better for them to close their resturant.
I went yesterday with my husband ... we were hungry(didn't eat breakfast) and we wanted to eat our lunch. we ordered the shawerma plate combo. 
bad chicken
so bad rice
semi-good french fries
the salad is just lettuce and if you want to add onion and/or green bell pepper

the one star for the cocacola that I took it cold from the refrigerator not of course for the food

so bad don't waste your time and for sure your money"}
{"text":"Saw that there was a lot of hype surrounding the new restaurant opening up so my friends and I decided to try it out. There wasn't a long line when we arrived so we got out food quickly.  Sadly the food DID not match the hype.  The rice like mentioned in another review was sort of stuff. I ordered the regular chicken gyro combo but half the tin was literally lettuce. Considering that you'd be paying $13 there should be more rice than lettuce.  anyways,  the gyro was comparable to the pizza sausage from Pizza Pizza and the chicken was standard. The white sauce was sort of plain like salad dressing.  You're better off going to Villa Madina, or Ali baba and even Jimmy the greek whose gyro tastes much better. The redeeming part of the meal was the spicy sauce. I would not come again but it was nice to try."}
{"text":"This is a prime example of why we should not be deluded by social media craze. The line that span the block, the buzz from my contemporaries, and the streams of unmistakable yellow bags all lead me into a trap. What I got was a $14 mess of flimsy lettuce, that comprised of 1/3 of my platter. Mushy, over salty gyros drenched in their 'signature' white sauce that resembles white glue. The service was quick and efficient, and for that I added an extra star. A nauseating experience."}
{"text":"We were so excited to eat here, waited in line for about 30 minutes. It was so packed, so as soon as a table was free, we sat our kids down and proceeded to check out. As soon as we paid, the manager told us that we couldn't do that next time.  Table reservations are NOT ALLOWED!! Unfortunately, his comments ruined our appetite and became uncomfortable after being scolded for reserving our spot! Not worth it!"}
{"text":"Review in a couple of words: It was fine

Went here for lunch as I work just up the road and a couple of friends had been mentioning that it was open and they raved about the NYC location.

Got the small combo platter ($9.99 + tax) which came with \"salad\" (tomato and lettuce), rice, chicken and beef gyro. I got the white sauce and hot sauce too. 

The hot sauce was hot! I'm okay with hot sauces so I liked it but I know a lot of people wouldn't be able to handle it so order with caution! It definitely has a kick which caught me off guard on my first bite! The white sauce was great but again, pretty similar to other \"white\" sauces you get at gyro/shawarma places.

As for the meal as a whole, it was good, nothing mind-blowing. It is probably a little expensive compared to other similar establishments around the city. I might try it again in a few weeks, or maybe next time I've had a few beers as I can imagine this being great drunk food.

I've read some reviews about people lining up for this for 30 minutes!? I would not line up for this..."}
{"text":"Well i have been to the NY street halaal guys and the tempe version tasted very different. 
It wasn't bad, however the white sauce tasted different ( tasted like just  mayo and ranch). NY one is much much different and yummy!. Also, tempe location do not have lamb, just chicken and beef. Hot sauce is thicker and hotter than NY version which is not necessarily a bad thing. 

Overall, it was good but don't go in with the expectation that itll be like NY."}
{"text":"Halal Guys may be great by New York City standards but in Toronto where the shawarma and middle eastern food game is quite intense and advanced, Halal Guys food is mediocre at best. See below for details...

- chicken is relatively unseasoned
- gyro (beef) meat was good but it's so cooked that it tastes like crispy meat bits vs meat itself (if that makes sense...)
- the only way to get any taste is to overdose on the tahini and white sauce which quite frankly defeats the purpose of the seasoned meat and rice
- rice was good (cardamom flavour)
- their hummus is average at best (nothing compared to Paramount)
- extremely limited menu
- hot sauce will give u an ulcer ... It's just way too hot! 

With some major Toronto based shawarma joints serving really good meats (kabobs and shawarma), sauces (garlic and tahini), drinks (non-alcoholic beer, juices and smoothies) AND proprietary/unique breads (I.e Me Va Me's Laffa bread and Paramount's stone baked unlimited bread), halal guys is too basic for Toronto's advanced tastes... 

They have the hype, but they need to expand their menus and make their core offerings irresistible.. hope they get better, I most probably won't go back till they do."}
{"text":"Got the combo platter. Meat, rice and iceberg lettuce - awful, bland and dry. Ordered a falafel on the side. Was $1 for one tiny piece. Do yourself a flavor and skip this!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Halal Guys was at their home base in NYC and while their franchise isn't *exactly* the same as ordering fresh of the cart, it is still delicious and makes me feel like I have a piece of home nearby! Their white sauce is exactly the same, and so is their hot sauce (beware putting too much on your food if you're not a hot sauce lover, it will numb your lips lol). This place is very busy so expect a line as well, and if they are out of something- try a meat you wouldn't usually have, it's all delicious. Rice is perfect, salad is refreshing, and they have extra sauce you can grab from the back if you need more. Check it out while you're in phoenix!"}
{"text":"Wondered what all the fuss (read: line-ups) were about - today, there was none so decided to give it try. Glad I didn't wait on line! Beef gyros sandwich: generous portion of meat & standard veg but all virtually flavourless. Way better found virtually elsewhere anywhere in Toronto. And let me tell you why there are lines - it's because their staff are either untrained or don't care to hustle or both. No line when I came in and it took 10 minutes to walk out with a sandwich (all components pre-prepared too I might add) and that was with only two people ahead of me in line. If you're smart, don't bother - unless you like standing in lines for mediocre quality - apparently some people do!"}
{"text":"The food is spectacular, They don't skimp on the meat. It has such amazing flavors that my husband who is chef material even loved the food. He actually is willing to go back there, which is a rare thing indeed. The rice was amazing. I very rarely can have rice so it has to be spectacular for me to eat it, and I ate all of it.  The pita was also perfect size, not to much and not to little. I can't wait for them to open up more so it is not so far away from my home. It makes a great date night. I also have never had better service than I did there. The staff couldn't have made it better. They were happy and made everything seem magical. I can't wait to go and eat here  again. If I could give it 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"Not that great to be honest. I was really looking forward to the Halal Guys opening in Toronto after getting it time and time again every time I visited NYC. Sadly, the food here is not near as good as the carts on the streets of New York. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very excited that Halal guys opened in Vegas, being from NYC we had high expectations!! We went on opening day all though there was a line didn't wait that long but 20 mins wait in Vegas outside is long esp it's hot as hell outside! Lol 

Food was good enough! The got the combo w/ chicken and beef gyro! If u don't know the original NYC cart serves chicken and lamb you'll be amazed but since we've been eating chicken and lamb for a while know we can tell the difference. Also the rice is diff. Idk Mybe I'm just a little bias since I'm fr NYC. It's also more expensive than NYC, Combo in NYC is about $7 Mybe $8 now. In Vegas it's $10. 

It was good enough to satisfy cravings but def not NYC good hehe! Will still come back tho from time to time! 

Don't forget the white sauce! Be careful of the hot sauce coz it's very spicy!"}
{"text":"Best food  love them so excited, reminds me of my east coast. Best Arabic food in AZ.  The employees are so nice and service was fast !"}
{"text":"Over priced
Overhyped
Over sauced
Under seasoned

Do not waste your time. Stick to real Arabic food spots around there!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much hype about this place in New York that we had to venture out looking for it in Vegas.  When we got there I expected a massive line, but to my surprise and relief, it was empty.  We ordered the half chicken/beef combo platter.  The chicken and beef was good, not too dry with good flavoring.  The white sauce added extra flavor.  I found the pita to be dry, a bit stale and overall subpar.  I would definitely go back for seconds."}
{"text":"Yes, it's as good as everyone says. Now that I live a tiny bit closer to this oasis of meat and rice my rewards card is going to get a serious workout. Whether you've come here to relive your days on the mean streets of NY or you just want to see why people are descending upon this random intersection of Las Vegas at a breakneck pace, I'd venture a guess your first visit won't be your last. 

Platter or sandwich, as long as they're putting that tender chicken or beef (or both) in it along with the veggies of your choice (lettuce, tomato, green peppers, jalapenos for the adventurous diners) it's going to be a win. The staff is super nice and does a great job of explaining what you might or might not want on your plate. The hummus is flavorful and the pitas perfectly doughy and warm. You can get their glorious white sauce on your meal or they even provide packets of it which was a wonderful surprise, cause why not hoard them and start putting that sauce on everything you put in your mouth. It's just that good. The hot sauce would likely start a fire if left unattended so heed their warning on overdoing it and ruining your tasty creation. 

It's pretty close to the strip if you're in town for debauchery and need a hearty meal but they also deliver and the food travels well. Halal Guys gets my very enthusiastic stamp of approval."}
{"text":"On my way to an exam last Tuesday (December 6th), around 11:30am, I saw a dude in a Halal Guys uniform go outside and then proceed to take a piss in broad daylight on Mackay street. He then ran back in the restaurant. Me and a group of people looked at each other like: ''Is this guy for real?''

I thought I'd make a Yelp account just to let people know in case they're thinking about going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best gyro place in town!! Make sure you got the baklava it's free if you check in with Yelp!
Linda was great!"}
{"text":"Food is great... GET MORE PEOPLE WORKING THE LINE AT NIGHT... the line can get ridiculous and I have walked away multiple times because of how long it takes the single person working the line to get through all the orders"}
{"text":"Me and my wife stop by and we asked what they recomend the staf says try the combo platter so me and my wife try it and she was right it was delicious the white sauce is so good but listen to Joan about the hot sauce the way she said it explosively hot she is not kidding it is extremely hot good thing she put it on the side...... thank you ladys  you made my day. I definitely come back again on this place"}
{"text":"I was so excited that Halal guys came to Vegas! I literally had it as my last meal of 2016. I kind of regret that I did though because it was one of the worst halal guys I've had. We dropped by around 4pm to get 8 orders.

At every other Halal guys I've been to, I noticed that the meat is much fresher. Majority of the time, the meat came straight off the grill. Perhaps this place is slower than others because all of the meat was on the warmer and looked like it had been there for a while. There were even burnt, hard pieces at the bottom of the platter. They also skimp on the rice here a lot compared to others, I asked if they could fill it up more but she said that it was extra which is a little ridiculous. There was no extra rice option on the menu and I have asked before at other locations. 

Overall, portions are smaller and meat is not as fresh at this particular location. I'm sure this meal would taste better the later it gets at night. However, I wouldn't recommend eating this for a daytime meal :/"}
{"text":"We were at a baby shower over the holiday weekend that served Halal Guys and it was delicious so we decided to have them cater an impromptu Labor Day family lunch 2 days later. Couldn't have been easier to order. It was delivered right at the time we scheduled for and came with everything we needed and didn't even know we needed like chafing dishes, sterno, serving utensils, individual food signs, lighter, and a well made instruction sheet on how to set everything up. The food was delicious and devoured. Would definitely use them again in the future!"}
{"text":"Out of gyro at 10:10... unacceptable. I wanted a combo not just chicken and falafel is not an ok substitute for gyro... being that it is not meat. 

Employees breaking down the line as if they were closing yet you guys are open until 11. 

I've been here like 15 times since you opened and this is not how it's been. 

Almost as if the higher ups aren't around anymore and now it's just like any other fast food place where the workers and managers don't care and want to close early. Or... and more likely some higher up decided they could save money by not making more gyro an hour before they close in order to save money... well how much money are you saving when people leave and don't buy food, because there isn't any to sell?

1 star."}
{"text":"First timer here. Will definitely come back. I had the combo plate with jalepenos. The white sauce was great. The red sauce is ridiculously spicy! 

Overall delicious and will recommend to everyone to check out."}
{"text":"Would love to be able to rate, but appears they arbitrarily decide when they open and close based on the alignment of the sun and moon because every time i try to go it's closed. Advertised open until midnight and have been closed anywhere between 9-11 pm all 4 times I've tried stopping by. I'll just stick w driving to tempe and go to the one that's open at consistent times or just go to pita jingle for my fix."}
{"text":"Bland rice, white sauce is simply ranch dressing. Soggy tomatoes. 

Extremely unclean and unkempt. Not going back again"}
{"text":"One of the most overhyped plates of pseudo middle eastern foods in North America, that may have at one time been worth it. Unfortunately, commercialization and franchising has turned this brand into a tourist trap that serves unrecognizable pieces of meat, accompanied by bland rice and tasteless lettuce, smothered in a highly questionable substance called 'white sauce'. If you're visiting this place, especially in Toronto, please know that there are MUCH better options for middle eastern food, within the same price range, and in the same area. Shish Kabab Express at Bay/Dundas, or even the Ali Baba location near Ryerson, to name a few. 

If you're a tourist looking for authentic middle eastern food, find some time to make your way to the stretch of Yonge between Steeles and Finch in North York - you will be spoiled for options! Even if you go to the hot food bar at Khorak Supermarket, you'll be better served."}
{"text":"We came back from New York in May and Halal Guys was one of our favorites so we couldn't wait until this opened. They measure their servings here. In New York they load you up so you have a full platter so for it being a little pricy they don't give you much compared to NY.  I ordered 3 combo platters and a gyro platter. I told the ladies 4 times and they still left out one combo. I ordered 2 sides of falafels at the register and the same lady yelled you should of ordered it back here. She had an attitude. Because I am comparing this to our experience in NY and how we kept craving for more I can say I probably won't crave this one which is why I gave them 2 stars."}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying halal guys ever, and with today's experience I honestly cannot wait to try it when I'm next in Nyc! I split a combo (chicken/beef gyro) plate with a friend, as the portion sizes are huge! The white sauce was really amazing but you are literally able to feel the kick of the red hot sauce at the back of your throat. I personally felt the orange rice was the best part; I would honestly recommend this for  everyone to try at least once. Was honestly so worth the money!"}
{"text":"Pita Jungle has nothing to fear from these guys.

Warning signs: It's what should be prime dinner time at 6 PM and there's nobody in the place - no customers, no staff.  We go in to order take-out and it looks closed, if not abandoned, with the shawarma cooker and flat top grills both empty and cold.

A couple of staffers do appear from the back and one methodically fills a couple of $10 chicken-gyro combo platters from hotel pans without much chatter.  (In case you might have forgotten, this isn't Chipotle!)  We have to ask for garnishes, which are doled out in very small portions.  We're offered a taste of the hot sauce - it is very hot, but quite tasty - and get a garnish of babaganoush on the platter, then \"famous\" white sauce and a little hot.

When we got home and dug in, the finely-chopped or shredded chicken reminded me of tuna salad.  The gyro meat didn't remind me of anything.  The orange (Basmati?) rice was as flavorless as the famous white (garlic? tzatziki? diluted mayo?) sauce.  At least the hot sauce had some flavor and the pita wedges were soft.  It was filling, but nothing else.

Bottom line: We should have heeded the warning of the empty store and headed elsewhere.  For about the same price as HG we could have each gotten 3 In-n-Out double-doubles, 2 veggie-filled footlongs from Subway, or a Filiberto's combo; for a couple bucks more a signature entree from the Pita Jungle just down the street.  Too bad Khyber Halal isn't in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of hype about halal guys from east coast friends. I was really excited to hear that they now had one within driving distance to phoenix, az. After making a drive to Las Vegas for the weekend, we decided to save the best for last. On our drive back, we stopped at halal guys. For a place that has chicken and rice as their signature dish, I was appalled that they were out of rice when I got there. Even more, there was a \"40-45 min\" wait on the rice. How you don't start preparing rice ahead of time as you are getting low is beyond me. Deciding not to wait, we ended up settling on the sandwiches. The chicken was bland and the only saving grace was smothering sauce on it to add some flavor. Needless to say, the hype was not well deserved. Personally, I think that any restaurant establishment can make up for mediocre food by having good customer service. I wish I was able to say that about this halal guys. The place had 4 people behind the counter, but a single person was taking the order, making the sandwich, putting the condiments and accepting the payment. Most inefficient use of manpower I have seen. If the management doesn't take some serious steps to properly train its staff, I can't imagine this place will continue to be very successful just by relying on the popularity of the brand."}
{"text":"The combo platter was excellent. We were quickly greeted with warm smiles by employees more then happy to take our order. I love the fact that this place is open late and I hope to make it back so"}
{"text":"Pros

1. Great customer service! Waitresses are really really nice and very accommodating.

Cons

1. Beef Gyro meat was comparable to the process meat the Gyro places (eg. Gyro Time).

2. Chicken was like a typical grilled chicken.

3. The place was so small that you had to eat quick for the others to be able to eat as well after ordering.

4. It was so hot in there when we went (08/15/16) and they had rental air conditioner which was not enough since their grill is open to the dining area. 


2 star tops. I had better kebabs, gyro, and shawarma elsewhere."}
{"text":"Halal Guys cart is always my to-go food whenever I visit New York. Now I moved here, I'm so happy that it opened their store in Tempe. Service is fast, small platter is nice portion for one (at least for me) and the white sauce is the best. I have eaten at least 3-4 times since their opening and I don't think I'm going to stop anytime soon. Chicken platter and combo platter are my favorite."}
{"text":"Seriously one of (if not) the best food locations in Vegas delicious food, awesome service, these guys are the best, my recommendation combo platter with some extra hummus and pita bread you can't go wrong, thanks again guys for the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Finally visited Halal Guys in Toronto and it was great! Food was just as good as location in New York.
Prices are in line with the US considering our weak CDN $. Only thing I did not like is that they charge $1 for white sauce to go it should be free.

Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Hi Melissa,

I just wanted you to know every time I've visited this store the chicken is very dry, burnt and hard. I really love this company but I'm just really concerned on why the meat is not edible. 

Thanks so much,
Edward"}
{"text":"I went in here only knowing that the company started as a food cart and that is got outrageously popular and I guess I can see why!!! Combo platter is fantastic! Gyro meat is absolutely delicious and I have to say that the white sauce was amazing. When I went in Victoria was the best and was super knowledgeable of the food and the background of the company. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Submitted an order through Foodora. $15 for a chicken platter. No potatoes with it, but it did come with rice and sad salad (tomatoes and iceberg). I ordered all of the fixings and got none of them, it's like they didn't even read the order. $1 each for maybe a tablespoon of hummus and a drizzle of baba ganoush (super liquidy). This the second most disappointing delivery I have ever had. Bar none this is the worst meal I've had of this kind. Maybe they are better to pick up from in person but I will never know because I will never go there."}
{"text":"I really want give them a 4 star at the first time. But the second visit was not good as I expected. The chicken is too dry and the rice taste not like fully cooked. 
Their service is also, not that good. :("}
{"text":"The food was overhyped! The portions are huge but for the price you would expect more meat. The food was just alright, nothing too special about it. I'm from Ottawa so we can get much better quality food for the same price. BTW DONT GET THE HOT SAUCE!!! It should be illegal, I put THREE small drops on my sandwich and my tongue was burning for hours."}
{"text":"For the price, you're better off going elsewhere for Middle Eastern food. Toronto is full of Middle Eastern food that isn't frozen or packaged. The falafels were so hard and tiny. The service wasn't that good either, considering we went on an empty day. 

Just go to another middle Eastern place if you're looking for a meal like this - something fast, cheap and filling."}
{"text":"Fast and nice service but the food was just a pure disappointment...haven't been to the stand in NY but in MTL i would probably not go back and return to the good old boustan"}
{"text":"If you're looking for disappointment you've come to the right place. Service was prompt but the food is devoid of quality."}
{"text":"I have been to the infamous Halal Guys twice now and I am a fan. The Gyro plate is recommended, which comes with iceberg lettuce, rice and of course gyro with a side of pita bread. They give you 2 packets of the delicious white sauce and I thoroughly mix into my plate. There's hot sauce that is extremely spicy but not very flavorful as I'd like it to be.  

This chain is expanding rather quickly, and most people know the infamous Halal Guys from New York, where there is usually a long line to enjoy one of their incredible combo plates. I am sure you will enjoy this location."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! They got it all wrong! The food is less thank ok! Rice and meat was dry. I think they just used the name but forgot to bring the quality that should've came with it.
Staff are very friendly. Store is cheaply made and not worth hanging there. Too bad, was really looking forward to this! Embarrassed I invited colleagues from work to try it out. Would not return unfortunately :("}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place. The food was just ok. What they call Shawarma is just a chicken wrap and the chicken wasn't too tasty . They don't use the authentic toum sauce and it's just a confused dish. The Babaghanoush was nothing great too. The falafel was better than the meat. We ordered 4 different items on the menu and nothing was really too yummy to mention it ."}
{"text":"I came for opening weekend and decided to grab a bite on a Saturday night. I first had Halal Guys in NY and couldn't wait to try it again in Vegas. That white sauce! It is to die for! And that red sauce. Forget Sudafed. Just pour on some of it and it will clear your sinuses in no time! I got the combo plate which had chicken and gyro. So bomb...I can't wait to go back and get my Halal fix."}
{"text":"Pretty meh.  I ordered the been gyro platter.  The service was quick, but my pita was stale.  The beef gyro had good flavor, but the yellow Jasmine rice was bland.  I am not sure how they got it to be such a rich gold color, but I doubt they used saffron.  I couldn't taste any other fragrant spices in the rice either.

I probably won't be back with good choices like Even Stevens and Poke Bowl right next door."}
{"text":"So I've heard of this place from a few friends & family. They made it sound good so hubs & I decided to try it since we were on this side of town. I got the beef plate & hubs got chicken/beef combo plate. I do love Greek food so I had high expectations. I'm sorry to say but it wasn't all too great for us. The meat was a bit tough & rice was a little hard & tasteless. The soft pita was good tho. I tasted my hubs chicken & that tasted okay. Better than the beef. I had olives & that was super salty. Don't know if those type of olives are suppose to be that salty but the juice that was with it turned parts of my plate just really really salty. Good thing it was a small scoop of it. The white sauce made the plate taste a little better at least. The staff was really nice tho (reason why I gave 3-stars). I did a check-in on Yelp & I was able to redeem a FREE slice of baklava. That was good! It was good to try the place out but not a place where I can get a good fix for Greek food tho"}
{"text":"Had the combo platter and it was pretty bomb. I made the mistake of adding too much hot sauce. My mouth literally felt like it was on fire! For anyone trying this for the first time, I definitely suggest tasting the hot sauce before your put it on your food because the hot sauce is literally so spicy!"}
{"text":"Second visit already... The famous NYC gyro food cart that once began 25 years ago for the demand from cab drivers has made it's way to LV! A quaint location on Spring Mountain & Valley View -- the staff was friendly, the venue was clean & the food was savory! 

FOR HER: 
- Beef gyro
FOR HIM: 
- Half chicken & half beef combo platter

The meal was very tasty, & its true -- you cannot have too much of their \"white sauce,\" which is just so complimentary to the meal. They also have a red explosive hot sauce, which is definitely no joke! Even as a lover of all things spicy, he said this should be used sparingly as it can be a bit overpowering. We also tried the baklava, which was truly made to perfection. The perfect sweetness & size to end the meal! 

PRO TIP: They are open until 4:00AM and are not too far from the Las Vegas strip! Which is perfect for those late night, post clubbing eats! :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Rubby provided great customer service and was very attentive to our needs. Thanks Rubby!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb! I drive all the way from the other side of town to go here. You cant go wrong with Lamb or Chicken. The falafel is great! Their fries are awesome. The portions are great and for what you get the price is good. This is not a sit down restaurant. They have a few chairs to sit in but its pretty small. Make sure to use very little hot sauce a little goes a long way. Their white sauce is amazing! I highly recommend Halal Guys!"}
{"text":"This food is edible and the location is open late which is very convenient. However that's where it ends for me. There is absolutely no seasoning on any of their food making it all extremely plain. This is the most Bland gyro I've ever had and even their frozen crinkly fries lacked any sign of salt or any other flavor. The flavor god seasoning I put on at home was the best part of the whole meal. 

Also, while we're waiting for our food which we ordered to go.. the guys behind the counter decided to make himself a HUGE gyro sandwich for himself and announce that while we waited for our fries to come out of the deep fryer. Super unprofessional in my opinion. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Got the combo platter and mixed it up. It is so good!  Exactly what I wanted it to be. Feels healthy but tastes incredible!  I haven't tried the original in New York, but I would love to the next time I'm out east after reading reviews that say the Vegas version is good but not as good as the original. 

I also tried the baba ganoush and falafel. Both were full of flavor, but not as good as the platter. I will definitely be back... Often!!"}
{"text":"The Halal Guys opening in Montreal was so hyped there were line-up for several days. The first time I tried this place, the regular combo platter tasted great but the portion was light, as the staff sparsely filled the plate, mostly with lettuce. Several weeks later, I ordered the same meal but this time plate was more generously filled and the price had dropped; but it didn't taste as good. Serving is rather uneven, perhaps the staff was worried they may run out of food when they were too popular... I may have to go back to check. ;-) Still a decent place for fast Lebanese food, but may not live-up to the original NYC cart reputation."}
{"text":"Good Food but soo disappointed with the quantity. We ordered it via Uber eats and they gave us only half a box."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch, and it was so good that I joined their frequent eaters club. Fast, friendly service, and best of all, the food was great!

My husband got a beef gyro, and I had the combo plate. Chicken was good (nothing special), but the beef was delicious, especially with a combo of white sauce and hot sauce. I asked for everything, and while I appreciated the green peppers and Kalamata olives, next time I think I'll skip the jalapenos.

Don't forget to ask for the locals discount. Even though the meal was inexpensive to start with, it saved us a couple more bucks!"}
{"text":"Bomb. Combo plate allllll day. Crinkle cut fries are delicious with the tzaki sauce. Bought some hummus to go, ate it the next day with my coworkers and everyone liked it. Will definitely be back for more. Another great thing is this place is open until 4am!!! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"We came here late afternoon. It wasnt a busy time. Service was fast. We ordered 2 half and half combo platters, 2 beef gyros and 1 beef combo platter. We were already enjoying our first bites when my brother felt something's really different, something really hard. He spitted it out and found a metal piece. He then told them about it and they gladly gave him a new one no questions asked. He wasn't asked to pay and they gave him a coupon but when we checked it out it was already expired sooo... haha 
I checked in too so I got one order of Baklava for free. It was my first time to try baklava and sadly i found it too sweet and too flaky. 
Their hot sauce was really HOOOT even my husband who is a spicy person found it really hooot too. White sauce and bbq sauce were good too. 
I only gave it 3 stars coz though i was satisfied with my order the fact that something not edible was in my brother's combo platter it made the experience a little less perfect."}
{"text":"Giving them only 3 stars mainly because I dont get the hype. It really doesnt deserve the huge lineups it gets. Maybe its better in NYC? While I dont mind the gyro at all , I dont get why they chop up the slices into ground meat. The hot sauce is very spicy so be careful. The platter doesnt seem so worth it as its just rice and a lame salad so I recommend a wrap if anything. Its worth a try if youre curious but honestly not much better than lets say a kojax gyro which is very average."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! The staff is very friendly and quick!! Love it and I will definitely be eating here regularly!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! And the customer service was even better. Definitely lived up to the hype"}
{"text":"Really good food, but was very little. A combo plate didn't fill me up. But it was delicious."}
{"text":"Their hot sauce deserves its name and gave me a good kick. But besides that, none of the components of a gods sandwich are present. Bread, chicken, beef, lettuce. Everything is stale, without any texture or taste."}
{"text":"I am so glad you guys are finally in Toronto.  I used to drive 7 hours to nyc just to eat your sharma... with that being said..  I was a little disappointed with the quality. The sauces are the same but I feel that the food temperature overall was not hot enough. The chicken could stay can be grilled a bit longer as it kinda taste boiled right now. The portion is almost petty compared to new yorks...I waited about 45 min in line so its not bad at all. Hope the quality gets better because that would make me very happy!"}
{"text":"I used UberEats. I ordered the chicken and beef platter with no lettuce and no tomatoes, I added fries. And I asked them to go easy on the sauce. When I received my order I didn't have any fries, there was lettuce and tomatoes included, and they put extra sauce. I already had to wait 40 minutes for this order. 
I called Uber eats, they processed me a refund, they told me that I could get a five dollar discount and that it would be available if I re-ordered immediately. So I did, re-ordered immediately. I waited another hour this time. And when my food came there was no sauce on the food, I still got lettuce and tomatoes instead of all rice. And I got my fries this time, but they taste like they're old, and I don't think fries are supposed to be chewy. Undercooked? It's kind of sad, because I was really looking forward to this place for months. I'm hoping they do something for me to compensate for this inconvenience."}
{"text":"Halal Vegas opened too soon, IMO. I came here at midnight opening day. The staff seemed bit overwhelmed and under trained. If this was a soft  opening it would have been fine, but it was grand opening and social media hyped. 3 stars for not meeting expectations and having very limited seating. 

I've had Halal guys in Socal before. It was great then. For whatever reason, the Vegas one wasn't as good. I think I expected a bigger portion with more meat! Definitely more protein and veggies. I didn't finish my plate (I put in too much red sauce), but it was 90% rice left over. 

The Red Sauce is literally fire like Indian or Thai spicy. Its hella hot. The white sauce was a bit more bland then I remember. 

For Drunk food, I'd pick Halal guys over Pho Kim Long."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My first time here and I enjoyed it! Service was amazing and Anthony provided us with a great smile and servixe!"}
{"text":"Being from NJ and working in NY for over 3 years these carts were My go to lunch spot. When I heard they were opening a restaurant here I got super excited and could not wait. I tried to go to the opening day but the line was literally wrapped around the building. 

So I decided to give it a few weeks and finally went yesterday night. There was still a slight line but primarily to Monitor the crowd almost like a club with a bouncer and he also gave a good description of the food and what to expect for the newbies. The line moved quickly though and so did the food line. Which again reminded me of the fast paced NY I miss. 

The food did not disappoint at all!!! I ordered the Combo plate with chicken and gyro (pronounced Euro!!!) with the white sauce and 4 lines of the hot sauce. And trust me it was exactly like back home. The spice of the Hot sauce is not
For the weak hearted but for me it was perfect and well worth the wait. So happy to have a piece of home in the desert."}
{"text":"So glad this opened up in poor area! Very fresh and savory meat.  Tired the combo platter and have to come back for falafel and hummus."}
{"text":"not bad for a quick fix. Everything is already made and laid out. I had the beef gyro platter with a side of hummus.  He had chicken. Both were tasty. Added bbq and white sauce, but that red hot sauce was super hot! cleared my sinuses."}
{"text":"I came and lined up an hour before the grand opening on Friday May 5th. It was a cold, windy and rainy morning. There were at least 30 people lined up ahead of me in the rain, they probably came 1.5 hrs before the opening or maybe even earlier. The wait seemed to take forever since it was so cold and wet out. Luckily I found 1 glove inside my coat pocket and put it on the hand that I held my umbrella with. Its not their fault that their opening date happened to fall on a cold and wet day. They were nice enough to give out umbrellas to those who didnt have any! I took the day off to use as a resting day and to come to the opening since I heard good things about their NY location as well as to attend an aerial class that I would not have been able to make had I worked that day. Finally 11am arrives and I hear the DJ playing music and crowds screaming on and off. It took about an extra 20 minutes for me to get inside and order. I was excited for the chance to get a swag bag and a chance to win free food for a month. I was disappointed to see a spinning wheel of discounts, free side and such. I spun and won free baklava which seemed to be the most popular of prizes but would rather have gotten free swag bag. I ordered the chicken and gyro combo regular sized platter for almost $13 and added 2 pieces of falafal for less than $2. I got a free soft drink for signing up for the points card which they failed to mention at the cash register I had to bring it up as I read about a free drink somewhere. The food was quite good! but I cant compare it to the NY one since I have not tried that one. I love the white sauce but beware of the red sauce. They gave me a small line of the red sauce and now I know why. I asked for more hot sauce not knowing how spicy it would be and boy did it make me sweat! I ended up scraping some of it off cause I couldnt handle it. Everything was delicious and portion size to me was good but thought the price could've been a dollar or two cheaper. I was not able to finish the meal as it was quite filling I polished through about 3/4 of it and took the rest home to finish later as a snack. I definetly will come back when I'm craving it but I will not go out of my way just to go there unless I plan to buy or do something close by. It would be a good excuse to get some bubble tea afterwards since that area is lined up with Gong Cha, Cha Time, Share tea and Coco."}
{"text":"When this place first opened was great , but now it's my second time horrible food , and it's zero customer service from the manger as well , hoping the owner can see this comment  and change this this bad staff"}
{"text":"Had to take a break from eating healthy to eat here and absolutely loved it! The white sauce is amazing and I love the kick from the hot sauce. Put a few dots to gauge how much hot sauce you should put in before it lights you ass on fire. I put quite a bit but I love it! The falafel was also great! I loved everything about the food. It's a little greasy but who cares, it's my cheat day LOL


Oh what did I order, I got a small combo and couldn't eat it all because it was a lot of food. The small was enough to feed me and leftovers for the hubsters. My son is 16 and killed the regular size combo. Also make sure you don't plan on eating there cause it's small. We got lucky and was able to get seats."}
{"text":"The cashier was friendly but the prices and amount of food was poor. The food is bland and everything is extra. Won't go again"}
{"text":"They should have a warning label on their red sauce. My husband put too much red sauce on his plate and he hated his food. The white sauce on the other hand is delicious,and the service is very friendly. The price is affordable and the restaurant is clean. Although we enjoyed the service I doubt we'll be going back, the food was okay but not amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff!!
Tried this place on a whim and it was just what we were looking for. Short menu which helps the decision process! Few different sauces to try. Try the falafel too!! Yum!"}
{"text":"First I was schooled that it's not Mediterranean food it's traditional middle eastern food.......thanks.  Second if you're going to drain students trust funds by charging 10 bucks a plate for rabbit food and a small portion of protein. Can u at least spend some money on 2 ply toilet paper.  After I'm done eating said rabbit food I have to expel some waste. Unfortunately my hand was wearing most of my own waste due to cheeping out and having 1 ply.  U have ur business on a college campus with guys who like to eat and usually spend a fair amount of time ingesting garbage.  The make up of said waste will have a thick consistency. So please Nickel and dime owners invest in some upgraded products.  

Thanks"}
{"text":"At 2pm parking was available, service was pretty good and tables to choose from! Not too bad for a late lunch. Food portions are still disappointing compared to what you get at their NYC foodcart but a bit improved from our last visit. We ordered two regular combo platters, side of hummus, and baklava. They now give you a choice of veggies to add to your platter - black olives, jalepenos, onions that I can recall as I write this. There is also now a frequent diner card you can get. The staff  may want to pay attention to their sauce availability - the white sauce containers were pretty much empty. But the sauces were still spot on ~ white sauce DELICIOUS, and red sauce HOT!"}
{"text":"We were all so very tired after returning from the RISE festival. We didn't want to eat at any restaurants the hotel(RIO) offered and were also too lazy to go out to eat. Thank goodness for UBEREATS! Searched and found these guys, delivered curbside to our hotel-lifesaver indeed!

We ordered 3 combo plates: came with chicken, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and pita bread. I must say the portion size is awesome!!! It was perfect for us 6 to share. The meat was tender, rice was perfectly cooked and well seasoned, and Their WHITE SAUCE is the $#!+ we all love it, it's like crack! It's good on everything!!! No lie, we ordered extra(although there was no need cause it came with plenty), had a package we didn't use, saved it in the fridge. Ordered White Castle the next day and ate it with the WHITE SAUCE. One word.....LEGIT! 

So you know how when you go to a place and you order \"spicy\" and then the food come out and your like...\"wahhh? Where's the kick?\" Well their hot sauce it also LEGIT. The mister loves spicy and can handle a lot, this is pretty comparable to when his friends make  papaya salad with +15 peppers! Definitely not for the faint at heart, Love it!

We also ordered a side of their hummus and it was delicious. The only downside to this is that it came with only one piece of pita bread......one. Definitely not enough and I would recommend ordering extra. 

To think you guys started in NY selling from a small cart on the streets.....amazing. I wish you had a location near me :( until next time....."}
{"text":"I do not see the hype behind this restaurant chain. The food is overpriced and extremely bland. I ordered the Falafel Platter and the falafel tasted like it was spoiled and was inedible. Not to mention, I specifically asked for there to be NO TOMATOES and EXTRA LETTUCE and go the exact opposite. I am very allergic to tomatoes and was unable to eat the food as a result. I will definitely not be ordering from this place again or recommending it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place but the service is the worst! The guy behind the counter doesn't stop talking amongst themselves when taking orders. 

The guy handing me the food had the food in his hand but talked to his coworker for a couple minutes before handing it to me.

I will never be back here. They have no sense of urgency or priority for their customer."}
{"text":"I love the kind of staff that works here. I forgot his name but that kid was simply amazing on how to treat customers. It was my first time ordering in Halal guys, he guide me all the way on which kind of food i was trying to get that moment. Will recommend and will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Halal Guys is a chain known to have its start and roots as a food cart NYC in the 90s. Not knowing much else about them, I was excited to try the food here. I was surprised to find that the food is really simplified, and menu very basic - food definitely a bit blander than usual real deal halal, and I guess kind of \"Americanized\"?

The service was good as they were friendly enough to explain how their hot sauce works - you can ask for how many \"lines\" you want, as it is super spicy. They are known for the white sauce, which I found to be okay but wasn't as garlicky and developed as most other white garlic sauces I've had at other places.

All in all, if you are new to this kind of food or are looking for a quick meal late at night (they are open super late I think!), it's a decent choice, but nowadays with the ever expanding food scene, there's a good number of more authentic halal places offering those incredible flavors the cuisine is known for."}
{"text":"All the talk of this place made me cave in. I came in with some high expectations and was looking forward to some good food. Walking in I immediately noticed the decor, while it is not the prettiest decor it is also not the best looking decor it was mediocre, but that's not what I was there for. I got in line and was already ordering as there wasn't much of line. Will say for a regular combo platter, the amount of food was astonishing. I tried it right away and honestly be careful of the hot sauce other than that everything else was good. With good customer service and good enough food I can see myself coming back every now and again!"}
{"text":"Went the day they opened with my son what a huge mistake. Got two orders because my son loves this type of food and made me take him. Before I get to the register I heard a customer being asked how she liked the food. She said well it was ok but the bread fell all apart so I couldn't truly enjoy my food. Instead of oh I'm sorry blah blah blah she was responded to by the owner with \"well it's bread what do you expect right?\"  I was shocked at the response. They had so much advertising everywhere that the first 150 \"guests in line\" would receive one free meal per month for the entire year. I get to the register and the cashier gets very rude and tells me I need to learn how to read that it's only for those 18 and older that she wasn't giving me one for my son. Reason I was there too btw. I said well the flyer I have says guests and not adult guests. She got upset and took me outside to show me a sign on the back of the door where they had taped a piece of paper to it saying 18 and older. Hmm why didn't their fb post say that? Hmm why didn't the radio station promoting say that? Why didn't everyone's flyers say that? They all kept repeating the first 159 guests in line. She continues to say well if you open your eyes you can read that it says it clearly right there. Talk about rude. I thought well maybe the food will be spectacular and I can forget the rude ass cashier. Nope! My 10yr old even said wow mom sorry for making you wait in line for this. The food was greasy and tasted burnt probably from being thrown back on the grill, I don't know. Not sure how they keep opening other locations unless this one is just the crap one. I really wanted to like it because my son loves this food. Service is horrible and so was the food. Definitely won't be going back. Please invest in training your staff customer service skills. Also don't false advertise!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and there wasn't a long line. We waited for less than 5 mins. Even though there were a handful of small tables inside, it was way too hot (even with the fan on) and we opted to sit outside and eat. 

For 2, we got a regular combo to share with extra white sauce and it was definitely filling. I think without the extra white sauce it might've been too bland. It was alright but I don't think this will be a dish I would crave."}
{"text":"Basically, street meat.  Nice and filling but a tad pricier than i remembered from NYC.

The only thing noteworthy from my visit is the fries.  It's just your regular old fries.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with simple salt on it.  BUT, after suffering through the disgusting garbage that is Montreal Burnt Fries and Soggy Poutines, these freshly made fries tasted like heaven. lmao"}
{"text":"Big DISSAPOINTMENT ! I was excited to see it opened here. I had Halal Guys NYC  by MOMa, which is 100x better than this branch. This one is nothing like the original: very skimpy in portion, cold, not fresh, hummus is extra. We arrived at around 7 pm, staff was already cleaning up the place, looks like it's going to close soon. We are not the only one thinking it's closed, as other passer by customer asked if they are closed. 
The 2 vertical meat griller was off, someone was cleaning it. Chicken was piling up on the grill table, wasn't heated up or grilled before staff served it. Beef was inside the container on the prep table, beside lettuce, and other sides. 
The overpriced platter costs $9.99 small or $12.49 large, comes with some meat, chicken or beef or both (not much here, extra for more meat), some rice, lettuce, tomato, pita bread, and sauces. 
Beware their hot sauce is super spicy! 
I could barely ate the whole plate when I had it in the original location, because the amount of food, but it was so tasty I ate almost all and wanting to have it again everytime I'm in town. So when this branch open here I got so excited, but ooh what a disappointment! Tasted awful, nothing like the original, cold, basically not a good value for your bucks. 
We got the impression staff are lazy, maybe just want to clean up and go home on time, or management doesn't want to pay extra hour for cleaning? Hence, food items are sitting on prep table, doesn't look or taste fresh. 
There are more than enough number of staff there, 7-8. They can easily do the cleaning later, and serve proper food like the original one. 
It's Halal Guys in name only, maybe they are banking on the name. 
But it's really nothing like the original. 
Forgettable and overpriced. 
Do yourself a favour don't bother coming here until they improve to match the standard  and taste of the original place. 
Do the meat correctly, turn on the vertical grills! 
There are a lot of other places around that are better, and would love to serve you food rather than cleaning the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and we were pleased. Love the white sauce and rice.  Would definitely eat here more often."}
{"text":"This place had some serious hype when it opened, so I finally tried it for the first time.

I went there today (a Sunday) around noon and it wasn't busy at all. I got a regular combo platter with white sauce, ONE line of hot sauce, a scoop of hummus and some onions.

This place definitely lives up to the hype.  Both the chicken and the beef gyro were well-seasoned and tender. Good flavor on the rice.  That white sauce set set it off, and the one line of hot sauce was all I needed!  The hummus was just as good and fresh as they described it, creamy and lemony.  Everything was pretty tasty, especially when I folded it up in the pita triangles.

I wanna go back and try a sandwich next time, and I heard the falafel's great too.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. After living in the middle east for half my life and searching for good middle eastern food in Arizona, I was beyond excited when I heard that New York's beloved Halal Guys will be gracing the streets of Tempe. The meat was ok-ok and lacked flavor. The tabouleh was alright as well. There was nothing special that would want to make me dish out nearly $10 for a bowl. It's overpriced and I would much rather go spend my money for real middle eastern food at Haji Baba or Paradise."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying halal guys! It has always been a thing people talk about trying when in New York, but it's a great thing they expanded their territory. I've heard that it was delicious and simple and it was! I got a regular for 10.99 before tax, and it's extremely filling. I could probably portion it to 2 meals. 
Anyways, when my friends and I arrived, they told us it would be a 5-7 minute wait for chicken, which was fine because it would mean we would get chicken fresh from the grill! 
It was nice that the manager gave us free soda cups because we were waiting.

The bowl was loaded with meat, I saw the worker give each of our bowl at least 1 and a 1/2 scoops of both chicken and beef gyro. They had all the sauces on the side near the soda fountain. 
Their white sauce is as good as people say and the red sauce is as spicy as people say. Both together is a great combo, but go light on the red just to give a nice spicy kick. I noticed that the bottles have a printed label that shows when it was made and when the store should toss it. It shows that they always change the sauce bottles.

All in all, it's a nice simple meal that will fill you up. Nothing amazing to keep me craving it, but I can see why people enjoy it with its simple fresh flavors and housemade sauces!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times so far. Before grand opening (Yelp Elite event) and also after my recent trip to NYC and trying the real deal. 

This wasn't the first brick & mortar location ive been to. The first one I went to was the first B&M one opening in Costa Mesa last year...? Overall it is similar food wise, but service upon initial opening and what not was night and day. Not sure if the hype was dead by the time it opened in vegas or what.. but vegas never got hour long lines, fortunately. Lol

Even pre-opening event with yelp, they had sufficient amount of staff to get the lines moving fairly quick. Which is great ! 

Coming here after opening, there was little to no lines, ever. During the day or even during dinner time. Prices are not as good as the NYC carts of course, nor are the portion sizes. 

At $9.99 for a combination platter, they tend to load more veggies and less rice and meat (even after requesting for less veggies and more rice). I feel like there is something missing in terms of flavor but it satisfies at least. With each order, they provide 2 packs of their signature white sauce and 1 pack of their signature red sauce. Be fore warned, if you had not been already, the red sauce is extremely spicy for most people. 

After you get your food and pay, I like to go to the sauce area and put the sauce myself from the sauce bottles. I don't believe there is a restriction saying you cant but I like saving the sauce packets for other uses. (halal guys white sauce mixed with turmeric rice from Persian food take out is good xD and the red sauce adds a great punch and spice to pasta with a red sauce)

Overall, im happy they opened a location in vegas and its kind of convenient (though parking could be a disaster). Would be nice if they can modify the portion size a bit."}
{"text":"Always come here. Great customer service and food! East coast favorite. Thanks for bringing it to the west! :)"}
{"text":"At last I had Halal Guys, a place people keep on raving about, but clearly this restaurant isnt special in any way. The food is expensive for what you get. I ordered a chicken/beef mixed platter. The meat is so meh, the sauces are meh, and the taste is so meh. This place is way overhyped. Service is good, So one extra star for that, but that's all. This place is way overrated and overhyped. 

My advice, save your money and eat at Osmows, they're miles better."}
{"text":"The added star is because it's Halal Guys. Minus 3 stars because the service was terrible and that literally makes me NOT want to come to this location the next time.

I love Halal Guys. I grew up in OC where they also have a location and I was craving this for dinner. As I walked in, the location seemed a little small (think small taqueria/Mexican restaurant). 

So the service is really where this particular location lost stars. I waited around 10 minutes for anyone to even service me. There was only 1 person ahead of me, but the employees decided to attend to other duties before serving the customer. The manager ended up coming out to take my order but she was terrible as well.

Instead of being friendly about taking my order, she was very cold and rude, trying to tell me the price for everything even though I told her it's fine. She stopped mid order to look at the grills/clean them when the cook was already there. Complained about how he was cutting the chicken too big, grease on the floor in front of me (the customer). 

Honestly she could have waited to talk to him after she was done ringing me up instead of embarrassing the poor guy. 

Meh, won't be back to this location, but I still love Halal Guys."}
{"text":"I wanted a Gyro so I stopped in to visit The Halal Guys. Well the parking is bad, the place is dirty, no atmosphere, meat was cold and the pita was soggy. Vegas has so many other better places to get a Gyro. I was very unimpressed with The Halal Guys. My biggest beef is the soggy pita, this needs to be corrected asap."}
{"text":"The line was a bit inefficient but by the time we paid we got what we ordered. The food was great and the best part you can add as much white sauce as you want. 

Eaters BEWARE the red sauce is HOT. And don't take this as if - it's hot and a lot goes a long way.  In the end you can always add but you can't take away!  

They have phone plugs to charge food. Good stuff!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy their food! Fast, delicious, well-rounded meals! And we met the General Manager the other day when we were in there and he was very courteous, making sure all the customers were pleased."}
{"text":"So I am in Vegas and went to visit a friend who was renting  a house.. And wanted to eat something more than the fried chicken and pizza they had. (Mind you in hanging with my brother an a bunch or men.. So there were no sides or anything just meat.. Lol) do I got on √úber eats and saw this place.. Usually I look up reviews but I was so hungry I didn't... Oh how I wish I had! 

So I ordered the Falafel platter that came with rice Lettuce 2 tomatoes and pita bread with 2 'white sauce' and hot sauce.. Now is it just me or do they just call it 'white sauce' I thought it was suppose to be some type of yogurt sauce.. Now remember I said it came with 2 tomatoes, yea no it came with crushed tomatoes.. And don't get me started on the falafel.. It was just a frozen falafel that they fried too long and it just made them hard.. Plus aren't falafels round?! Well mine were roundish more round/square.. After a few bites I was over it.. They were so hard to eat and the rice OMG it was orange and smelled and tasted like mop water.. I just couldn't stomach it anymore.. I hated to throw my food away but I couldn't eat any more.. The 'white sauce made it tolerable for the few bites I did have.. But at the end of the day it was $20 right down the drain.. Dish was $12 but I used √úber Eats so was lil more.. 

So if you have to order take out DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE! It was so not tasty at all! And I HATE to throw food away.. So it took a lot for me to make that decision, most times I'd suffer through it if I was hungry, but I guess I wasn't that hungry or it was just that gross!"}
{"text":"Combo platter. For whatever reason it's just not as tasty as compared to NY. The rice was average. The meats were whatever. White sauce was good."}
{"text":"Food is average to subpar, not the best but not the worst. Only thing that makes the food passable is the ridiculous amounts of white sauce they put on it to mask the taste of the dry chicken. This alone would make me give it around a 3 stars, but when I went there they kept telling me to give them a 5 star yelp review for 50% off coupons. They were really aggressive on trying to get us to give 5 star review and it was really bothersome when we were just trying to enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is disgusting!! If you want some corporate ass Mediterranean food be my guest.. the hot sauce should have a warning sign because I almost choked!!  I love spicy stuff but this is whole other level hot!! Ruined my hole entire plate,the gyro meat is super salty the rice has no flavor and is sort of hard.. the babaganoush is salty as hell!! Talk about salt overdose kill me and die! Since when is okra in the damn babaganoush?? HELLLLLL NO! waste of money if you ask me! No authenticity whatsoever :( if I could give it 0 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Went their on opening day and with this long line, they managed to serve everyone really fast. Food was awesome and everything was to perfection. I would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Just that best food and service I always get when I come here. I just love Hala Guys."}
{"text":"Love this place the good is always great.the workers are always friendly this is just too much for rating"}
{"text":"I saw the lines when this place opened and I presumed they were popular because they had good food.  I gave it a try once the initial hype subsided. The staff were friendly and the service was quick...that's where pretty much where the positive part of my review ends. They have a very limited menu and use very few ingredients.   I assumed this meant their food was perfected and delicious.  Not the case at all.   The pitas were too thick, dry, and brittle while the filling was soaked with sauce and contained imperceptible amounts of veggies.  This is a mediocre mess of a sandwich at a steep price.  Toronto has many many shawarma places that are so much better - and cheaper .  We don't need Halal Guys here."}
{"text":"SYNTHETIC FOOD

How these guys have a following beats me! Thankfully didn't waste my time trying it in NYC.

It tastes as good as premium frozen meals get. 

They'll live off the NYC hype for a while, let's see if they make it past yr 2."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the NYC location so this was a first for me. There's a bit of a wait (out the door, no less) even though it was past lunch time at 2pm.  However, the line does move fairly quickly. 

The white sauce does not disappoint! I find myself craving for more, luckily there is a staff that came around to ask if anyone wanted extra. Yes please! 

Good portion and rice/meat ratio. I'm told the prices are more expensive than NYC but you have the option to sit down and eat, which is worth it for me."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. I had the food delivered. Is this real shawarma ? Gyro? The meat tastes grilled and chopped. There was no crispy ends. No flavor. 

The combo just comes with rice, iceburg lettuce and soggy tomatoes

The rice was good. That was the only thing that was good. 

The white sauce. What is it ? Watery mayo? I was hoping for a Toum-like sauce   It has no flavor but if you read the calories. OMG no shortage of calories. 

Anyone in the area that wants shawarma or middle eastern food in the area would be better off going to Parsley. 

This was my first and last visit.

Update : the aftertaste of meat made me throw up"}
{"text":"Nice big portions and the food is fresh. I couldn't eat it all at once but it was all damn good."}
{"text":"Was so excited for this place to be in Vegas.. but was sadly disappointed. Food was good but the people behind the counter did not offer me any fixings, I did not know what options I had, and felt rushed. Also portions were pretty small but white sauce was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We attended a Foothills Living Magazine event hosted by the Halal Guys and the food and service were phenomenal! It is such a treat to have this type of cuisine in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Got here for an early lunch. It fills up pretty quick during lunch hours and I got the beef combo with the pita and rice. Overall, I was satisfied, but it didn't compare to the street carts in NYC. The meat was cooked differently and the side of pita felt unnecessary. Also, they will offer to put spicy sauce on your plate. I would suggest to have it on the side or put it on lightly because that thing packs a punch!"}
{"text":"Great food for vegans and regular meat eaters. Very simple menu. Quick service. Great price."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait till this one open since we had the best one in Los Angeles. We got here last week and it's not quite the same.  We ordered 2 gyro wrap, 1 chicken, and a combo plate. The the flavor of the meats are more on the bland side and the temperature was on the cooler side. The sauce doesn't have that extra deliciousness compared to L.A."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait. So excited that they are here in Arizona! 

The line was long ( out to the streets) for their grand opening but it moved pretty quickly. 

Pros:
+ fast and friendly
+ reasonably priced
+ the white sauceeeee yummmm 

Cons:
- the sandwich was messy and for almost the same price, it's better to stick with the plate since they over-do it with the lettuce in the sandwich 
- the tomatoes were not the freshest


The hot sauce is definitely HOT so if you're not ready for the fire don't ask for extra hot sauce like I did haha"}
{"text":"Where do I start.... Perhaps the food so here we go , in a nutshell it's deserving of one star . Tasteless overpriced and would never eat there again . Now to the employees, just plain rude shall we say . I am disappointed as I was looking forward to a place that sells halal food , maybe I'm unimpressed because I know what middle eastern food should taste like . My wife's partially to blame because of her flavorful and authentic cooking .I don't think they will be around long , such a shame."}
{"text":"Went on a lunch adventure here with the family, and it was packed! My sister and aunt ended up waiting in line, ordering and getting the food for the rest of us. I gave them $60 to pay for the food and waited outside for their call for help later. No change at the end. LOL. I guess it was enough for the food and tip. My aunt and sister got falafals, and ordered 3 beef gyros for me, my dad and brother served with all inclusive toppings. 
Never got to eat the food right away 'cause it was packed there. Drove about 15 minutes to get everyone home, and when I finally got to eat my gyro... It was just alright. 
Maybe I had high expectations? Or maybe it wasn't comparable to Mediterranean restaurants I've already been to and enjoy?
My gyro was too cold for me, and the drink I got from their soda dispenser (Sprite) was messed up with something else, so I cringed when I took the sip. Eh...
My aunt and sister enjoyed their falafels though!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan...but it's no NYC street cart. Yes the ingredients are the same, but something's different about this franchised version compared to the original food cart in NYC. I can't put my finger on it, but now that I've been to 2 franchised locations outside of NYC, I can tell that it's not quite identical.

The experience you get in NYC waiting for this delicious steaming hot platter of food- in cold or warm weather, sober or drunk, 11am or 2am- has always been positive for me. I've probably had it 7-10 times and it was always freaking delicious. Even when I picked up 4 orders and drove to Philly one weekend it was still glorious to share with friends. So why does the franchised version seem different? I can't really decide. It might be the rice, which was more dry, or the meat, which also seemed more dry and less seasoned. It might be the prepacked white sauce, which is probably now made in some commercial packing kitchen. The only consistent thing I found was the red (HOT) sauce, and the pita.

Tips: you always need more white sauce. Red sauce for spicy lovers- if a medium spicy person 6 drop of sauce will suffice. Low spice? try 2-3 drops.

This is good and will fufill a craving, but if you want the real deal, go here:

{"text":"Food: We did the  typical Gyro, and the regular plate with beef. The  food was pretty good with the white sauce, however the Chili Sauce please use it sparingly! otherwise you will have dragons breath.

Ambiance: The place is still under construction, there's a failure on the air conditioner so the place is a bit hot, especially during the summer time. The restaurant is still operating at a barebones. 

Service: Service is fast food."}
{"text":"I got the gyro platter with white sauce only. It came with heaping serving of rice and gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, and I added green pepper and olives. It also had some pita on the side. My meal was delicious, fresh, and served fast. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is freakin bomb! I crave it all the time lol but only 4 stars because they literally never have enough people working so it takes foreverrrrrrrr. They need to take notes from the way chipotle works!"}
{"text":"Now the people are nice and the food is fresh and the place looks nice, but being Halal is not enough to make this an authentic middle eastern Gyro spot. It lack authenticity and flavors with the frozen falafels. In a college town full of incredible middle eastern restaurants, I was very disappointed . I was looking forward for a long time to visit this place. The Gyro looked pre-frozen and processed meet. The chicken was shredded as it belonged to a BBQ chicken sandwich. Not good."}
{"text":"I ordered rice, salad, falafel, and hummus. Not only was the food very good, the staff was really friendly. I took my time since it was my first time there and they were helpful, not condescending, and warm. The manager, I believe, she was blonde with large pretty lashes and braces, was extremely kind and took in consideration many small details that you see in fine dining. There was another guy with curly short brown hair, tan skin, he was very friendly as well. 
Recommend this place based on cleanliness, quick service, and tasty food."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and every time I passed by there would be a long line up outside on the street so I figured this place must be doing something right. Yes, long line up day after day and it's always packed inside ; you get the picture. One day I passed by and there were only 5 people waiting so I gathered today is my lucky day and I had to thank god for giving me this opportunity to order their food..... I had the beef gyros and I must say  I'm sorry I apologize to myself inside my mind. It's way too oily and salty, with a cold soft wrap. Now I understand the real meaning of \"hype\". This 1-star is only my opinion. Try it for yourself to be fair."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ever since my trip to New York, I've been craving Halal Guys. I was beyond stoked when I found out we were opening one here! And the location is pretty convenient for me! 

The line usually isn't too long. I either get the combo with chicken and beef or just the beef. I drench my plate with the infamous white sauce and about 7-8 drops of the hot sauce. Mind you, their hot sauce is intense! I would be really careful with that. The few times I had Halal Guys in New York, the pita bread was always soft and fresh. However, the pita bread here just isn't right, it's usually cold and has like a stale taste to it. 

I'm alway a happy customer when I come here because it just satisfies my craving so much! Would definitely recommend if you like these types of food."}
{"text":"First time here. Came in at 10pm on a Saturday night. Moderately busy, not busy enough for you to hunt for a seat. I ordered the combo chicken and beef gyro platter and a dollop of hummus for a buck. The food was great, chicken was tasty but I REALLY enjoyed the beef gyro much more. From fellow yelp recommendations I doused my platter with white sauce and dabs of hit sauce. It was bomb!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out with a friend to take our Halal Guys virginity and see what the hype was all about.

They have a pretty simple menu -- I opted for the combo platter which included chicken and beef gyro (because 2 in 1 for the same price, why not get your money's worth?) You order from the entrance side first then make your way across the assembly line to the cashier. Along the way, they ask if you'd like additional toppings, free of charge and sauces. The guy did not hear me clearly and added more of the infamous white sauce than I liked but I let it pass. I also found it hard to hear what the toppings were and could only see three toppings from the glass so he added olives and jalapeno. If he communicated that louder, I would have had that removed.

Anyways, my friend and I got our order and sat down as it wasn't too busy on a Monday afternoon. Although I got the combo, I would much rather get the chicken. The overall dish wasn't anything special. They're supposedly known for the white sauce but it didn't taste like anything. I didn't really get the hype.

I would much rather go to Ali Baba's just a little further up or down the street where you could get a bigger portion and more flavours."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Hala Guys and it was a disappointment... it was disorganized and the food was not all that. Ran out of white sauce... the hot sauce was on point but not enough to salvage the experience and food."}
{"text":"I wanna start by saying I love how late this place is open, it makes it super convenient for people like me who work nights. I came here because I always see it all over my instagram, I wanted to see what the hype was about.
The service was good and prices are decent, but it just wasn't my taste. The three friends I brought with me weren't impressed either. Maybe this just wasn't our food group but I just didn't find much flavor in anything I ate. It just tasted like I was eating a chicken and beef stir fry with some pita bread slices. It wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to the hype around it."}
{"text":"I give this place one star. I would give it less but they did at least manage to open a restaurant and serve food. We had heard all the hype about this place \"finally coming to town\" so we were looking forward to trying it. We did order it through uber eats so I can't comment on service, atmosphere, or staff friendliness. I will say the order was correct and warm when it arrived so that's a plus. That's it for the pluses. Everything went downhill from there. I would describe the food as bland and flavorless. We ordered some chicken platters and some gyros. The platters were almost all lettuce not much chicken. The rest of the veggies looked sort of sad and colorless. The white sauce was fine. Not flavorful but not terrible. Just sort of there. I put in on my food to try and improve the experience. If it did nothing for flavor, at least it gave me the activity of tearing open the packets to squeeze out the product and take my mind off the food I was eating. Just packets of sauce. Nothing fancy there. 

The hot sauce? HOT. Silly hot. Not enjoyable hot. I will tell you I am not a huge fan of hot sauces in general, especially not the painful ones so maybe it's not fair for me to weigh in on it but I did. I tried to add the hot sauce to the flavorless food to help it but all it did was anger me. 

I ate the food because I was hungry and it did provide sustenance but that's it. We will not waste time with this again when there are dozens of other local places and even more chains and fast dining establishments. 


Check it out if you need Late night food but I wouldn't waste your time, money, or energy."}
{"text":"I've had this for dinner twice within 3 days! It's totally my kind of meal because I'm all about food being served bowl style so you can mix it together & get a little bit of everything in one bite! Mmmm! I also love that you can build your \"bowl\" how you'd like & add or not different toppings. If you're a fan of Greek food it's up to par! I see a lot of Halal Guys in my future!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good overall. I would definitely recommend getting extra hot sauce especially if you enjoy spicy food, their hot sauce is amazing! I love that's it's not just a knock off salty Tabasco sauce, it's the real deal. The restaurant was clean which was surprising considering how busy it is during lunch hour. I had the platter, which as pretty good. I even enjoyed the rice, kinda wish they had a chicken on the rocks or sticks option but pretty good overall!"}
{"text":"LOCAL TIP: 10% off for Locals with ID
CHECK IN OFFER: Free Baklava 

Had to try this \"world famous\" place. The tables in the lobby were dirty but the workers were attentive. Ordered a falafel plate. They were sure to let us know that it may take about 4 minutes because they are fried fresh - NO PROB!
The falafel was excellent. 
They even have a sauce bar, I had to visit it twice because everything else was so bland. They give you soooooo much rice ( which looks like shredded cheese :/) but it's completely flavorless. Basically everything was flavorless. 
My husband was happy with the FREE baklava though."}
{"text":"Got the chicken platter. Loaded it up with the white and red sauce. Can't complain! I lived in Philly for a while, and would take the train to NY just to get this stuff. Couldnt resist stopping by this location during my stay in Vegas. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised by the quality of the food here considering that it's in a food court.  My favorite part of the chicken and gyro plate I got was the rice.  The food is tasty and affordable and it really hit the spot after walking around the strip for several hours."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat similar to chipotle because it's nearly just rice and choice of chicken or beef. I know it's a middle eastern style restaurant but honestly this place lacks the flavor

I got the regular platter with chicken and it was honestly not worth it. Total came out to be $9.67 and although the portion is a handful but for the taste its certainly not worth it and I'd rather eat somewhere a bit more decent.

Im sure middle eastern food lovers would definitely enjoy this place but I cant see myself eating at this place ever again. Lmao."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in phoenix for quick eat or take out.  We visit this location and the tempe location often and the consistency is always there.  Even the owners took time to speak to us on a recent visit.  Very nice guys."}
{"text":"First of all, let me disclaim that I don't usually like to review restaurants if I'm going to criticize them. I'm more of a \"promote what you love\" person rather than \"kill what you hate\".

The reason why I'm giving this Halal Guys such a mediocre score is because I don't want to see the image of this chain suffer because of poor management and training of their new locations. I think it's wonderful to see Halal Guys expand and make their delicious food more accessible to people around the world. 

My previous experience with Halal Guys is the original chicken and rice in NY, and the Halal Guys near South Coast Plaza in California. 

The Halal Guys near South Coast Plaza is the model child of customer service you should train all your other Halal Guys on. The employees were smiley and friendly, great food.

This Halal Guys is not bad, but not as excellent as the South Coast Plaza one. This one cook who was cleaning the cooking counter or chopping meat, was making these EXTREMELY LOUD BANGING NOISES! I was shouting WHOOOAAAAAAA to signal how monstrously loud it was, but even that was covered up by the crazy loud banging!!! 

My boyfriend and I could not longer hear ourselves talk! 

There's also no lamb here offered here. There's also a sauce bar and two bottles of white sauce were out of sauce."}
{"text":"Wow! A little taste of New York in AZ! How exciting! Yes, definitely went to the grand opening. Stood in the cold for an hour...was it worth it? Yes...and no...hmmm I got the small combo platter. The chicken was delicious but the gyro was average. The white sauce was good, but I don't get the hype? Idk? Hmm I'm definitely down to come back! Don't get me wrong it was a good experience...the food was good...but maybe it was just overhyped. 

I like the freshness of the salad to cut the richness of the meal...but it's literally lettuce and diced tomatoes.... 

I would definitely come back because it's a good rice bowl to have. Can't wait to try with less wait.

The owners and the workers had great customer service."}
{"text":"So just tried this place based off of yelp reviews.. food was a solid four stars.. but gave it five because of service... I think it was Johnny that was helping us.. I am hella indecisive so alot of people get irritated with me to the point where I think they might spit in my food lol... but she was really helpful with a good attitude at that.. I think I've only done 2 yelp reviews before this in 10 years so she's the ishhhh.. hAd to give her a shoutout for not getting mad at me haha... deff coming back.."}
{"text":"4 stars for the neatness and the service
3 stars at most for the food

We ordered the chicken platter, falafel platter .The food was bland and even after adding a ton of their famous sauces, it didn't taste great. Not sure about all those people who wrote the rave reviews, we are not going back.

Got a free baklava with the yelp checkin, which was good.

I couldn't think of a place that disappointed me so much off late"}
{"text":"Let me start with positives. Clean dining area and the olives that were on our platters were very tasty. The gyro meat was over cooked and cool. The lettuce was only iceberg. The hummus had no taste. The falafel was terrible. Tasted weird and the tahini sauce that came with it was unappetizing. The pita that came with the platter was hard as a rock and cold. For as much as this dinner cost us we were sadly disappointed. We should have gone down the street to Flaming Kabob like we usually do, but wanted to try something new. Bad choice on our part."}
{"text":"Definitely not as good as the NYC locations. Portions are a lot smaller too. A little bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"Stopped into Halal Guys at Midnight to get a bite to eat. Even though it was exceptionally late Johnathan (I hope I spelled that right) greeted us with a smile and a great attitude and helped me though ordering.

He is an exceptional employee and I hope anyone reading this knows that I will stop by again because of how great the service was the first time I came in. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of hype about the Halal Guys opening up a place here so I had to try it out for myself and see if they lived up to it.  I went with my brother and we both got the combo plate (beef gyro and chicken, rice, tomato, lettuce, flat bread) and it was very good!  Very impressed with how fully staffed they are.  Must have been about 12 people in the kitchen so you can imagine the wait time for our food was just non-existent.  Me not being the most patient of people absolutely loved that.  

The air conditioning wasn't working when we went today, no biggie, there were fans all over the place and they were trying to actively get it fixed. 

The staff was super friendly. 

The white sauce was endless and kept at a nice cold temperature.

My favorite thing about them is the portion size. For $10 for the combo plate, I was absolutely stuffed (and I can eat a ton). 

Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Tempe location. Across from ASU and next door to Even Stevens and Ahipokibowl(coming soon!)!  Plenty of parking for now. Small store, but fast, efficient and friendly staff. Small & simple menu. Super tasty beef and rice and don't forget the WHITE SAUCE!!! Recommend: combo(beef & chicken),regular size(good portion), rice & white sauce!!! Their baklava was a plus too!"}
{"text":"Line up took and hour and the meat was dry. 12.95 isn't a good deal for a plate of this poor quality. Overrated. It was better in NYC and only $7 US"}
{"text":"I don't get it. 
I ordered delivery so maybe it wasn't as fresh. the
I had the falafel platter. Falafel was just okay. Rice was gross. Pita was as white and bland as any bread has ever been. And the famous white sauce... was like bad bottled caesar and nothing compared to middle eastern garlic sauce. The hot sauce was hot with no flavour.
NYC tends to have good taste in ME food so I don't know if I can blame this on Americans prefering sweeter, less crunchy food to Canadians. I can't fathom the hype."}
{"text":"TWO WORDS: WHITE SAUCE.

I finally tried Halal Guys after all the talk and hype build around it. When I visited during a weekday night, there was no lineup. I ordered a large platter with both beef and chicken. The platter was enormous and I got a table to eat at. The food aroma was very fragrant and the rice taste great. I thought that the dish really depended on the white sauce. If they didn't have that sauce, it would have tasted really bland. The beef and chicken were just average. That white sauce really brought the platter together. Next time, I'm going to ask them to just load the white sauce. 

In my opinion, this place is definitely hyped up and I do not like how the only thing that made the dish good was just the sauce. A sauce should not define a dish. There were a lot of different food deliver carriers that enter and exit this place. 

I was already full after finishing half the platter and had to take out the rest for later."}
{"text":"Given that the Opening Week crowds had subsided I thought I would try this new lunch place near work.

I ordered the small mixed plate of chicken & gyro atop a great mound of bright orange rice with a salad on the side.

Overall it was a disappointment. The gyro meat stung my mouth from the heavyhanded use of salt but the chicken was okay. You can get better chicken pretty much anywhere downtown so this particular recipe by the Halal Guys also got tossed into the category of underwhelming.

The salad was a mundane assembly of iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes. Its saving grace being that it countered the salt burn of the meat.

The rice - of which there was plenty - was bright orange in colour so I had to ask what it was flavoured or coloured with. I was met twice with the response:

 \"It's a secret\". 

This, in the food industry is probably the worst response you could give a customer, and it made me vow to never return to this restaurant chain. Well, the secrecy as well as the cuisine, that is.

I didn't finish my plate, preferring to write this review rather than finish eating their mystery food."}
{"text":"Portions are a lot smaller than NYC. Taste is alright but nothing too special. Service was really good though! They accidentally put white sauce on my friend's order but she didn't actually want any (they misheard her) so they redid her entire order despite the store being packed since we went on their grand opening day."}
{"text":"That red bottle is NOT ketchup. I have never been to the food truck but I get the hype after trying this place out. I tried the combo plate no rice no pita and got a side of spicy hummus to share with the table. I keep a Low carb/keto diet 90% of the time and this place fits the bill easily. I will be back for sure when in the area. That white sauce though....yum!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in this place after getting excited about it from all the hype. i ordered a beef gyro platter. The meat was incredibly greasy, and the \"White Sauce\" they give you in a package on the side was disgusting (so, so rich). It did nothing to detract from the greasy meat like a typical cool, cucumbery Tzatziki should. They give you one little piece of pita with the giant portion of rice and meat topping. After that was gone, it was impossible to finish that oily disgusting mess. Rice wasn't too bad but the meat was supposed to be the star of the show. They get two stars because the service is fast & friendly but the food is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place! I heard so many good things about the NYC location and we saw the signs coming soon so wanted to try when it opened. The line was just starting outside the door and we waited just under 15 mins. So the wait wasn't bad. 

While waiting we watched them have the grill split in 3, with raw chicken in a massive pile, semi cooked chicken and then a grill to finish it off. They were refilling the rice from the hot table with everyone's trays lined up on the counter and the condensation was dripping in everyone's dish as they removed the tray. 

The people were nice and a lot of staff were working, the place was clean and new looking so that part was good. 

I got the combo regular size which was $12.49. It said it came with with salad but it was just shredded iceberg lettered and a few diced tomatoes. There was no other things you could add in, and if completely tasteless. The rice was an orange colour and similarity not much taste. The chicken and gyros was good portion but again the chicken had no taste and the gyros was so greasy that when I moved the rice away at the bottom there was a thick layer of oil. The hot sauce was good, it was actually hot and the white sauce tasted pretty watered down. They clearly are rushing the food and not taking the time. 

I am saying this having eaten at MANY shawarma places and I can say with confidence this is by far the worst one I have had. Small food courts in malls with no name places blow this place away. Other places the sauces have lots of flavour, the meat is seasoned, they have lots of toppings and always bursting with flavour. I know this is a super negative review but I am not exaggerating as usually I give 4/5 stars for places."}
{"text":"Alright, I had to stop crying to write this review. I was aware of their famous white sauce and decided to go with the gyro beef platter, great choice but gimme a heads up on the frickin hot sauce Lol. The gyro was delicious and tender and the rice paired well, considering the heat from the hot sauce I now understand why they give you lettuce and tomatoes as a side. So please never complain why you got a side of salad, it's for your own safety. On a serious note, I'd probably come back despite the insane price mark ($11 for a small platter) but I know better now, The Halal Guys made me wiser. I need a fraction of that red hot crazy sauce!"}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate at when we moved to Toronto a month or two ago.

I walked in, stood in a long but extremely quick line and ordered a mixed plate.

It came with salad, rice, chicken and beef as well as some white sauce, BBQ sauce which I didn't try because it did not seem to go with the dish and some hot sauce.

When the girl asked me if I would like it spicy I told her very spicy please and she gave me a stern warning that this is not like Popeyes Louisiana spicy sauce.

I really do eat pretty darn spicy food and I get this warning everywhere I go from Chipotle to Indian restaurants and didn't think much of it from a fast food joint.

I got home and decided to lick the sauce of the top of my lid. Welcome to flavor country my friends. . .

My gosh! I was shocked as to how spicy it was. I went over to the fridge and looked for a drink. Nothing in sight since it was our first day in our new place.

I went to look for a cup and nothing was unpacked yet.

I finally put my mouth on the tap and turned it on. 

Nothing came out . . .

Turns out that a fire hydrant outside blew and the water will be shut off for a few more hours.

Needless to say, the struggle was real and the 30 degree + weather was no help.

I have since been back 5 or 6 times and really do love the food as well as the uncensored spiciness.

Tip: Ask for spicy sauce in packets on the side if you are a first timer. If you don't like spicy food at all you can simply ask for no hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I love The Halal Guys ever since meeting the carts first in NY. When a location came in South Bay, I was excited at the prospect of not having to travel so far for this comfort stable. Imagine my anticipation when I learned there was a location at home in the Valley!

But for me, this location felt like a Pass/Fail assignment in college. The components were all there - the meat, sauces, rice, veggies, pita. Chicken and beef tasted as I expected, as did the classic white sauce and spicy red sauce. Eating here is the classic Halal Guys flavor.

Yet with that solid foundation, it never goes further than that. Literally everywhere I've seen more fun iterations, such as a loaded fries instead of a platter. Or for the gluttons, there are more sub-upgrades within platters such as extra meat or rice that didn't break the bank. Here, what you see is what you get. 

I think if I lived on campus, this might be a solid stop. But I feel like something's wrong if at dinner time Dutch Bros. is full but this place is nearly empty. I think I can better understand the lukewarm reaction Tempe has for this spot."}
{"text":"Meh - Way overpriced and not sure what the hype is all about? Meat was dry and veggies not great.  Rice looks good but doesn't have any flavor. Maybe they'll tighten up and have better prices after a few months of getting acclimated.  Haji babas kills with better portions, flavor, quality and price. And many better gyro options minutes away."}
{"text":"Its delicious but not amazing! Definitely overhyped. Got the combo plate and the meat is the best part. People are right about the white sauce -the food wouldn't taste as good or moist without it. Drenched my plate in it. The rice didnt have flavor, but the lettuce and tomato are refreshing. Their baklava is some of the best ive had. Flaky and full of nuts.  The restaurant is small, but managed to get a table. Service was fast and friendly. The girl at the cash register gave me a hard time after asking for my ID and credit card because my drivers license had holes in because I renewed it, but she meant well. Recommend if youre in chinatown or the strip."}
{"text":"Usually heading here at the wee hours of dawn after a gruesome day of work. 

If you're a local, ask for the local discount ! (10% off!) 

It's always satisfying and yeah, I've had the New York original. It's NOT the same. But is it good enough to make me very happy? Ooooh yea. The white sauce and hot sauce is spot on and their rice is fantastic too. Wish they had LAMB.

COUGH COUGH MANAGEMENT COUGH COUGH 

Alright thanks halal for being that dirty (in a good way?) late night regret the next morning option  ya'll the best"}
{"text":"I ordered 5 platters through Postmates and I live about 20 miles away so it's definitely not across the street. The postmates driver came on time but only brought 4 platters. Upon finding out that we only got four platters instead of 5, the postmates driver immediately called the halal guys store and spoke to the owner named Logan to let him know of the situation. The owner went beyond and took responsibility for the mistake and tried to get us the missing platter but unfortunately there were no postmates drivers showing in our area at this point, being that it was 2am.

The owner of halal guys in Tempe then told us that he feels really bad and drove all the way from Tempe to the east valley, about 20 miles, and delivered us the missing platter at 2:30am! That's true dedication and exceptional customer service, this owner truly cares about his business and his customers!"}
{"text":"Late night in Chinatown and don't feel like sushi or pho? Done. 

Super fast and tasty options of plates or gyros.  Simple menu,  really friendly service,  and huge portions.  

I got the combo plate. It came with rice,  pita,  chicken,  beef,  and I added some toppings. The white sauce was highly recommended from yelpers,  so I got some extra,  but didn't need it.  You could definitely make 2 meals from one plate.  

I wouldn't say it was the BEST halal I've ever had,  but it was pretty darn good, and packed up nicely for to go."}
{"text":"Just like their NYC food trucks! I'm so happy to see them here in Vegas. The combo platter is so amazingly delicious with white sauce and just a few drops of hot sauce. And just like the food trucks on 53rd & 6th, there's nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"It's the most average middle eastern place I've ever eaten. If you want something extremely quick and have no where else to go then I'd go there, they just give way to much iceberg lettuce and mediocre meat, and on top of that you have to pay something like $3 for hummus. It's really not bad, but not amazing for sure."}
{"text":"This place is seriously over rated. The food is just okay tasting. I've tried this place twice and the meat lacked flavor and was dry. The only thing that made it taste better is the white sauce. There are other Mediterranean places that are better in the area. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Things I love about The Halal Guys ~

The food! I always stick to what works for me here which is a beef/gyro bowl smothered with white sauce and drizzled with BBQ sauce. When all the delicious ingredients get mixed together it's truly a bite of heaven. (Gyro meat, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, a few small slices of pita and the sauces). The rice here is the best rice I've ever had! My man always gets the gyro sandwich with the same sauce combination and he loves it. Our food has been consistent and it's one of our favorite quick meals. 

Side note ~ for all the chicken lovers like me. I'm not a fan of the chicken at all here and if you happen to be disappointed by it, you should give the beef a chance. It's AMAZING!

The cons ~ 

The service isn't consistently great but I can say that it is most of the time. The parking can be tight because this location is in a very small plaza with tons of other businesses. Small shop equals not too many tables & chairs so prepare to take yours to go occasionally. The decor is probably my least favorite part. I don't enjoy the hard & cold in winter metal chairs and I'd seriously love to give it a makeover and keep it modern but make it sleek & a little sexy. 

But even with the cons, we truly love the flavors and the meat is incredibly flavorful. It's on the higher side as far as pricing goes but you'll taste where that comes from with the fresh ingredients. Also, don't forget to check-in on Yelp for your complimentary baklava which is a very nice touch and always delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Their chicken actually tasted better than the halal guys in East Village, NY! No longer need to fly to NYC to get an awesome meal. Wishing it great success! Will be back. Always go for the combo dish. Watch out for the hot sauce..Its deadly."}
{"text":"Great Service!! Even better food. The combo platter is the bomb and the baklava. Don't miss this place"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. There was no line, 3 employees, we stood there for 10 minutes and not one employee acknowledged us. No hello, or be with you in just a moment was said."}
{"text":"The service was on par with the original. I can't say for sure but the platter seemed to be a little smaller than the one in New York but the taste was just the same. I'm guessing they are justifing the cost increase because of the restaurant set up rather than a stall. All in all amazing experience and also comes with the extra long lines..:p just like in NYC!"}
{"text":"Waited a few weeks to go here to wait for the crowds to die down. All in all, I don't think it was worth the hype. The food is sort of bland, the white sauce wasn't very flavorful, and the hot sauce was WAY TOO HOT, I almost couldn't finish my plate. Honestly I've had much better Mediterranean style food at other, less expensive and less busy places in Vegas. Most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I have one word for this....TRASH. I'd  only come back for their French fries and BBQ SAUCE. Id rather eat cup of noodles"}
{"text":"I've had it at the carts years ago in NYC.  That was amazing.

This storefront Toronto location - not so much.  I got the regular chicken platter w/ hummus, extra white and hot sauce.

Sauces are nothing special to note.  Rice was meh, nothing at all distinguishable about it.  Chicken was pretty disappointing.  I'ts just average taste here, and incredibly expensive (After tax this was more than $15) 

Stick with your local toronto joint - much better taste and flavour."}
{"text":"Most excellent choice of food from Mediterranean region. Fresh shredded beef and chicken with rice and few pieces of naan and multiple choices of your favorite toppings. Must try it to be hooked."}
{"text":"Actually pretty decent. I thought I would be disappointed comparing it to the original Halal Guys on the streets of New York, however, I was surprised that this tasted pretty good. Ordered the chicken platter and it was a good late night meal. There were some completely brown rotten pieces of lettuce though, which was disgusting. The hot sauce packet that the cashier gave me was also really sticky and gross. Prices are inflated but I guess that can be expected at Caesars."}
{"text":"I get that this place is new-ish and exciting so it was very busy, but the service was still strange and not great. It was my first time there and even though they have a massive assembly line of workers none of them lent much info on how you're supposed to order. I ended up with a chicken wrap with just tons of crappy lettuce and tomato. The sauce, which they just called \"white sauce\" (which I had to ask them about twice as to what it actually was since I'm sans lactose) is a mayo based sauce with \"secret spices\". These secret spices didn't at all sit well with me, not my taste. I've had plenty of shawarma/Lebanese style sandwiches, but none have ever tasted like this. Hey, some people might love it, but it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Food was bland. 
NYC was way better.   Had the chicken and gyro combo and the meat was bland. The sauce saved it a bit but would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm from NJ area, so I've often had pleasure of enjoying the original location in NYC. We always get combo platters with beef and chicken, but the main ingredient that makes this place amazing is the white and red sauce. In my opinion without those sauces the food won't hold up. The white sauce is creamy and delicious, while the red sauce is extremely spicy, but in small quantity it can add more flavors. They used to keep the bottles of these sauce on side, but it seems like they know that can make more money by giving one packet per combo and then selling you extra sauce packets, which is  a bummer. But if I ran the business I would absolutely do that.  They also sell baklava, which is awesome. Yelp check-in gets you a free baklava as well."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight and both the food and service were good. We arrived at 9:00 and there was still a little crowd. The food is not quite as flavorful as getting it from the stands in NYC but was close enough. The white and red sauce were on point. I thought the portions were quite a bit smaller than what I was used to in NYC. You don't get much for $10. I would come back sometime and am happy to have a franchise here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this place with all the hype of it coming from New York to Las Vegas. Plus , I was really craving Mediterranean food. Sadly , the food left a lot to be desired.

I got the regular sized combo platter based on suggestions. The combo platter comes with chicken , beef , rice , lettuce , tomatoes and pita. The meat (especially the chicken) and the rice was dry but the white sauce helps make it more bearable. The reason for the 2 star rating is because there was nothing really special about the food. My 3 other friends who dined in with me also got the combo platter and said the same thing too. It's eatable , but nothing really stands out or makes you really want to come back. At least it's affordable and portion size was good - I paid around 10$ for my meal and saved the other half for dinner.

For you spice lovers , get the red sauce but beware it is spicy. TRY A LITTLE BIT BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON YOUR FOOD. I would say it is spicier than habanero and closer towards ghost pepper spicy but not all the way that spicy. I put waaay too much red sauce on mine and my lips swelled up for a good hour. I also went on a day when the A/C was broken and it was super humid in there. I still wonder to this day how I even ate half of my food at that time.

I do like how the service here is fast and friendly. They are open until 4 AM and it's not too far from the Las Vegas strip (being in Chinatown). I feel that this location is great for those late night , post clubbing eats when anything sounds good haha."}
{"text":"The food tasted different from the one that had in New York. The portion was also different. I'd say their small size is too small."}
{"text":"I tried The Halal Guys for the first time in NYC and fell in love with the food so I was ecstatic to hear they were coming to Tempe, and just a few miles from my house! I finally went in for lunch on Tuesday and got a small combo (gyro & chicken) platter and it was definitely reminiscent of the food cart in New York, although it was lacking a little flavor. Not a problem for me though, I just add some extra white sauce and a tiny bit of red sauce (be careful, the red sauce is no joke) and all is good!"}
{"text":"Forget the white sauce, their baba ghanouj is some of the best I've ever had. Also underrated: the falafel. Add on a couple pieces to your order, they're only a buck each.

Everyone seems to be eating the platters exclusively, so I started with a sandwich. The wraps are enormous- gyro meat is ground, which was not expected and isn't my preference, and wasn't my favorite meat. The chicken was nicely seasoned and robustly flavored. Unfortunately, the cold pita tore easily and just didn't taste that great, and the overall wrap needed the white sauce to keep the flavors interesting and provide moisture. 

Returned for an event and got a platter- combined the meats I loved, the chicken and falafel, with their rice, and added extra white sauce and a touch of red. This was a solid meal. Add on a piece of baklava if it's available, this version isn't drenched in honey like other places. The $10 meal will definitely have leftovers.

Service is fair- staff is friendly, line moves quick, wasn't thrilled about how my order went all the way down the line through four employees who all noticed the torn pita issue and yet none of them thought to start over with one that wasn't falling apart.

A little confused about this choice of location, which is super small and has a hectic parking lot. Proximity to the Strip makes it an easy option to Uber- plus they're open til 4AM, just like NY."}
{"text":"Luis gave my fianc√© and I the best costumer service not to mention the amazing food!!!!"}
{"text":"great restaurant the sauce is amazing had chicken platter the hot sauce is really hot"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price!

I would recommend the combo platter with white and one line of red sauce. Two lines and you will be hurting. 

This place is also brand new so it's super clean and super nice compared to most surrounding places to eat that are a little run down."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The portion sizes are massive so you will always have some left over for later! I hope they bring a location to the west valley ASAP because I could eat this on the regular."}
{"text":"So I got food from this place last night 
A combo plate 
Had it delivered by doordash 
It didn't take long but the food was cold 
Had to heat it up \"wtf\". How to separate hot food from the cold side to heat the food up 
After that didn't really enjoy the food...
Maybe it's hot if you eat that the place and not delivery"}
{"text":"The food was great! Im a picky eater but I love the food here! I got the combo plate with chicken and gyro. I prefer the chicken more and so do my kids. The hot sauce is hot!!! I also enjoy the white sauce but it taste great even without any sauce. Highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. I've had better food at Montreal mall foodcourts.
I Paid $12.99? For a regular sized falafel plate with the following ingredients: Lettuce, tomato, rice and falafel.

Tahini- They don't have it, instead they use \"white sauce\" to save $ which is basically mayo
Hummus- $1.50 extra
Talboleh (or any other salad)- Non-existent, they serve lettuce instead.

I'm a fan of middle eastern food, but they've cut way too many corners and the price isn't reflective of the offerings."}
{"text":"Fast food, affordable. It's in a convenient location from uofT so I had too much of Halal guys. It's also open till late. I usually get the chicken- gyro platter with white sauce and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Wow! Seriously impressed by these guys! Came in not really knowing what would be good here, but the staff was wonderfully helpful. The manager with the beard was superb in guiding me through everything. I didn't even know what half the stuff on the menu was, but he walked me through it and ended up getting their spicy chicken. It was soooo yummy! I'm impressed! Even the baklava(?) I think it's called was delicious. Sweet and tasteful! Going to definitely come by here more often!"}
{"text":"Here's yet another 5 star review of Halal Guys, like they need it, but I adore this place so I'm going to say my peace anyways. 

Being part middle eastern, I was extremely excited about this place opening. There's not enough of that genre of food in this town and I was excited for a fast food option (wish it was a little closer to my home, but maybe it's better that way!) They did not disappoint. 

The food is outstanding. And appeals to everyone being as it's just chicken, beef, and for the adventurous soul, falafel. The chipotle style of service works well for them. You can pick and chose which options you want on top of your customized platter or sandwich. Also a side of fries, falafel, or baklava can add a cherry on top of your perfect meal. 

The best thing about this place is the white sauce. Oh the white sauce. And they have giant bottles at each table so that each customer can douse their food in it, or if you are a weirdo, only have a little. 

Overall this place is amazing. Even if you haven't ever tried middle eastern cuisine, give this place a whirl. It's a great segway into that type of cuisine."}
{"text":"The beef gyro is awesome!  Adding the White sauce makes it even better. The HOT SAUCE will make your insides explode!"}
{"text":"When I read positive reviews of the place, it is justified, and their restaurant and employees are somewhat new.  Thanks for giving us some of the magic that your company had from when you were in the streets of New York."}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday around lunch time, first thing I noticed as soon as I arrived were multiple signs posted on the windows letting people know that their AC Unit is currently down until further notice, just a minor inconvenience , they had 3 fans set up around the restaurant, and one of them was next to the tables which blocked some of the chairs. They were giving out free Mini-Bottles of water to make up for the lack of AC I assume. 

Also as soon as you arrive, you'll be greeted by an employee telling you to watch out for the hot sauce, you'd be wise to listen to her unless you wanna spend the entire day at the soda fountain! It wasn't too busy so me and my friends got our food pretty quick, we all had the combo platter which comes with Gyro Beef, Chicken, Salad, Tomatoes, Rice, and Pita Bread.  Sauces proved were White sauce, Hell-in-a-bottle sauce, and BBQ sauce which tasted like some cheap generic kraft sauce. As far as the food quality goes, there was nothing really amazing about it, the beef and chicken left something to be desired and I was the poor unfortunate fool that got stuck with the almost stale Pita bread. According to my friends who've been to NYC, the menu is much bigger and they serve lamb as well! 

I've definitely had better Mediterranean food and probably won't be returning anytime soon unless my friends peer pressure me into going. Sorry Halal Guys, You may have 3 fans but I'm definitely not one of them!"}
{"text":"COME because you are trendy, hyped, and want to rekindle memories of NYC.
LEAVE because you never got to board the bandwagon.

The Halal Guys leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I never tried the original in NYC so I have no baseline to compare their latest franchise location. I do, however, know good middle eastern food when I eat it. Maybe that's unfair, though. This is to middle eastern food what Cafe Rio is to Mexican food. That's too bad because its roots started legit and grew deep.

Like the food pyramid, let's start at the base: rice with chopped lettuce and tomatoes. This rice is dry in a way that makes no sense. The lettuce is some iceberg. The tomatoes - flavorless, unripe whatever. These are ingredients indiscernible from Taco Bell's production line.

Next level: the meat. It's your run of the mill crispy-ish \"shawarma meat.\" Nothing special going on here. Seasoning is a moot point because of the next level.

Top level: the white sauce. Unless you tell them otherwise, the assumption is \"I would like a gallon of sauce, please.\" What ever magic potion is in the sauce, it's good. If this sauce wasn't good The Halal Guys would be out of business. It covers the meat, making that crispy-warm-liquid-savory layer that gets you hooked. It's like the sauce on your all-you-can-eat sushi: the sushi roll is merely the vessel. There's a small strip of their hot sauce as well. Hot is an understatement, really. That red sauce is a fire in your mouth.

The top-top level: a few pieces of bread. It's bread.

I know, I'm coming down on The Halal Guys hard. They could have, and should have, done better. This is the age of the \"open production line\" restaurant. Chipotle, Cafe Rio, PizzaRev, etc. They're all efficient at what they do and designed to be inoffensive to accommodate the masses. This is what makes investors and franchisers happy and so I understand it's not going to be the finest of middle eastern culinary experiences. The let-down is the missed opportunity to upgrade the product from its lowly food cart origins where generic lettuce, tomatoes, and dry rice is acceptable - even charming! At this stage, though, there's simply better choices for your time and money."}
{"text":"The sauces are the best part. I ordered the platter and it was mostly rice. It was good to try and I would eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats. Food was cold and half my order was missing. Not the drivers fault. There is no flavor! The \"white sauce\" tastes like ranch. Very disappointed! Also I ordered a regular coke and got diet. I will never order or recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place and I make my cousin take me here as soon as I land in Vegas. The only problem is I landed at midnight and they were already closed by the time we got here. Not to worry, a few days later I made my cousin take me back again during dinner hours and I got my usual. Combo plate with falafel on the side. I don't know what it is...the combo gyro plate with white sauce allllllll over is extremely satisfying, with a small dab of burn your ass red sauce. 

BOTTOM LINE: Combo platter, white sauce all over, with 6 red dots is the perfect ratio for me. 

BONUS: they deliver through one of the local delivery services."}
{"text":"*Edit* - now that ive had halal guys at least twice in Montreal Im convinced the Toronto location isnt doing something right. The portion size and quality of meat is a lot better in MTL.
______

I'm not going to try to compare it to the food truck on NYC because I think somethings shouldn't be compared to the original. Where it started will always have a different appeal to it. 

Firstly I'm super thrilled Halal guys is here. I had it first in Manhattan and then in Montreal and now in Toronto. In terms of quality and taste I've found all three restaurant locations to be very comparable. Also when you douse everything in that delicious white sauce can you even taste anything else?!? Lol.

I got the combo platter with white and hot sauce. For folks who haven't been here and don't do too well with heat watch out for the hot sauce. A single serving will set your mouth on fire. But it's soooooooo good. 
When the girl behind the counter was serving the meat I did think the portion looked smaller but maybe my eyes are just greedy. Once I sat down to eat I did get a piece of meat or two in every bite. Or maybe because I got very little rice and more salad so I couldn't tell. No complaints though! 

I'll be returning and will see if they're consistently good. I'm hoping so because I'm rooting for Halal guys to be successful in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Affordable and filling. Do not skimp with the WHITE SAUCE!
Unfortunately, my falafel was hard as nails...stick with the chicken and gyro.
Parking can be a challenge depending on the time of day.
I don't think I'd drive out here for lunch..but if I needed a quick bite after a night out, I would consider this as a good option."}
{"text":"A great addition to the Caesars Palace Food Court. For just $12 (platter) or $10 (sandwich), you can come away feeling full (and not entirely ripped off). 
Combo (chicken & gyro) platter was served up quickly & the portions were more than enough for a hearty meal. 

Compared to the Spring Mountain Location: I didn't see any option to add green peppers, olives, or jalapenos...but I didn't think to ask. White sauce is limited to one squeeze bottle behind the counter (I asked her to go HEAVY with the WHITE SAUCE). If you find that you don't have enough on your food, I did see other customers go back for an extra squeeze or two.

Other reviewers mentioned late night hours...although I haven't personally been, I can see myself ordering another combo platter after a night out on the Strip."}
{"text":"I just ordered from uber eats halal and I normally love it, but today along with my other co workers was very disappointed. We all ordered the chicken platter and all 3 of us had dry and burnt chicken. This is unacceptable that they can charge 12 +plus tax for a meal that is like eating jerky! I don't mind spending the money either, clearly I have eaten her before.... But you should never send food out of your restaurant that is not perfection!

Update:
Right after I posted this review Angela reached out to me I believe she's the GM. She apologized for the bad experience and wanted to make up for it. She offered me and my 2 co-workers a free meal next time we come in. I wasn't sure if the girls would want to order again, until I talked to them . We decided to give it a go again since every Saturday we order out as a ritual of ours (our cheat meal). I text Angela and she was so helpful and took care of the whole thing. When it arrived we were all nervous... Pleasantly surprised though! The chicken looked perfect not dry at all, we all took our first bites and agreed that this was the best we had ever received from halal!! The flavor was on point! So a big thank you to Angela for making us all believers again!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for Shawerma or middle eastern food than this is definitely the wrong place. This place should serve hard shell tacos with the dinners and rename the place The Taco Guys because it tastes exactly like a taco salad with rice. 
Save your time, money and colon....what a disappointment. Fake hype"}
{"text":"The amount of food you get for the price is amazing.  The special sauce is worth it.  The hot sauce is REALLY hot, beware.  The food taste is definitely above average but not a street cart in NYC, so if you've been blown away by that, don't go in here with that expectation.  But for AZ it's pretty awesome.  It's also efficient and quick which is why I gave it a perfect rating."}
{"text":"So I had the original halal guys in NYC... Is this the same... Sadly no. But it is cool that they are here in Vegas in a store front instead of on the open streets. Just for that alone I give them props. 

I had the beef gyro sandwich and my bf had the beef gyro platter. The sandwich was decent. I added the onions, been peppers and olives to my dish and it added more texture and flavor. On my next visits I got the platter as well and added everything in it again. The flavor is good.... Maybe it's the nostalgic memories but the flavors are great. I would recommend the platter as I think it's a better deal overall... And I would pass on the rice as I do not think that it had alot of flavor. 4/5

I would also recommend eating in instead of take out... Why? My main reason would be the sauce. When you get your items to go... They charge you extra for extra sauce BUT when your are dining in.... You can get as much sauce as you want by taking the squeeze bottles directly to your table. :) 

And the hot sauce is actually spicy so be careful! And they are stored in a cold table by the drink station so you know that the sauces are kept cold and sanitary and I appreciate it. 

Their baklava is ok... But u can't complain since it was free!! Lol 

Ambiance... It's ok... It always feels a little cold to me... But I go there for the food so I'm ok... But I think that the decor could be changed. 3/5

Service is normally? on point.  As soon as you walk in... You are greeted and if you tell them that you have never been... They explain the menu to you. 5/5

So far so good. I have not been disappointed since I've started to come here."}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0
 
I've been to the original food cart a few years back so I decided to check out the first franchise brick and mortar location here in Toronto that just opened recently. As expected, there were line ups even at around 2pm. However it moved relatively quickly. It took around 25 minutes to order and get my food.

Personally, the original one in New York was nothing amazing to begin with and this one here is more or less the same. I think it was more of a tourist spot than anything else. But at $6 USD back then, it was a very reasonable price, the portion was fairly substantial and it was decent overall for a quick meal.

I had the beef gyro platter as I wasn't a fan of their chicken. The white sauce was decent as usual with the beef gyro and rice. The most memorable part was definitely the hot sauce!

Overall it isn't worth lining up for especially at their price point. But feel free to check it out if it doesn't look too busy to fulfill your curiosities. I think Toronto actually has some pretty good places already for these types of dishes and at a much lower price."}
{"text":"Pros :

Large portion of combined gyro beef and chicken 
Nice tasting rice 
White sauce is tasty

Cons:

$17
Extra for hummus
Extra for falafel
The beef had a weird smoky aftertaste
The staff might be under instructions to sell up 
( I thought I said chicken gyro sandwich and got the combo platter)


Conclusion:

Not the best shwarma in Toronto or even in this section of the city. Try Mzaar just up Yonge or Paramount at a comparable price point."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype I decided to try Halal Guys for myself! 

If you plan on eating at a curtain time or have somewhere to be, come early as the line ups can take some time. I would say that from start to finish of standing in line to actually getting your food would be about 30 minutes, give or take. This will improve with time as the staff is still being trained and isn't running 100% just yet. 

I came with a friend and we ordered two regular shawarma plates, one chicken and one gyro in order to test out the two different choices of meat. Both were amazing! We ordered white sauce on both and just a small line of hot sauce. Be carful when asking for hot sauce, a few drops is enough! If you like spicy food, ask for less hot sauce than you are used to because this one packs a punch! I think the price on a regular plate is $15. 

What really stood out to me is how the staff treated everyone! It was refreshing to see smiles on their faces. Every single staff member I talked to in the line while ordering my food wished me a good day! I was very impressed with this! It is much better service than what you see today. 

Halal Guys earned my business! I will be coming back again and again and again."}
{"text":"Not good at all and overpriced. The food has very little flavor and they have very few options. Nothing was made fresh and it tasted as if it had been made the day before"}
{"text":"Good quick food.  Ordered the plate with chicken and rice and it's all pretty good.  Get the garlic sauce and go crazy.  I didn't like the humus so I wouldn't recommend it.  Room for eating inside it was me and my little family kids enjoyed the food too."}
{"text":"Limited menu which made it quick and easy to order. The food was wonderful and fresh. Had the chicken and gyro combo platter with salad. Next time will get the rice only with meat. They have this red sauce that's hotter than a jalapeno so be careful if spice is not your thing which is not mine. My friend had the white and red sauce and eyes watered instantly. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"It's a nice substitute for the original food cart in NY, but it's more expensive and the portion size is a bit smaller. The white sauce though is still just as good, and the hot sauce just as spicy. 

Get the combo platter, and if you've waited in line you might as well get the regular size, because the small just won't be enough for all that halal guys goodness.

The chicken is well flavoured, though it definitely didn't really taste the same as ny, but maybe thats just nostalgia talking. I preferred the beef gyro, nice texture and well spiced and flavourful. The rice was pretty much the same as ny, and a little sweet."}
{"text":"I was a little iffy going here. A friend had recommended it and he idea just didnt seem pleasing. Once i received my bowl the appearance was not impressive. A couple bites into and i was totally meh... i mixed it up a little more and added more white sauce.. and the more bites i took the more i fell in love! Wow. Absolute delish! 

Definitely a good spot and hopefully I'll get another chance to try it out again."}
{"text":"First time I went last week it was good, but man oh man even a single line of hot sauce can overcome some seasoned tastebuds. An hour ago I picked up the same item to-go, Small Beef and Chicken platter. Right off the bat I could smell something burnt but the meat looked fine. Once the taste of the sauce would drown out, I was left with a horrendous burnt taste in my mouth. My roommate had the same complaint. We think this is because they don't scrape their grill frequently, and the meat on there absorbs the charred smell. Very disappointed, and I can't even finish my food because now that the sauce is gone all I can taste is burnt beef and chicken. Not worth the hype."}
{"text":"This is the second location of The Halal Guys that opened last month on St-Denis. More spacious and cleaner, the staff is friendly and menu is simple -gyro sandwich-chicken, steak or falafel-8$ with tax, plates (combination of rice , salad and meat with a slice of pita bread), poutine and refillable fountain drinks! Of course we can't forget the infamous white sauce (almost like ranch dressing) and red sauce (very spicy be warned!!) that was stored in their own  cute little mini fridge!

Definitely like this location better than the first. Your  after clubbing/bar hopping food scene just got a little more comfort food!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4 because I totally think the original halal guys cart in NY is so much better. 

I love how simple of a menu they have and you get a lot of food. The red sauce is extremely spicy..so I would totally put a dab of it on your food at first. Otherwise, I love the chicken and rice platter with LOTS of their white sauce."}
{"text":"I loooove Halal Guys and nothing beats the street carts of it in NY but it's nice to have some restaurants popping up in the valley. Decided to give the newest location by Christown a shot since I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon. It's a small location and weird placement of the \"order here\" line since it is literally right when you walk in the door so when a line form, it shakes awkwardly. There was one family in front of us and three workers behind the counter. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it's a new restaurant and like a month in of being open but they just didn't seem to have their flow and rhythm working. It took all three of the workers to work on the families order in front of us, and then all three of them again to work on our two platters. It was just slow and no flow behind the counter. But again, benefit of the doubt and probably working out the kinks. All in all the restaurant was clean and had good music playing and The platter of course was yummy. Hopefully they work on the hiccups behind the register, but other than that, the food was delicious and servings of gyro and chicken where plentiful in the platter....PS. I'm actually 9 weeks into a 12 week diet but had my first cheat meal today because my buy 1 get 1 coupon was about to expire. Was not disappointed with breaking my diet for the first time tonight. It was gooood and worth it."}
{"text":"The Halal Guys prove time and again that taste is king. The flavours of meat and rice are on point and the white sauce compliments both, although I wish the hot sauce was less spicy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! Being from NYC I have had this type of food many many times and was never disappointed.  I live and work nearby so I was excited to try this place as soon as it opened. I ordered a side of falafel and a combo platter.  The falafel was crispy but so bland and dry.  The combo platter was ok but nothing to write home to NY about. The staff was very nice and I assume that the restaurant will do well since they are close to ASU and open late."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. The service was quick and friendly! The girl working the counter explained everything and was polite. The Gyro was excellent ! They also have a hot sauce that I didn't try... maybe next time!
This is a easy place to find and a very clean place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered our platters through ubereats and it arrived pretty quickly. I got the chicken platter and my wife got the falafel plate. She liked thr fried falafels but there were only 4 smallish chunks of it. And the rest was rice and lettuce. The white sauce does make the plate edible. So kudos for delicious white sauce. My chicken platter I would order it again, I enjoyed every bite. The portion sizes are large, I barely ate all of mine and my wife could only finish half. All in all, we probly wouldn't bother calling this places' name for dinner again."}
{"text":"I just had an AMAZING experience at your restaurant!!! The food was AWESOME and I love the toppings that your location added! Also, love the fact that I can put as much sauce as I want on the food because you guys have a sauce bar that allows us to have as much sauce as we want. 

On top of this I had the BEST service ever from Johnnie. She was very courteous and friendly. One of the nicest fast food employees ever--the kind of service you expect from a great restaurant, not fast food. This is definitely one of the best Halal Guys anywhere, and I will be back. Love you guys!!!"}
{"text":"as fast as the food service was the food itself was not appealing. meat was bland as it could ever be. would not recommend coming here. it's just a bunch of poorly seasoned meats and vegetables tossed into a bowl for a somewhat reasonable price. never coming back."}
{"text":"The food was fresh & tasty. A lot of staff on hand. All friendly! Will diffidently go back!"}
{"text":"Don't order through a delivery service, I have ordered twice and both times have been shorted items. Their to-go service needs improvement. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try it after hearing my girlfriend talk about it so much after her NY trip. Finally tried it today and daaaaaaayum it was pretty bomb. Platter combo is da way to go. White sauce is awesome, but be careful of that red sauce. Don't underestimate it... I did and now I'm sitting on the Oval Office dying. Overall the food is good! Good quality and they give good portions!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Halal Guys for dinner after visiting DaYung's Tea shop since we were in Tempe. What a good choice! The last time I had this was back in 2012 in NYC and I say, it's pretty darn close! Got the gyro and chicken combo platter with a side of falafel. The gyro was AMAZING and the white sauce was to die for. I can drink that sauce all up in a cup! The falafel was good, but not quite like how Sabuddy's used to make them, but the white sauce fixed that. My friends got French fries for the kids and honestly it was really good crispy fries. I liked the juicy flavorful gyro so much I was tempted to get a gyro platter to go since we live half hour away. Next time I'll do that for sure! Be back Guys! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Having hopped around in several halal guys locations around the US including NYC and Chicago. Montr√©al does not carry the same vibe! I think it is the food portions- get more meat for the buck in the US. Although, fairly put the prices are well marked due to the Canadian currency equivalent and taxes. The staff is very friendly! Long line ups of curious locals. I would find myself here if I want to kill a food craving."}
{"text":"Combination plate is so good I'm ordering it again the next day.. chicken was fresh, gyro was cooked perfectly and the whole meal has a good blend of flavors. Don't be stingy with the white sauce, use both packets! .. only con is I wish they would do there own delivery as Postmates doesn't have complete menu"}
{"text":"If you've been to the halal guys on the streets of New York, then you've probably set your expectations too high.

Although this place serves the same food and has a killer hot sauce, I didn't feel like it tasted the same. The price is certainly higher and extra sauce to go will cost ya too. Back in New York, I could eat a whole bowl and each bite was delicious and strangely new. Here, I could barely finish the small sized bowl and not because the serving was too large, but because I felt a bit queasy like I had just had too much fast food.

The only thing I enjoyed was that white sauce, but warning, don't look at the nutritional information. Sad to say, I'm not craving to come back any time soon...."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!! Amazing food and spectacular customer service!! Marshell, Tyra , Laveine are very humble and enthusiastic about their job. They made us feel so welcomed and made our first time experience want to come back again :)"}
{"text":"Going to Halal guys in Montreal is like playing Russian roulette. I've ate this in store and ordered it online many times. On the chance that you get lucky, you can expect great quality and value similar to their chains in NYC. However, they don't have consistency of such quality. Sometimes the vegetables taste funky as if they have been sitting around for too long. And sometimes they give miserly portions of meat making you feel cheated."}
{"text":"Ooo, a taste of New York in Tempe (also known as the barren wasteland for foodies... I came straight from a short stint in LA so I am a little bit spoiled) and OPEN LATE!

I got the falafel platter and loaded it up on the white and hot sauce. The boy serving me seemed incredulous when I asked for ten lines of the hot sauce. (He really asked how many lines.) Boyfriend got the combo platter.

Both platters came to be around $20 total. A little pricy, but they are in a PRIMO location across ASU so they must need to pay the rent.

The owner - I think - asked me and my boyfriend how we were doing as we stood in line. Unfortunately, I wasn't really looking at him and didn't realize he was talking to us until I noticed he was looking at my boyfriend, and even then I was assuming he was talking to the group behind. I'm a little slow, ok.

We came at Saturday morning at 1am... so basically Friday night and it was still pretty busy... but the line moved fast.

Contemplating trying to baklava next time. And I'd probably ask for even more hot and white sauce next time!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 3.5 stars. Only thing I wish was if this place was closer to Gilbert. 

Everything was good! Finally a spicy sauce that is spicy! I'll be coming back to this place a lot."}
{"text":"Walked by a couple of times but the line was really long so waited until today. I should have walked away when I hit the front of the line. First the guy was unwrapping the gyros and they looked they had just been defrosted. Having waited 20 minutes I had committed to this and wasn't going to leave. The second thing that came to my attention was the lack of organization. There were roughly a dozen  employees back there but the line was crawling. I don't blame them as the owner should be there to delegate and move the line along. There were delays along my entire order with literally 4 employees standing near the cashier doing nothing. They had two cashiers but were only operating one. Once again I ask the owner why not have two cashier's? I hope the owner reads this as I hope you succeed but right now I honestly believe this is just a pure hype and people seeing a line. Honestly the plate was mediocre and I've had better hummus at the supermarket. Honestly if you want a better plate go up the road to Cumberland and there is a $5 dollar shawarma plate place, pay the extra for meat and pay $2 for 4 fallafel balls and you'll still spend less than this place. Honestly I fell victim to the hype and social media."}
{"text":"I could never find time to stop by and try the food when in NY. I was excited to see the Halal Guys open in Tempe. We ordered a Gyro plate and a chicken plate with the famous white sauce. Loved the food and our plates were generously filled. Good Halal food is always a great find!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for food that brings you back to that first bite of street food you had in NYC, look no further.

Just as I had remembered it, this food is incredibly delicious and flavorful. 

I took my family here for the first time and they were more than satisfied when we finished our food."}
{"text":"SKIP IT. Suuuuuper bland. To me, this is the poor man's Chipotle. They aren't the same cuisine, but they might as well be. 

FLAVOUR: Chipotle's chicken has more flavor packed into one bite than in an entire Halal Guys meal. Just visually, the meat looks colourless and desert dry, and not even a generous dose of their \"signature sauce\" - which by the way, tastes like watery mayo - can save it. 

ORDERING: They try to do the Chipotle assembly line, but it's really just \"pick a protein\" and \"pick a sauce? Maybe pick more vegetables?\" It's hard to tell because it's hidden behind a counter and unless you were tall, you wouldn't know that you can request peppers and olives and whatever else is hidden there because the staff don't tell you. 

PRICE: At $11 for a small platter - which I found sufficiently filling - it's on par with other downtown portions. However, the quality of the food makes it entirely not worth any money."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are complaining about the portion size. I got the regular plate with half chicken and half beef. Yes they do give you quite a bit of lettuce but even with the lettuce the amount of food was more than enough to share between two people. I was just in NYC in April and the taste of the food is pretty consistent with the food cart in Manhatten. The price is definitely cheaper in the states but I still feel you get your money's worth for what you get. I asked for lots of white sauce and they were more than happy to squeeze lots on my plate. Everyone that works there was super friendly and polite. I will be back!"}
{"text":"First thing i ate when i came from nyc to stay over. This was super disappointing, because we paid 15$ for a platter that is 7$ in nyc. Furthermore, they charge extra for white sauce and the portions arent as packed as they do in nyc. Basically if you want to pay MORE for less, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Menu is simple: either you pick a beef gyro, combo chicken and beef or a falafel.  Choice of either as a sandwich or a platter.  Some sides like fries, baba ganoush or hummus are also available.  I thought it will be like the New York food trucks.  This is actually a much better experience!  Good food , great prices!   I'm glad I tried this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Nothing beats the original but satisfies the craving when needed."}
{"text":"Anticipated their opening since I found out they were opening here in Tempe, AZ. 

Started following The Halal Guys on Instagram, won a contest they held, winning a free platter way before they even opened here. 

The Grand Opening was great. Busy, but definitely worth the wait. Owners outside greeting and talking to the crowd. 
But now on to the most important part of all... THE FOOD! 
Let's just speak in emojis 

The Chicken and Gyro... so moist, deliciousness bursting in your mouth. Not to mention their special white sauce .  The falafel was being given out as samples, super yummy as well. With our order we also tried the hummus and fries. 
The Halal Guys did not disappoint! #1"}
{"text":"The first time I came here the hype was SO REAL. Everything about the food was amazing. The chicken plate I ordered in a size large was more than enough. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The lettuce and tomatoes were crisp and fresh. The pita bread complimented everything nicely. And that white sauce. That beautiful, luscious, creamy white sauce... goes well on anything.

I am not much of a fan of the beef. I feel like the chicken is their prize winner here. 

Service is always prompt and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"My initial visit to The Halal Guys had me impressed and hungry for more. I was excited to indulge in their food and welcomed The Halal Guys as a potential competitor to Chipotle in the Tempe-ASU area. 

On my first visit, the lines were out the door, which left me feeling both excited for the food and irritated because I had to wait. After reaching the entrance and getting past the bouncer, I approached the friendly staff at the counter and asked for a combo plate. I glanced at the menu and looked around the store, but had to double take at the menu one more time to make sure I read the right prices. 8.99$ for a regular platter. When making my decision, I looked at the man in front of me, who opted for the costly 6.99$ wrap, and noticed his sandwich was much smaller than the menu image made it out to be. Assured that I had made the right choice, I proceeded to walk along the counter, mesmerized by the teamwork and mass production of food by the staff. The employee added two heaping spoonfuls of rice which I oddly assumed was cheese, a scoop of crunchy water (lettuce), a scoop of flavorless tomatoes, a pitiful spoonful of gyro, a lackluster spoonful of beef, and 4 mini triangular pieces of pita bread. Unbeknownst to me, you are allowed to add onions, green onions, and olives as free extras, however I was uninformed of this by the busy staff. The employee then asked me if I would like white sauce, red sauce, or barbecue sauce but I asked for all three on the side (to get more quantity). To finish it all off, the staff placed my to-go meal in a high quality yellow Halal Guys plastic bag, which felt silky smooth and amazing to touch.

When I reached home, I was eager to try the food. I opened the legendary white sauce and drizzled it over my food. SO MUCH WHITE SAUCE. I sampled the rice alone and found it excessively greasy, but satisfying. The crunchy water and flavorless tomatoes added meaningless bulk to the meal. Both of the meats, gyro and beef, tasted average and were not horrible, but were not amazing either. The flavor particularly came from the white sauce and red sauce. The legendary white sauce was creamy and delicious, tasting like ranch dressing but with less kick. However, spoon after spoon of creamy, fattening white sauce with the greasy orange rice had my taste buds begging for something new. I drizzled the red sauce over the platter and was in for a surprise. This sauce was made for Satan himself. While not adding spicy flavor to the meal, the sauce tasted extremely hot and added excitement and variety to the greasy repetitive nature of the meal. The mini pita pieces were soft and delicious (I would recommend adding an extra pita for a dollar). 

After return visits to the restaurant, I have found the food tasting dull, greasy, and flavorless, even in spite of adding the optional extras and trying their hummus. I also observed a decline in the quality of service they provide. On one visit, two of the employees looked stoned (which I do not mind), but they forgot to include my white and red sauce on the side in the bag, the very essence of Halal Guys. On two other visits, I was charged different amounts for the same combination platter I usually get. The staff is not as friendly as they initially were, and the overall food quality has declined from its initial opening. I would not expect more from a fast food restaurant but I was hoping for more.

Despite my critique of the store, I was initially astonished and satisfied by the food. For 8.99$, the quantity of food is decent and Halal Guys offers a fresh take on fast food in the Tempe-ASU area. Additionally, the hours are great, midnight on most days and 4AM on Saturday."}
{"text":"First off we came during Ramadan, got here at 8:20 with a line up out the door, Iftar was aylt 8:55... We didnt get to order until 9:25. 

There were 7 or 8 people working, it was unbelievably disorganized. I am a vegetarian, they have these little over fried falafals. The worst part was the hot sauce... This stuff is literally too hot for my brown friends who are used to a consistent level of spice. It was ridiculously hot. Ruined the plate, I couldn't even eat more than a few bites! 

I mean overall it was just awful. Can't stress how unorganized the staff is."}
{"text":"I went here after reading some reviews on Yelp. However, when I was ordering an employee came out from the back and started chatting with the person serving me. She said she couldn't wait to go home because she was sick. I almost walked out at that point but they had pretty much already made my order so I would feel bad. I didn't get sick, but that was so off putting.

I had the combo plate because I wanted to try both meats. The meats were good but not great. The flavors didn't pop as much as I thought they would. The platter is basically a few cups of rice and lettuce and then topped with a bit of meat and other vegetables like olive, tomato, onion, jalape√±o. I was a bit disappointed that for $10 they didn't give many sliced olives or onion. I think I had about 4 slices of olives (like canned sliced olives). Though there was a decent amount of meat. The pita bread was soft, warm, and almost doughy. It was good bread. The white sauce is basically just spiced mayonnaise if you read the ingredients, you will see it reads like a jar of mayo. The hot sauce was good, good spiced flavor and very very hot. Actually way too hot for me so I didn't have a savory spiced sauce to use. I wish they had a mild version of this sauce.

I'd give this place 3 stars, but the comment I heard about an employee being sick ruined it all."}
{"text":"So glad there's a halal guys in Vegas. This location is probably better than the one on the strip. Huge shoutout to Ruby and her one other sidekick working on New Year's Eve at 4pm. The phone was going off the hook and there were so many people wanting to eat halal guys, Ruby kept her cool and she was busting her butt. I hope she gets a raise because that place gets hectic. Whoever owns this place should think about adding at least one more person to busy holiday shifts, it's definitely not fair seeing the only two running around, trying to serve 15 people not even counting the Postmates orders (about 6). Food is good, service is excellent."}
{"text":"So this is a gyro/chicken/falafel type place. It comes as either a platter with a bed of rice and vegetables with a piece of pita or as a gyro style wrap. The menu consists of just the items mentioned above with a few sides like fries, hummus, bakalava. It through me off  a little with how simple the menu was but it's not unlike other places like raising cane's and in and out where they just do one main item well. 

The place is fast food, so your in and out or you can dine in their dining area. The food experience was pretty good. I got the combo platter with chicken and gyro meat. They ask if you want side toppings like onions, jalapeno, olives etc. I liked the gyro meat better than the chicken personally but my girlfriend liked the chicken. The gyro meat was a little bit greasy so keep that in mind if you can't decide between the meats and grease/oil isn't your thing.Than there's their white sauce which is like the \"special sauce\". It's really rich and creamy with probably a mayonnaise or cream base. I was expecting a tzatziki type sauce like you find in most gyros but it was different. It's not tangy or herb tasting like tzatziki just creamy. They also have barbecue sauce which I didn't try and hot sauce. Careful, their hotsauce actually is quite spicy even for a spicy lover myself. 

Overall this is a cool place to get a quick Mediterranean/halal meal. Something different right in the center of the Asian food scene around it. Not bad, not amazing but definitely different."}
{"text":"I was so excited when Halal Guys finally made its way over to Las Vegas. I came here on a Friday night and there was plenty of parking. I was only ordering takeout and it was a really quick grab-and-go spot. You can also substitute falafel for one of the combo plates, which does take an extra 3 minutes to fry.  They also give you more than enough white and red sauce packets, and make you pay if you want extra. Beware with the red sauce because it is really spicy! Compared to the New York street carts, it doesn't taste exactly the same but its similar. Compared to the OC location, it's about the same to me.  It satisfies the craving but I would take New York over Vegas Halal Guys any day."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a while and was able to go try for lunch on Saturday. We ordered a regular size combo plate with some garlic sauce on the side, a 4 piece falafel, and a side of hummus. It didn't disappoint. The hummus was tangy & delicious, the garlic sauce was fabulous! It's probably my favorite garlic sauce I've had at any Mediterranean restaurant. The combo plate was enough to feed both of us... The gyro delicious, the chicken was good but nothing fabulous. Their rice was very good, and I'm not normally a rice person. The hot sauce was hot... But very very good. The falafel was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The pita was yummy, but nothing special. I have to say we both thoroughly enjoyed the lunch. We will definitely be back.... I'm glad it lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"My husband had it in NYC and he feels like the Toronto location is quite good as well. Their shawarma tastes very different from other places - meat is not oily or greasy at all, tastes like almost steamed. Half of the bowl is veggies, less than the amount of rice, so it's extremely healthy. The hot sauce is crazily spicy but somehow after I ate it my stomach was not upset, which is the first time ever for me. It feels like overall a healthier option than other shawarma places."}
{"text":"I appreciate the concept and the fact that its not another Amir/Basha clone for once.


The small combo plate is 11, large is 13, the beef looks like ground beef and is sitting in a mettalic tub.

The chicken is a bit better, the rice is very ordinary
And the salad is just lettuce and tomato.

The portions are much smaller than elsewhere and its $3 extra for fries.

The good is that the white sauce is unique and the bbq sauce kind of helps with the flavor.

The red sauce is pure insanity, just a smidge and it will overpower anything , use at your own risk.

The decor is very upscale for a chicken shawarma type of place, so bonus points"}
{"text":"Ordered the combo platter and had it delivered by UberEATS. Granted I placed my order at 2:30 am (I work graveyards), the meat was cold, rice lacked flavor and I prefer to have more pita to eat the meat with. They also failed to provide silverware and napkins.

It's a no, from me."}
{"text":"It's tasty, but it's not as good as New York, and given that the mighty Boustan is 2 blocks away, I'd say this place won't be successful for long. Their prices are far too high. In New York, the meat is succulent, freshly grilled, and chopped up before being put on the plate. In Montreal, the employee scooped up pre-cooked meat from a heated container on the counter. Also the rice is not as good as in New York. It is undercooked. Go to NYC for the real thing. It is so good you can cry. If I'm near Concordia in Montreal, I'n going to Boustan. For 10$, you eat like a king and everything is beyond fresh. You can really tell when food is prepared with love."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my vegan friend.  For me, the the chicken gyro was delicious and filling, I'd say not bad for the price. 

However, NOT A VEGAN FRIENDLY RESTAURANT! Halal Guys would be a sketch. They offer falafel, which is a chickpea/ bean mixture that is fried. 

My friend and I kept watch just in case any non-vegan contamination occurred because of my friend's diet. We observed that the gentleman had grabbed a pita that was TOUCHING the pile of chicken on the grill. Not sure if that is their way of keeping the pita warm, but this did not seem sanitary or effective. 

Maybe the workers were new, but I'd hope to see (one day) that these workers will be aware of what is \"vegan\" and what is not. i.e their white sauce (which was almost drenched into the vegan gyro) is not vegan due to egg yolks. They do offer a different vegan sauce, so be cautious and keep watch. 

My friend and I didn't make it a big deal, but this is a warning/ lookout for other vegans in the community."}
{"text":"Simple menu - easy to order. Got the combo plate (beef & chicken). The beef gyro meat wasn't in slices, it was more of a crumbly texture, but still tasty good.

The chicken was outstanding (hard to find moist, flavorable chicken sometimes). No questionable parts...yay! I'm a stickler for not having skin or fat in chopped/sliced chicken prepared by others, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality in addition to the flavor.

Only down side was that we got there after they first opened up for the day, and they didn't have all of their items ready in order to have a plate, just a sandwich...but it was worth the 10 minute wait.

And beware the red sauce...it IS spicy."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at Halal guys, easy to order and fast service. Although this time was different. Walked in there was no menu anywhere. Asked for the menu and they handed me a piece of tiny paper with the items to order from. Not convenient at all. 

We also a some loyalty cards with a free item,which they refused to take it because they claimed that they stopped using it since 2017. (Which isn't true considering I came in January and someone to stamp my card).
I understand they stopped using that card but they could have still given us our free item or atleast transferred the point to the new card. Instead of making us waste it.(Felt like a scam). Really disappointed. 

I gave a 2 star because the food is still good."}
{"text":"Updating my review because I've returned consistently and have dealt with amazing staff and generous portions. Plus can't beat the free baklava on check in. :)"}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this place and finally they open one in Arizona! The set up in here is very quick. I asked the girl to explain the menu and how things works there and she seemed very helpful since I'm a new customer. But the food was not what I expected. I got the regular combo which has chicken and gyro over rice with four pieces of pita bread. 

Honestly everything tasted so bland.. Chicken was dry, gyro was so oily, rice was hard and too bland. There was no special taste to the platter. I added the white sauce and that is basically what makes the platter taste very good, without it the dish is very plain and bland. 

Kudos to them for opening very late and right next to a university. Service was nice and helpful. I would definitely be back to try other dishes but I wouldn't get the platter again. (:"}
{"text":"Like many others reviewing this place, I have also been to the NYC original location many times in my years living there. It was our usual late night spot. But Toronto's location is not worth the wait and the quality and taste is poor/average at best. The food doesn't taste very good, bland meat splashed with lots of sauce. I cannot even finish the small platter lying in front of me, which makes me feel slightly sick. Chicken is rubbery and the amount of lettuce and tomato is about half the bowl. I'm surprised it was a disappointment given the hype and line ups. I don't see this place lasting too long - perhaps people who don't know good food will keep it alive!"}
{"text":"I love the beef gyro !!
and the falafal is the best in Tempe!!!"}
{"text":"They've got customer service and cleanliness. One of the staff was seen walking around with a cleansing spray and paper towels cleaning up the surfaces. Washrooms were nice as well.

However, the food itself wasn't too interesting. For $14 + tax, I got a regular platter with chicken/beef gyro combo. They offer hummus for an extra dollar, which I declined.

I found the food quite greasy. I like that there's fresh lettuce and tomatoes to balance things out a bit, but the rice was just really oily. The meat didn't stand out either in terms of flavor.

One thing that was particularly disappointing was the amount of sauce they add. I'm the type of person that eats salad without any dressing, but I figured hey why not if this is how they recommend the dish to be eaten, then I'll have some sauce.

I looked at the cover photos posted by the business and they had nice thin streaks of sauce just lightly drizzed in a zig-zagging pattern across the food, but they just covered the entire bowl in sauce. Looking at other photos, it looks like this is just how they do things here.

It is disappointing that they are covering up the flavors of the food with ridiculous amounts of sauce, and the sauce wasn't that interesting either. Maybe try a squeeze bottle with a smaller hole, or perhaps start with a small amount before ramping it up to the max. It was hard to determine whether the flavor came from the sauce or the meat/rice.

For the record, I enjoyed the hot sauce more than the white sauce."}
{"text":"Very dry beef gyro meat. Tasted like an old left over. Very disappointing. Typical middle eastern restaurant. Second time bad experience. Not coming back"}
{"text":"I came 45 minutes before the opening time, and that was a great decision, right after the line started to pile up. 

When I went in, the staff was friendly, the service was really fast, like less then 4 minutes, but I wouldn't say 1 min. I took the combo platter, as they recommend. They poured the white sauce over, I was worried there wouldn't be enough sauce, but no worries, there's a guy who pass trough all he customers to ask if they want more sauce xD i had some hot sauce on the side. And yes, their hot sauce is the kind which is slow and steady, just a a few drop, mix it up and you'll feel it. 
The platter was full of rice, tomatoes, freshly cut lettuce, beef and chicken and 4 piece of naan - i think it was naan . I ordered a regular, but I wasn't able to finish so i took what's left home. And I think they know it because it's served in a aluminum plate and put in a plastic bag. 

Ps: they had a lucky wheel and I won the one week free food :))"}
{"text":"Came here on their opening weekend not knowing what to expect at all.  The menu is very small but that is good if everything is great.  I got a combo plate with chicken and gyro and it was delicious.  The white sauce is amazing and I drenched my plate in it several times and could've done so a few more.  The hot sauce is extremely hot so be careful as a few drops will do ya!  The only thing I didn't like was the falafel.  This was my first time trying falafel so maybe I just don't like them but they were really dry and tasteless which was a complete turn around from the rest of my meal.  

The food was great but the restaurant needs some work.  We came on opening weekend in the summer and the air was broken, which is understandable but still sucked.  The restaurant is so tiny too with maybe four tables and 3 bar stools which is not ideal for how packed this place was or plans to be.  For that reason and because it is far from me, I was not interested in coming back although the food was good.  I didn't want to get it to go and have it be cold when I got home.  That being said, I have actually craved it once or twice more since then and may have to venture out there again at some point."}
{"text":"Really awful customer service. The white guy their was so rude. Ended going somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff!   And they are not allowed to accept tips!??  The management should change that.  Great service deserves to be recognized by their customers ;)"}
{"text":"The food was good but honestly not worth 15$ and its not hot its just warm however the customer service is A1 they should win an award honestly they were so nice"}
{"text":"Not bad, but I've had much better. The menu is extremely small and a little confusing. The place itself is also very small and extremely loud."}
{"text":"They kicked everyone out of the restaurant at 10:59 am when they open at 11 and didn't let anyone in till 11:03. When they opened \"late\" they were still not ready and scrambling to get their food on the line. Staff was completely clueless when they told me they had no lettuce and her co worker had to tell her they do. Not worth it. Go to Oliveos down the street"}
{"text":"One of my favorite food in New York but Halal guys food is not even close to the streets of New York"}
{"text":"Probably the best Halal Location me and my boyfriend have been to. Super friendly staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"I've heard all the hype from Halal Guys in NYC but waited a few weeks for the hype to die down at this location. Upon first entering, I noticed a giant fan on and sweltering heat inside. I was sweating within the 10 minutes I was inside waiting for my food. We ordered a large gyro platter with extra of their famous white sauce. We found a bench around the block to eat on because it was way too hot inside. 

This food itself was good, but not great. I can see why the hype is there for the white sauce but it probably has some change in ingredients because I've heard from everyone that it's not as good as the original. However, as a standard shawarma meat plate, it's still better than most places. I don't know if I'll go back, but if you don't try this place you're not necessarily missing out on much."}
{"text":"Hit the spot! Not as great as the streets of NYC but nothing compares to that. CAUTION- the HOT sauce is HOTTTTTTT. This definitely hit the spot I will be back!!!! The AC was broken today hopefully they get that fixed soon. Lacks seating so it's a more of a take out place. Love the fact that they open till 4am"}
{"text":"I was super excited to check this place out and went for lunch with a few co workers the other day and we were all underwhelmed at best. The line wasn't too bad, but it was really warm on the restaurant  and very limited seating and waited 5 min or so with our food for a table. We all got the combo plate and both meats were flat, little seasoning and low quality. The white sauce had no flavor and the hot sauce is way too spicy and all of us agreed it just adds no flavor since it is so hot. I would not go back here and wouldn't recommend anyone waste time and money going here either."}
{"text":"On UBER Eats!

Getting in and out of the Vegas strip is a nightmare at any hour of the day. I was so happy when I found Halal Guys on UBER Eats.

I had Halal Guys in the original NYC street cart a few months back and I was craving the incredible white sauce again. Although not the same as eating it from the street cart in NYC, I was very satisfied with my Halal Guys order in Vegas.

My only issue was that it was more expensive than the street cart in NYC.

{"text":"So I have been back few times since the Yelp event. The biggest thing is the quality of the food or the experience has been just as fabulous. Sometimes coming back after a Yelp event for regular service can be hit or miss. The Halal Guys first thing off the top nice see got the air conditioning working. Not that it bothered me because pre opening there lot of things that can go wrong. The food has been consistent from my first visit to my recent visit (third). I know should have ordered something different but fan of the combo platter. I got the same thing all three times. 

The things I enjoy about the combo platter are the portion size, freshness, and can do double of one protein if craving just one. The protein with the combo chicken and gyro it nice scoop of each. No matter if you get the regular or large size. The same goes with the rice as the base or the sides of fresh chopped lettuce and diced tomato. It steal of deal. The only way I finish is if am starving because its all carbs and protein. I did mixed it up one visit. I tried the baklava. It was very good. It was nice buttery with lots of layers. The price of one piece might be little pricey. I was happy I tried one just to say had one. Really the star of the show is the combo platter or the same ingredients in burrito style. 

The chicken and gyro. The chicken like the fact all the meat is hand picked and shredded chicken. It can be dried out because they keep everything in steam table. The same goes with the falafel or the gyro meat. My experience never had problem with either one of the meats being dried out. I think the flavor is solid. The meat by itself is nothing that going blow you away just the honest truth. I feel it simple food nothing fancy. Just sticks to the history starting as food vendor on the streets of NYC. They just keep everything in steam tables and all about quick in and out or to go style. The white sauce not only is it addicting. It really is the ideal sauce with any one of the proteins. The white sauce feels like cheese Alfredo sauce. It not quite as thick of white sauce but the flavor is similar. The HOT sauce that just no joke. I would recommend put little spot taste before you go crazy with it. Once you drop whole bunch on top basically ruined it if not fan of the heat. 

The service has always been awesome every visit. Each visit been different staff but each visit everyone smiling, enthusiastic, friendly, and awesome. 

The restaurant is super small but again the whole concept is more to go then sit down. They do have couple tables and counter area. One of the best things about the hours stay open till 4am. So if you ever need The Halal Guys fix got you covered. I am happy brought some of that NYC to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed after all the hypes. Server was extremely slow and food was dry, felt old and uncooked. I went three different occasions to make sure it wasn't one time fluke (bad chef day). I tried both Sandwiches and Platter. Each time, the meat was very dry and the lettuce seemed very old and soggy. 

There are much better middle eastern restaurants and this wouldn't fall above mid tier for me."}
{"text":"I remember seeing massive lineups outside this place when it first opened, so I decided to drop in one evening for a shwarma wrap. I was really underwhelmed. The food was just very meh...nothing to write home about at all. 

What killed it for me though was that I asked for \"a bit\" of sauce, which somehow meant that it would be absolutely drenched in white sauce. I actually took a napkin and tried wiping some of the sauce off because everything was just swimming in sauce! If you need to put a half litre of sauce on your food to make it taste good, then the food itself can't be all that great. 

I've had MUCH better shwarma elsewhere in the area and for the same price if not less, so I won't be back here."}
{"text":"What a sad, underwhelming experience. I came here today in the rain and cold to line up for the grand opening promotion and I highly regret it. 

Not only was the promotional effort weak (spinning a wheel and having a mere CHANCE at winning a decent coupon), the food was subpar (odd mushy texture for the gyro), the portions were lacking (why is half my box just lettuce and why is there so little meat?), AND the price point was unreasonably high for a fast food joint ($14.11 after tax for a regular platter).

I'm pretty disappointed by this Toronto chain and I would not come back. I also wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.. you're better off eating at Ali Baba's if you're looking for other Halal options."}
{"text":"Maybe it's my fault but I was expecting a lot more than that. The rice was crunchy and the meal was nothing to brag about. Simple concept and friendly staff is what's getting them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Literally stumbled upon this location on its grand opening night, and SO GLAD I DID!!! It's now 5am and I'm laying in bed dreaming about it! I had the chicken and rice plate which doesn't sound special but boy is it ever!!! The tender chopped chicken is both juicy and flavorful, and the rice is nothing short of miraculous! They provide a deliciously cold chopped salad on the side that pairs PERFECTLY with the meal making this my new FAVORITE restaurant to round out 2017!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this location after going to the original location in NY on 53rd & 6th Ave but the food was not quite what I remembered. It's been over 6 years since I had food from the street cart over there but it seems like the portions here are smaller than what I remember and the chicken meat was more dry than I expected. I still had a great meal though but unfortunately it doesn't compare to the NY location.

Still plan on giving this place another visit because I really like the food and especially the white sauce!"}
{"text":"After being tortured with pics for months, I was so excited to finally get to try The Halal Guys. I went on opening day, around 3 pm, hoping to beat the crowds. I lucked out! Found a parking spot easily, and only had about a 5 minute wait before getting to go inside and place my order. While waiting outside, employees passed out bottles of water and gave us copies of the menu, which was nice. 

I ordered a beef gyro sandwich, 2 falafel on the side, 2 combination platters, and 2 pieces of baklava. 

The gyro was very good- both the pita and the meat had a good texture, in fact the pita was pretty much perfect. I wish I had known I could have gotten toppings on the gyro like jalape√±os and olives, but it was their first day being open to the public, and that didn't negate my experience.

The platters I took home for dinner. I made the rookie mistake of getting the large size, so much food! The rice was great, that white sauce lives up to the hype, the red sauce was too much for me. We liked the chicken, the beef, and the falafel, though my husband thought the falafel was a little dry. On the flip side, he loved the baklava and I thought it was a little dry....just a matter of preferences. 

This is a bit of a drive for us, but we agreed we would both return here for weekend lunch, or a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Since I haven't been to the New York to try these guys, happy to see they had a branch in Vegas when we were in town. Went in and had no trouble with parking. The line just happened to be short that day. Got the combo plate and it was awesome with that white sauce."}
{"text":"I'm from the Bronx, you can't play me like this. I can't blame these people because they're just doing their job. However, being a real New Yorker, this sad plate falafel hurt my soul. There were 6 tiny balls of falafel in a giant plate. They only gave me a packet of hot sauce. I can handle heat like bruh. Definitely a lot worse than New York, but it's to be expected."}
{"text":"First and foremost, other than the packets of sauce (of which we received one after paying for 4 extra - Uber Eats), this is NOTHING like NYC.  I should have known and expected that going in to it but I was so excited about that white sauce (which again, I paid for and did not receive after TWO Uber Eats attempts).  

Anyways long story short, we have a newborn, can't really leave house, got excited for Halal Guys, ordered through Uber Eats, paid for extra sauce, didn't get ANY sauce.  Called Uber, they came again and still shorted us the sauce that we PAID for.  Then the food was garbage.  Halal guys as a franchisor should be ashamed and seriously guy's (Tempe store) if you can't figure out delivery just opt out.  You guys are terrible and you can't even answer your phone line.  Total bummer."}
{"text":"Was eager to try this place with all the hype of it coming to Vegas and the story behind it, but was kind of bummed about the food. Dry is the best word for it.

Got chicken and gyro combo platters.  The portion is huge for the regular which is $1 more than the small. Yay for leftovers!  

The meat (chicken especially) was dry and the rice as well.  Not much else to say....dry is dry is dry.

I was real curious to try the white sauce that is raved about.  It is like a mayonnaise based version of tzatziki. The red sauce is like the ghost pepper sauce of HEAT! (Never had ghost peppers, but I would imagine this is how it would burn...haha). Tasty, but it will have you sweating with a runny nose! 

The staff was super nice and cheery in their cute, yellow shirts.  The food was just okay though."}
{"text":"Finally got my fix. The lamb and rice platter still taste like your on 5th ave in NYC. The Only difference is the price but I guess you get what you pay for because now the assurance of cleanliness is clear. You arent in the middle of the street anymore with everyone breathing over the food. And you get all the white sauce you want when you use the bottles thats sitting out for customers."}
{"text":"I used to live in NYC and would frequent the original cart a lot, so coming here to try the store was a must. I went on a weekday, around 2pm - there was a lineup, but maybe for only 15-20 minutes.

Honestly, the cart is miles better than what they're serving at the store. But with that being said, the regular combo platter is a generous portion of chicken, gyro, rice and salad and you really can't go wrong. Even the small size can fill you up.

And, as always, the white sauce is where it's at."}
{"text":"I waited at least 45 minutes and the lineup was around the corner. I ended up ordering the combo platter. Which comes with both chicken and Gyro. 

They are very generous with the white sauce and the hot sauce is pretty fire as well. Be careful. I went into this meal not knowing what to expect. However - all the taste were familiar to me. The best way to explain would be that it tasted a LOT like taco bell burrito's BUT served in a bowl. I asked other people if I was right in my statement- they agreed as well.

Overall- it was on my bucket list as it seems as the  social media line ups from the NYC food stands crossed my timeline's quite a lot. However it did not have any distinct \"street food\" taste nor was it that distinct or foreign to me. Seemed like a decent meal comparable to already the already established Osmow's brand we have in the GTA."}
{"text":"I don't know whats better the food or the customer service!! They are both great! The Ladies are  amazing n foods extraordinary! Best greek food in Vegas!
Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I love the Halal Guys only because of their spicy red sauce. I get the gyro plate (often with double meat) and put around three to four packets of the spicy red sauce and one packet of the white sauce. I like my food drenched in sauce.

For me it lived up to the hype that came from NYC. Every time I visit NYC , I make sure to have Halal guys. The only downside is that the Toronto price is significantly higher than the NYC prices. However, that probably comes from the higher over head from a store versus a food cart.

However, if you aren't a sauce person then I would stay away from this place. The food is extremely bland without their signature sauces.

Also, I've had friends who have had bad experiences as the food can be quite salty for some people. It's a very hate it or love it type of place from all the comments my friends have made about this place."}
{"text":"I got Halal Guys around this time where they have their soft opening. The location is great because it is near both Ryerson, UofT, and Eaton Centre. I had a regular platter with both chicken and gyro over rice with lettuce and salsa. The platters are served with rice, pita, lettuce and tomatoes. You can also get the platters with their famous hot or white sauce and the choice of toppings. The pita was super good to balance out with their hot sauce because it definitely is spicy for me but not overly spicy where you cannot enjoy the dish. Their famous white and hot sauce is also delicious, no wonder they don't reveal the recipe.

Service was quick, I will be returning!

Note: Halal Guys tastes best right when it is served but even after a couple hours when you heat it up, it still tastes good."}
{"text":"The service is A+ but the food is just ok. I got the combo plate and I swear I don't know what was chicken and what was gyro meat."}
{"text":"This was a terrible expensive meal. The staff was chopping meat so loud they couldn't even hear to take my order. I had a Yelp check in for a free dessert, but they would not honor it. Said it was expired however they hadn't taken it off Yelp. The food had no flavor, the hummus was hard and stiff and all of the bottles of sauce at the sauce station were dated two days prior and still sitting there. We won't be back"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to see these guys open up. Stopped in and got a combo plate. Everything tasted great and fresh. It was plenty for one person and I even had some left to share. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Reminds me exactly of the carts in midtown... Overall amazing, great food!!! Staff is always nice and accommodating! Truly go here like 2/3 times a week... Guilty! Reminds me of being on the East Coast"}
{"text":"I eat here too often. The food is incredibly flavorful and comforting. I always get a gyro platter. Just a warning the red hot sauce is pretty spicy. Start with one line and then add more if you want it. Actually I would recommend adding it yourself after you get your food. Some of the people are a little more free with the sauce than others and you might end up with more spice than you intend."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my husband when I was pregnant and we've been going back at least once a month ever since! 
I started out with trying their combo plate of chicken and gyro but the chicken was a bit too dry for me. It tasted great with EXTRA EXTRA white sauce, but I can't begin to imagine how many calories are in it, so I choose to stick with just 1 Extra White sauce and all gyro. Granted the calories in the whole meal is going to be astronomical, I got to find a way to cut small corners, right? 
The staff is always great but can be a bit slow at times. However I can't complain because I can only imagine what the wait is for the original halal guys in NYC."}
{"text":"My review is mainly for people reading the earlier reviews which are more critical / negative and are a bit put off.

1) I've been to the original food cart in NYC. Of course it's outstanding, but you have to remember the NYC cart is not using Canadian products - meat, veggies, etc, so the taste will be different even slightly. It's also very hard to compete with the original and the charm that it comes with.

2) The lines are long of course because it recently opened, had a huge hype from all the craze that it has in NYC, and so you have to expect the lines to be long for quite some time. Frankly, this seems fairly obvious. As well as key times for lunch and dinner. I went on a Thursday around 6:30 PM and the line was only slightly out the door, but wasn't going around the building as it's been, and everyone seemed fairly content with it. It wasn't until around 7:00 that the line started to really get going.

3) I've never had the actual shwarama or falafel, so I can't speak yet to how good those are, but the platter is what Halal Guys is known for. One user commented that the salad was basic - shredded lettuce and some tomatoes. Consider that it's like that as cooling foods, because of how crazy spicy the hot sauce is. Granted, it probably could be better, but they're not advertising the salad much so it's a bit unrealistic to expect it.

IMO, it's the next best thing. The platter is comparable to Osmows or Lazeez, and that's fine. Everyone has their preferences. My own personal taste, I think it's a bit higher quality and I'm definitely coming back. However, I'd say give it a few months for the hype to get settled and the staff to come together more, get the cooking right, and see then. 

I will give my one critique which is why I can't give this 5 stars: I thought it could be a little cheaper, and the beef tasted a bit generic. I've definitely had the same quality of beef at another shwarama place, but the chicken is good.

It isn't the original NYC cart, but I'm happy with it. Just take the few things in mind and then see."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my visit.   Meats are essentially flavorless.  Pita is dry and stale.   And I am not sure I have ever been to a Mediterranean place that does not have actual tzatziki sauce.   They serve some type of crappy mayo based substitute.  This was my first and last time at this place."}
{"text":"I've driven past the New York stand about a hundred times in a taxi but never had the urge to wait in it. Went in on a Monday evening and the line was outside but took only about 15 mins. They are very quick and efficient here. We got 2 regular sized chicken and gyro combo platters. The portions were huge! Everything was delicious however I'm not sure it constitutes such long lineups. Also, the hot sauce is very very hot (nothing like Franks) so take their advice and keep it in one corner if you must try it."}
{"text":"So I don't typically review restaurants when they first open because I like to give them time to work through kinks (I've opened several stores myself). But I had a pretty good experience for my first visit here. If you don't know these guy's story, they started off as a hot dog cart in NYC in the early 90's. Because of the diversity there, they started selling Gyro's and Falafel to better serve the Muslim community. Now they have grown to several locations across the US and AZ now has their second location. The Tempe location is in the perfect spot because there are a lot of Middle Eastern restaurants nearby and they fit in perfectly. I'm curious to see how they will do in Ahwatukee being that it is a smaller town and they aren't known for late night eateries (Halal Guys opens till midnight). The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and clean. I love the simplicity of the menu - a couple sandwich choices, platters and some sides. I was greeted by a very friendly staff and ordered their Falafel platter. You have the option of adding several condiment choices like olives, jalapenos, onions and of course their infamous white and red sauces. The red sauce is a real kicker and I love to douse my entree with it. My only bummer is that they have a cool rewards program which wasn't up and running quite yet. But I'm happy to have Halal Guys here in town and hope they do well."}
{"text":"I'll keep my review short because I don't have much to say. I was looking forward to try The Halal Guys because my husband told me they're really big in NYC. I ordered the chicken platter. The chicken was so bland. I couldn't taste any spices at all. The rice was also very bland. My son ordered chicken gyro and my husband ordered lamb. They were both very bland, as well. The falafel was way too over cooked and dry. Sadly, I was very disappointed, as I walked in expecting more. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Worst Mediterranean food ever!  I would eat Mediterranean food ANYWHERE ELSE but here.  My friend and I both ordered a platter each and some hummus,  everything was dry and not tasty.   We left disappointed and angry at how bad the food was."}
{"text":"Very dry beef. Chicken tastes better. Not a clean place either. 

The staff are polite and friendly. The portion of the food for small plate and 9.99 is decent. The hot sauce they have is very hot, not your average siriracha.

I recommend trying it once, but there is absolutely nothing special place about it, other shawarma places with their choices of salads and flafel might be even better."}
{"text":"Not authentic or nutritious. I give this place a 1 star just for their sauces. First, if you know anything about Gyro, Shwarma or D√∂ner kebabs they are made on a spit grill that turns and in the process the fat gets extracted at the bottom of the pan. These guys just put all the meet on a large industrial fryer and the meet is soaked and drenched with oil! Furthermore, this meet is ground-meet and tastes like spicy hamburger or Chopli kabob from Pakistan or India. The servers are nice people but have absolutely no knowledge of the type of food they are serving! If you like  minced spicy hamburger meet drenched in fat and oil with some mayo and hot sauce this may be the right place. It was worth trying once, but I will not go back and won't recommend this place until the food is made the authentic way!"}
{"text":"Just like the original in NYC! I go to the original cart whenever I'm in NYC and this Vegas location has definitely met my expectations. Great flavor and quality ingredients as well as generous portion size. Love that white sauce... but definitely take it easy on the hot sauce... a little goes a long way! Also enjoyed friendly service from the staff here. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! Thank you for the delicious food and the trip down memory lane-  of my many cold, late night trips to the food cart on 53rd waiting on that long line!! I it!! The food was absolutely incredible!! Literally tastes exactly like the food cart I grew up with! 
Thanks for opening up so close to my new home! Moved from the east coast about 3 years ago, and that was one of a few things I missed!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way home from work. Place is clean, service was quick but I have to say the food was just ok. The pita is super thick & so dry that is cracked when I tried to bite into it. Would have been really good if not for the cold dried out pita. There a way better gyros out there than this....won't be back."}
{"text":"Decided to eat before we tackle the Boxing Day. I ate here, when it opened at first place. I heard mix reviews; and after eating there, I wasn't impressed. It was over priced, the food tasted very bland. 

My sister wanted to try, therefore I decided to go again and give a chance. The service was mediocre. The background music was way too loud; I had hard time to order; I had to yell. I asked for chicken sandwich; they ran out of hot sauce. We were the first customer; they are already missing ingredients. My sister's and my sandwiches were really below average. The sodas from the fountains were completely flat and warm.

It's so cold outside; you would except some warmth  inside but it was freezing cold.  

Sadly, it was disappointing my second outing here."}
{"text":"Halal guys was a pretty decent quick and cheap spots to grab a meal at when I first visited New York, so I'm pretty hyped up that they're finally here in Vegas. 

What's even better is that they're located right in the grand busy sector of china town, which is pretty much where I go when I'm drunk and on the roam for food haha

I always pick their combo bowl and get the chicken, which has a good amount of seasoning and flavor, and the lamb which is a definite choice for myself any time I get shwarmas or any type of halal food. The combo goes great over the warm bed of rice and soft hot pita bread pieces you get. Oh! And don't forget to get extra white sauce packets!! 

Um for the red hot sauce, I suggest going easy on it. I made the dire mistake of using too much once and I couldn't taste much that day other than fire and death in my mouth.. Worth it, but seriously go easy there on it buddy!

The meal itself is also pretty cheap, roughly about 9 bucks so you can't complain that you're paying too much considering the portion sizes come in ranges of moderate to fatass level. Thanks for bringing some east coast goodness to Vegas halal guys!!

But uhh where's the lamb at? The Las Vegas location is lacking it, and the menu is rather small and lacking :(

Halal guys is no fancy diner but it is what it is, cheap vendor food, that's filling and quick. And when you're wanting cheap and quick vendor food, halal is pretty decent. I just don't feel the appeal though as much with it being a restaurant style, kinda like turning an ice cream truck into a walk-in diner; it loses the appeal to an extent."}
{"text":"Im from NY and was happy to see that there is cartoon food here! Tried The Halal Guys in Tempe and was not that happy with it. So now that I see there is one closer, I decided to try... OMG just like home! And the girl serving was a joy! Great service and great food. Thank you I will be back!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I, decided to brave the lines on a Friday night. The line up was out the door and there was about an hour wait. 

We ordered the combo platter which is chicken, gyros, rice and salad. The white sauce was pretty good but too much of it made me sick. And the hot sauce was super spicy - like burned my mouth spicy. Overall, the dish itself was just okay. It was good but not great. 

Also the restaurant itself was pretty small and since it was busy there were zero places to sit. Luckily, my friend and I managed to grab a table after waiting a little while. 
My friend got up to go to the bathroom and these two women were already eyeing our table. I heard one saying to the other woman, \"sorry, we were waiting for this table first\". 

Ummmmm....we didn't even finish eating and we were pretty much getting vultured. 

Never again. I'll stick to my local Osmows which tastes 10x better than this place."}
{"text":"Amazing place with some good chicken. I've tasted their Chicken gyro and fry platter . They are open late on the weekends (: Come check the out for Sure!"}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to describe how disappointed I was with this place.

I was a regular at the Halal Guys food cart when I lived in New York and found myself craving food from there from time to time.

I was super excited about them opening up a location in Toronto. However the combo was disappointing. It lacked the flavor that made the Halal Guys in New York so good. It made me even wonder if this was the same place as the one in New York? 

I would definitely not come back."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and was nearby so we gave it a try. It's a tiny little storefront, bare bones unless you count the patio out front on the sidewalk. The menu isn't simple which might be OK for some people, but the beef gyro meat was bland and tasteless. Bleah! The platter salad was just chopped iceberg lettuce and tomatoes with two tiny wedges of pita bread. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed. This is just another one of those places that wants to make a quick buck without giving much in return or doing anything to stand out to deserve your business. King of Gyros on Elliott is a bit further for us, but it's far better and well worth the extra drive with better food, better gyros, and a much larger menu."}
{"text":"My first experience of The Halal Guys came from downtown Montreal... I never thought I would say that. NYC Halal Guys is still on my bucket list but this will have to do for now!

As for the food, it was prepared very quickly so the wait you endured lining up will be better once you order. I'm liking the small cut styled shawarma compared to Montreal's. You can even mix it all together Chipotle style (close the container and shake it up). Go for extra white sauce and be careful with the red sauce!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review...

Our first time to The Halal Guys was about a month ago and the experience we had then is totally different than what we had today, hence the update.

We ordered a chicken platter and a combo chicken/gyro platter. The rice was nice and fluffy, and the meats were hot and moist. The pita had been steamed over the hot chicken cooking on the flat top and was soft and pliable with chicken juices. The self serve sauce bar was being constantly checked and refilled (BEWARE that hot sauce! It's not for the faint of heart.) and it was decently busy when we arrived.

The customer service here was and is attentive and consistently good. 

Would I come back? Sure. If The Halal Guys can deliver a consistent good experience like this one, I'll be back as a regular customer...especially when I have late night/early morning cravings for that white sauce!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by the food here. Ordered several platters. all we're mediocre. The hummus and baba ganoush we're very blah. Even the baklava wasn't very good. I wouldn't come here again for sure and may not go to any other halal guys location based on this experience. The falafel itself was ok though."}
{"text":"Car runs a red light and nearly slams into us at 2 AM. Luckily, Halal Guys was nearby to save us with a great late-night meal. Thanks, Halal Guys."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, but they lose stars for trying to make their gyro look like it was full of meat when it was full of lettuce.  I get that they are in a casino and are probably paying a premium for rent, but please don't try to fool me with lettuce, that stuff drives me nuts.  Also, let me add my own Tahini, garlic sauce, whatever. Controlling the sauce and adding a little tiny line of sauce does not make me happy."}
{"text":"Food tastes as good as in NYC, but the service speed is very very slow compare to those in NYC. 9 people working behind the counter and they can't make the line move."}
{"text":"I went here to see what the hype was all about but was sadly disappointed. Food was dry, I see employees making meals in front of the trash can and honestly feel like I was unwelcomed. I don't think I'll be eating here again"}
{"text":"Finally, The Halal Guys are here in AZ.  This place has just opened across from ASU.  It's def tasty and the staff are super friendly.   Def come and check this out.  The hot sauce is super spicy but addicting."}
{"text":"Went in for just a salad.. didn't see it on the board but asked.. awesome lady made me a platter with beef and chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and jalapenos. Had her go light on the ginger rice.. (it's awesome)
Best low carb salad I've found in Vegas.
Will return for sure."}
{"text":"I appreciate u guys for coming west. People want to be \"foodies\" when they don't even know the heart and soul of the Halal TRUCK. This food has gotten me back from many of hangovers, broke times and even made me feel like I made a very healthy choice at that price(because we all know $5 can't go far ESPECIALLY in New York City) I was born and raised there and when I left, my heart broke when I realized I was leaving my beloved trucks. I gave a 4 because though the food is awesome, I think it's missing that food truck authenticity (since its now its a store front lol)and I didn't get as much white sauce as I expected...it might be because I asked my brother to get it for it me  but good luck guys, tell your Jamaica Ave truck keep up the good work I'll be coming back!!!"}
{"text":":( they where closed I got there around 11:30p sighn on door said open till 4am and it said the same on their website. call before."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good gyro. Given that Halal Guys is buzzy new addition to the Phoenix area, I wanted to give it a try. There are several places to get a solid gyro in the S Tempe, W Chandler, Ahwatukee area, so how'd they stack up?

Poorly. I ordered the simply gyro sandwich. Unfortunately, the amount of meat they put on is pitiful. It really looked pathetic. I went with traditional toppings - tomatoes and onions. I went with their white sauce. The majority of the sandwich was comprised of the fluffy pita.

The meat itself wasn't bad. But it was lost in a mouthful of pita. It seemed like ordered pita with a small side of meat. So any goodness from the meat just got drowned out.

Considering the cost of the gyro, I was quite disappointed with Halal Guys. I'll be sticking with the local King for gyros..."}
{"text":"I believe that food got lost in the mass production and chain game. This is an overpriced version of subway. Tonight it served a quick bite to eat in between errands but we were left hungry. Even an added order of the cafeteria style fries and babaganoush didn't fill us up. Flavors were bland, except for the hot sauce (definitely delicious), the white sauce tasted like yogurt only. Sad to say, we won't be returning to this franchise."}
{"text":"Oooohhhh how I love this place!!! So many gluten-free options, not to mention it's delicious! The Manger is so helpful  and his team were  on point with their customer service!!  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I give The Halal Guys a lot of credit for opening directly across the street from ASU. Smart!  AND, they're open until 4 in the morning, on Thursday thru Saturday's. Real smart!

When I worked in the WTC in New York, there were a bunch of Middle Eastern food trucks on Broadway, near the old Merrill building at One Liberty.  There was always a Kabob truck, a Falafel truck and Gyro truck.  Oh yeah, and a Sabrett's Hot Dog stand. LOL 

The Halal Guys were a midtown operation, but very similar.  \"Halal meats that are seasoned to perfection and a melting pot of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors that are sure to delight.\"

You should know, that Halal, Halaal, or  food is not the same as Greek food. It's middle eastern in origins, but tastes subtly different. You'll find no Kronos lamb spinning here either. 

They serve their food steamed (photos), not fried -- on a plate with chicken or beef type gyro meat(photo), over rice and bed of iceberg lettuce, covered in their proprietary (creamy mayo) White Sauce. 

We really liked our food. We ordered the combo plater of beef and chicken; with a sides four falafel balls with tahini sauce and a small bowl of humus. We also grabbed a beef gyro to go. LOL

The rice was very tasty and we found the meat to be slightly bland, but their sauce made up for it. If you enjoy heat, you'll have to try their chili paste based Hot Sauce. I loved it, a 8/10 alarm'er. 

So Three Stars, \"A-Okay\"."}
{"text":"This place died down faster than I expected. When they opened about a month ago, the wait was almost 15-20 minutes outside in the heat but the last I went, we were 2 out of the 7 customers that were there. 

Their potions are very generous, in my opinion, especially when I asked them to exclude the veggies from my plate. The chicken is my favorite and you can never have enough of that white sauce. 

One star off because it seemed like some workers were just standing around while some workers were constantly moving. Maybe I'm being a little judgmental but the worker at the register was literally leaning on the counter with her elbows and staring off into space. 

Also, during their opening, their AC was broken so I was sweating in there but I didn't mind because it was packed. The last time I was there, the AC was blasting almost to the point where it seemed over exaggerated because it was already cool outside. It was just overall uncomfortable in there. Hopefully a happy medium next time."}
{"text":"We went to visit for dinner before heading back to home to Cali. I must say I wasn't as impressed as I was when I had the plates my sister brought home from their original stand in NYC. I thought I was going to be blown away as I originally was when I tasted their plate from NYC but found it mediocre. Still love it though in spite of. The sauces are the delicious. The spicy hummus is okay. The meat and chicken were cooked okay. Overall, not too bad."}
{"text":"This place has good price and portions, restaurant is clean and convenient. People work here are super nice, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service has always been good
Food quality is the same as NYC but the quantity is less and it has increased in cost with more popularity. I like that it's close but don't necessarily have cravings for it anymore. 

Mediterranean style chicken, rice, lettuce and tomatoes with small pieces of pita. 
Addicting white sauce and really spicy hot sauce which has a thick paste like consistency. 

Not something I would go to often, too many other places to go nowadays. But like I said great service and reminds me of being in college again!"}
{"text":"First time visit to \"The Halal Guys\" this evening for a snack before the movies. Centrally located in China Town next to Krung Siam on Spring Mountain and Valley View. Always happy to see a freebies upon Yelp check in! Today we each got a baklava.

The wife and I ordered a platter and a sandwich so we could share. She ordered the combo platter with chicken and gyro. It came with rice, lettuce, pita bread, and your choice of a number of items including, onions, peppers, tomato, jalape√±os, olives and a white tahini sauce. Very filling plate and delicious 4/5. I had the chicken sandwich which is loaded with as much chicken as they can fit in the bread, topped off with peppers, jalape√±os, kalamata olives and white sauce. Huge, messy and delicious to the last bite! 4/5. We tried the other sauces available next to the drink tower: hot sauce FIRE in a bottle (sriracha got nothing on this sauce) and the bbq sauce. Good variety and worth trying each or a mixture. 

For dessert we enjoyed the baklava which hit he spot and attempted to put the fire out from that hot sauce. Two sprite refills and a baklava later, lips still tingled. Overall a nice quick meal with the wife."}
{"text":"This place doesn't compare with their NY original carts.  I guess the NY carts are so busy that the meats are fresh and the food is hot.  This place had oily rice and the food doesn't taste very good.  The white sauce is similar and the hot sauce was super spicy.  Service was slow and not very friendly.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Great to see the Halal guys spreading west! The same great schwarma, rice, veggies and pita. Make sure to top it with the white and hot sauce"}
{"text":"Went on the soft opening for a family night, good food, good company, and great hospitality. Overall a wonderful experience for my family."}
{"text":"You either love it, or you feel, just \"eh\" about The Halal Guys. It's not like it's hit or miss, because it's pretty much the same, every time. There are minimal options, and you most likely know what you are going to order before you arrive. I personally love the combo platter, which is grilled chicken, beef, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and pita bread. I add two white sauce packets and one hot sauce packet. YES, the hot sauce IS HOT. BUT, if you like spicy, and you mix it all together, it compliments the meat and white sauce perfectly and leaves just the right amount of linger on your tongue. I love it! You can also order falafel if you don't do meat. Or a Gyro sandwich on fresh pita. 
The location is a decent size with about 4 tables. But it's really meant to be just like NY, grab and go. See a long line, don't stress, it moves SO FAST!  
I had The Halal Guys off a truck in NY, and to me, it taste the exact same! I have read some reviews about it being different but I did not notice. This place has been open less than a month and I have already been here 4 times! My kid likes it, my boyfriend likes it, and even when I brought my best friend a plate, she killed it. 
Sure, it's basic. But to me, it hits the spot every time. Good, fresh food, nice people, good prices. The crack sauce, I mean white sauce that is so DAM addicting. If you haven't stepped out of your pizza and burger comfort zone lately, take a leap and do it here!"}
{"text":"This place is a little overrated, in my opinion. It was so hyped up, so we ordered early everything on the menu and it was terrible. The rice was dry, the meat seemed like it was from last week, the baklava was frozen. Just all around weird, unappetizing and just flat out not good."}
{"text":"three people working!!!
one putting my order together!!
all three having an in depth conversation & the one putting my order together is moving in slow motion because she's talking to the supervisor & the other worker. the other two are watching while the one is slowly moving. 
stop talking & put my stuff together. 
as far as i'm concerned, its the super who blew this review. 
wtf"}
{"text":"Came in today to try the infamous Halal Guys. They were pretty busy since it's only the 2nd day of being open. There are only a few tables as the restaurant is pretty small. The service was decent considering they were pretty busy. 

The AC isn't working yet, so be prepared to be toasty if you come in during the first week of opening. They have free water and coolers running which does help. 

As for the food, the small combo platter was a perfect size for me. The meat and rice is flavorful, the white sauce is so delicious, that hot sauce is HOT! I read the warnings but didn't believe them. Start with a little and add more if it's not enough. It is very hot! 

Overall, I would definitely come back again. I'll give it a few months when it's less busy. Great addition to the Chinatown area!"}
{"text":"Omg. The food here is so good! The line looked a lot longer than it actually was. The service was fast and friendly. It's a little pricey but totally with it. I'll be back before we leave Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and they were out of poutine so they called me to ask if they could send me something else, which was fine. However, when the food arrived it was cold and soggy, also the sauces they gave me had a best before date of a month ago. I tried to call the restaurant to let them know they were serving expired food, but no one answered even though the restaurant was still open."}
{"text":"I've only every other takeout from this pace and the food is just big just like all New York food ought to be. The flavors, the hot sauce and the white sauce are fatty and fantastic. Highly recommend you pair your bowl of whatever you buy with baklava. I wish you good luck with your food."}
{"text":"Yay! The Halal Guys are in town!

I didn't know they had opened shop, so it was a pleasant surprise to come across their open door. There was momentarily no line-up, so we decided to try it for dinner.

We ordered a Chicken plate and a Gyro plate, with white sauce. The workers were so efficient, I barely had the time to find my wallet that the food was ready. The meat was tender and succulent, and generously seasoned. It was actually a bit salty, but it went well with the generous portion of rice. Everything was very good and fresh. I had no complaint, appart from the price. I find that 10.99$ for a small place is a bit expensive, but they can probably pull it off given the food quality. 

When we were leaving, the line-up was out of the door again - good thing they work fast.
A new, very competitive addition to the Concordia neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Yes, halal guys I one of those places that gets me excited. Specially the fact that this store is open late at night as well. If you're going to compare the food sold here from the New York stall, please save your breath. It isn't and will never be that. Go fly to New York if you're really that keen to talk about it.

I always order the combo platter since that's the dish that started it all from the original stall by time square. It's fast, its easy and really yummy as well. They even hooked it up with a yummy dessert just for checking in on yelp yelp.

The place was really nice. I think the location was brand new. Very well kept as well. Would definitely come back and eat here again.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"}
{"text":"Just went earlier today, it's my second time eating here and I like it. Really tasty and the white sauce is delicious.  I did have to wait in line for a while even though there was only 1 person in front of me. There were 4 people behind the counter. Aside from waiting, I'll keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at the one in NY, LA and now here in Vegas.
I have to say a big, thumbs down.
Went here first on a Wednesday night around 5, super long line, but the food was hot and not dried out. Food was being cut from the rotisserie and fresh
The next time I went here, my hubby and I were craving it on a Friday night (2/18/17). Went here around 10pm ( and keep in mind- this place is open until 2am)
We ordered 2 gyro platters ($8.99)- combo of rice, iceberg lettuce, chopped tomato, gyro meat
- side toppings include: jalape√±o and onions
Michelle checked us out and helped us. 
NOTHiNG looked (or tasted) fresh: tomatoes were all pre chopped and super dried out- you know where the skin is all wrinkled and dehydrated, the meat was all cut up into little small pieces not in larger chunks (like how it usually it's when it is cut fresh from the rotisserie)- super oily as it had been sitting in the heating bin for a while, the pita was served cold- I watched as another girl put it on the grill for about 20-30 seconds, the rice- that was the worst part! The rice had this deep orange tint to it- not the usual yellow tint I'm used to- and it had def been sitting there for a while and not fresh- because the rice as it went into our mouths were super rock hard like little bee bee pellets. The only fresh thing was the salad (iceberg). And the worst was the large chunks of white onion. They put so much on and it was super spicy and sulfur tasting. 
In general, the restaurant is very small and has about 5 tables. Can maybe sit about 20 people. The weirdest is the table right near the door ( so awkward). 
Overall, I think the owner sold out. The quality has decreased significantly. The sauce packets of the white sauce and red sauce don't taste the same and the percentage of saturated fat in 1 white sauce packet alone is a whopping- 53%!!
I know that lamb/beef gyro meat isn't the healthiest but dayum- 2 packets of white sauce will put u over the recommended daily saturated fat intake! 
I'm am sad to say, after my experience here last night, the quality of the food made me not want to crave it anymore.
I would give this 1 star, but I know the food could be so much better! 

****Yelp Check in!!: FREE Bahklava- crunch layers of filo dough with butter, sugar syrup, pistachios and nuts: Really delicious and great for breakfast or after snack ( doesn't need to be refrigerated)"}
{"text":"Their food is complete shit. I have never had worse Middle Eastern food. It's like they ate crappy Middle Eastern food, and then shat it out into the tray that they served us. Their white sauce is total crap. It's mayonnaise. Why not just call it mayonnaise so we don't get our hopes up that it might be tzatziki? I enjoy hot sauce, even siracha and habanero hot sauce, but the red sauce was completely inedible. Obscenely high in calories and fat (330 calories and 36g fat per pack of white sauce). Complete waste of money."}
{"text":"Not recommending. Getting 2 stars for customer service and clean store. Food was not very good. Ordered the combo gyro and chicken platter. Chicken was shredded/chopped and dry the gyro tasted fried and no flavor what so ever. The meat may have been sliced at one point then they chop it to very little pieces. Pile of rice which was okay. Olives were the best tasting on the platter. The white sauce was not good either. Mayo based, way too much put on the platter and again, no flavor even though it's compared to  tzatziki sauce. I didn't taste any cucumber or onion what-so ever. Also tried the hummus which maybe since I make my own was not very good. The pita should have been at least thrown on the grill to warm up and toast a little which didn't happen so basically was pulled out of the bag and rolled in tin foil. And yes we are in but food was not very warm. Not a place I'd go back to."}
{"text":"Got the combo platter with a side of falafel, extra white sauce, couple dots of red.  The combo platter was great.  Falafel was terrible, hard as rock.  Couldn't finish one.  Service was friendly.  Came during the grand opening and the line moved quick.  There was an issue because I didn't have id but they let me slide.  Thanks guys!  Location and parking sucks.  But what are you gonna do?  Better than being on the strip I guess."}
{"text":"Easy peazy lemon squeezy. Easy menu. Crunchy lettuce. Chicken and gyro meat are pretty dry on their own. You need lots of sauce to meld everything together, but once you've done like 3-4 zig zag patterns and 15-20 dots of hot sauce, you're golden."}
{"text":"When I found out Vegas was finally getting our very own Halal Guys I was giddy as giddy can be! But when I took my very first bite I was sadly disappointed. I stopped going here for months to give them time to sort their shit out. 

Surprise surprise. They really turned themselves around since the grand opening days. I'm really glad I gave them another shot since the taste and quality of their food got much better.

The first few times I came here, everything was bland, they skimped out on meat and were sloppy and not consistent with their plating. Now they have everything down to a science and starting to almost taste like like their big brother in New York (alas it will never be the same as a gritty grill cart on the street) but it will satisfy the urge. Plus it's more convenient than a flight to NYC.

The beef gyro here is my favorite! However, for first timers, why not sample everything to see what your favorite is? I recommend trying the Halal Classic (mix combo platter): chicken & beef gyro, yellow rice and a simple side salad. I always ask them to add olives and onions as well. \"The perfect bite\" is with a little bit of protein, rice, salad - make sure it's all sauced up! A bite with the salad adds a crisp texture and also the pita triangles are fabulously soft and so fluffy - mix it all up and dig in! It's an explosion of flavor! If you still don't want to take the plunge to try the beef gyro, the chicken & rice is decent. I just love the beef gyro though.

Their babaganoush isn't shabby and I also like their falafels, if I am in the mood. 

Make sure to try their 4 different sauces: 

1. Creamy white sauce - Don't be shy and drizzle a good amount of their \"crack\" sauce! 2 and a half sauce packets (or more) will do the trick. It really takes the food to delicious heights and adds a wonderful creaminess. Less is more doesn't apply to this. More is MORE!!!

2. BBQ sauce - I know, don't let that weird you out! Drizzle a little over your platter, mix it in and go from there. It adds the perfect sweetness to the food, balances everything out, without weighing down the dish. Love it!

3. Hot sauce - That Red Devil Sauce. Swell up your tongue and face type of situation. I love the hot sauce because it's unique to Halal Guys and it has bold flavor. It heats up every morsel and really brings the dish to life! Just make sure to use it sparingly (start with a dot and work your way up from there) 

4. Tahini - Toasted ground hulled sesame seed sauce. It has a rich nutty flavor and pairs nicely with the falafels. 

I won't say this location will blow your socks off like the cart did to me in NYC. But the flight to NYC is a further reach than dealing with the differences here. Dig in!"}
{"text":"After coming here a few times and giving them several tries, I realized I really just don't like their food. I was very disappointed. Their rice and falafels are always so dry and I feel like in order to enjoy their food you have to drench it in their sauce. 
I'm a sauce girl, and I have to say I wasn't even impressed with their white sauce. In fact the only thing that kept me coming back was their insane hot sauce which I fell in love with."}
{"text":"Just opened up in Caesar's palace food court. Glad we saw this. My wife and I have to drive pretty far for Halal Guys. Since we were in Vegas for vacation why not! Love this stuff! Combo Platter All day with white sauce! Basically a mini Halal Guys. Staff is nice. Got our food really quick. Happy to know they have this in Caesars! Open til 4:30 am I believe!"}
{"text":"I wanted to check out for myself what the hype was all about and they didnt fail me good food,  friendly crew and clean restroom what else can you ask for.  Oh and the white sauce is the bomb.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I go to the Massage Envy in the same strip mall once a week, and the scent of the food wafting out of Halal Guys smelled irresistible.... Too bad they drowned our meals in thick, heavy sauces. My husband's chicken and gyro bowl was literally inundated with a mayo-based sauce. The proportion of sauce to actual food was serious overkill. #FoodCrime. If you eat here, skip the sauce so you can actually taste your food."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and really enjoyed the food. Tonight, we stopped by and ended up not eating. We expected that they would be understaffed, though the two employees were not prepared for how busy it was. While ordering, they must have thought the customer behind me was there with me, she took his order at the same time and had him pay before me. She already missed half of what I ordered, even though I repeated myself 2 or 3 times. I was already watching closely because I watched the guy at the cash register start handling food after taking money from another customer without washing his hands or at least changing his gloves. The person making my food did the same thing, took cash and then started to make the rest of the order, without washing her hands or changing gloves and had touched all of the bread that was being kept warm on the grill. At that point I was done and we walked out."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.
I feel like this place was a bit overhyped. The portions are huge and the service is very good but it's pricey and the sauces aren't anything special.

I tried the sandwich and the plate. 

The plate was mostly rice, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. A small part of it was actually meat. It was disappointing given the price.

The sandwich was better but their meat is seasoned in a way that made me tired of eating after a while. 

Overall ok but wouldn't be my first choice. It looks better than it tastes."}
{"text":"Visited the original when I was in NYC - glad they finally opened one in Vegas! The food was delicious and the red sauce is still as hot as hell. Service was even better - Johnnie was the bomb and went out of her way to help us! Any time you hit Halal Guys - look for Johnnie and give her a shout out."}
{"text":"Just ate form this spot, it was amazing! Best gyro I've ever had! You guys keep doing your thing. I'm definitely going to be a regular. 
Ps the hot sauce is HOT!"}
{"text":"After the anticipated opening of Halal Guys, of course I had to attend the soft opening and it did not disappoint! We ordered 6 platters of the chicken and gyro mix and drowned them in the white sauce. Two sizes are available- small and large- and the small was more than enough. It contains rice, salad, beef gyro, chicken and pita slices. Food was awesome, the service was great and efficient. Only complaint was the price. I did expect New York quantity for around the same price of $7. The small platter was about $11-12. 
Overall, I'd definitely recommend and will be back! And beware of the hot sauce! Couple drops was more than enough for me."}
{"text":"No joke...I'm addicted to the combo platter. The heaping portion of gyro meat and chopped grilled chicken is very satisfying to your hunger pains. Mix on the the rice, lettuce, diced tomato, and the Halal guys famous white sauce. Two packs of white sauce with half a packet of the TASTE BUD SEARING red sauce. Careful use sparingly or you will pay the price later.  

The falafel platter is amazing also. Beautiful crunch on the outside and a light green hue on the inside. YUM!  We had an order of fries which were fresh and made to order and seasoned proper.  

The seating area is somewhat small with 25 seats max. The line moves pretty fast during peak business so don't be discouraged if you have to wait a short while.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am a proud sheeple (sheeperson? sheep?) 

I've heard all the hype surrounding the Halal Guys and saw the long lineup so OF COURSE I had to check it out. 

I split the combo platter with my boyfriend. Total cost was $14, which, to be honest is kinda expen$ive. Anyway, first impressions: that is the most photogenic shawarma plate I have ever seen. Ever. Unfortunately, I didn't take a picture since I was too hungry (classic first world problem), but go take a look at the pictures other Yelpers have posted and you will understand. 

The secret is in the sauce. The food gets drenched in this white sauce and it is the perfect addition. You can also add spicy sauce. They'll only put a very small line and at first you'll be confused because that seems like nothing but TRUST ME (and the other reviewers) that's more than enough.

The meat felt very light (although, let's be honest, it's probably like a bajillion calories), so I guess that's a good thing.

Overall, a decent meal and a decent experience. I think some of the low reviews it's been getting are a little unfair. Will I ever come back? It's kind of out of the way, so probably not. But! If I happen to be in the area and am willing to shell out the money, I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait until they opened close to our house, but what a disappointment. Hardly any menu items and the price is high. The food tasted like it had been sitting out all day. The pita bread was dry and crimping when trying to eat it with the hummus. They advertise their specials but don't have any. They say it's past- my question why keep advertising of you don't have the items anymore. Don't think this place would be worth trying unless your desperate. I'd have to say the two employees upfront were nice but the manager would even acknowledge any of the customers. More worried about telling the other employees what they need to clean."}
{"text":"Compared to any others the service here is abysmal.  Asked For a falafel platter still got a mixed.  They need to mention on their site or Uber eats that their gyro is beef and not lamb.  This is crucial due to religious purposes. Horrific service. Won't be ordering again. I'll stick to it whenever I go back to nyc where at least they pride themselves in the service."}
{"text":"This is the best option at the food court! Great food and excellent service!i had the hummus and falafel sandwich with the best French fries ever! The staff is really friendly and generous with the white sauce ! And I am very picky so everything looks clean and fresh! Good addition at the Caesars palace"}
{"text":"So bomb. Don't underestimate the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Super pumped that these guys have a \"Brick & Mortar\" resto in Vegas now. I lived in Manhattan and ate the Chicken Rice plates with the \"White Sauce\" all the time. Now I don't have to stand up and eat it. I can finally sit down lol #MustTry"}
{"text":"Halal Guys has been the talk of the town these past couple of weeks. I'm sad to say it was not worth my 20 minute wait.

I ordered the regular combo platter with chicken and gyro. The platter was topped with a layer of white sauce, along with balanced servings of meat, lettuce and rice. The sauces definitely made up the stars in this review. The white sauce was oh so lovely but oh so bad for you. Their red sauce had a great kick (be warned, you will likely finish your meal with a lingering burn on your mouth).

In terms of actual food, I thought the gyro meat's texture was a bit mushy, and the chicken was alright.

This area offers plenty of options for a quick bite, so I probably won't be revisiting on my own accord."}
{"text":"Simple food done right. I've always somehow missed my opportunities to pick something up from their cart in New York, so I bookmarked this spot to check out. I met up with my bf's extended family here - met for the first time, laughed, learned a little about each other, all over delicious chicken and rice. We ate at a BIG variety of food while we were in Vegas and the Halal Guys is among the top of my list. I can't wait for them to open in Atlanta later this year/early next year!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place in the food court. It's open late, and for $9.99 you get so much! I could only eat half of my bowl! I got the combo bowl which throws in beef, chicken, rice, salad, bread, white sauce and a strand of spicy sauce. I love spicy and I  was a little thrown off when I only got a small strip of  spicy but I was pleasantly surprised with the level of kick! Rice is full of flavor, salad is crisp, cheap, quick, ample and delicious!!"}
{"text":"They could've come up with a better name than white sauce ... lol

There's a lot of hype with Halal Guys. But don't get it twisted, this is not NYC. It's so much better in New York. 

It's still good, but is a bit pricey for fast food - $12.49 + tax for a chicken and gyro platter. The portion isn't as big either. 

It's not officially open until May 5th. It's a soft opening, they're still training staff. 

The hot sauce is crazy spicy. It tastes like burning

{"text":"Maybe because it was too busy when I was in there. Hard to get a seat. This felt like the Subway Sandwich assembly line of Middle Eastern fare. Food was okay, but I've had tastier. If we were just judging hot sauce, they would get 5 stars though. That stuff is pure fuego, and you'll want some of that white sauce to survive."}
{"text":"When we visited New York in 2012 our cousin introduced us to this amazing dish on the streets of New York from the Halal guys. It was our first experience and the food was Yummy! Since then we wanted to eat it again. We are happy to hear that they've opened one up in Las Vegas. We ordered the beef gyro & combo plate to share and of course can't forget about the white sauce dressing. Everything was delicious, flavorful and satisfied our long awaited craving... Will definitely be back again.  Thanks Halal guys!!"}
{"text":"WOOOOWWW. This place is literally amazing.

Chipotle + Mediterranean Food + Better Deserts than Chipotle (being that they have some) = Halal Guys. I will literally wait in line for however long it takes, because I love this place so much. I first had it in NYC, and it was great then, and it's even better now because I don't have to go all the way to NYC to get it. There's also usually cute dogs on their patio outside so what is not to love?"}
{"text":"Gross parsley's is way better...I'm so disappointed. You're doing New Yorkso so wrong ugh. Only good thing is locals get a discount. However is is worth it? No!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! The food was awesome, the service was great! Nothing else to say.."}
{"text":"Warning the hot sauce ruins the food. Who needs to burn the s*** out of their mouth eating this? The food is not as good as I had hoped. The white sauce everyone raves about tastes like mayonnaise. I don't get the appeal. I wanted to like it much more than I did based on all the great review. But it's not worth the 10 bucks."}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations since I've heard there famous. Boy was I disappointed. The lettuce they put in the platters is disgusting low grade iceberg white lettuce. And the meat is a little dry. This would have been okay had I not asked for the hot sauce. They asked if I wanted the hot sauce I said yeah and she asked how many lines. I usually love hot sauce and eat it on everything but this was not hot sauce, this was fire sauce. It was so hot I literally could not even finish my food. My mouth, lips and nose were burning and you can't fast any flavor other than hot. You should really warn people that the hot sauce is this hot or not even offer it to be put on. It's ridiculously hot. It's not even remotely tasty. It took an hour of me drinking ice cold water for my lips to stop burning. Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"When news hit that The Halal Guys were gonna open up in Vegas, everybody was excited including me. Ironically, I was in New York the same week they opened. Of course I got my Halal fix while I was there and when I get back home to Vegas, I was definitely gonna hit this place up for its that good.

Located in the same plaza as the Thai restaurant Krung Siam, these guys are basically on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View. The place is kind of small so good luck in finding a table at peak hours. I came in on a late tuesday evening around 9 pm. Im glad they close late for I was starving and was looking forward to another experience like I did just weeks before.

Unfortunately, it was no where near what I came to expect. The first thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the giant portable air conditioner in the middle of the restaurant. Not only was it loud, but I dont think it was sufficient enough to keep the place cool for it was still pretty warm in there. Now if they were trying to simulate the hot outdoor weather of New York since its a food cart well then they kind of succeeded. You just dont have the humidity part. I still dont know how you New Yorkers get accustomed to that sticky feeling on your skin.

Anyways, I got the regular size Gyro Combo ($9.99) which was only a dollar more than the small combo. This consisted of shredded chicken, beef, a salad mix, some rice, and slices of pita bread. 

This is the part that is very disappointing. Both meats were dry! I threw some white sauce on there and it only helped it a little bit. For those of you that are not familiar with their sauces, their main one is what people describe as a spiced up mayo/ranch sauce. Only this sauce seemed more watered down and I could hardly taste any spices. They also have a hot sauce that is a legit make you cry steam coming from your head type of spicy in which you should only put a little bit first just to see if you can handle the heat.

I hate to say it but this is where the \"chain\" restaurant label comes in meaning that the food is nothing like its original location. Thats the best way I can describe it. In my opinion, the food carts they have in New York, the reason why they have really long lines and its not dry is because the food is cooked fresh. This location it looks like they cook everything in mass quantities and then put them in food trays. So by the time you get your food, its been sitting in the trays for a little bit.

So in closing, I am very disappointed. Im definitley not gonna be craving this type of cuisine any time soon and if I do, it will be somewhere else. My experience was not good to the point that it was laughable because of the hype that came with this opening. If anybody asks me about these guys I will refer them to this review. Im not saying for them not to go but if they come back and tell me it was laughable as well, then I will have no choice but to call these guys \"The Ha!Lol Guys\"

{"text":"Had the chicken and beef gyro combo. The rice was dry, the pita bread wasn't heated up and the tomatoes were unripe. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Beef Gyro sandwich and the meat and ingredients were really great!!! The pita bread that it came with was really dry and not great. I should have ordered the platter. Next time..."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good! There aren't too many options but the flavor of everything makes up for it :) Beware of the hot sauce though, it's really spicy!"}
{"text":"delicious 
The platters are a lot, could easily feed two. yummy and get speedy service"}
{"text":"Definitely smelt like New York street meat. So I was reminiscent of back home immediately. Staff was the coolest. Up sold me on the hummus for a dollar more. We laughed cause she was a true salesperson. Told her that her confidence should be in timeshares with me. 
Falafel sandwich was good and not overcooked. Price wasn't too over the top. Next time I will get the platter and bring my son to see what he thinks about it since he's not eating meat this month.
Happy to have food venues from the east coast other than pizza here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food at great price... nice orderly service to get you faster through than Chipotle...gyro meat is the best but beware of red sauce since it's extra hot"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The hummus was ok. The falafel was ok. The gyro (beef only) was almost like a ground beef it was chopped so finely. The chicken is also shredded. It's ok. The white sauce is a seasoned mayo basically. I was expecting and hoping for tzatziki. The hot sauce is extremely hot, as they warn you, but not a flavorful or good hot. Nothing here was awful, nothing was remarkable or worth a second trip. Try it when the novelty fades so you can find a place to sit while you eat your mediocre food."}
{"text":"Halal Guys is one of my FAVORITE places in Tempe! The menu is simple and delicious. 
Yesterday I visited in the afternoon with my boyfriend. It was pretty busy, but the staff was so efficient that we barely had to wait. I got the gyro sandwich with white sauce and 3 lines of hot sauce. It is super hot but the sauce is amazing and gives so much flavor! I also got hummus and pita on the side. My boyfriend got the combo platter with a side of french fries. Both of our meals were amazing and we left so happy! I would highly recommend this for high quality, fast, fresh food!"}
{"text":"Got the food through UberEATS. The food was delivered on time. 

We had ordered two platters plus two extra hot sauces . The platters are supposed to come with two white sauces(4) and 1 red sauce(2). When we got the order we only had three white sauces and 2 hot sauce and 2 were missing. I called and they apologized but they can't refund because it was through UberEATS.

The food quality is average at best. The rice has no flavor. The white sauce is mayo based nothing to rave about. The hot sauce might be just bit too hot. The meats are ok

I would stick to places like Baiz or haji baba!!!

Sadly won't be coming again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I wish I could give The Halal Guys (Toronto) more stars, but I just can't. While the experience wasn't horrible, it just wasn't the same as Halal Guys in NYC. 

My visit here was around noon on a weekday. That was the mistake because the lineup was all the way around the building almost to the Wellesley Station entrance. Luckily, I had a friend who got there just as rush was starting and was at the front of the line who ordered food for the two of us. (Thank you Erica U.).

If you've ever been to the NYC street cart chain, you wait because the carts are small and can only cook so much food at a time, so the lineup was justified. This Toronto location is an actual restaurant with sit down areas and all, cooking surfaces are at least 2x the size, so you'd think the food comes quicker. Kind of, but because they take debit and credit as well as cash, line up takes a while. 

I feel the restaurant regulates serving sizes because I got the same combo plate as the last time I visited NYC and NYC combo plate was much more full, whereas the one we got this time, it was more rationed. The taste is fairly close.

If the lineup continues to stay this long, I think I'll just wait until the next time I get back to NYC for my next Halal Guys fix."}
{"text":"So what can I say it's the Halal guys the food of course was delicious as always and the quality was definitely on point. I was kind of worried about taking my husband there because he had never tried it and I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype. It's in the heart of downtown so that's really nice we did have some trouble finding parking but that's typical of anything in downtown. Once we got there thankfully there was not much of a line and we were able to order but it was really really hot inside the restaurant and they actually had one of those humongous commercial fans blowing towards everyone. We got our food and even ordered some falafel. We were able to get a table easily and sat down to eat. Since they are cooking the food right then and there behind the line where you order it just gets really incredibly hot and extremely noisy especially when they're chopping up the chicken all you hear is really loud middle bringing together which is what we heard for about 20 minutes or so. We got lucky because as soon as we sat down and started eating the line got really long and went out the door but they were serving people pretty quickly. Everybody was in search of a table though so it became a little bit rushed and then of course it was really hot in there so I just felt like there was too much going on. A homeless guy came in and literally went through the entire restaurant asking people for money but not one person noticed he even asked people in the line where people were ordering the food and again not one employee noticed or asked him to leave. This was quite bizarre because he's literally asking one person away from the cashier and every other person in line as they order food but they really had no clue or care as to what was going on inside the restaurant! Again the food was good but I would say the falafel was the biggest hit of the night which I'm really glad my husband ordered. I still don't think that \"fast food\" for two people that are eating two small entr√©es plus a drink and falafel should cost 30 bucks though!"}
{"text":"so glad these guys came here. I had halal guys last time I was in NYC off a food truck and it was very good then, STILL AS GOOD The only thing  is always packed and and no place to sit and eat but bring memories back.."}
{"text":"Upon entering the store we weren't greeted or acknowledged. Ordering was a bit confusing and the worker wasn't much help. Although the veggies in my sandwich were very yummy and fresh, the chicken was WAY too dry and over cooked and ruined it for me. Unfortunately will not be returning to try anything else."}
{"text":"I am not drinking the same koolaid or \"white sauce\" that everyone else is. The tbl next to me put it best, This is not really worth $9-10 as I can get similar and even better food for less.

The falafel itself was crunchy and moist inside, however it lacked the flavor punch I am used to. The rice was fine nothing special same for the iceburg lettuce and tomato \"salad\"  a few soft peta points and that is a platter. They offer two sauces, White some may like dressing, and hot which truly is hot. However no tahini.

Sure it may have been on TV but you cant state what you see on tv."}
{"text":"Note for the Vegetarians out there, their normal pitas are warmed and flavored over the meat, if you ask they will make a vegetarian non meat warmed pita. 

As for the food I was not impressed. The flafel was dense and not that flavorful,

The hummus is quite good but you do not get that much of it.

The rice is, yellow but it is just rice.

The \"salad\" us just iceberg and tomato, quite weak.

Their special sauce is just a salad dressing, not the type of sauce you would expect to have with middle eastern food."}
{"text":"From Wikipedia: \"The Halal Guys is a halal fast casual restaurant franchise that began as a food cart on the south-east corner of 53rd Street and Sixth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.\" 

I love that fact about this place. Been wanting to try them out, ever since the location in Tempe opened up. 

This new location is on the NE corner of Stapley and Baseline, where the old Eklectic Pie was. 

I grabbed the combo platter. It comes with some beef gyro, chicken, basmati rice, and lettuce and tomato. There are a few toppings you can have them add, such as onions, and peppers. The \"famous\" white sauce doesn't cost extra, but garlic spread does. I tried a splash of their hot sauce. They weren't kidding when they say it's 20 times hotter than a jalapeno. Lastly, I got side of hummus and some baklava as well. 

Over all, everything was good and tasted fresh. Both meats had good flavor. I really liked the light crispiness of the gyro. Baklava was really good. I wasn't a fan of the hummus.  It was a little heavy with tahini for my liking, but it didn't taste bad. I wasn't a fan of the whole pita either. There was something that I didn't like about the texture, but the cut up pieces that they use, were good. 

Staff was really friendly, and the place is open late. Worth a try, in my opinion. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent and very strategic location in the Caesar's Palace Forum shops! We went here after the Britney concert for some late night food (it's open until 4 am). 

I've had Halal Guys in many places around the country including the original NY location. Food was on point (gyro over rice)! Service was friendly and quick! There is plenty of seating in the Forum food court as well for you to sit and eat. 

A very safe and reliable option for a late night or really any time of day in LV!"}
{"text":"tldr

Got:
-half chicken/half beef combo platter; the meat was fresh and flavorful but once mixed together with the white sauce and hot sauce everything just clicked. I disliked the pita bread a lot, it wasn't up to par with the rest of the meal.

Protip: use half of a white sauce pack and only use the hot sauce sparingly; its wicked hot dude."}
{"text":"Great NYC style street meat rice. For those who are complaining about too much salad, you have to tell them to give you more rice or no salad at all if that's what you want, and they won't load up with veggies. 

Still does not compare to the original 53rd and 6th Halal Guys in NYC, but it's still different from eating the repetitive shawarma and shish taouk in the city."}
{"text":"Food was not good and could not finish 60% of my sandwich just went to trash.
Other friends did not like it either.
May be the chicken shawarma was not from the rolling stick but from a left over.
Fries not a good kind of fries."}
{"text":"Food Quality and Hospitality was great , chicken and Gyro Test so good , whit sauce amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! The staff are friendly and the portions are large. You could easily share them. 

My go to order is the chicken-gyro combo platter, love it!"}
{"text":"I have heard about the New York Halal Guys so often, I can't believe they are now opening in Montreal! Today was he grand opening so there was a huge line up. I waited ohtside for 30 minutes , but it was totally worth it. There has been so much hype about the chicken and gyro platter and HG' white sauce that my expectation built up pretty high. I was also curious since they say their food tastes different, but I've had chicken and beef platter at other places like Shawarmaz and Kojax and they taste pretty similar...BUT HG is truly different.

I ordered the regular chicken and gyro platter with extra white sauce. The white sauce is soooo gooood and goes so well with the other ingredients. Unlike the meat I have eaten in similar resto, HG's chicken and gyro was not dry and hard at all. The pita was fluffy. Everything was just perfect. 

The price might be a little high compared to the 7$ platter HG offer at their food cart in NYC, but their price is reasonable compared to similar platter offered at Montreal.

I will be back for sure, hopefully there won't be a lineup next time I come."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service best food in Vegas. I come to Vegas 2 times a year and the food in Vegas is overpriced. You want to keep your stomach full and keep your wallet full 
The Halal Guys is the spot."}
{"text":"I would say my favorite  is the regular gyro platter. I always come here if I get off early from work. And the good thing is this place is open till 4."}
{"text":"Came back last night at midnight because the owner reached out to me to apologize for my first experience. This experience was a lot better, the employees were more interactive and provided great customer service."}
{"text":"Service is 5 stars, we were helped by a very kind lady who really went above and beyond to make sure that I had everything I needed. 
The yelp check-in Baklava reward bugged out and she still gave it to me and made sure to give me one from the fridge and not the one sitting outside.

Food is 4 stars, about the same compared to other locations but it's a franchise, so it's expected."}
{"text":"I've eaten this on the streets in New York and was pretty excited to see it here in Vegas.  Unfortunately the restaurant version is not good - at all. Not one of the ingredients in the combo bowl was worth eating; not the rice, not the lettuce, not the tomatoes, not the onions, not the olives, not the jalapenos, not the pita and for sure not the \"beef\" or chicken. I don't know how you can screw any or all of that up. Literally the only redeeming thing there was the white sauce and the spicy red sauce. Too bad that copious amounts of both couldn't mask the unacceptable level of quality of everything else. I think one of two things is happening here, 1) the Halal vendor carts in NY actually serve better food, or 2) food generally tastes better when you're tired and hungry from walking the streets all day or you've been out late, you're starving and it's the only thing you can find. Neither of which is the case if you drive over and hit this place for lunch in Vegas. The good news is - Parsley sells similar food that is high quality and delicious only 5 minutes away. The staff was friendly, if that counts for anything..."}
{"text":"Delicious! Meals are big enough to share. It taste almost as good as the one in New York. My favorite is the combo platter."}
{"text":"Oh boy, I love me some Halal! I've been to the originals in NY (my hometown) and I have to say that they're the next best thing. I went their opening week. Any time you go to a restaurant's grand opening day or grand opening week it's expected to come across some confusion or problems. It's understandable. But I was pleased to have an amazing experience there!

The decor was fabulous, it reminded me of New York, it even had a New York mural on the wall. Options on the menu were very simple and to the point. All of the food is fresh, and their signature sauces are within reach on ice by the soda machines. I got a falafel platter, generous servings,  really good, and I drowned them in their amazing white sauce. My husband got one of the meat platter combos, that was great too! 

We'll be back! I love the late hours! Perfect for Vegas!"}
{"text":"I go to halal guys in NYC every day I'm there when I visit cause it's just that good!

Unfortunately, the vegas one doesn't even come close...the rice seemed under cooked or dry and bland. And the white sauce wasn't as good. I'd say skip it and save it for when you're in NYC.

Vegas #3 meal, another disappointment."}
{"text":"Reading some of these reviews, I can not speak of or relate to the OG spot in NY, but what I can say though is that this spot was consistent in taste compared to the LA locations. The wait wasn't bad on grand opening day and they also handed out some appetizers for those in line. Also service was great, I think her name was Stephanie who was the one that went above and beyond for us. Aside from that I would definitely be back because the food is FUEGO!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Air conditioning system is missing. Customer service is rude. Food is over priced. Nine dollars for a Gyro and three dollars for a soda. Also there is no lamb only Beef Gyros"}
{"text":"Gross gross gross!!!!  If you want authentic Mediterranean food this is NOT the place. This is the chipotle of middle eastern (and not in a good way). I got the combo plate for $10. I was the second customer of the day my gyro meat was dry and chicken was cold.  Don't be fooled with the white sauce. It's not a cool refreshing yogurt based Tzatziki sauce you might expect.  It's some house sauce that left a greasy film on the roof of my mouth.   Like I ate a spoonful of mayonnaise. 
#notmygyro.  Ha. 
I'm giving it 2 stars because the produce was fresh and the restaurant was clean.   Never again !"}
{"text":"If you want something to eat. Come here you won't regret it. By far the best food I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with this place. Been wanting to come for a long time. Ordered beef gyro and the beef was really dry. Service was good but good nothing to be excited about."}
{"text":"I remember waiting in line at the Halal guys in New York and ordering my chicken and rice with extra white sauce. I think I cried because of how much it changed my life so when I heard Halal guys were coming to Montreal, it was priority on my \"to eat\" list. 

I ordered chicken and rice. To my disappointment, the halal guys in Montreal are ruining the Halal guys name. The chicken is dry, rice isnt as flavourful, & the prices are ridiculously high ($13 +tax for plate) compared to the one in NYC. The red sauce is a numbing burning spice making it very unpleasant to eat (NYC's red sauce is heat and flavour). I eat EXTREMELY spicy and I did not enjoy it at all. 

Overall, it's alright but I would not recommend. If its your first time trying Halal guys, DO NOT try the one in Montreal. Do it right and go to New York City, it's 100000% better than this one."}
{"text":"An unfortunate let-down as everything just seemed saturated and un-fresh, and a bit expensive for what I got. The pita and tomatoes were the winners of my combo plate, but that's a far cry from a compliment as it's the entirety of the meal I should be touting. 

-Gyro meat was too strongly seasoned, overly wet with juices
-Chicken was chunky and fatty, not nicely chopped or shredded
-White sauce was alright but nothing signaturely fresh and clean
-Baklava costs $2.00 for the BITE portion I got...don't get me wrong, I don't mind the portion but TWO DOLLARS for something less than tomorrow gourmet...?! Please! 

Service: Lastly, I actually entered the establishment twice and wasn't acknowledged the first time within the 2 minutes I reviewed the menu, so I went to check out another establishment. 30 minutes later I came back and it took, again, over a minute to even be greeted. I will not be back, and unfortunately, given the entire experience, I've got a less than pleasant taste in my mouth for The Halal Guys."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Amazing food, clean pleasant environment, and friendly smiles all around. My first time, Angela the manager was a great help and fun to talk with. Will come again soon and bring my family."}
{"text":"Not as good as NYC but the white sauce. OMG yum. The spice is spicy and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Dat hot sauce tho. It's probably the second hottest hot sauce I've had, but, unlike the first, it was very tasty...which is a trap. I'm used to heat, so the mouth feel was fun to deal with. The G. I. feel from ingesting all that heat was not fun, and I only have myself to blame. I actually think I had a headache the next day because of it. 

Besides that, it's exactly what their website or any picture will show you. A gyro or a gyro bowl. Unless you have no place to store it, go with the large bowl. It's much better bang for your buck. The regular looks like a small next to the large and it's only a dollar more.

It's good food, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend going out of your way to get it. If you're in the area, stop by and you won't be disappointed. But don't expect this to be your new favorite place."}
{"text":"Meh...Friendly Service, but below average food and strange banging

I went here on Friday night with my wife, but I should have taken a closer look at the reviews before doing so.  The basic set up is a bit strange when you first walk in, but the setup is basically like Chipotle or Cafe Rio with premade food that they put into a container for you.  In this context, we opted for the combo (chicken and beef) and the beef platters.  

First, the platter is primarily salad.  Second, the rice in the platter is overcooked and bland.  Third, the overly chopped nature of the beef and chicken are likely on purpose to hide poor quality meat.  Anyway, the platter was underwhelming.  The sauces that they offer aren't really that great, even the famous white sauce, and the hot one must be habanero based and will set your mouth on fire.  Either way, I won't be eating here again.  I will just go to the Great Greek Mediterranean Grill on Blue Diamond that is vastly superior to the food offered at Halal Guys.  The beef gyro just looks sad at Halal Guys.  

Finally, this place has strange, loud banging.  I think the employees must be \"chopping\" the meat on the steel countertops, which causes a super loud, obnoxious banging noise that goes on for at least 15 minutes.  It is super distracting.  As to the NYC comparison, I have actually eaten at the one in Mid Town since it was part of a walking food tour.  I haven't eaten there in about seven years, but there is no comparison.  If you're lucky to eat at the one in NYC, and you don't want to opt for the tremendous amount of other options, then you should try the one there.  Just be ready for a long line and to eat while standing."}
{"text":"Walked in expecting great food but also received really great service. Greeted as soon as I walked in through the door with my brothers and it nothing but great customer service. Food was served hot and with the urgency as if there was a rush. Will be back for the good food and great experience I had. I believed the employee's name was Tyra according to my receipt and I didn't get the other lady's name but she made my fries and let me know about the wait for the fries which was nice of her and gave me a notice before I finalized my order. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I had the chicken \"sandwich\", I'd call it a wrap and be warned it's mainly dark meat. It's plentiful and the wrap is delicious fluffy bread. The veggies were fresh and their hummus will not disappoint!  I practically licked the container clean. Hummus was definitely the high point. 

Tough that they will compete with all the pita places down the road. But it's quick and filling."}
{"text":"We checked it out   We tried the combo was ok not that impressive. The baklava was very good. The service everyone was very helpful and friendly and offered recommendations. Portion size is very good. I am not sure but something seemed to be missing."}
{"text":"Awesome to have this as an option in Ahwatukee! Definitely give it a try... the combo platter was delicious and the signature white sauce didn't disappoint. The red sauce is seriously HOT! The staff was incredibly friendly and it's a definite plus that there is ample parking available."}
{"text":"My first time eating at this chain, and was very disappointed. I don't plan on returning. The food was bland and a bit dry, what a shame. There's a good chance this restaurant won't be around for long if their cooking doesn't improve --the service was very friendly however."}
{"text":"All of the employees were very nice and attentive. I ordered the falafel platter,&  it was absolutely delicious!! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed a platter of Halal Guys in 5 different states, the first being New York, followed by Texas, California, Virginia, and now Arizona. If you don't already know, Halal Guys is famous for its standard \"chicken/lamb over rice\" platter and duo of sauces (\"white sauce\" and \"red sauce\") that add all the flavor. No matter which Halal Guys you go to, you're going to be met with these basic options. Yet, every Halal Guys around the U.S. still manages to offer a slightly different taste and overall experience. 

At this particular Halal Guys, I recommend the gyro platter over the chicken -- the gyro is plentiful in flavor where the chicken lacks. I also recommend checking the Hooked App before making your purchase, they frequently offer coupons that could score you a discount on your meal and sometimes free baklava, fries, and a drink. If you are going to choose between fries and baklava, I say go for the baklava. Halal Guys offers crinkle-cut fries, a fry that proves time and time again to be a disappointment. Their crisp-to-fluff ratio is nothing short of absurd.  

It's not all bad here though, in fact the service here is quite speedy, the location is directly across from ASU, and there is plenty of parking and seating inside. Don't expect it to live up to the hype of NYC Halal Cart, but don't be bummed either --- this location is better than many of the other chains sprouting up around the West Coast."}
{"text":"Portions are small, I ordered a regular plate and the guy gave me the same portion as someone who ordered a small plate. Rice had a weird plastic taste, chicken and rice was warm at best. Nothing like nyc and definitely doesn't live up to its name."}
{"text":"I've just experienced another great visit to this new location. on the VIP NIGHT before opening...the new location is spacious and clean and well decorated the food was sooo good agin the combo platter and loaded fries white sauce yumm the chicken is sooo flavorful and even tho most the staff is training it was still a really good visit .. I love this chain"}
{"text":"I love this place .. i LOVE the food and I'm always happy with the people and the service it's very clean and inviting I tell everyone about this new location 100% satisfied"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean food in Las Vegas!!!  

Service:  10/10 The staff was incredibly friendly and prompt making the food.  The restaurant is very clean and welcoming.  The staff actually chatted and joked with us the whole time.  They were great.  

The food is incredible.  Three of us ordered combo platters with beef and chicken and all of us thought it was amazing. Each platter comes with a  generous portion of meat, rice, pita bread, and you have to load up on the white sauce!

Halal guys is a staple for me and I will definitely be coming back frequently.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHECKING THEM OUT!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night around 10pm... Not crowded.. Fast and friendly service

Food: I had the chicken combo platter which was delicious... Loved the white sauce. Rice was okay... Sampled the red sauce... Not for me... Really hot!

Overall enjoyed the meal and will be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Located in the food court in Cesars.   Anytime I can eat at Halal Guys I'm In! Best place in the Vegas touristy area to get some quick, good, real food at a reasonably price. Hubby and I shared a rice plate and we were both full. My only complaint was it was 4.79 for a fountain soda. Only one huge size available . Only Pepsi products. Not there fault. This is the only option throughout Cesars."}
{"text":"Ordered the beef gyro sandwich & it was definitely worth what I paid for! Also got the falafel platter. It's probably the best I've had. Service was superb! The young black lady was super kind as well!"}
{"text":"Food: 
(+) Combo Plate - The chicken and beef were being made right when I walked in so I got lucky. Folks here don't skimp out on the portions! The meats were fresh and weren't dry like my experiences in the past. The sauces were out and you could add as much as you wanted to without asking the staff to get the bottles. A hardy meal for under $10 bucks! Get the regular size, it is a dollar extra! 

Vibes: It was late and there was surprisingly not a lot of people inside so not bad at all. 

Service: Staff was friendly and patient because it took my friends and I a while to order so I appreciate your patients!"}
{"text":"The falafel tasted on point, it just looked strange. If you're looking for authentic Mediterranean food you're not going to find it here. They've operationalized the process... it's fast food."}
{"text":"When a middle eastern family walked in and left immediately we should have taken it as a sign to leave. We ordered the combo small and large plates. A new girl working started preparing the small plate and gave minute portions. There was a customer that came after us and colleen gave huge potions too. We decided to ask for the same and still got a little food. When I asked to give us a little more they said she is training. But thank goodness she gave us a little rice because it was hard and uncooked. The food was served cold. Do not recommend this location. Ive had halal guys in nyc and socal and this is by far the worst ive ever had. Save yourself the time of driving to spring mtn. This was gross."}
{"text":"We got a quick snack from here while we waited for our food from the place next to it.
So the service was slow and the people who were there at the time were getting easily annoyed by the people in front of me who asked questions about the food. 
All I wanted was hummus and bread.... that took about 10 minutes because instead of just getting it and paying, I had to wait until these ladies got their special ordered food while 3 employees just kinda stood around.
The hummus was good but could have used a little more seasoning. Made me a little frustrated I wasted 10 minutes and over 5 bucks to have meh hummus."}
{"text":"Quick service and decent fresh food. Good value for the price in the casino. I ordered beef gyro sandwich  (really a wrap) for $10 and it came with a good amount of meat with fresh veggies. The beef was a bit greasy for my liking so I'd recommend getting the chicken instead."}
{"text":"So experience was awesome. Great food and fantastic service. I recommend the night crew if you ever get a chance to stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved it! The service was great the line moved fast. I had the combo plate. The meat had great flavor and was great with the white sauce. I dared to try the hot sauce - the flavor was wonderful but couldn't handle the heat, be careful! Looking forward to trying the sandwich and if I got a plate again I would do all gyro. It was really nice to dine with  a great diverse group of people enjoying world food."}
{"text":"Nothing stood out to me, I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries and it was just an average sandwich but it wasn't bad, my brother ordered the regular chicken platter with fries and he told me it's really filling which is always good, but We both ordered a side of fries and they were the saltiest fries I've ever had and they were a little dry, they have nice customer service"}
{"text":"Yesterday late night visit.got beef gyro platter not a good choice food was greasy blend and too much white sauce. Only thing i like is hummas."}
{"text":"The Halal Guys is one of our favorite NYC stops.  Being from California, were excited to see this company expand into the West.  On short visit to Phoenix we stopped in to get the Halal we've come to love.  Short story: We got it.  We loved the food.  On a scale of 10, this place in Tempe is a solid 9 compared to the Manhattan Halal Guys.  I think there was less meat on my plate than the NY joints.  We didn't try the baklava or the falafels, but the gyro, chicken, rice, and french fries were perfectly prepared.  The white sauce is what makes the dish, don't skip it.  I got two rows of hot sauce but could have used a third.  I love it. 

I have to mention my interactions with the manager. Nidal is amazing.  This GM will take this restaurant to heights unknown.  After chatting a bit, it was clear that his mission is customer service.  His goal is to perfect this restaurant.  HALAL GUYS - Nidal is your guy!  

On food alone, I would leave a strong 4 star review, but because of the management, it is a 5 star restaurant.  Wish I lived closer to enjoy more frequent visits.  Well done Halal Guys."}
{"text":"Staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable when I asked if they had any vegan options. There's only one - the falafel which didn't disappoint. Perfectly fried NOT greasy, crispy on the outside with flavorful chickpea filling."}
{"text":"First time in here and their AC is broken. Its a really small place so its very crowded since they are busy. They offer free bottled water. 

The lady that was taking the trash out and cleaning table is VERY friendly (African American). She was so helpful letting us know what to try and to slow down with the hot sauce cause its very hot. 

I ordered the combo and its pretty good! I put a lot of white sauce to make it better and the veggies on the side helps to balanced out the taste. Overall its good but I think its just hype"}
{"text":"Went there opening day, it smelled good from the outside while we were waiting. Getting in was disappointing because the only options were tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, chicken, gyro, and rice with a small assortment of sauces. I have allergies so I couldn't have their white sauce and got hummus instead, which they didnt tell me was extra! The food was overall bland and just a small amount of the hot sauce made the dish almost inedible. I'd rather go to Hummus Xpress where they give you an entire pita with your bowl, not three measly cut up pieces"}
{"text":"Only a little more than other Reviewers to contribute.

Yes, the \"regular\" Combo Plate (pictured) portion (mostly rice & iceberg) is large, the service was fast & friendly and they're open late, but other than that ... meh?  The very bright orange rice and chicken & gyro meats were a dry and the overall flavor (including that of the iceberg and diced tomatoes) was bland.  The \"White Sauce\" (pictured) did add some flavor.  By the admission of one female Employee, it's very similar (but more liquid-y) to mayonnaise.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of mayo on gyro meat, rice or salad fixings.

I also ordered French Fries (pictured).  Again, the portion size was large and they were served hot, but lacked ANY salt for flavor.  Had the male Employee who made them bothered to wash his hands after handling a broom (and possibly other cleaning chemicals / supplies), I may have been more comfortable eating them.

The price was a little on the high side.  The Combo Platter with French Fries (but no drink) plus tax was over $12.  This part of town (and others) has too much competition for Middle Eastern food to price it as such, especially considering the food quality and handling / sanitation concerns.

In sum, ok, but there is plenty of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype about the expansion to AZ... was able to have my order delivered via UberEats.  We ordered the falafel sandwich, combo platter, and hummus to try a little bit of everything they offer.  Falafel was great, super crispy.  Everything was good, but I feel like we have better local Mediterranean restaurants here.  Will most likely reorder delivery for convenience."}
{"text":"Wanted a late night snack after work. Great customer service! Decided to get the combo plate.  The only thing I ate prior was wing stop and that never disappoints.  The combo at halal was not that good. Nothing special.  The next day I felt sick and couldn't keep anything down! First time I ever got food poisoning. Nightmare! I'm avoiding this place. Hope it was just me and nobody else.  The hummus was very good and the pita I'm not too picky about."}
{"text":"Great look and a very friendly staff! Got the combo plate and a side of hummus that I thought was just okay. I expected this food to be a healthier option than it actually was. Everything was made with soy bean oil, but overall it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay let's get to the point. It was alright not worth the hype and price honestly. I was introduced to halal guys just from watching videos on it and a close friend who lives in NY telling me it is cheap and the lamb is a must have. Tried it on the grand opening for the first ever and it was pricy. $10 for a platter when at the cart I saw it was ranging $7-$8 plus I got charged to have sauce when i wanted to stay and eat. Total bill was about $12 a platter At the moment I was pretty astonished on why it costed so much. Overall the food was dry. The sauce was really good and was the only thing that kept the whole platter alive. The meat was pretty bland too. I was pretty disappointed for my first experience but I thought it just because of the grand opening. I went again 2 days after the grand opening to see if any thing had changed. The combo plate was a little bit better than it was the first day. Rice was dry and the meat was decent. Probably my last time coming to halal guys honestly. Not worth the price honestly"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. don't waste your time and money. The portion is smaller and in the combo platter, the meat is beef not lamb like the original. Most importantly, the meal was pretty bland and unseasoned (including the rice). The white sauce was the only thing that made it decent. I would say, they could make the right adjustments and this place would be much better, but for now, I get the sense that whoever is cooking, really couldn't care less."}
{"text":"Today i went to halal guys in china town Las Vegas this restaurant super tinny and fly welcome me,when I saw Fly i was going to walk out before order something but I wanna to give it try because of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food but I couldn't find anything in menu middle eastern or Mediterranean not even any similar dish .when I placed my order my wife showed me another Fly.i ordered more than 3 dishes they were all so salty.My food was so salty rice wasn't cooked good .this is another junk food restaurant like others fast food restaurants.i wouldn't waste my time and money again.thanks halal guys keeping too many flies in the restaurant ???"}
{"text":"When I heard Halal Guys was coming to town, I was excited. I talked it up for weeks to my husband. I told him about their reputation, the food was great and they had this \"crack sauce.\" I was so excited, it got him excited. 

Our first visit, not long after their opening, was a COMPLETE disappointment. The chicken was dry and not tasty. The rice was flavorless and the \"crack sauce\" was like watery ranch. 

I made excuses to my husband and told him they had to work out their kinks, maybe the workers needed better training. We left and forgot about the Halal Guys. Fast forward over a year later.. plenty of time for them to work out their issues, right? NO. The second visit was worse than the first. Actually, it was really the same issues as the last visit except this time, the rice was crunchy. Really dry and hard.  I ordered the bowl and had mixed the rice in, so the hard rice was in every bite.

Halal guys is NOT okie dokie. I say avoid it... unless you enjoy crunchy rice."}
{"text":"Very fast and was delicious. Food was great and fresh. Employees were very friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place was pretty average. I ordered the beef gyro platter. It was a decent amount of food for around $10, but nothing about it really stood out. I have had more flavorful gyro meat at other fast dining places, such as Hummus Xpress. The white sauce was also nothing special. The pita triangles were served cold. I'm not sure if that's how they regularly come here, but pitas should be warm.

The staff was friendly and seemed to be trained well. I also appreciate that when they say \"hot sauce,\" they mean it. I usually scoff at people who say that their restaurant's sauce is really hot, and I'm usually right (I've done the Blazin' Challenge twice). This time, I decided to take their advice and just put a little on the side. I'm glad I did. Respect to them for providing a serious hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats. Forgot part of my order. Falafel is dry. Combo plate is also dry. The sauce that comes with the falafel tastes like tahini, but with garlic. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about these guys and finally they're here in Toronto. I was beyond excited to try eating animal that was alive and healthy at the time of slaughter and all blood was drained from the carcass.

I had high anticipation of meat tasting so much yummier if a muslim had performed the slaughter in a ritual manner with the animal facing mecca.

The food was quite disappointing and oily and heavy. Even the meat was not that great which was surprising because apparently when a throat is cut by a sharp knife severing the carotid artery, jugular vein and windpipe in a single swipe, it's supposed to make the dish so much better. After hearing so many good storied about Halal guys New York location, this was a really disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The is generic Greek food. They give you chicken (mostly dark meat) lettuce & tomatoes. Wow. 

Also their white sauce is basically mayonnaise.

But if you're looking for a quick fix Greek food meal here ya go."}
{"text":"Being from ny/nj this was probaby the biggest disappointment ive encountered in vegas. Portion is way less, flavor is off, ingredients are pre made and they charge way too much. They also charge $1 for additional white sauce."}
{"text":"Decent late night food. Good customer service even though we ordered at the last few minutes. The combo platter and baklava is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I usually order via Uber Eats, and this was my first time eating at the location. Service was great, food tasted yummy, and it was quick and easy!  I usually order the beef gyro and it was amazing delicious... the white sauce and hot sauce is so tasty!"}
{"text":"Awful Awful Awful. This place shouldn't be able to call themselves \"The Halal Guys\". I've been reading reviews from this place and it seems like nothing has changed since day 1. The gyro meat tasted and looked like one batch was prepared in the AM and was left sitting out until around 8:30pm. It was tiny, greasy, rock hard pebble like pieces of beef. The rice was so dry and crunchy that it may have been prepared the day before(or a couple days before.) 

I grew up with Halal Guys and I love the food but this location is awful!! 

Aside from the piss poor quality of the food($20+ for shit) the kid behind the counter helped us out at the register. He kept his same food service gloves on while he handled our cash the proceeded to go back to prepping the meals of the customer behind us without changing his gloves!! That should be an obvious violation of food safety standards.

I contacted the franchise owner and I was given the same response that she gave a month ago. That she would look into and take it seriously, well obviously that is not the case because nothing has changed!!! Halal Guys LLC needs to rethink this location because it is ruining the Halal Guys name."}
{"text":"I really liked this place for a good lunch at a decent price near campus. It's within walking distance from ASU but I'm sure it gets crowded with students during peak times. We scored...it's spring break so lines were not long.

The menu is simple and ordering is easy. There was only one person prepping food. It would have been a bit faster had there been two people working the station, but no major complaint. The line stilled moved quickly.  

I had the regular size falafel meal.  I could not finish it. The falafel was tasty as was the rice. The side salad was fresh and was delicious with their special white sauce. (The sauce was actually lightly poured on everything and I loved it.)  Their hot sauce is super spicy and tasty. It's hotter than sriracha so watch out. I got a slow burn in my tummy about 15 minutes later, but nothing that diet coke couldn't cure. Yup, it's that hot. 

Seating is close together inside and kind of sparse outside. I wouldn't expect to get a table during prime times, so you may want to plan to get it to go. 

Service was good--- friendly and efficient staff and the it's clean too. My only teeny tiny criticism is that the fork handles are short. I had to maneuver my fork in the bowl to get at the good bits. If my only complaint is short fork handles, you know this place is good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place after hearing all the raving reviews. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed.

It's a chipotle style concept. I tried the combo plate with chicken & gyro meat. It was decent! I skipped the hot sauce though after a warning from the employees.

I'm sure I'll be back if I'm looking to grab a fast food option."}
{"text":"The best Middle-Eastern food in Arizona! Fresh and delicious flavor overall. Be sure to try the combo platter with falafel, humus, and their signature 'white sauce'"}
{"text":"My coworker and I came for lunch around 1 pm. She order the gyro and chicken regular size combo and I ordered the chicken regular. Did not enjoy, will not come back. Here's why: 

-chicken was unseasoned and tasted like nothing 
-apparently the beef tasted not like beef but actually just tasted super strange. 
-rice had a cardamom flavour but nothing else
-white sauce was watered down ranch, no garlic flavor whatsoever
-hot sauce was spicy but not flavorful (just nuked the food) 
-I had to use the washroom the next day and it was NOT pleasant. (Didn't eat anything else that day due to the large nature of the food) 

However, the portion size was decent for the money, and the lettuce and tomato was fresh."}
{"text":"Me and all my friends got intense diarrhea from this place. The hot sauce is too hot and the food was extremely over hyped. 

I'm very upset, had to put my review out there. Sorry halal guys, I wanna love you but I'm 1000% sure this was from you. 

Over all I give this place a 2/10. One point for the creative business and venue and 1 point for  trying on the food."}
{"text":"If you're ordering the falafel please do not waste your time. It comes on top of a pita with only shreds of ice berg lettuce and diced tomatoes (which oddly tasted like Taco Bell..?) The white sauce they offer is completely flavorless and bitter, and as for the hot sauce, be aware, it's so so so hot. We were so bummed, but at least the fries were good."}
{"text":"Great customer service. 

They have someone at the line so they can explain how things work. 

Food was okay. Got the combo with chicken and gyro meat. White sauce has a strong mayonnaise flavor. Not your normal white sauce, but I can see why people love it. Red sauce is smoking hot. Only a tiny bit needed. The extra pita bread is $1 and smells weird since it sits on top of the meat from the grill. Probably wouldn't order again. You can get ones that aren't on top of the meat as I was told later by the nice lady at the front. 

Fries were delicious and made when you place your order so they are very crispy and tasty. 

Not sure if I would go back. But it's definitely worth a first try for someone who hasn't been there."}
{"text":"No flavor what so ever. Not worth the price at all, it was shockingly bad. The staff was nice however they didn't understand the menu and couldn't even make recommendations."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I can guarantee the low stars are for the line out the door. The food is great quality and delicious. The line only took 10 minutes from web we got to the line all the way to paying for our food. DONT LET THIS DETER YOU! As far as middle easter fast food, this is the best I've had in Tempe. No, it's not EXACTLY the same as super authentic cuisine in the ME. No one's grandma is in the back cooking, but if you just accept the food for what it is? It's so good."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The \"white sauce\" there isn't fresh made delicious tzatziki. It's pretty much packets of ranch dressing. Also 2 packs of sauce contain 660 calories and over 100% DV of fat. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"For almost $15 for the 'regular' platter, you certainly don't get much more than the $9.99 plus tax 'small' platter. You do get extra bland lettuce (filling up half the dish) and lots more rice, but the meat quantity is pretty much the same. I watched them scoop pretty much the same amount into each container, just spread out more to cover the larger dish.

The meat flavour is pretty good and the sauce is just as I remember but the canadian price jack is just too much. This stuff sells for $7 in NYC. There are cheaper and just as good halal joints downtown."}
{"text":"Two words: white sauce! I don't know what makes it so addictive but it is amazing. Really adds creaminess to the dish and helps with the spiciness. And speaking about spicy; that hot sauce is hot! I'm a fan of hot sauce and put El Yucateco on tons of my food but their hot sauce really kicked my butt! 

Big portions, good food, what's not to love? 4/5 for me!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and generous portions. White sauce on everything! Hot sauce is seriously hot...as it should be. Do yourself a favor - eat in and enjoy all all the sauces in unlimited quantities. 

Minus one star for visiting during a slow time. If the meats have been sitting they can get a little dry. They still have the flavor you love, but become a little \"chewy\", but nothing more sauce can't help."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of the chicken on rice platter (\"extra white sauce...some more please\") from The Halal Guys NYC cart for years so I was super excited when The Halal Guys announced they'd be coming to Toronto. I've gone several times since they opened and am pretty satisfied with my experiences. The food taste is true to the quality of the original cart, and service in terms of time/customer has been quick. The price is higher, but that's to be expected at a brick & mortar location."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Gyro, Chicken in Las Vegas. My husband and I got the Gyro and Chicken plate. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"My first halal guys experience was the New York food stand so this one was rather disappointing. First of all, the prices here are much higher, which makes sense because they have a physical location and usd to cnd makes up for some of the difference. But cmon, halal guys was supposed to be a late night craving cheap eats kind of deal. 
I got the chicken and gyro plate, which had all the elements. Chicken, gyro, the coloured rice, salad, and pita bread. Food was delicious, but the gyro was too salty. Portion size is also comparable to NYC, but I feel like the pita bread was much smaller. Not a concern though. 
Lastly, I got this for delivery and they were doing a \"12 days of EATSmas\". Basically, I got the plate for $5! Obviously I write reviews based on their regular price but I highly encourage people to make the most out of promotions.
Food was good, but most likely won't go again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get the combo platter with white sauce, a scoop of hummus and a red sauce packet. It's simple but always delicious. Keep in mind the red sauce is HOTTTTT. My first time there, I was wondering why they didn't spread that sauce all around my platter and then I tasted the sauce and my mouth was on  with just one little taste. The employees are always super nice and efficient. The dining areas are clean. Everyone is always working and there's something about that makes me feel like this place really has a good system going. Only thing I wish would improve is the falafel. It's pretty hard on the outside and not always warm. All in all I'm a happy customer and I go probably once a week to satisfy my cravings!!"}
{"text":"5 Star Service, 2.5 Star Food, 1 Star Baklava! Get Out Of Line And Save Your Money!

The service here is outstanding. All of the staff were friendly and welcoming! 

The food was pretty bland.... I got the combo platter... the meat was decent but not much flavor... the spicy sauce is horrid with spice but no flavor.... 

The unbelievable part is that for the first time in my life baklava was not good! It tasted like cardboard and stale! I've never not enjoyed baklava, but I couldn't even finish my first piece, I threw piece the number 2 away. 

Baklava is -1 star!
Meal is 3 stars
Service 5 stars
Hot sauce is -1 stars

I don't imagine I will be coming back here again. I don't see what the hype was about at all. 

There are better halal food sources in the area.... 

How can baklava be bad? But it is soooo bad!"}
{"text":"It truly pains me to write this review as I was so incredibly excited for this place to open. I went to NYC for the first time last year and ate at some of the Halal carts there and their gyros were unlike any gyro I've ever had. I never visited THE Halal Guys and had heard they were the best of the best. When I heard they were opening a location here I freaked out, I couldn't wait!

We went last night around 9 pm, it wasn't that busy. I mean it was full and there was a line but I was expecting it to be outside wrapped around the building. In all it only took about five minutes from the time we walked in until we left with our order.

I ordered the chicken and gyro combo plate with the white and red sauces on the side. I tasted the white sauce before I put it on my food thankfully because it's revolting. I assumed it would be like a tzatziki but it was basically liquid mayo. I ended up adding half the packet of the red sauce which gave it a nice heat. Unfortunately the hot sauce was the only great thing about this meal.

The gyro meat was more like ground lamb than sliced gyro meat like how I had it in New York, and the meat itself was very tasteless. The chicken was ok, it wasn't dry, but again it was lacking in flavor. The rice was extremely bland as well, all the food pretty much tasted like red sauce and had no flavor of its own.

It wasn't a terrible meal it was just extremely underwhelming and disappointment. The Halal Guys came very hyped by everyone and unfortunately the dish did not come close to delivering. If I'm ever drunk in China town maybe I'll stop by again, but there are way better gyros elsewhere in Vegas to scratch that itch."}
{"text":"I went to California recently and was so happy to see they had Hala restaurants...I was looking for Hala Guys restaurants because on the website the food looks so good couldnt find one in Anaheim,Ca but a few days later just driving I was so excited to see a Hala Guys in Las Vegas been a week and been there 2x already the food is awesome and the customer service is Great!!! I am and will be a returning customer...PBTA!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Halal guys (originally from NY) was in Long Beach, CA, and it was unlike anything I've ever tasted. That orange rice, chicken, gyro, lettuce, and tomato, drizzled with that white and red sauce, all mixed together...Mmmmm...The hype was real, and I wanted to go back the next day! 

When I heard that they were opening a Halal guys in Vegas, I was ecstatic, and I was dying to have it again. However, for some particular reason, it just wasn't as good as the first time I've had it in Cali. I've been to this location twice now, and the ingredients don't seem as fresh; the meats were really dry as well. The white sauce is as good as I remember it to be, and I think the red sauce is a little tamer here (warning: it'll still burn your insides out if you consume too much). I got to try their crinkle cut fries this last time, and it was surprisingly good. Hot, fresh, crispy, and crunchy. Also, if you're gonna get the platter, go with the large, because it is significantly larger than the regular size for just $1 more. 

The service has always been good. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 rating, but due to the friendly and helpful staff, I am bumping them up to a 4."}
{"text":"Been to the original cart on 53rd & 6th and I've been counting down the days for them to open here in Vegas.  Sure it's not the same as the cart in NYC, but I'm sure that the original McDonalds was way better than the 100,000's of franchises around the world.

Food of tasty.  The white and hot sauce are as good as the cart.

The only complaint I have is the portion size.  They're a little stingy and inconsistent on portions."}
{"text":"Thanks to Savannah for the free gyro sandwich! I accidentally put too much hot sauce didn't realize that it was too spicy!!! So she gave me another one. Definitely gonna recommend! Look for Savannah! She's very accomodating and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Trying out gyros with beef.  They give you a lot for the Sandwich and it will be enough to fill you up. The taste is good but the restaurant is too noisy at times when that are chopping he meat. Otherwise it is a good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place was good for the most part as far as their food is concerned. Their customer service wasn't very good, nobody seemed to really know what was going on and it took awhile to order. 

I also do wish that Halal Guys had more options other than chicken and gyro (i.e. lamb).

Overall a somewhat decent Halal spot."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Dry food that definitely needed some sort of sauce. I ordered two sandwiches and my girlfriend ordered a small plate with a side of hummus. All very underwhelming. If they simply added sauce and didn't cook the food to well done then it would be great."}
{"text":"Good food, though a bit expensive compared to other places. I would rename it The Halal Gals though lol. A few ladies totally ran this place when we came, and did a good job for sure. They were professional, and answered any questions my wife had."}
{"text":"Good food, overpriced. Not worth the hype. 
Had it twice and I don't feel the need to ever go back"}
{"text":"I was walking around here on a Saturday at 2PM and saw that the line was quite short so I decided to give it a go. The line was about 5-10 minutes and getting my food was very fast. There are only four or so choices for food; I got the platter with chicken and gyro. Preparation was super fast, and I got to choose from three different sauces: barbecue, white sauce, hot sauce. The food was delicious but I found the meats a bit too greasy. The portion was large and there were a lot of veggies. Would definitely come back again if the line were shorter during regular lunch / dinner hours. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Lined up. Took about 20 minutes and the line seemed to move very slowly. Service was fine.

The food in NYC seemed to be better, but maybe that's because that was the first time I've ever had Halal Guys. Plus I was eating it in the middle of beautiful Central Park and not at my desk in Toronto. This food here in Toronto is nothing to write home about. I can count many places that have better shawarma than Halal Guys within arms reach. Which is disappointing. Dry, bland, and cold. Smells good though. Plus that red sauce is crazy spicy, if that is what you're into.

And the wait? Not worth it. Give me no-line and remove $5 from the cost. Then I'll bump this up to a 3/5."}
{"text":"I had to run errands in the area and decided to stop by. First and foremost, the workers here were awesome. They were extremely friendly and took the time to explain everything to us because it was our first time. The establishment itself looked pretty clean and well kept. The sauces were all labeled with the day that they were made, which was reassuring. 

Overall, the food quality was not bad but nothing amazing. The chicken was middle of the road. Not super tender and not too dry. The gyro meat was pretty damn salty. After I started eating my plate, I realized that I needed to pretty much empty half a bottle of white sauce to mask the saltiness. I'm sure that much sauce can't be too good for you, but I'm sure I've done worse to my body. The Baklava they gave us with the yelp check in was BOMB! Hands down the best part of the meal. 

I kept reading about how spicy the red sauce was so I really wanted to try for myself. Let me preface this by mentioning that I am Korean. I love eating food that makes my lips go numb and makes me break out in sweats. I started off by drizzling a small amount of sauce over my plate, but ended up dumping a ton of red sauce halfway through my meal. The red sauce definitely lived up to the hype and I loved how much it hurt. I'm definitely going to be shooting fire out my ass tomorrow, but it was worth it. 

The portion size is quite generous. Two regular size combo's was more than enough to fill us up. Pricing here was $8.49 + tax each and I think it's a fair price to ask for. This place offers decently good value for your money, but is nothing spectacular. Imagine a mediterranean version of chipotle. Would I drive out from henderson to come here? Probably not. If I was in the area, would I try it again? Sure."}
{"text":"Excited that the Halal Guys are here in Vegas. Being from the east coast, not the same as back home. Prices are a little high. Order a chicken gyro and drink and cost me around $11 and some change. I even had to ask the server put more meat on the pita bread. Over all, not getting the value for money especially that it's in the Chinatown district, you'd expect more bang for your buck. Most likely won't repeat."}
{"text":"It was very decent! The experience in NY was much better! Meat was very moist. Salad was very moist. Bread was very moist. Come eat!"}
{"text":"Wasn't even that good. More like drunk good food late at night. New York must have something better than this stuff. I think people would be more satisfied with a Taco Bell 5$ box."}
{"text":"Too much hype but disappointing at the end. The food was bland including the famed white sauce. The only exception was the falafel, which was exceptionally good. It was crisp and dark on the outside and green on the inside due to the generous use of fresh cilantro. If I go again, I would order it. Nothing else's was interesting on the limited menu."}
{"text":"Doesn't get much better as far as gyros. I typically enjoy the slices better Than the chunks, but Halal Guys is on point nonetheless. The infamous white sauce has great tasty kick and the addition of hot sauce makes for a fire sandwich. Throw on some tomato and lettuce on think pita and you got a great lunch. At $8.75 it is steep, but I think it's worth it every once in a while if you're craving spicy and are tired of the typical chipotle or panera lunch options."}
{"text":"So ordered through Uber eats and read disclaimer on the hot sauce and basically disregarded it since I  love spicy stuff. However I am very pleased that this sauce kicked my ass I just want to thank them for creating it"}
{"text":"So many mediocre reviews. So many people love to pick on the place like they can tell the difference between this and the nyc carts. Yes I too have eaten at the nyc carts many times and yes this food is comparable. Tasted the same to me (especially the sauces). 

You're not being edgy by criticizing the best of street food in the US. 

The food is great,the price is great and now the location is great. All the haters are just butthurt because now they can't brag that they alone have eaten the famous halal guys."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 because of the service I got from them, the cleanliness of the place in spite of location, and since I'm comparing it to another branch in California. The vegas franchise, of course, it's the original 53rd & 6th--but it will do for someone who lives in Vegas, and to not be ungrateful for having it in town. Combo is the only way to go for me even back in New York, even late at night or after club hours! Beware of the red sauce, you are now warned. It will generate a love-hate relationship with your food, but it is so goddamn good with the white sauce that they have. 
Altogether, I know I will be back. They are not stingy with their white sauce at all, they give you 2 packets (unlike the one in California) and they have table-extras if you decide to eat in house. 
I'm sure there are other places to get your halal fix, but trust me--this is different."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try Halal Guys . We went for an early dinner so the line wasn't to bad and even when their was a line, it moved fairly quickly. The menu is pretty simple. Either order a gyro or a platter. I opted to try the chicken and gyro platter which came with rice, lettuce, tomatoes, pita bread and the two meats. Definitely get the white sauce and it you like spicy , try the red sauce too. I usually like my food spicy so I got some more red sauce on the side. My mouth was on fire  and I regretted putting more red sauce in my food. 
I thought the meats had good flavor (esp the beef)
And the price was reasonable.
I liked that it was fast and quick and I enjoyed my meal :)"}
{"text":"I love the simplicity of this place. You can either order a plate combo or a gyro. I personally love to order the combo platter with all the fixings (jalape√±o, green pepper & olives). Top it off with their white sauce  so good!! I also love anything spicy and their red sauce is no joke. When I first came, I made the mistake of putting a bunch of red sauce thinking it wouldn't be spicy. I was totally wrong and it was so hot that I did not enjoy my meal. So I suggest getting the red sauce on the side ."}
{"text":"Came in at 2 AM Monday night looking for something other than the typical China town/sushi/ramen spot ... I was so happy to find this place open! Came in and everything was clean and the place had a great atmosphere, credit going to Johnnie who really nice and helpful. I got the combo platter and a side of extra pita bread, hehe, and everything was amazing. I got all the extra toppings as well. It's so fresh and cooked perfectly.  They keep sauces in the bottles by the drink fountain, I like that too. Will be back many many times"}
{"text":"Miss Halal Guys since I first had it in NYC Summer last year. One of the most anticipated places to visit this year. The long 50 minutes wait in line plus 10 minutes walk from the car on Grand Opening day was all worth it! Both the service and food were great, friendly, quick and tasty. I just wished that they're more generous with the sauce, both white and red sauce, pretty stingy compare to NYC ones. Tried the baklava in NYC, not here but assumed tastes the same, it's way too sweet for my taste. Cannot wait for HG to open one on the West side."}
{"text":"Rating of 3.5 stars. 

Cant really compare it to the NY carts on 53rd and 6th, but overall the food was good. Its awesome AZ finally has a \"CnR.\""}
{"text":"Pretty consistent food.  Try the falafel.  It's good too.  Chicken is a a little dry.  Staff is super friendly.  Tyra is super nice and cool."}
{"text":"This place smelled soooo good once I walked into the store. I couldn't decide what to get, it was between a platter or a Gyro, So my girlfriend suggested if I was hungry, I should get the Regular size platter. Now on to the second decision, what kind of meat...beef or chicken? I couldn't decide, then the guy asked if I wanted to try the proteins. My eye lit up. I was so happy!! The Asian in me was so happy for samples. I was glad he gave me a sample it help me determine on which proteins to get. Overall great service and good food!"}
{"text":"Quick service and food was good! I had the regular sized beef plate with just rice lettuce and the white sauce they give. It was my first time trying and it was noting too spectacular but satisfied my hunger. The pita bread they give you with the plate is a little smaller than I'd hoped. Next time I'll try to order another piece because I found myself trying to ration it with the rest of my food. Overall was tasty though and I wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were super excited when this place opened. We had heard all the rave about it from our fellow Yankee friends and could not wait to try it out.

As soon as I entered the place, I was not impressed by the interior nor the attitude of the staff. My husband went for a mixed plate and just watching it being made, it put me off and I did not continue with my order. I found there would be more freshness or something unique about this place but it reminded me of similar shish taouk/Lebanese fast-food chains that in my opinion, look much more appealing. 

I watched as our server loaded up the plate with heaps of rice and salad then finally topped it off with a ridiculously small portion of meat & chicken. Lastly went on the famous 'secret' white sauce, which just made it look pretty but did not enhance the taste. 
I was not impressed by the flavours or quality and very quickly, we were just left eating rice as the ratio of rice to protein was about 5:1.

NOT worth the hype, would not go again."}
{"text":"I've actually been here during their grand opening. I was a little skeptical about trying this place since I know the real taste of New York halal guys. I actually thought the one here is similar. I thought the food tasted the same but their cut of meat is way different. I feel they really mince their meat. I think I'll try this place out again because it's really good during those late nights."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and the food never came.  I called them a few times and no answer.  Luckily I ordered thru grunhub and they gave said they will refund me.  0000.00000 stars"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night. Was very satisfied. I ordered the combo plate with chicken and gyro and it was very flavorful. I definitely recommend getting this as well as a lot of the white sauce as they call it!"}
{"text":"The folks who are familiar with The Halal Guys in New York City will be pleased with the experience at the Yonge/Wellesley Toronto location. However, I can't help but feel that the experience is slightly watered-down compared to what I had in its American counterpart. It just doesn't have the same energy, as terrible and vague of a criticism that might be.

You can get a plate of chicken shawarma, the signature orange rice, salad, and enough white sauce to swim in for a reasonable $12. With the slew of new bars that popped up around the Yonge/Wellesley area, The Halal Guys is a very strong \"drunk-eats\" option."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro sandwich tonight from The Halal Guys. My gyro arrived overlooked, with the gyro meat actually breaking one of my teeth due to it being overcooked. In addition, I asked for hot sauce and did not receive any, on my sandwich or on the side. Negligence on the part of such a successful business should not be overlooked. I'm a loyal customer strongly reconsidering my loyalty."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I had the combo with chicken and gyro and it was just what the doctor ordered after a couple hard nights in Vegas. The meat is tender and juicy and their white sauce is delicious. The ratio of may to veggies is perfect.

The baklava left me yearning for something less sweet and more tender. 

Overall, I enjoyed the meal and will be back."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Food over priced and rewards program a joke. Got run around with rewards program and they are just too greedy and don't care to help, spoke to and emailed them.  I already cut up my rewards card and encourage everyone to do the same, I will never go here again, these people are very greedy and don't care."}
{"text":"I've had halal on the streets of NYC and honestly this place does a decent job.  However, it can never compare to the Halal street cart!

Needless to say, this smorgasbord of food is worth the try and is welcoming to have something new in the valley.  The plates itself were pretty affordable; $7.95 and up is not a bad deal.  I do remember eating like so as a younger man, but I tell I can only handle these kinds of meals once in a year maybe!

I ordered a larger halal plate as it came with some basmati rice, beef, chicken, iceberg, falafel, and topped with their special mayo-like white sauce.  I added a small dip of their spicy sauce on the side; and I'm glad I did so cause man that sauce was too spicy for me!  Overall, the lettuce and falafel helped with the texture providing a subtle crunch.  The chicken and beef was uber tender and soft to the bite.  The mayo sauce is what makes this dish pop!  However, it definitely was nothing like compared to what I had in NYC; not trying to knock it,but just based on shear experience having to hold a warm plate of food eating on the street corners of NYC.  Something about it, but maybe it's just in my head too!

In the end, The Halal Guys is worth the try since it's definitely affordable for a big plate of food and just something different! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"PURE TRASH! And the owners know it!! No Wonder why they deleted the Review section on the Halal Guys page on Facebook LOL! So Overpriced for what it is too much oil the salad is not fresh from the day and it is noticable, rice is hard like rocks, chicken is dry .. White sauce tasted like Mayo I'm not sure if they get it, its supposed to be \" tahine\" anyways..  I'm really not the type complaining but for the price we pay this is way too much!.. You wouldn't even pay 5$ to go there. nothing to do with the U.S halal guys!"}
{"text":"Halal guys Montr√©al doesnt have the same taste as NYC ones. Its much greasy than any other halal plates. However its pretty good."}
{"text":"It's still good but if you're expecting the same flavor as that of the original NYC Halal Guys you'll be disappointed. A bit on the pricey side as well. White sauce tastes like it is mayo based. Good customer service; a little tricky to find parking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place! Food is amazing, healthy, fresh. Customer service is superb, fast and friendly. Open late too!"}
{"text":"Born and raised New Yorker here so I was super excited when the Halal Guys and opened in Las Gaygas. It was good but as so many other reviews stated, it was not quite the same. 

First time we had it, we ordered from Uber Eats. Hubby has never been to NY so I was excited to have him try it. Needless to say, he loved it but I still can't wait for him to try the legit thing. 

Second time was today and we're still waiting for the food we ordered almost 45 minutes ago. First, they ran out of chicken so we had to wait for that. Then, when the chicken was finally ready, they realized they didn't have enough rice. The girl behind the counter subbed the rice for fries and kindly refunded one of the platters we offered. Hubby was disappointed since he had ordered extra rice because he liked it so much. 

3 stars because it doesn't quite taste the same and for the slow service. Maybe I'm just used to how speedy the carts were in NY and that was with lines that wrapped around the block sometimes."}
{"text":"Good spot and had a large crowd at lunch but the line moved quickly.  We had chicken pitas and they were great... fresh vegetables and lots of chicken.  The house sauce is really good but I would ask them to go light.  Platters also looked really good and fairly priced.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So glad they made the expansion out to Arizona! It obviously cannot measure up to the original stand on the streets of New York City, but it's still got the same, famously great flavors."}
{"text":"Food is not great. When I went there late one night on the weekend, the meat was already there warming up. It wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for Middle Eastern comfort food -- and plenty of it.  Service was fast, but there aren't a lot of tables.  

The menu is pretty simple.  My son and I chose the chicken and gyro combo, which came with plenty of both.  The rice was very good, there was a small salad of lettuce and tomatoes, and the extras of onion, green peppers, and olives added a lot of flavor -- especially those olives. 

On the sauces, unless someone is adventurous or likes things pretty spicy, I'd advise sticking to the white sauce.  It's a spiced up yogurt blend that I think of as Ranch Jr.  When the server asks if you want more, say yes because the usual portion isn't enough.  

Two sizes are offered.  The large is only $1 more than the small and a lot bigger.  Both my son and I couldn't finish ours, so took them home for another meal.  I also bought a 2-piece box of baklava, thinking we could have it later.  But my son declined -- and yay! to that.  It was excellent."}
{"text":"Way too overhyped. Perhaps the NYC cart tastes better which I will definitely visit someday. 
The portions are pretty big but instead of salad they should have potatoes instead. The plate itself was not bad but missable and also expensive!
I personally think Boustan is way better and in a city where Boustan, Basha, and other middle eastern style/gyro cuisine exists plentifully, which, are also priced way better."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food at unreasonable prices. One would presume that a restaurant so close to the university would have better food with more affordable pricing but this is just not it. Moreover, they're very stingy with the food."}
{"text":"2 experiences both 5 star. Ordered From UberEats and got the food hot, correct, and delicious. Came in today because we were in the area and had a couple combo platters. The chicken was just coming off the grill and was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. The 2 employees Rylin and Jody were friendly and had great suggestions. The hot sauce is as advertised. HOT! But Rylin made sure we knew that and gave a small tester before we made the decision to use more. Will 100% continue coming back here or atleast order from here. Restaurant was clean and everything you would expect from a new spot. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Had to check it out since people rave about it coming from NY.

Nothing SPECIAL. It was good, but I'm not going to make the extra trip out.

Had the combo, small. Falafel was a bit small and on the hard side.

They were quick, but it's a busy location- especially the parking."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed until last week.  I've had the one in NYC and absolutely LOVED the food. It was my go to cart every time I visited. Now, This one in Tempe is pretty darn close. The portion sizes are good (not as big as NYC plates) and service is also great. We always seem to get there are the perfect time with no wait but it's usually pretty busy. The white sauce and the pita bread ROCK!"}
{"text":"Finally! Welcome to Vegas. I've had Halal Guys 3 times since its soft opening already. It never disappoints with their combo plate. The hummus is okay, nothing special. I enjoy their pita bread, white sauce, and hot sauce (be careful & cautious!). It's a light yummy but filling meal. The only negatives I experienced so far were their AC being broken, they forgot my to go hot sauce and white sauce, & their condiment bottles were all empty at the stand. There's a dozen or so employees helping but the sauces got overlooked. That's the best part! Hope to come back with these first bumps in the road resolved."}
{"text":"It's just HYPE guys! 

If you've never had the real thing in NY then maybe... But then again, there are so many better place in Vegas to spend your hard earned money on. 

Pros: staff was friendly, sauces are readily available by the soda machine, the food was ok

Cons:  parking was a little difficult, price is high for what it is, menu is small, the only thing that reminds you of NY is the name - otherwise just looks like a random fast food joint 

Wish I could give a higher rating because I love the NY guys, but this was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is very different compare with the original in NYC... 
The place is very small and they don't understand how to work as a productive chain.  As consequence, you have to wait at least 20-30 minutes once you're in the door of the resturant.  They're very very slow..."}
{"text":"I wish I can give no stars. This place is a joke, the chicken has no flavor, the beef, well I'm not sure what the hell it is, condiments are cold tomatoes & lettuce & they have this nasty extremely hot sauce that makes no sense & they put a glop of this white sauce on it & there rice had stale pieces in it. There is no way in hell this place is gonna last. I guess it started out as a cab stand & should've stayed a cab stand. Marketing does wonders I guess. Worst wannabe middle eastern I ever had."}
{"text":"I was expecting something fabulous from all the hype, but to me everything was so bland. Yes, the ghost pepper sauce will give you heat, but the beef and chicken isn't flavorful to begin with. I understand the original NYC locations featured LAMB, which would totally step up the flavor quotient. This loose beef doesn't cut it, and the white sauce adds nothing but moisture (which is good, as everything is desert dry) but again not much taste. Sorry, Guys, wanted to love you."}
{"text":"The portion is so little for something that is over $10.  The amount of rice they put in is so little even for a large order.  If you're used to eating at the location in  NY 53rd and 6th you'll be really disappointed."}
{"text":"Very friendly girl at counter.  Beef and chicken were plentiful and flavorful. The pita bread was hard, seemed old, was gross. The hummus was good but we couldn't eat it since the pita bread it came with was old and gross. I don't think pitas are supposed to fall apart and crumble. Prices are a bit high if you compare to fast food,  but this is a category above so prices are average."}
{"text":"Service is fast and staff are nice but the food just isn't up to par. A block away there is Boustan which is far superior in taste.

They have an amazing white sauce and a super spicy sauce but no garlic sauce 

Also the value isn't there in terms of portions.

My only real complain is the chicken, once I saw it in the kitchen, I changed my order.
Also the bread was wet"}
{"text":"Portions too small for the price get amir or  basha etc for cheaper price and same quality and bigger portion"}
{"text":"Tried this joint for the first time today! I've never had the NYC version but I'd like to try it some day.

Came by for a late lunch. Shared a regular chicken and beef platter. I enjoyed the mix of flavours in the platter, and it was a decently sized portion for the price you pay. The sauces complimented each other very well, and the hot sauce is spicier than you think! The rice was alright, a little on the bland side but not too terrible. I enjoyed both meats - and there was a large quantity of both of them.

I suggest you try asking them for more sauce when they are making your order for you. Relative to the other pictures posted by others, our platter did not appear to have as much sauce. As well, if you want more afterwards, you're going to have to pay for a packet.

Overall, I enjoyed the meal. I'd like to come back to try their gyros!"}
{"text":"Had this place back in Chicago and in LA.  Still good here.  Had the Combo Platter.   Wasn't busy at all for a friday night.  Ample parking.  Will always be back.  Not sure if it's as good as New York, but I still like it."}
{"text":"Didn't meat the expectations, we ordered beef gyro and falafel sandwich. You can barley see and taste the meat, the falafel was ok."}
{"text":"We went to Halal Guys for dinner last night and I was very disappointed. 

We were really excited to try it out since there has been so much hype leading up to their opening. Also, as a Middle Eastern food lover, I was excited for a new concept to come to the valley. However, I'm not sure that you could really call this Middle Eastern or Mediterranean food.

They only have two options on their menu: a pita wrap/sandwich, or a platter. Then you have your choice of meat: chicken, gyro, or falafel.

I ordered the platter which automatically comes with shredded iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and yellow rice. Then they top that with the meat(s) of your choice and a few slices of pita. They serve average pita like the type you could get at the grocery store. Their sauce options include white sauce, which is a mayo-based sauce, spicy sauce, or tahini, although you have to specifically request tahini. 

Their food is extremely bland, and it is severely lacking something fresh - which may sound strange because half of my plate was shredded lettuce, but it lacks some type of vinegar - whether it's pickles, olives, or some type of dressing. Also, their hot sauce is so spicy that you can't even enjoy it, I'm not sure why they bother making it. It would be nice if they had a few different types of hot sauce, maybe something along the lines of a mild herb-based sauce, a medium sauce, and then their extraordinarily hot sauce. 

All in all, I won't be back. I'd rather go elsewhere and spend less for more flavor and more authentic food."}
{"text":"My first time here! Even though everyone recommends the combo plate I was just really craving a sandwich. It did not disappoint. I rarely eat a whole gyro, but I couldn't stop with this one.  The red sauce was good, but I liked the white sauce much better. Too fattening to eat on the regular, but I will definitely be back to try the combo plate."}
{"text":"Very disappointed bad food this is not a middle eastern food I'm not going back again"}
{"text":"No long review here... now I've been to all the Halal Guys in the desert. A Halal Trifecta!
The employees were pretty awesome. Best of the three joints. They hollar \"hello!!\" And \"goodbye\" to everyone that comes in. 
The food was consistent.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"These combo platters are serious business!
Best 9 dollars spent on food ever!
The meats have good flavor and the sauces are awesome.  This is a tone of good food and the management staff seem pretty awesome. 
This place is always busy but never a really long wait."}
{"text":"Finally open in chandler!!
These combo platters are serious business!
Best 9 dollars spent on food ever!
The meats have good flavor and the sauces are awesome.  This is a tone of good food and the management staff seem pretty awesome. 
This place is always busy but never a really long wait."}
{"text":"Came in around 12:30am last night. I don't understand why the food was a bit colder than room temperature. They were suppose to be open til 4am but they seemed like they were about to close. It's definitely a fast food joint. The white sauce people were raving about was very bland and the hot sauce wasn't to my liking either. It could be just me so still give it a shot. They got 2 stars cause of their hummus and pita. It was fairly good and they give you a good amount for $5. We ordered the combo plater with falafel then a side of hummus just so we can try most of what they had. If this was my first time trying middle eastern food,I would probably never try Middle Eastern food again."}
{"text":"One of the better valued restaurants inside the Caesars Palace Food Court. For around $10-$12 a plate, I was pretty stuffed with my chicken and gyro platter. Compared to other restaurants in this food court, Halal Guys give a pretty decent portion.

The Halal Guys saved my stomach at 2AM in the morning! Unfortunately they were limited to one squeeze of white sauce, but the white sauce is one of the best dressings ever!

I only know of their other location; which is in Spring Mountain. Tastes the same as that one."}
{"text":"So simple, so easy to order, so delicious. Those red and white sauces are cracktastic. It is good food fast so don't go in there expecting fine dining like some of these people writing reviews. The guys working there are courteous. They fry those french fries up on demand and I LOVE some good hot crinkle cut fries."}
{"text":"I am an avid Halal Guys fan! I used to frequent the street cart in NYC when I lived there - it easily became one of those meals that I craved weekly! 

I just had my first meal combo plate at this location and it did not disappoint. Before posting this, i saw a review from someone complaining about the food being cooked ahead of time and it sitting until it's served - clearly that person doesn't get out much. You ever been to a chipotle? It's the same concept. And, with how busy their locations are, the food won't have much of a chance to sit for long - those lines won't stop! It's sad that someone like that rated them so negatively at the beginning. 

Back to the food; be careful with the red sauce! If you haven't had it before, taste a little bit on your finger before adding it to your dish - you'll thank me later! The white sauce is where it's at. It's like ranch and tzatziki made a love-child. The lettuce and tomato help cool the heat from the red inferno! 

The location is small, but coming from a cart on the street where you had to eat your meal standing up in 5 degree weather in the snow and wind...I think this is a huge step up! I love that feeling of standing and eating my meal at their locations. It's just one of their \"things.\" If you're going to complain that you don't have a seat to put your butt, bring a fold-up chair in your car (or eat in your car) and save the complaint. 

The A/C wasn't working, but they haven't really opened yet. These types of things are expected. They had fans and cooling units inside to help - we appreciated that. The owners were great! Very nice guys! They even gave us (2) free entrees for a future visit. The staff were all very friendly and I saw lots of smiles (not something I'm used to at the street cart lol)!

Eating here is an experience & you should look at it like that! You will likely have a challenge finding parking. You may wait in line when the weather is not so great. If you come here with those expectations, you'll enjoy your meal even more (especially late night after some cocktails)! Well done, Halal Guys!"}
{"text":"Best customer service Angel does a good job on greeting the customers very clean store"}
{"text":"AMAZING. I've heard great things from friends in NYC but I had to experience it myself. Well worth the wait. Hope they open one in Scottsdale.


Ps order the red sauce on the side. Extremely spicy."}

{"text":"I was so excited to try the falafel and Gyro's at this place 
because I heard a lot of the good things about it!!! But after I try it I wasn't worth it the money I have spent on this food!! Not enough falafel, very little Gyro's, chicken wasn't cooked very good !!!!. Never again ."}
{"text":"Glad there wasn't a line up when I went! Prob would've been disappointed if having to wait 30 minutes for it.

I've never had this in the states so I can't compare but for the price ... it doesn't seem to be worth it. There are many mom and pop shops in Toronto that make better gyros than here.

I got the combo platter (reg) and it came to be around $14 for it. The portion is decent but feels like something that should be $10. 

It's definitely a good alternative to other quick bites in the area but I wouldn't come here just for the sake of eating it."}
{"text":"Halal Guys has probably been the only restaurant I've been excited about this whole year. I can remember my first time like it was yesterday (it was really only 6 months ago), it had just finished snowing, the cold winds were relentless, and I proceeded optimistically cautious to the famous food cart (see my NYC location review for details on orgasm). I swore to myself that one day I'll have another bite of its yellow rice, chicken, gyro meat, and white sauce. Thankfully THG has become a multi-million dollar company and expanded its white sauce deliciousness to the west coast (and even the Philippines).

The combo plate has not yet failed me (with only two visits how could it?). My only recommendation is extra white sauce, easy on the red sauce, and BBQ sauce if they have it. I could on about its buttery rice and moist chicken, but I'm sure the other (soon to be hundreds) of reviews will do that. 

What is the appeal you ask? Perhaps its legendary name, the white sauce, or that tasty cheap eats are always on its own pedestal above all others, the only way to know for sure if THG is for you is to try.

 Is it as good as the NYC locations? I don't think so and I don't know why. In NYC you are tasting the decades of grinding on the streets and hard work while in Vegas its the byproduct of that (flavors of The American Dream can be noted). 

At least it fits my macros though.

{"text":"Great food and quick service. Prices are reasonable for high quality food. Beware of the red sauce, it is liquid lava. The white sauce is fantastic though! If you get there at 11:30 you will beat the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Driving around the ASU area of Tempe and made an executive decision to stop by my old neck of the woods! I was very surprised to see this location across the street from my old apartment complexes back in my college days. I recently tasted the food from the yelp Halloween event at the Arizona center, so this motivated me to trying it out. I like the simplicity of the menu and have the option of a small or regular plate for $7.95. I went ahead and had the chicken/gyro combo, combined with tomatoes, lettuce , yellow rice , topped with the meats. My toppings included onions, peppers, olives and some white sauce I forgot how to pronounce . The pieces of pita was a nice compliment and overall the food was okay, not the best but good tasting meal for a quick grab n go!"}
{"text":"I love that this place is open until around 3 or 4am. Working in the industry and you get off late it's a perfect place to stop and grab food on the way home. Always friendly staff and always in and out of there quickly. Don't forget your rewards card!

Edit: I believe the new hours only stay open till 2am"}
{"text":"It is good for what it is, which is chipotle style mediterranean food.  The felafel was good, but not a huge fan of their mayonnaise sauce"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Nothing to rave about. Think there was more hype than taste here. It was a little crowded with no place to sit... Might be a good place to eat after going out since it's open till 4am and the service was fast. But if taste and quality is what you want, not a place to spend your money."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check out The Halal Guys ever since they opened up in my area, so on a night I didn't feel like cooking dinner I headed on over!

Arrived a little before 5pm, it wasn't too busy, leaned you can either get a sandwich or a platter, I went with the chicken sandwich and ordered a side of falafel.

The chicken sandwich came on a nice warm pita, the chicken was tender and juicy had nice flavor to it, the sandwich had lettuce and it comes with a white sauce & and I also asked for the hot sauce too. This was a messy sandwich, but ooohhh sooo good!

I have to say though I was surprise with the side of falafel, there are 4 pieces of nicely fried falafel, but it did not come with any sauce, which I guess I expected it to, so by themselves with no sauce, they were little dry. Next time order a side of sauce or just make it a falafel sandwich. 

Glad The Halal Guys are in the neighborhood and I'm sure I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Probably the blandest shawarma that I've ever eaten. The meat was pretty much tasteless and there really wasn't all that much to choose from for toppings (no pickled turnips at all). The price was average for what you would normally find at a shawarma shop.
Do yourself a favour if you're in the mood for shawarma.... Walk up Yonge street at little further and give the Falafel House a visit. They've been my go-to for years now"}
{"text":"Wow... Talk about flavorful!

Their combo meat (chicken & gyro is soooo tasty).

Their pita is super soft & yummy.

Falafel, just okay.

Baklava, perfectly sweetened & delicious.

Their red sauce is sooooo hot, a few drops is enough for a platter.

Their white sauce... OMG, the best!!! I generously poured it all over my platter! Hahaha

I like the simplicity of their menu, generous serving sizes (the platter was 2 meals for me) & reasonable prices.

The only negative is the limited seating & parking. 
Other than that, it's definitely worth checking out.. And they're even open til late!"}
{"text":"When I went to New York City everyone told me I needed to go to Halal Guys before leaving. I loved it then and I love that it is now in Las Vegas! Of course it is not the same as the little cart in New York but it was pretty good regardless. 

I went there and got a gyro and it was massive I had to take the rest to go. The meat was full of flavor but the only thing I didn't like very much was the pita bread they used. The bread was very thick making it difficult to eat the gyro because I felt like I was eating more pita than anything else. 

Like I said, it is definitely not the same as the one in NYC but it was still pretty tasty. Also, if you are a local you get 10% off !!!"}
{"text":"I had also fallen into the PR trap from Halal Guys for their grand opening and waited in line, in the cold rainy Friday for about 45 minutes to spin a wheel for a mere 30% off one item. 

I must also mention I haven't tried the Halal Guys in New York but since #whitesauce was all the rage all over my Facebook newsfeed, why not? 

The food was sub par and over priced for the quality. Not a lot of meat/gyro but a lot of veggies so at least you know you're getting in your servings. About $12 for a small platter and it felt a bit unfair. 

The employees I found were really nice and cheery though, even for the hordes of people that kept coming in.

There are many other options around the area to get really great halal food WITH great sauce as well. If I'm just craving something similar, I would say Lazeez on Harbord or for great greasy fast food, Messini's all the way.

In my opinion, not worth it, and definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"A poor homage to the original one on 53rd and 6th in NYC.  Having had the original countless times before, this one seems skimpier on the portions, overcooked on the meats and rice, and more expensive than the original.  Major props to their expansion across the US, but this feels more like a copycat than the real deal."}
{"text":"For those of you who \"thought\" that this location is anything like the ones in New York, you are absolutely wrong. First of all I know it a new place and it still trying to establish itself but you can tell the whomever owns this is a rookie. The owner charges for literally everything. One packet of White sauce- $1
Extra meat (Since they barely put meat)- $4
To top it off it's close to $10 bucks while New York has there menu at $7 for the regular size bowl."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! The food is delicious! The new management has really turn this place around!!  I spoke to the manager Vanessa about catering for my companies next business meeting. She answered all my question and helped me get it all set up! Just AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Not near as good as in NY. This visit was below my expectations. The meats were dry as well as the rice. The food was so dry I could feel it getting stuck in my throat. The pita bread also had a strange taste to it, not sure what was going on with it. In NY they are making it fresh on the carts...maybe that was the difference? My husband and I wanted to control the amount of red sauce on it when we got home to eat, so we asked for togo packets of the red sauce. Beware---they charge a bunch for the togo sauce, but if you dine in, you get unlimited free sauce...Wish we would have stayed to eat as my food was so dry that I wish I could have added a TON more white sauce to help. Very bummed about this whole experience, just going to stick to the real deal when we go to NY."}
{"text":"The Halal guys hype is the reason I went in... The pictures look so amazing, the reviews are great, so I needed a taste! While I seldom choose a meat options, I went with traditional gyro meat in the platter. 

Well... when I first looked at my platter, I was thinking to myself that the meat looked extremely greasy. It made me a bit nervous. 

If you are dining in, they have bottles of the famous sauces you can bring to the table. 

White Sauce- I was kind of let down because I expected some super tasty garlic-y sauce, but it tasted like plain ranch dressing.

Red Sauce- HOT! They give fair warning! I am a heat connoisseur who orders an 8 at Thai restaurants... This stood up very well. Its HOT HOT HOT, but still tasty. Just eat it on the side or only start with a tiny drizzle!

They have Tahini sauce as well. Tasted pretty traditional & up to par.

So anyway- Once you get the whole bowl rockin with sauces and toppings, the greasiness of the meat leveled out. The pita they serve with it was also kind of greasy but oh so delicious. 

They are open late, its clean inside, and I would definitely recommend it or eat it again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my friend on Friday night. It was busy with no place to sit and and their AC wasn't working as well. Besides that, I'm thinking \"whatever, I came here for the food\". 

I ordered the Pita wrap combo with a side order of rice and it was so bland and tasteless. The pita was thick and doughy. The meat almost had no seasoning whatsoever. Rice was was tasteless. The veggies were fresh, but again tasteless. Even just a tad of cilantro and lime would've helped. If it wasn't for the white sauce and hot sauce (that was pretty okay), I wouldn't have finished my meal. 

I really wanted to like this place, but I can't. It's just another New York chain to pop off in the LV that has yet to impress me."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally have The Halal Guys in Toronto! (See my NYC review).

- Meh food. The combo platter comes with orange rice, chopped iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, two small pita pieces, and two meats.
- The chicken and gyro meats were honestly very dry, so it's soaked in white sauce.
- They give you very little salad.
- Their famous hot sauce is SUPER HOT. IT BURNS.
- Overpriced ($14 CAD for a platter)
- This place closes at 11, the Halal guys in NYC is the go-to spot for super late nights.

Overall - Disappointed... Unfortunately I don't see myself coming back. It was not worth the time or money.
There are cheaper and better shawarma/gyro places in Toronto.

5/5 Kudos to the staff for working the nonstop crazy lineups!"}
{"text":"Just the taste I remembered back on 53rd and 6th! Although the portion was a bit less than in NYC and a couple dollars more, it's still the best I ever have. 
Don't forget to add that famous white sauce along with bbq sauce, and if you like spicy, just squeeze a bit from the hot sauce bottle because it is extremely hot! 


They also serve additional side dishes (hummus, and baba ganuosh) and baklava. Yum! 

Easy to park, the restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly!"}
{"text":"TIL that the white sauce contains mayo, hence why they keep it over ice with an expiration date - which may also explain why it's so tasty and addictive. 

After a weekend of excess in Las Vegas, I finally realize why Halal Guys is the perfect anytime food for Vegas. Halal guys is good for:

* A cheap lunch. Less than $10 per plate (before taxes). Compared to my other meals on the strip, this was a steal. A drink at the taco bell cantina sets you back $10. 
* An afternoon snack. Plates come in two sizes - small and large. Go small for snack time. 
* A quick dinner. No one hour waits here as the food is made pretty and served pretty quickly. 
* After a night out. Opened late and just enough protein, carbs, flavor, and a bit of grease to hit the spot (and slow down the absorption of alcohol) without being too greasy. Ask for more rice and less lettuce if you need more carbs. 
* After a weekend of excessive eating. Everything is pretty fresh and the bit of lettuce and tomato help to lighten the meal. 

I got the combo meal, which is my usual go to at halal carts. The meat was in bigger chunks than I expected, but tasty and not too dry. The rice was flavorful and fluffy. The pita was alright, but I don't usually care for the pita anyway. I did make the mistake of putting on too much red sauce and had to make multiple trips to the soda fountain for more water. 

It's not an exact replica in tastes and experience of the original Halal Guys and cart on a street corner in NYC, but I guess that's what happens when you can't port the water and years of flavor built up on the cart across the country. It's close enough and a great addition to the Vegas food scene."}
{"text":"Best Late Night Grub Ever! Can never go wrong with a combo platter and douse it with White Sauce/Tahini...dab a lil Red sauce too to add spice in your life! Unless yer adventurous like me. Luv my food spiiiiiice-yaaay wootwoot!

The service is awesome always, thanks Tyra!"}
{"text":"If you've tried the holy grail of halal guys in nyc - this is not the same. You don't have to fly over to nyc to get an idea of what it's like. Appreciate this food offering for what it is - that way you can say, make a fare comparison to similar food in the city.  

I ordered the combo platter. I don't really see the point of a size choice. That's new. The are more expensive than nyc maybe it's our taxes and health care but it's much more is all I have to say.

Alrighty, I'll be honest I spend a lot of time in nyc and I get dragged to the halal guys as a go to and it wasn't my favourite then and it isn't my favourite now.

It's not bad but I've had better in this city regardless of the infamous  white sauce. Both the chicken, beef and rice were dry.  That's going to happen when is meat is diced and heating. 

The tomatoes were nice as something that tasted fresh but lettuce, iceberg lettuce it's just a silly addition in anything. I call it filling.

I can't say I'd eat here again but I'm glad my curiosity was filled.

I will say it's a very clean space."}
{"text":"TWO WORDS; NEVER AGAIN. 

The Halal Guys is considered a staple for Halal Fast Food in New York City. I think it was about a year ago when they finally opened the doors to the Toronto location. I was so excited to finally give them a try. When they first opened up the lines were pretty outrageous, so I patiently waited.  

They have a great location! Steps away from the subway station and right on Yonge St. There was a bit of a wait, it was around lunch time which is normal for the city. 

I ordered the signature item. The Combo Chicken and Gyro Platter with White Sauce. WOW. What a disappointment. So let me start off by telling you what's in the platter. 

Lettuce, Tomatoes, Orange Rice, Chicken, Gyro (which is greek, so kinda confusing as to why they are serving that) tons of white sauce (not sure what it is) and the HOTTEST hot sauce. 

The rice is so bland and definitely needed more cooking. The Chicken and Gyro were also very bland. That white sauce was so salty and completely took away from everything. The hot sauce was so fucking spicy. If you look at my picture, there's only a bit. 

Here's my theory, people might be confusing the taste of the food with the actual taste of the hot sauce. It's very spicy and takes over everything. 

NEVER AGAIN. 

keep eating (but not here), 

Angela"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 10 times now and I'm still unsure of the place. The food is decent, the service is okay, but nothing \"wows\" me. Halal Guys usually has a short line but the ordering process seems to take longer than most fast food restaurants. I would classify this restaurant as fast casual.

Dining inside is a bit of a nightmare as there's no good seating anywhere. However, they do have plenty of it. There's modular tables so they can stack next to each other for up to I'd say 8 people before it encroaches into the ordering line.

If you order a gyro style sandwich, you have to pay a lot more for rice than if you order a combo. It's a big difference too, like $3 or something like that. Makes no sense to me. That's literally my biggest gripe with this place is the clear overcharging for a side of rice.

As far as loyalty rewards they sometimes have a locals discount, but at other times I'm not sure they have had it. It's something I heard about while sitting in line. Also make you carry the rewards card around. Time to get with the digital age and either do an app or use my phone number like everyone else!"}
{"text":"Being from NY I was looking forward to having halal guys come here. The service was great and the food was good. We will be back"}
{"text":"I had this place in NYC so I was stoked to see it opening here. But it was a huge let down. Won't be going back to this location"}
{"text":"Firstly, I was very impressed with their bathrooms. Very clean despite a lot of people coming through.

We got a combo with chicken and beef and a beef shawarma. Together with a fountain pop, it came up to around $26.

I really liked the beef and pita. The beef was flavourful and pita was super soft. They packed the ingredients so it was super filling. The chicken was ok. It didn't have as much flavour as the beef. The hot sauce was very hot and the white sauce was not overpowering with garlic."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time via Uber Eats and it was pretty good. We ordered the combo platter and the baklava for dessert. I most say that the food portions are big. Can feed two people!"}
{"text":"First time I went it was pretty good. I don't think it compares to the NYC one.
Second time, the food tasted a little different, a little \"weird.\" I won't come back again, maybe it was a hit but it left me with a weird taste. 

Also, the white sauce is amazing, a bit loaded on the calories."}
{"text":"The 2nd star is purely for fantastic service. The staff is friendly and very efficient. If you want to try it, get extra tahini. In fact, dip your meal in the white sauce and it might work. 

I've had their food in new york and so, my friend and I decided to try it. Luckily we got there before noon for lunch and so didn't have to wait in line. The food was edible but, my friend didn't even bother finishing her meal. The rice had no flavor whatsoever. I like simple menus, but this place has 2 things on their menu. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Yeah, I just had to go to The Halal Guys in Vegas.  It's probably one of the best spots to grab some late night grub, especially since they're open till 4am.  So after finishing up at the bars one night, I stopped over at 2am for a regular combo platter.

Regular Combo Platter -- http://bit.ly/2iqpy8u
Best thing to eat at 2am in Vegas, or anywhere!  One aluminum pan loaded with chicken, gyro, rice, salad, and pita bread.  I could've opted for the Large size, but this was plenty of food for me.  And oh yeah, you gotta have them smother it with their white sauce!

Granted, it's not the same experience as the outdoor carts in NYC.  It's more expensive and there's no real rush from ordering, at least when I went.  But it's still worth it!

Vegas and Halal Guys definitely go hand in hand.  It's such a satisfying plate of meat and rice that just hits the spot late at night after having drinks on the Strip.  And they're not too far away from the Strip, just a short drive or cab ride away.  Definitely hit them up when you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Well, I wanted to like this place a lot more, but... It was ok..

I had the falafel bowl thing. One of my dinner guests asked for well done lamb (just toss it back on the grill bro) they were clueless. Someone else asked for grilled onions, and again I can see the grill right there behind you... toss them on there bud, but nope.. So, I was not impressed with the level of service.

I thought it was a bit pricy to be honest. However, they stay open really late. So if you go out to the clubs then you can come here after (as if, I'm in bed by 10) for that much needed alcohol sponge. 

Lower your expectations, and you will be just fine."}
{"text":"I love it here just hate that charge for everything lol even a side of hot sauce, but the food is great"}
{"text":"Updating the review because while the chicken is HORRIBLE, just terribly dry with zero seasoning, the beef gyros platter is actually pretty good and well seasoned. Actually really enjoyed the beef gyros with the white sauce and orange rice. A far better experience with the beef gyros. They should just cut chicken off the menu if they're going to put little to no effort making it taste good."}
{"text":"The place is decent for food. I like falafel, so it cant really go wrong for me. I mean their falafel is ok, but the quantity could use some work. Ive noticed that meat portions are huge while falafel is small compared to it. Although the quantity is probably small due to it having to be prepped or something.

Yeah the food is okay, but I really dig the customer service. The people are nice and are always greeting me, telling me stuff, and the fact that twins work together here is pretty great.

I've only had the falafel gyros and the regular platter. Their falafel tastes good, its crunchy, but its pretty dry. To make up for the dryness of the falafel, I drown it in white sauce. I put a good amount on my gyro and then add one strip of their hot sauce. Their hot sauce is hot enough for one strip to make me sweat a bit. It's a good amount of spice to the point where I can actually taste everything else.

So the falafel dishes are okay, but the customer service is better."}
{"text":"Nothing impressive lol, just a breakfast place with no AC \"for now\"! Food is not bad, but no good either ! FAST service ( well deserved 2nd star). I would give them another shot, because of the big advertisement their doing.."}
{"text":"If it's your first time here, order the Combo (chicken and beef gyro meat) Platter. That is what they are famous for! Also like I mentioned in my tip, SMOTHER that shit in more white sauce. And even if it looks like enough, NO you are wrong. Smother that shit some more until your whole platter is basically swimming in it. And I guess you can add a dot of hot sauce. Unless you wanna take a fireball dump in the morning I suggest listening to everyone else's warning about how hot it is. It's no joke! That hot sauce could burn through my soul. 

It's located on Valley View & Spring Mtn, you can't miss those lovely red letters! The space is tiny but has a few tables and also some seating by the walls. Workers were suuuuper nice and even offered us free mini bottles of water. 

Again, extra white sauce, hot sauce and BBQ sauce is located by the soda machines. You already know. USE IT WELL. 

The platter itself was bomb. I am devouring my leftovers as I write this and it is still bomb as a leftover! It comes with rice, few slices of pita and some lettuce and tomato. Of course the one in New York will always be the very best, but this will satisfy the cravings until I can go back again :) 

And another great thing about this place is that it's open until 4am. YAAS for one of the best drunk foods!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't that good and wasn't hot (maybe because it was after 11pm but they're open til 4am."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch, left a tad disappointed. The service is good, the food is mediocre. I got the falafel sandwich, and it was bland. 7 dollars for a falafel sandwich with only 3 small pieces of falafel is a ripoff. My first few bites into it were just bread and sauce, that should give you an idea of how small they are."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. This is a tuff one because I don't like to give bad reviews, buuuut:  The buzz about this place doesn't live up to the quality of food served.  I ordered the large mixed platter ($9.99), a side of hummus ($4.99) and medium drink (a whopping $2.50), w/tax..I'm in for $19 (for lunch).
 When you think Gyro, Pita pocket, hummus, etc, you want a true Mediterranean flare...it didn't happen.  The \"beef\" gyro wasn't flavorful.  The chicken...bland.   The hummus had way too much paprika and oil on it...plus it was pre-made (or bought) and didn't have a good, smooth texture.  We also had Babagonush, which way to smokey flavored  (almost artificial) and lacked a decent texture.   The killer was the single pita they gave you with the side order was pre-wrapped in foil and left in the steam tray to keep warm....the result....sauggy pita. .  

The set up was similar to the ever so popular Chipotle style open kitchen.   The staff was nice but had no real knowledge if the food they were serving, nor the history of why this place was made famous in NYC."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Places with small menus should really nail what they do, and unfortunately this place missed that mark. Had the chicken platter and a beef gyro sandwich, and nothing about either really stood out. The pita bread wasn't great, the beef was better than the chicken, the rice was...rice. The garlic sauce is pretty good though, and it was pretty reasonably priced. If I do go back it won't be in the summer though - it's sweltering inside."}
{"text":"If you haven't had the experience of The Halal Guys in New York Cory, you must come here!!!  So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Not even close as compared to NYC halal, $7.99 for a small serving chicken halal rice is dissapointing. Wont go for the second time!!!"}
{"text":"Changing my 3 stars to 2 because I just looked at the other reviews.  All of the 5 star reviews were given by people that attended their VIP/friends & family soft launch.  If I was given free or discounted food with a smile, I might give a higher score than it deserved.

This was my experience on my first visit...

Me surveying the menu:  I have never eaten here before.
Employee:  I can help you decide what to get.  [Proceeds to explain options]
Me:  can I sample the rice?
Employee:  sorry, I can't.
Me looking at a stack of empty 2oz portion cups:  just a taste?  I've never eaten anything from here before and I am not sure if I want to get the rice.
Employee:  you just need to buy the platter if you want to try some rice.
Me:  ....nevermind....I'll just take a sandwich to go.

The sandwich was okay.  I guess in Germany I was spoiled, eating doner kebabs topped with curry served hot and fresh from street corner vendors."}
{"text":"Great food! Even better service, thank you for making it an enjoyable experience! Chicken gyro is what i regularly order and it is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! As busy as it is! The service was great and quick! The food was juicy and tasty. I would come back! I recommend this!"}
{"text":"Never tried them in the states but heard lots of good things...definitely over hyped because there is a lack of flavor.  If anything the chicken was decent but as a whole it's definitely missing something.  One star may seems harsh but I'm looking at it as a whole for price and taste.  I got the small platter which was $10 and my co-worker got the large platter $14, plus $2 for the \"combo\" which is just chicken and gyro, no drink. So for $16 you'd expect a pretty big \"platter\" right? Wrong, portions were just average, smaller than those Asian take out 3 part containers. It's an OK portion but if you're hungry and have a big appetite, don't expect it to fill you.  As others have mentioned, humus is extra $0.99, where as anywhere else you go it's free. So add humus to your meal plus a drink and your bill is over $20.  Maybe some people like the small orange rice; however I was not a fan. Not just the texture but the overall flavor of it was lacking and to me, the second most important thing besides the chicken (protein) is the rice in a meal/platter, I prefer basmati. I was not a fan and would honestly not recommend anyone try it, considering the price tag.

I did not try the wrap, perhaps that might've been better as the chicken was decent so I can only comment on the platter.  Seems a lot of new people came in to buy the regular combo platter only to realize it did not include a drink and it only meant \"chicken and gyro\"."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My fianc√© and I eat here on a regular basis. The Halal Guys offer the best customer service that I've ever witnessed, aside from amazing food! If I could give them 10 stars I would!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the few poor reviews. This place is fantastic as the long lines would indicate. Everything is fresh and delicious. Especially the pita bread. I had the falafel plate and it was the best falafel I have ever had in AZ. The service was great too."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food because of their \"Spiciness!\" They have a limited amount of selections on the menu so it's much easier to order what you want.  First, You can choose from either a platter or a pita bread sandwich that already comes equipped with lettuce and tomato or you can tell them to hold the veggies. After that, you select your meats (chicken, beef gyro, combo, or falafel). Finally, you have additional toppings to choose (jalape√±os, pitted black olives, and peppers). Oh yeah, I can't forget the sauces! They top your item off with a creamy white sauce.

If you're like me and dip food into a sauce after every bite, they have it next to the drink dispensary for people to grab. 

Btw, the two other sauces provided are BBQ sauce and HOT sauce (literally hot). I don't know what peppers they used but it's flaming. I guess that's why they have the white sauce displayed for your own protection lol

Today I preferred the beef gyro sandwich because I had to order to go and I can eat this using my hands. It cost me only $8.99 with a drink $2.49

P.s. if you check in, you get a free Baklava dessert! Trust me it's really good!"}
{"text":"Favorite chicken and rice restaurant!   I've had it at a couple of other locations in the west coast, but this one is probably the most similar to the one in New York.  

The chicken is really tasty and well marinated.  Perfect combination of rice, salad, and meat.  But most importantly the red and white sauce.  Definitely recommend trying the red sauce for all spicy food lovers!  It's really spicy, but so addicting.  

Customer service was surprisingly catering for a fast food restaurant.  

Would definitely recommend eating here if you don't feel like dressing up.  Great for late night munching."}
{"text":"The only thing I liked here was the rice. It was fantastic! I got a gyro plate with rice, a Greek salad, and a side of fries. The meat was bland. The pita was tough. The fries were boring. The salad was a small pile of lettuce with a piece of tomato. There was no dressing, no olive, no feta! How is that a salad? We had one plate between the 3 of us, and we threw away most of it, with the exception of the rice, because it was just not good. It was way too much money for the quality and quantity. I shop here every weekend and was excited for a nice Gyro place. This is not it!"}
{"text":"I adore the staff here. They've always been and welcoming!!!! The food is delish, I get the chicken platter every time with extra lettuce to make it kinda more like a salad, and that white sauce though....amazing!!"}
{"text":"Middle Eastern comfort food with meat, rice and salad. My gyro meat was dark, over cooked  and chewy...didn't look anything like gyro meat. A little bland. The olives helped, but the food could use a little more spice and vinegar. I really like my middle eastern food tangy. I'd love it if they offered middle eastern pickles or a simple vinegarette for the salad.  I'll give it another chance... Gave it another chance... Went back a second time. Gyro meat was dark and chewy again. I don't think I'll be coming back, sadly. I really wanted to like this place. I will say, you do get a lot of food for the price. Unfortunately it's lots of bland chewy food."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is great. The staff are pleasant, helpful and very nice. I had the combo sandwich with lots of white sauce. Was amazing. Be careful though, the hot sauce is really hot. What a kick.
You definitely can feel a very positive energy in this place.
This is going to be my favorite spot from now on every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and awesome location... thank you for great service tonight Jesus ."}
{"text":"Great food... patient employees.. and great service...
Thanks Angel G and Tiara! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Not one for giving bad reviews but my friend and I were really excited to try this place out and are very disappointed. The only option you had to choose from was the meat and if you wanted sauce or not (your choices are a sauce that is \"mayo based with spices\" , BBQ, or hot sauce). We found the service to be hasty and unfriendly. Felt pushy if you will. Once we got our food it was flavorless despite that or bowls were doused in sauces. If you want to pay 9$ for a bowl of shredded iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes, rice and bland meat try it, but I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Hmmm, what is the hype about??? The place is small with no seats, food is less than ordinary, service is just ok - nothing special. Menu is limited youd think they would specialize in what they serve? Nope! Wont be coming back!"}
{"text":"The fact they are open hella late gives them four stars, dank hummus but unfortunately the quality of chicken and falafel wasn't as good as hoped, but if your looking for late night now that Oliveos is closed in the neighborhood it works"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place but when I actually tried it I was so disappointed. I feel bad but I really could not even finish the food and my stomach hurt. It had no flavor, the white sauce is gross and the hot sauce is like fire with no taste."}
{"text":"Hard to find. I waled for an hour but couldn't find it in the location they mentioned."}
{"text":"Really good! The gyro is better than the chicken IMO. Also less is more with the hot sauce so be careful lol."}
{"text":"Always a great experience! Love that white sauce.  And locals get a discount. It's great that they are a bit far away from where I live because otherwise I'll be there everyday"}
{"text":"Nothing really special. I heard so much about their famous white sauce. But their platters with chicken and kebab/gyros is like any other shawarma restaurant. It does not stand out and the it isn't cheap either. I don't understand the long lines at this place."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots! Originally located on 56th & 6th in the heart of Manhattan-its all about the WHITE SAUCE! Get extra, you're welcome. 

Always consistently yummy! The yellow/orange rice is delicious. I skip the veggies because it is just lettuce and tomato. Some people like it, though. They have platters in two sizes. You can also get a combo. I love the falafel and chicken. Again, extra white sauce! It's cheap and the service is fast as well-extra bonuses. 

If you give them a 5 star   review, you get free fries and a drink! Whoo!! 

P.S. We stood in line on opening night for 45 min and met the owner the night before when my Nee Yorker bf \"had to have it\" and he is a super nice guy! 

Awesome place! Awesome food! Awesome people! 
5 stars in my opinion"}
{"text":"So pleased that it has arrived in LV!  Red and white sauce just as good as NY. Good atmosphere. Gyro combo was the way to go - served nice and hot, no sitting around. Falafel was decent but not the reason to come."}
{"text":"Like many others pointed out, the service is great, nothing at all wrong on that end. Now the food... All you get is your meat which is honestly sub par at best and you get rice and salad which is just a handful of lettuce... They give you an option for hot sauce and white sauce. The hot sauce is the only good thing they have going for them because I love spicy food and the hot sauce here is comparable to the Buffalo Wild Wings blazing sauce, perhaps even
Hotter. Too bad the food here isn't worth it. The white sauce is some kind of mayo dressing that's loaded with fat. Literally not kidding, one packet of white sauce dressing has 33grams of fat! If you're watching your macros skip the white sauce, I see that many people enjoy it and drench their bowls with it, but I wonder if they know the facts. Anyways as far as improvements, if they want to compete with real Mediterranean joints then I suggest making veggie options and better overall quality food. For the price I'll stick to Hummus Xpress on Hardy & University, as they give you much better flavourful food which includes: real salad, very good humus, better meat, and hot veggies (Fried eggplant, glazed carrots,Lemon pepper broccoli etc.), not just lettuce, and a variety of toppings you can add for free."}
{"text":"VERY tender gyro platter.  Most tender we have EVER had.  Very large portion.  Fresh lettuce & tomato to build my own.  Love the 2 packs of white sauce that's given.  Enjoyed the take out.  Will order again."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to have some New York style halal food come to Vegas. Finally it's here. I love it. Keep it coming, I'm a fan. I haaate people that go on Yelp and hate and give bad reviews. So yeah good job guys"}
{"text":"Great food and great service 

It stays open late too, until 4 am on weekends 

I recommend the combo platter which allows you to taste both meats available 

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food Was amazing

The plates and sandwiches tasted the same as in nyc

You don't feel bloated with carbs or leave with a garlic breath after eating here like amir or boustan"}
{"text":"First time here! This is a new location and the Beef Platter was awesome. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys - no bueno. The Halal Guys cart in NYC is an occasional guilty pleasure for me when I'm over there, but the new Las Vegas location just does not do the name any justice.

$9.99 for a \"large\" combo plate that doesn't even fill the container, was mostly lettuce anyway (literally more lettuce than rice), with meat that was lukewarm (and technically probably not even room temperature as the A/C in the place isn't even working - it's 100¬∞+ out today, for goodness' sakes), and the pita was cold and hard. No wonder there is literally no line. (Well, at least I didn't have to wait to be disappointed.)

I don't expect a carbon copy of the greatness of their NYC cart, but they will have to get a LOT closer to what's at 53rd and 6th to get me to come back."}
{"text":"Halal guys has to be one of he best things I have ever eaten. When you come here go big or go home always get the regular combo platter with extra meat and white sauce. You will not regret it. 
The restaurant itself was very nice and clean and the staff were very friendly and quick to serve. I have no complaints about this halal guys or the food."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place from many people and we wanted to give it a try. After evening show at the movies, we landed up going to this place for dinner around 10:30. 

The place looks like any fast food chain, we ordered chicken platter. The rice they add is really good and thats the only thing which i liked. The chicken was too bland and didn't find it fresh. My bowl was filled with lettuce . The sauce was good but its like any other Mediterranean sauce. 

I was not impressed and did not like the food, does not look like any picture or video that ran on television in the restaurant. Price is reasonable"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. 

If you want Halal Guys, save it for the next time you're in NYC. 

Was there at 9pm. Ordered a chicken Shawarma pita. Chicken was all chopped up sitting in a metal warming tray. Upon entry into my mouth, my tongue became depressed. My tongue literally wanted to cry. 

This was not the experience, flavours and deliciousness I was hoping for. I've had better Shawarma's at some really crappy Shawarma joints in Toronto. 

Boo!"}
{"text":"Being a super cheap place in Vegas it was packed. Their AC doesn't work. It's vegas, 30 people inside. You get the picture. My 2 friends enjoyed their meal I think. I am just not into halal guys. I've had once in NYC. It was okay. Never understood why people talk so much about them. I'm a foodie and this is definitely not my standard. I ordered the gyro. The pita was soaking wet and fell apart. It was worse than McDonald. I only went there because all the other restaurants were closed. My advice, look for 7eleven and buy a cold cut sandwich over this."}
{"text":"\"It's the best Jerry! The best!!\" I will be here every week, I guarantee it.  The parking sucks, but that's probably because of the Grand Opening, not to mention it's next to a Starbucks and other restaurant I believe.  Other than that the service is great and very fast.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  I actually spent more time trying to find a place to park lol.  There's not very many tables to sit inside, but that doesn't bother me since I always take my food to go. Either way, the food delicious and cooked to perfection; not dry at all.  And the white sauce...let's just say I could drink it from that pack.  Lol, that's how good it is.  Besides Hot 'N Juicy, Halal is the best thing that's happened to Chinatown.  #TheHypeIsReal"}
{"text":"got a free meal due to the cutest & loviest worker! coolest management  I honestly love halal guys the food is absolutely immaculate, i tried it once and actually crave it a LOT. bigger than the tempe one too :)"}
{"text":"The staff and Vanessa the manager were so friendly and welcoming. This is my first time here so they explained everything on the menu to me. The service was really quick and the food was delicious. The BBQ and white sauce combo was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Dry chicken sandwich.
Dry pita bread.
Hot sauce tastes like it should be on a burrito not a gyro place.  sandwich was $8 fries were another $3. Bland and gross. The Tahini served with the Falafel was also extremely flavorless.
Who rates this place 5stars? World famous? Horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing service with great food first time trying this delishness and has the combo bowl with beef,chicken, rice and veggies.  A great inexpensive lunch for me and Be careful with the hot sauce as it is super spicy!"}
{"text":"Go there. Now. Get the combo platter. LOAD IT UP WITH WHITE SAUCE. Add in a little hot sauce. You're lucky there is a Halal Guys near you."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken platter. Regular spicy middle eastern food. ...You can actually find it in many smaller eateries in Toronto. A tad pricey too. Wouldn't line up again."}
{"text":"Still can't beat the NYC experience but so glad to have this place in town. Love the chicken platter with lots of white sauce, raw onions and jalape√±o peppers. Great halal restaurant"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, because I had tried something like this in New York and loved it there! So I was even happier knowing  I could find it here in Vegas! It tasted very much like New York! It was very good and tasty. The service was very friendly and helped any new customers on what to order. I ordered the combo plate which is what I recommend since you get to try both the meat selections they have. Inside is a little small and was a bit crowded when I had gone, but not a very big problem. Overall, I enjoyed it and would go back again!"}
{"text":"First day jitters . Food is not like NYC, but it's the closest we're gonna get and I'm okay with that !"}
{"text":"I had stopped by this place for lunch. The employees were nice and the customer service was good. I ordered the small plate with the chicken and falafel. There was rice, lettuce, tomatoes and three pieces of pita bread. I added their signature white sauce onto the meal. Also ordered a side of hummus. I thought the meal was okay. The falafels were not desirable. A hard outside crust with a green texture inside. The hummus had a grainy texture. It wasn't smooth. Altogether, the meal costs 12.45. I recommend other Middle Eastern places in the area for better value and better food."}
{"text":"I did my homework before coming here. Through reading other reviews, I learned that they are from NY and this location is not comparable to the original location. Rachel F. mentioned in her review that \"it's a once and done\" experience and I felt the same way. 

I went around 2pm on Thursday and there was no line. A girl behind the counter greeted me with an ice-cold stare and negative vibes. I understand it's a quick service here so I wasn't expecting a great service but a smile would have been nice. I ordered in clear and loud voice but she made me repeat everything I said three times, along with repetitive questions. 

Me: \"Can I have beef gyro sandwich?\"
Worker: \"Beef or chicken?\"
Me: \"Beef\"
*Grabs pita bread 
Worker: \"Did you want beef or chicken today?\"

This went on with my other order. I understand if she was trying to listen to me but she was trying to multitask by making my order while chit-chatting with her other coworkers. I work in a customer service job and always have in mind that customers are the first priority. I guess they don't have that mentality here. 

I ordered their beef gyro sandwich ($7.99) and small combo platter ($8.99) and did not like it. Meat is dry and flavorless, which has already been mentioned in many other reviews. I took other people's tip by drowning everything in their white sauce (a.k.a weak ranch dressing) which did help a bit. 

On the pricier side but good portion, which doesn't mean much when the food sucks. \"Once and done.\" I won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Tastes great but pricey! Wow couldn't believe how much our bill came to, they need to come down on the price of the combo salad. To stay in competition with the others around town. They also need to make sure the dressings are kept in a cool place they were all out on empty tables. Thought that was odd."}
{"text":"Just finished my takeout meal from Halal guys. If you're looking for an authentic greek gyro experience, you will be disappointed. It will not satisfy anyone who has had a memorable gyro. 
Here are a few pointers for the Halals. (1) gyro meat is not good when cut and left to sit in a condiment table.
(2) pita slices grilled are horrible and hard when left to sit.
(3) shredded iceberg lettuce cant be the overwhelming part of your meal.
(4) the meat portions need to be adjusted or the prices. Both of my meals were skimpy.
IMO......gyros need to be made with fresh cut meat off the hot slab with a sprinkle of lettuce, tomato, onion and yogurt sauce. We had a large platter, gyro, fries and 1 coke....25.00

Note: i actually liked their rice! Not sure what type it is but it was good.
The fries were standard krinkle cut and were ok. I'll check them out again once they get things worked out."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chicken and rice unless it's kababs and rice but this place is good for its price! The chicken tastes good, and the rice is made to perfection."}
{"text":"I was excited when I heard a new Mediterranean Restaurant opened near ASU. Haven't tried Ys Restaurant up the road yet, but I decided I'd give The Halal Guys a try. The interior is pretty clean and the staff is very friendly and professional. I ordered the gyro and falafel combo. I really enjoyed the texture and flavor of the falafel, bread, and rice. I know to order a drink next time because, after enjoying those tastes, I nearly choked on falafel. I only docked one star because my gyro wasn't wrapped. I docked another star for the high pricing. Otherwise, I think this is worth another try."}
{"text":"This menu of this place is similar to another local place called Parsley.  Mediterranean meat, vegetables, and sauce on rice.  I had the gyro bowl.  It was really good.  I had the large and I had enough to bring leftovers home.  The staff was friendly and gave me the head's up on getting a free baklava for checking in on Yelp.   I'll go here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through DoorDash. Food was really tasty, delivery was prompt, however I got terrible food poisoning for about 12 hours straight afterwards. I had the chicken/gyro combo and my boyfriend, who didn't get sick, got just the chicken.

I haven't seen any other reviews of people getting sick so it seems like it may have been a one-off thing, but I don't think I'll be able to stomach another meal from here after experiencing that!"}
{"text":"I admit it, The Halal Guys in Las Vegas doesn't even come close to the original location in New York City.  The hype is real, just not here. What I love about the NYC location is the portion size, taste, and price.  The chicken and rice is a bit dryer here, bowls are smaller, and the price is a little more.  All that being said, I'm still giving this Halal Guys 4 stars.  I almost have to since I'm here at least twice a month.  How can I honestly say that it's just okay and continue to get my Halal fix?  I no longer get their Chicken & Rice, though.  I just come for the chicken and a lot of it.  

Couple of Tips..
-Service is always great
-Parking can be a nightmare
-The Falafel is great when it's fresh.  Hard as nails when it's not.
-Protein only bowls range from $3 to $14.  I get the same bowl every time and charged a different amount almost every time. 
-The White Sauce is still the bomb.  
-I welcome other restaurants from the East Coast to open in Las Vegas.  The more the merrier."}
{"text":"I've been to the Big Apple but I did not go to the OG Halal Guys location so I can't say how close the OG Vegas location is... all I know is I like it. 

I was turned on to Halal Guys thanks to the Yelp event and my bestie Dyanna praising the NYC truck offerings. 

I always get the combo plate, add hella white sauce cause that stuff is my jam and I stay far away from the hot sauce. It's no joke I hear. 

Parking was hellish when this location first opened but the hype has died down and there is a second location open on the Strip making this one a bit more chill to dine at.

Yelp Reviews 2018 6/100"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The prices are through the roof, rice is bland (looks like it might be appealing due to food colouring), and the chicken is tasteless. The only thing thats good is the gyro meat (beef), however they skimped on that by just sprinkling some of it on that it didn't even matter.

What're you paying for? Salad and rice. With a topping of a little meat. How much? Almost double the price of all other middle-eastern restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best (falafel was basically hush-puppies, pita was store bought, and rice was completely bland) the portions were small, and the prices are outrageous. Be prepared to be nickled and dimed for every little thing."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times, food is decent compared to others. Still would prefer gyro time"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant. I gave it chance despite the negative reviews people gave me. It's more of an American twist to traditional Greek food. I expected the meat to have a little more flavor but it was dry. The rice portion is outrageously small. They give you one scoop that comes with the platter and you have to pay $1.50 for a second scoop. I find the price to be a little high for the quality and amount of food that was included in the platter."}
{"text":"I tried to lower my expectations due to the insane amount of hype about this place (albeit from the New York City original cart) but even after several visits, I have to admit that I'm just not a fan. The food just isn't very good. 

The beef is so salty that all I could taste was salt, salt and more salt. I guess that's what the sauces are for but I'm not a sauce / dressing fan. I guess I'm sort of a purist because I think if the food at its core is tasty, you shouldn't have to drown it in sauce to make it edible -- and that's what is going on here. Heed the warnings about that hot sauce; it is H-O-T and that is not a myth that's overblown. That mess will light your butt on fire!

The sad pita bread was just gross. I'm a bread addict and even I didn't want to eat it. I'm not sure if it's made in-house, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's not. There was nothing fluffy nor fresh nor appetizing about it. It was bad. The tomatoes, lettuce and cheese were just your run of the mill, straight off the food delivery truck quality. 

The ONLY good thing on my plate was the rice, and it is clearly the superstar. Flavorful, light and fluffy, it's worth eating (which is fortunate because it takes up the majority of the container)! This place is expensive and the portion size of the meat is too small for what it costs. I don't want to pay $10 for a lunch that consists mostly of cheap rice! 

The employees are very friendly, competent and willing to help, and the crunchy falafels are a tasty vegan option (serious vegans beware: the line workers aren't as careful as they should be about cross contamination; I saw one lady scooping meat and then falafels with the same utensil). 

Adding to the problem of the subpar food is the horrendous parking situation. There is quite literally NOWHERE to park. This place is located in a very busy Chinatown shopping mall so the spaces are almost always completely filled all day and all night, making this an inaccessible place to eat or to get takeout."}
{"text":"Holy. Smokes.

I'd heard a lot of the hype around Halal Guys before this location opened, but I didn't really think much of it. I mean, it's gyros and shawarma; how do you improve on something as basic as that?

How wrong I was.

I showed up a little after 5:00 on a Wednesday and the place was impressively crowded. (I can only imagine what it's like during lunchtime.) They've got a surprisingly small menu, so I decided to go with a Beef Gyro Sandwich.

It's so simple, but it's so, so good. The soft, fresh pita bread has been loaded with finely chopped lettuce and tomato, and then topped with an extremely generous helping of the aforementioned beef gyro. And then, of course, it's finished off with the infamous white sauce and I also got a couple of lines of hot sauce.

I knew I was in love right from the first bite. The simple ingredients all work beautifully together, and I especially love the unique way the beef gyro meat was prepared. It's not served in stripes as is usually the case, but rather in ground-beef-like chunks that are absolutely glorious. And that white sauce... My god, it's addictive!

I really, really hope that more Halal Guys locations start popping up around town, because I am well and truly head over heels for this stuff."}
{"text":"New to the area and familiar with the franchise name, my ventures today led me to try this location. I'm not big on meat, so I got a 4-piece falafel and baba ghanouj. The latter was quite tasty with a pretty fresh and soft pita, not at all as hard or frisbee-like as I've experienced sometimes. The falafel wasn't greasy or \"hockey puck\" in texture; get the sauce to dip these tasty morsels into. I was waited on promptly by very friendly staff who answered all my questions. Prices were reasonable. There's a rewards system, so save your receipts. I'll return."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo plate with chicken, gyro, tomatoes, lettuce, rice, and white sauce. I definitely was not impressed. The meat tasted really bland and was lacking a lot of flavor. I don't know what the big hype was all about. The service was amazing but I didn't come for service. I came to try the food. I was extremely disappointed. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Stick to Haji Baba or Wessen's Intl Kitchen if in the Tempe area. Trust me."}
{"text":"Zero stars!!! First time in my life I asked for a refund! Defiantly not food by anyone who knows Mediterranean food! 
Wow I can't begin to describe how awful this place is. 

When we got in we should have known, all the food was covered and hidden and the shawarma was already cut, not on the gyro pole, and covered with pita all over. 

My friend took food before me, and since I ordered falafel I had to wait for five more minutes, it makes sense, and I would gladly wait for fresh food but it wasn't at all fresh! He took it out of a plastic wrap. 

The HIGHLIGHT was when I asked if the \"white sauce\" is tahini and been answered that they don't have it - only mayo! The guy preparing my food wanted to give me hummus instead (we already paid by this point) and the cashier started arguing with him he has to charge me extra... 4 falafels were already 10 dollars which is way to much! She started arguing with me that they're not suppose to give any sauce. By that point I was so mad I told them falafel comes with either hummus or tahini everywhere else. I told them it's ridiculous that they have no alternative to mayo. Even extra mayo costs extra there! 
They started talking and 4 people came from the back looking confused. All that drama for a spoon of hummus. 

After a minute of them not realizing the customer is always right I asked a full refund, my friend got up gave them the food back and we got out. 
I've never been to a situation like this before. 
So foolish to not satisfy the customer with this one gesture after they already did an awful job with everything else. 
The place was empty and they couldn't get one customer happy. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Picked up a gyro plate here yesterday and spent the whole night throwing up. Beware! I should've known better. The store was empty and the meat was laying out...RAGRETS!..it didn't even taste that good so I'm even more upset."}
{"text":"The legendary New York street food vendor has finally arrived in Las Vegas. Rejoice!

Even if you've never tried their food, The Halal Guys should require no introduction if you follow social media at all. You must've had a friend or two post photos or rave about this restaurant, whether it's the original food cart in NYC or one of the new outposts in their wave of expansion. I was able to experience them in California and I was excited to have a vastly more accessible location at last (although it requires a U-turn or two lefts if you're approaching from the highway side).

I arrived at the start of typical dinner rush hours, so I was surprised that there was hardly any wait. After standing in front of a powerful A/C machine, briefly perusing one of the simplest menus anywhere, and waiting for my friends to arrive and get their own glance at the menu, I walked to the front of the line, ordered my food and sped my way to the cashier.

Combo Platter ($9.99 for regular size): about half of the aluminum tray had a salad mix, the other half had orange rice (with turmeric and perhaps other spices) that my friends mistook visually for cheese, and the rice was covered equally with chicken and gyro. Quick note: that legendary lamb gyro isn't even available at the original Halal Guys anymore (per multiple reviews), so the beef meat here is presumably the same that you'll get at any of their locations.

After you sit down (I don't see why you'd wait to sink your teeth into this), the right play is to grab white and red sauce bottles, then drench your food with white sauce. Maybe move the pita bread wedges out of the way first, but just get that rich creamy stuff into every bite. Then you might try just a touch of the spicy red sauce, which is legitimately spicy. Squeeze gently!

I must admit that I wasn't really picking up all the flavors at first, and perhaps there's a basis for that. The chicken was far more coarsely chopped here than at my first occasion, so there's probably less caramelization. Plus, peering into the open kitchen, I didn't see chicken on the grill or gyro on the vertical rotisserie, so perhaps the meats just get cooked up in batches and then left to linger. One of the employees was working on a huge pot of rice though, so there's that. And of course the baklava would be baked ahead of time (this portion seemed small so I skipped it).

However, I did save leftovers (all but the most ravenously hungry should have some), and I ended up devouring them late that evening. Maybe my palate just wasn't right earlier, and aside from still not picking up all of the nuances from my first time (especially in the sauce and the rice) and realizing that the meat was a bit dry, I was happy enough that my leftovers didn't live to see the dawn of another day.

Falafel ($1.99 for 2 pc): a little bit of false advertisement considering that the sign says $1 (presumably for 1 ball). Of all the fried chickpea balls that I've had, this is among the better ones in flavor. However, I wasn't that impressed with the texture because was a little mushy/dense inside and not all that crunchy on the outside. This is probably because they'd been fried long before they were served, just like the other proteins.

Baba Ghanouj ($4.99 for a decently sized tub and a pita): nice spiced flavor with surprising smokiness, plus discernible vegetable texture. The tub comes straight from the fridge, so it's cold. I suggest waiting for it to warm up enough to lose the cold temperature's numbing effect on the taste buds. Although it was my friend's order, I'd be amiss not to mention that Stefany V was right to recommend this side dish.

I'm a little disappointed overall, but I'm sure that I'll be back sooner or later when I get a craving for The Halal Guys. Hopefully it will hit all the right notes without forcing me to wait for hours."}
{"text":"Few items on the menu, but hands down one of the best Mediterranean places I've been to. The beef gyro and chicken were perfectly seasoned and cooked the first time I ate there, but the chicken was a little dry the second time around. I always get the regular combo bowl, which consists of rice, lettuce, tomatoes, beef gyro, chicken, and pita bread. I feel like everything mixes well together and is extremely delicious. 1 tip for all newcomers: use a ton of the white sauce. The calorie intake is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I'm so glad that I don't have to travel to NYC to get some Halal Guys. Yes it's not exactly the same as the experience from the cart, but it definitely does come close and it definitely does satisfy my late night cravings. I'm so glad that they are open til 4am, this is great for after a night of drinking out on the town.

I love their combo platters. The chicken and beef combo is amazing on top of their seasoned rice, tomatoes, lettuce and extra extra white sauce. I love getting the red sauce on the side so I can monitor the spice. The portions are very generous as well, I always have leftovers for the next day. 

Great location in the heart of Chinatown. Fast service, great food and open til 4am. Definitely check this place out. It's one of my favorites and I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Greasy, greasy, greasy. Won't be back. Lettuce wilted, fries saturated with grease, gyro meat greasy and hard pita bread. Given that this place is new shouldn't they be producing a high quality product in an effort to entice return business. The food gets an F rating. The young lady helping was friendly but the service itself was slow. Hardest of passes for Me, I was more than disappointed with my food and the overall experience. The little manager (heavy set Caucasian lady) while probably has great intentions, should shy away from food prep, it's not her strength (minor suggestion only)."}
{"text":"Now I must say before the halal guys even came to Canada I was dreaming just to go to New York and try them out and then they opened one right on yonge street & wellesley. I've been here maybe 20 + times since they opened back in may. I've never tried the new York ones. 
Everyone says this taste the exact same and if it does it's delicious ! Can never get enough of this place I always order the regular chicken platter, rice lettuce tomato, chicken and pita bread ! Hopefully they put one in Scarborough. Fresh delicious food on the go or seating is available inside"}
{"text":"- What I have tried:
    + Falafel platter (3/5): They gave me 6 pieces of falafels and tahini sauce on top. The falafels were small and a bit dry for my taste. I thought they were ok, not the best falafel I have tried (I had better falafels at Maha's). The platter came with yellow jasmine rice and lettuce + tomatoes and couple slices of pita bread. The dish was not as good as I expected, I only had two pieces of falafels and already got sick of it.  
    + Combo platter (5/5): This platter has both chicken and beef and also comes with yellow rice and lettuces + tomatoes. They also gave special white sauce on top, which was so creamy and tasty, went very well with meat and rice. I thought this was the best dish out of all they offered.
   + Hot sauce: insanely spicy, only need a tiny bit for an entire bowl. 
- Portion: small bowl was extremely small (they should have called it snack bowl instead). If you want to be full, go with regular bowl. 
- Price: expensive, I got a regular for $12.49, with tax it came up to $14. Extra white sauce will cost you $1.25 which is ridiculous (I wouldn't say anything if they sell it for 50cents). 
- There were many tables there and people are in and out often so there are always seats for 2-3 people. 
- The line was so long, I waited for almost an hour at 7pm.
- Overall, I think it's worth a try but not worth the hype.
- Would I come back? No because their food was ok but overpriced.
EDIT: I just realized that they also give pickles, onions, beans and jalapenoes in their veggies, but when I buy their platters, NONE of the employees asked me (and I did not know if they offered them). I found it extremely unfair as I have lined up for an hour to buy their food but they did not give me all that they had."}
{"text":"With all the craze of the opening of The Halal Guys, I was adamant about coming here to grab a bite to eat after falling in love with the locations in both New York and southern California.

Located in the same lot as Krung Siam, Izakaya Go, and Starbucks, finding parking during the lot's busier hours can pose quite a challenge. There are not many parking spaces available and the lot itself is quite small.

Walking in, the restaurant is very small with not very many seating. The line moves quick. With the menu in giant print and letters above where you place your order, you could choose from the many items they sell. From the looks of it, they provide the same choices as the other locations I have visited. You order first, get to watch it get made, and then pay at the end.

I had ordered the combo platter. There are two sizes only about a dollar apart. However, the smaller size was more than enough for myself to finish. It comes with a salad, pita bread, rice, beef, and chicken. Portion control is something to work on. Also, I noticed that the salad dominated the platter in this location. Though I appreciate them for helping me eat healthier, I don't think I would pay almost $10 for soggy lettuce and mushy tomatoes. 

As everyone says, don't forget to load up on the white sauce! You can't have too much. However, be careful of the red sauce as it is HOT. A little goes a long way. However, even with the sauces piled onto the entire platter, the meats were dry and the rice was hard (borderline stale). Thinking this was just from the bottom of the barrel the first time I had visited, I returned again about a week later to give this place another shot. Sadly, it was just as dry.

Service needs a lot of work. The first time I had gone, there was a lot of confusion over my order. I did not think it took 5 people to ask me what I had to order. The next time I visited, I had witnessed one of the female workers yelling at the customer in front of me. As someone who has worked multiple hospitality jobs, that is no way to treat a customer. Especially one that had asked no more than one question beforehand. I was appalled. However, a couple workers with beaming personalities and smiles were their saving grace. Though I understand this joint is new and is still working itself, customer service should not be lacking as much as it did.

As someone who fell in love with The Halal Guys in New York, I was deeply disappointed in this location. Hopefully with more tweaks and as time goes by, I will be updating my review and raving about how awesome this place is. But for right now, I think I will just wait until my next trip to either coasts to visit the Halal Guys. Though this is Sin City, I will not be sinning with this Halal Guys anytime soon."}
{"text":"Picked up some family from the airport and we wanted to grab a quick bite to eat after a late flight arrival.  To our surprise this place was open late (in fact, very late today, open until 4 AM).  This place is a one of those strip type store fronts with about 6 businesses.  The only draw back could be the that they share a entrance with Dutch Bros Coffee.  So during peak periods could be difficult getting to park.  Once we walked in, we were immediately greeted by a friendly gentleman.  My family ordered chicken gyro \"sandwiches\" and I order the beef.  The guy that prepped the food was quick and really stuffed these sandwiches/wraps with everything.  I was really pleased with how well the meats were flavored, some places don't season enough, but no questions asked here.  The actual store front dining area has about 12 tables that will seat about 4 each...a nice medium size place.  Everything appeared to be clean.  I would definitely be back for a quick complete sandwich."}
{"text":"I was so pleased to see a location opened close to us. I am a big fan of their food truck in New York City and the food still as delicious as I remembered. We have been regulars since we found out that it's open close to us. It's delicious and nutritious and you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

It was so underwhelming in regards to flavor and presentation. The foil container the food is served in, is fine but the food itself left me not wanting to really go back unless it's 2 am and I'm in that area looking for something veggie-like so that I'm not eating junk food before bedtime :) 

In our experience, we had 2 orders of falafel and a chicken entree. The first falafel was ready but the second had to be prepared. No problem there - I'm down for fresh food. The issue was that when I eventually got my food - I had 2 fresh falafel balls out of the 3 and one of them was completely dry and old. My friend had 3 stale falafel balls. I gave her one of mine because I felt bad at how flavorless and stale the old ones seemed to be. That in itself sucks because it this was our first time here and the first impression had failed us so far. 

I don't think the sauces are anything exciting either.  Not for me anyway. The main purpose of the white sauce seems to be to balance out the extremely unbalanced and overly hot spice of the red sauce. I'm sure there is a history to the sauce itself - but if it's not pleasant to eat, then what's the point ?

It was literally so uncomfortably spicy, and were it delicious as well - that would have been one thing. It was not, in my opinion, delicious. Nothing could wash it down either. Just hot hot hot. Honestly, I can handle a fair amount of heat but it just tasted as tho it were not made properly. 

The rest of the plate was pretty whack too. As stated by other reviewers, the rice served with the entrees is strangely dry and unseasoned. There's flavorless, overly watery tomatoes and some bland iceberg lettuce. We are a culture of eaters. If this were the original or anything like it - I'd be stoked - but it all felt phoned in, so to speak. Just checking off boxes but not following through with proper flavor or balance. 

Along side all of that - the seating is not comfortable if you have more than 2 people in your party. Tables are too close - constantly being bumped by other tables while people are just trying to sit down. The overall space that the restaurant is in, is crammed and just whack.

I know they are semi new to this area, but when we asked questions about sauces and food - a staff member said they hadn't had the food or sauces yet... I'm like ... ??? Anyway - if we ever go again I'll ask for fresh made falafel, I'll ask for it to go, and I'll pray this was just a fluke. $36 for 2 meals and 2 drinks and no one was happy. Dry falafel is unforgivable when it's a main menu item. Please fix this guys! 

Happy Eating !"}
{"text":"Foods is always fresh, hot, made with quality ingredients, and it's priced right! The sauces are very good too. I'd recommend this place to anyone for to-go orders, it's not a great spot to dine-in because when they are chopping the meats on the stove it's incredibly loud, like nearly deafening to the point where you can't have a conversation lol. Also the line can take a while, if its more than 3-4 people then we usually don't wait. Another reason why doing to-go is usually the better option!"}
{"text":"After the initial craze about Halal Guys died down, I figured to try this classic NYC chain to see how it compares. Verdict? Meh.

There isn't anything to hate about Halal Guys, but there really isn't anything to love about it either. The charm that brought Halal Guys to fame in NYC were 3 things, availability, pricing, and quantity. Sadly, these 3 values are overlooked in the Toronto establishment. 

Availability: No problem with this here, while the NYC carts are often open until late into the night, the Toronto location is well place, and is available most of the time. Moving on...

Pricing and Quantity: Here is where I'm a bit confused. The price certainly threw people off (hence the 1-2 stars in the first couple of days). But it is a bit ridiculous to see how much of a price difference for the same, if not less food than the NYC counterpart. 

But when it comes down to it, it's the taste. To me, it DOES taste like the chicken and rice made in NYC, and it certainly tastes quite good. The famous white sauce and notoriously spicy hot sauce are nostalgic reminders that Halal Guys still makes the chicken rice around. 


Should you go to Halal Guys? I don't see why not. If you're like me and have discovered this gem in NYC, you won't be disappointed by the Toronto establishment. But at the end of the day, nothing surprises."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Whoever brought this to vegas was and is the most smartest most coolest person in my book. I have such fond memories of my hometown NYC and there gyro stands. I wistfully look back and remember walking all the way to 76th and 34 ave. Just for a gyro and would all the way back and sit in the park near my home and eat my gyro. I remember every break during my shift I was looking forward to my gyro plate. I have never taste gyro in vegas like the gyros from back home. Thanks halal guys. You have fed me maybe 17 times so far in one month alone!"}
{"text":"I'm sick and tired of reading reviews on YELP where entitled people want to go on about delivery service, a rude waiter, a hurried hostess or something that has to do with service. They don't give but 1 star (Less if they could) to service alone. When will yelp break their rating system down? All I give a shit about is the food! The flavor of it, the preparation. Humans are entitled to bad days that will pass. However the shitty rating lives in forever!! Ok, enough about my rant.
The food is great. I'm a New Yorker and have been loving Halal Guys on 59th since I was little. This place is great....not quite as good as NYC carts, but it's good enough. Better than you'll find anywhere on the left coast!! Gyro with extra white and light red!!!!! All day. So glad they're here in AZ!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried The Halal Guy in Toronto. Let's just say thank god we weren't one of those people that lined up for a hour for this when they first opened. 

Ordered the large combo platter to share with my boyfriend, which has chicken, gyro, a spoonful of tomato, some lettuce, orange rice, and three slices of pita. This comes to $14 - quite steep for the quality. The only good thing about this platter and like any Halal guy food is their infamous white sauce, and hot sauce for the brave ones. Otherwise, the meat especially the chicken lacks flavor and taste bland. The orange rice doesn't seem fresh as they were clumped together. The hot sauce was my favourite part and it was the only thing that can merely remind me of the Halal Guys in NYC. 

Pro tip: ask for the red sauce on the side. They come in individual packets."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. Food was SHIT. Service is even worse. They always mix chicken and gyro and state that they don't. DONT EVER eat here. Worse possible food in Montreal. Health services should shut down this branch of Halal Guys."}
{"text":"I love halal guys. I've eaten on the original halal guys at New York and their Glendale, Ca branch. Same taste but customer service is worst! You have to pay extra for sauces! The original halal guys at New York encourages extra sauces because it's in the sauce that's why it tastes so great. Level up your customer service. You're ruining the Halal guys reputation!"}
{"text":"I've never visited their stall in NY so can't make a comparison. I felt the portion was decent and the taste alright, maybe a bit over hyped. One note on the hot sauce: I eat very spicy, and that hot sauce packs a PUNCH. One line would be more than enough for most people..."}
{"text":"I didn't go in, but ordered from postmates. It was pretty decent. I got the combo platter which had chicken, gyro meat, rice, lettuce, tomato, and pita bread. This also came with a side of the white sauce and some hot sauce. 

First off, that hot sauce is no joke. I was expecting something along the lines of a Taco Bell or del Taco level hot sauce.... nope.... it had some serious kick! Like nose running, need a drink after type heat. It was really good though. Not one of those sauces that's heat and no taste. I want a jar of it.

The platter itself was pretty good. The rice was way over cooked, but that also could have been from being in the container for 30min while being delivered. The white sauce helps to moisten up everything.

Overall, it's almost like a taco salad. Not what I expected, but I'll definitely eat it again!"}
{"text":"I could gripe about how it's not the same as the original NYC food cart, which is the stuff of legend...but bottom line is that this Toronto iteration is fast and still packs a punch. I do feel like it's pricier here -- got the small chicken platter for $9.99, but it filled me up as an individual portion. Flavours are bold and fresh, and that hot sauce is actually something to write home about. Overall, a satisfying and speedy meal!"}
{"text":"I've tried halal guys in Costa Mesa, on the streets in Midtown Manhattan, and at the store in UWS NY so the boyfriend and I were excited to hear that they were opening a location in Vegas (and it was a plus that it was off the strip/in Chinatown because we wouldn't have to deal with parking on the strip). We came a few days after the grand opening and they were still getting their AC situation sorted out... so that meant NO AC... and there was no ice in their drink dispenser so we were basically dying.

We got what we got when we first had halal guys, reminiscent of our trip to NY. I got the beef gyro/chicken combo sandwich and he got the combo rice platter. The staff is really nice, they talk you through it if you're unfamiliar with the set up, warn you about the red sauce, etc etc. We arrived just RIGHT before the lunch rush and grabbed the last two bar seats against the wall. 

Overall the food was good, but if you've ever tasted halal guys from the cart - it's just not the same when it's prepared in a restaurant! We both finished our meal, so there's no denying it was good."}
{"text":"I had a small chicken shawarma platter and it was good but nothing comparable to the amount of hype received from the restaurant's grand opening. 

Since Halal guys is from NYC, I'm going to have to quote Jay Z to describe their presence: 'Grand Opening, Grand Closing\"...just kidding, it probably won't close but it'll remain one of the most overrated middle eastern restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"10/10 would recommend to a friend. Amazing service and good quality food. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Having been to the American location in Chicago, I kind of knew what to expect when I visited the Toronto location. I visited The Halal Guys on a Saturday night, and it wasn't very busy to my surprise; but it did make it easier to find a seat and fully enjoy my food. 

I ordered their signature Chicken Platter loaded with their \"white sauce\" and hot sauce (which is REALLY hot, ask me how I know). The quality of the dish itself was very good and probably the best out of all the Shawarma places I have been to. Their signature white sauce and hot sauce really tie the dish together; but be careful with their hot sauce as it is really damn hot! 

Service is okay, but it is a quick serve type of place, so we can't expect anything too great. But for what it is, it's okay. If you're in the area or have been thinking of trying this place out, I would give it a go!"}
{"text":"Thought this place was just called \"Halal Guys\", sans the article. I digress already. Came with a friend of mine who was also excited about their opening; she tried them in NYC and it was my first time. I arrived around noon and it was busy with a short line outside to regulate traffic inside the restaurant. Lots of employees working, making food preparation quick and efficient. I got the small falafel platter ($7.95) with white sauce and tahini and a packet of hot sauce on the side. 

I snagged a table outside for us to sit and waited a few minutes as my friend got her food. The platter has your choice of protein and rice, lettuce, tomatoes and pita bread. My portion was a good size for me as I finished it in one sitting. After all the hype, it's hard not to get my expectations up but there they were, hanging out with the clouds. After trying them out, they were humbly lowered back down to earth. I didn't find my food to be anything spectacular; it was lacking sauce and the hot sauce was pure heat, no flavor. I'm glad I got tipped off to get it on the side. The bowl seemed like something I could easily replicate at home. 

Food wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing either. I wouldn't not go again, but it isn't at the top of my list to go back soon. Good effort guys, and nice customer service!"}
{"text":"Opening Day wasn't as bad as I thought it to be, especially it being my first time actually going to a foodie opening day anything. The Halal Guys is located near the start of Chinatown plaza, next to Krung Siam Thai, Starbucks and Pokeman. Upon arrival, parking was definitely limited but we were lucky to find a spot nearby instead of across the street. The waiting in line was decent - especially for it to be around 10:30~11:00am+ it wasn't massively packed. Employees offered small water bottles while we waited under white tents within the comfort of fans and mists so the hospitality aspect was there. They gave away their branded restaurant shirts for low key advertisements that had various sizes from small to extra large. They also had a DJ next to the entrance to bring up the vibe while hungry customers waited patiently in line. 

When finally entering the restaurant, its actually quite small, compact, and slightly \"humid\". You can smell the aroma of their foods rather strongly as you get closer to ordering. My friends ordered for me while I saved and waited at a table for us to dine in, since they were more knowledgeable of the menu and tried it in New York. 

They got me a combo platter which consisted of chicken, beef, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, and pita. I did like how soft the pita bread was so a hungry me biting onto it was definitely heavenly. Chicken and beef were a bit dry unless doused in their white sauce which added a decent flavor to the meal as a whole. I really wish they were generous with their tomatoes though, the portion seemed rather small but perhaps I am just biased because I love tomatoes lol. The hot sauce is definitely not for the weak or for those who typically order just \"mild spicy things\"- I skimped out on that when I tasted a smidge of it at the ends of my fork, so heed caution!! My friend had his platter drowned in hot sauce, and bravely finished it despite having a red face full sweat and refilling his fountain drink thrice in a row haha!! Ahh I forgot to get their hummus so maybe I'll come back again to try that. 

Overall, decent experience for an opening day. I would honestly only come here if I crave middle eastern cheap eats. I feel that if I really want to heighten my experience though I would actually try the gyro food cart in New York as its in a fast-paced industrial area with better weather."}
{"text":"I've heard many tales of this glorious  'white sauce'...and I must say, it's pretty yummy! 

Although a few might not agree, I enjoyed the small store front and was a big fan of the minimal menu selection. I always worry about what to order especially when trying new locations so this made it real simple. 

The customer service was well more than you'd expect from a 'fast food' joint. They have team members on the floor there to greet you and answer questions. 

Unfortunately, aside from the white sauce, the meats were 'ehhh'. The chicken was really dry - the chicken seemed to all be cooked and piled together on top of the grill - not sure how long it was sitting there that day (we came for dinner around 5pm). 

Ultimately, I'm sure I'll be back again. It's an awesome option for those late night cravings. Just a little disappointed and expected a bit more from the all mighty 'Halal Guys' from New York. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going! The servers were nice and polite and greeted me once I got to the counter! I got the regular chicken plate! They gave alot of chicken! So much that it covered the rice completely! It was tasty! I'll definitely be returning and getting the falafel next time! The regular size is big enough for two, at least for me it was since I could only get through a third of it! :)"}
{"text":"My first experience with Halal Guys and I had UberEATS deliver it. I was impressed at how fast everything was by the time they got it ready to the time it was delivered to my house. The food was still warm by the time I started eating it. I just ordered the chicken platter without tomatoes. The chicken was moist and there was plenty of food left for leftovers. However, I know the main attraction is this white sauce. The white sauce did make it amazing! I would definitely want to dine in next time and experience the whole shebang next time. Overall I was impressed and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it. The spicy red is unbelievable. I like the simplicity. No really I like that red it's hot hot habanero and cayenne I suspect. Great combo. The problem is I barely made it home in time to get to the bathroom. Wish that wasn't my report but I would be careful.  Hope the management reads this and fixes what ever issues on sanitation might be going on. I know it's street food but trust me when I tell you I have cast iron belly"}
{"text":"Food was not good. Service was ok. But really the meat just tasted badly. Food reminded me of cafeteria food"}
{"text":"So I came in on a Saturday to try the food. And I was dreading about having to wait in line for too long. Or that maybe they would've ran out of something by the time I get to the front of the line. To my surprise it wan't that busy. There was a substantial amount of people to make a line. But not bad enough that you have to wait for an hour to get food. The place wasn't too bad . You had enough room for tables and a queuing line without too much cramming.  

I grabbed a large Chicken Plate and a Beef Gyro Plate (because that's just how much of a fat *** I am) and the process was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Usually with hype places like these there would usually be an overwhelming menu where the good stuff is only like one or two and the rest is just there but no. You choose from either Chicken or Beef or Falafel or Chicken and Beef. Add the Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Rice and your all set. 

Okay so on to the food. The Chicken was by far the better out of the two plates. It has that grilled aroma to it and the flavor was actually good. Not salty at all, not bland as well. They offer a white sauce that you can put on top of the plate for better flavor but the plate itself doesn't need it if you wanna stay on the healthy side. 

The Beef Gyro was soft, not chewy at all. Could use a little salt in my opinion but you don't have too really. The white sauce does tie in nicely but too much of the white sauce kinda ruins it for me since I can't taste much of the food after I accidentally smeared the whole packet of white sauce onto the plate. The lettuce and tomato, I would probably hold off on it the next time I visit. Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing bad about it. Its just they put too much for my taste and my fat *** doesn't feel like eating a salad. 

They also offer a hot sauce which is REALLY hot! I didn't believe what the packet was telling me when it said \"Its really hot\" so yeah I put on a good amount and it burned. But the nice thing about the hot sauce is that the kick is good. The flavor of the food is still there. Unlike other hot sauces where all you can taste is the hot sauce itself and then comes the burn. Theirs actually start off with a nice kick along with the flavor of the food. And then you get to the second or third spoonful and you regret having put too much of it on one plate. 

Overall, the food is pretty awesome. I probably wouldn't be hankering for another plate since the two I had would probably last me all the way to next week but I wouldn't have a problem coming back another time. I actually look forward to try the Falafel next time since my dad always tells me to go and try it. I will probably edit this review in the future for that. But for now I would recommend this place for those who are looking for something healthy and flavorful and those who are looking to get their grub on and just lather the plate with their signature white sauce. 

Parking isn't a problem during peak hours but I would probably try going on Wednesday or non-peak hours so as not to end up looking for parking. Or worse, standing in a line."}
{"text":"My fianc√©e introduced me to Halal guys when we visited New York City and I immediately fell in love. We were both excited when we found that there were locations in the Phoenix area. It's no frills food, and that's what we love about it. I also do the combo plate, with white sauce and a little bit of the hot sauce. Be careful with that hot sauce, that shit is hot!!!! This location delivers through Ubereats to my work, which is always a nice lunch when I'm craving it. Sometimes at the restaurant the service can be so so, depending on the time you go."}
{"text":"How could I not go here after missing my guys on the streets of NYC!? While this environment is more quiet and sterile, it still brings me back to NY, taking my hot combo meal and eating in Central Park, tossing pitas to the pigeons. People out here don't understand this type of NY street food but it will grow on you. Been there three times and will be back every once in awhile for the memories of NY and my Halal guys, oh and girls here....staff is super nice and sauce is SUPER HOT so don't go in there asking them to drown it and then whine that the sauce is too hot. You can get it on the side."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying if you are expecting the same as their original NYC cart, you will need to curb your expectations. I ordered the combo platter which is chicken and beef gyro plate with salad, rice and slices of pita bread covered in their famous white sauce and hot sauce. The taste was good, although not as good as NYC, it's the closest we have to there. Their hot sauce is no joke, so I suggest trying a little bit first before slathering it all over. I also wish that they had extra sauce bottles available for customers to add onto their food rather than having to ask, albeit during the grand opening, a staff member went to each table to give more white sauce. 

My biggest issue is the pricing and portion sizes. I got the regular size which was $12.49, whereas the small size was $9.99. Now in NYC it's only one size and it would be equivalent to a regular here and you would need to add extra protein which costs $2.99. I understand that the prices here would be a bit higher but if that's the case then keep the portions the same as well. There is way too much salad, about half the plate whereas in NYC you only get about a quarter. Hope they improve their portions to justify their prices."}
{"text":"This place is quick and affordable compared to the restaurants in the hotel however...  it is by far and away the worst version of this food they could make. Nothing tastes like it should. The rice is bright orange  covered in oil and tastes like nothing, it doesn't even taste like plain rice. Falafel had a hint of coconut and nothing else served over a huge portion of iceberg lettuce with some sad tomatoes. Their hot sauce was great it covered up the lack of flavor, order a side of hot and go anywhere else.  Only eat at this place if you are drunk and broke everything tastes better drunk and starving in Vegas."}
{"text":"I think I wrote a review for this place before but I'll do it again because I want you to try this place , it is really good

The Halal Guys located at spring mountain & valley view.
It is a very simple menu. You can order sandwich (pita wrap) or platter [ comes with delicious yellow basmati rice; your topping: chicken, beef gyro, combo-chicken & beef gyro, falafel; iceberg lettuce; tomato; 4pcs triangels pita]. The platter comes with 2 sizes (small $9.99 & regular $10.99). They have sides as well like  hummus, baba ganouj, falafel $1 each, fries. Baklava $2.49 for dessert.

I always order combo $10.99 & if you check in with yelp, you get a free baklava ($2.49). I love their yellow rice sooo gooddd. Their baklava is good too but it is a little bit to sweet for me.

If you get it to go, DON'T FORGET to get 2 WHITE SAUCE & 1 HOT SAUCE. Usually I put a lot of white sauce(1,5) & half of their hot sauce. BE CAREFULL w/ their hot sauce, VERY SPICY so put a little bit on your food and go from there. After you mix it all (for platter) & now your food is ready to eat!!! YUM YUM

VERY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hype about this restaurant from my friends in NYC but I thought to myself, Montreal has some amazing options when it comes to donair, shawarma places so my expectations were low.  As I was walking by, some instinct inside me said, just go in and try it.  Boy am I happy I did. The place is amazing!!!! First thing, I was greeted with was a friendly smile and a witty, funny server. I asked for some advice on what to get and finally chose the beef gyro sandwich. I am a very picky eater so I told the server that for sauces I only wanted hot sauce. I am a true hot sauce guy. In fact, I date girls based on hot sauce tolerance sometimes. The server warned me that the sauce is really hot but I simply rolled my eyes at that. I mean I love hot sauce, I can handle anything! By the time my pita was made it looked like a piece of art. The beef was pouring out lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and pita bread looked good. I get really annoyed sometimes when I go to kojax or other places and they put meat in your pita and then pull it out as if they put too much. I mean once it's in the pita it has to stay in there, don't be cheap with the meat!  The server at Halal guys loaded the meat inside until it couldn't take anymore. I finally took my first bite and it was melt in your mouth good!  Pita was so soft, the meat was so tasty, the lettuce and tomatoes were really fresh and hot sauce was crazy hot. The guy did not lie, I was sweating!  Thanks for the warning!  I feel bad for the other restaurants around this place as I don't thinks I will be able to walk by this one with grabbing something. Thanks for opening in Montreal! Can't wait for my next order."}
{"text":"After so much buildup to opening i must say this is the worst tasting Mediterranean food I have ever had in Chandler /Tempe / Phoenix Area. The food didn't taste good , plus it was served so cold that whatever the taste it might have just disappeared."}
{"text":"Well, it's simple if nothing else.  The menu has a couple of items and it's served quickly.  I found the gyro meat to be a bit dry and the chicken didn't stand out.  The sauces were the highlight.  Their hot sauce is potent and the white sauce is very good.  The rice and sides were just average.

All around it is an ok option for lunch but I don't see a situation where I'd crave it."}
{"text":"I'm going to be nice and say this location was definitely different than the rest. I usually go to the Tempe or Awatukee stores and they never disappoint. The portion size are always good enough to get me full and their speed through their customers has me out in no time. Plus the flavor of both meats are hot and fresh. Today at this particular location when we went it, it was completely empty. The young girl that attended to us looked pretty new but she still needs a lot of training to do. First with the rice portion that was not even a full scoop. Then when she went for the chicken she literally picked one piece at a time and then asks her manager if that looks like enough ? If you have to ask then it probably needs a little more. She had no sense of urgency even when more people started coming in after. The beef that was served was not fresh since it was really dark as if it was cooked way earlier. By the end of my meal I was still hungry and sad that I couldn't enjoy my spicy fix. The Tempe and Awatukee locations definitely set the bar high so hopefully this store will catch up."}
{"text":"This place is worth a visit. Was kind of skeptical about trying it since most of the reviews said it was bland. The only thing simple are the basic lettuce and tomatoes but you need that pop of freshness. The beef and chicken was flavorful even by itself. The white sauce was really good, can't get enough of it so there's 1 bottle by drink station. The hot sauce it very pica ! It's a whole other kind of heat the more you eat the hotter it seemed to get so only get a few lines when ordering or packets on the side. Overall, I like this place a lot but its probably  more fun buying their food off of a food truck in New York like my mother in law did when she first had them."}
{"text":"This place is terrible... I ate this yesterday & I'm still so bothered by it that I had to write this bad review to really let you all know what the buzz really shouldn't be about. The rice is wack the chicken is wack & that white sauce is WACK. Dry rice weird looking chicken not even comparable to chipotle & the sauce has NO flavor. Honestly just eat some chipotle or chicken kitchen."}
{"text":"Things I'll be telling my friends tomorrow at school... 
1. Don't worry about there being a long line, there's a Pokestop nearby so standing in line will be productive. Also, the line moves quick! 
2. Yes, the food is as good as their other locations
3. Parking in Chinatown is NEVER an issue. The further you park = the more places you get to stop and eat/boba/dessert before you get to your final destination. There will probably not be any spaces in their lot, but there are plenty of lots nearby so who cares!
4. YESSSSSS, the food is as good as their other locations. DON'T WORRY.
5. Watch out for that red sauce!

Let me bring to your attention that The Halal Guys is open until FOUR AM. I have no upcoming plans to go out clubbing, but this makes me want to go out just so I can experience Halal Guys the right way- a night of drinking followed by WHITE SAUCE. 
Stick with the famous combo platter if you don't know what to get. It lets you try both meats so that you'll know next time (Yes. There will be a next time.) which meat you prefer. I'm sure you don't need the reminder, but watch out for the red sauce it's HOT. 
The restaurant is small, don't expect to be able to sit inside to eat. Take it to go. Eat it in the car. Eat it in your pajamas on the couch binge watching that new show you started. Just make sure you buy two platters- the portions are HUGE, but you won't regret having an extra platter for the next day :)"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to love this place, as Greek restaurants in AZ are too few and far between. But after trying them multiple times I am not impressed with any of the food. We tried the beef and the chicken, the wraps and the platters, but none of it was fresh-tasting or flavorful. The meat seemed dry and tasted like it had been sitting around. The rice was kind of under done as well. The staff was beyond friendly with great customer service but I won't be returning; it's definitely not good Greek or Greek-like food."}
{"text":"Meh, it was just \"okay\". Nothing to really write home about honestly. Got the beef chicken gyro salad combo and it was neither horrible nor outstanding.
Pros: the serving size is enough to feed two. 
CONS: Hot sauce, entirely too hot to be pleasant at all.
The white sauce left much to be desired.
Chicken was a wee bit dry.
Not even half a piece of bread to go with.

Will I return? Yeah, if I don't have to pay for it. May just try the gyro."}
{"text":"After all the hype, it was just okay. The rice had little flavor but the chicken was seasoned well. The falafel was interesting and different than most I've tried. I'm not sure if it was bad but I'd come here again and reevaluate. Workers were nice"}
{"text":"Flavorless and completely unsatisfying. My group had gyros with fries and the chicken platter. How can spiced gyro meat taste like air? There is literally no flavor to it. The white sauce tastes like mayonnaise but somehow blander. The chicken at least was spiced but was chopped, tough, and stringy. The pita bread is very good but that was about the only positive we could come up with. We ended up going elsewhere later that night to get food that was remotely satisfying. That this is some sort of famous east coast chain is completely confounding to us. Will never return."}
{"text":"If you're craving some Mediterranean food (fast food or not), do yourself a favor and keep looking for another place. It's not \"delicious & tasty\""}
{"text":"Every trip to NYC, halal guys is always on the first of my list. Squatting on the sidewalk, devouring my combo rice platter is the best way to enjoy this once NYC exclusive staple. A halal guys in Vegas? wow.... All i can say is is that Las Vegas is becoming the fast food mecca in America where almost any regional exclusive chain can be found here now. 

Setting: If you're coming eastbound on spring mountain, its kind of a hassle to get here. You'll have to make a right at the light and then u-turn into the plaza where this place is located. Open until 4am, this is my new go to after party eatery since the line at tacos el gordo is absurdly long. 

Service: Pretty friendly! You can ask for no vegetables so that they give you more rice, which is my typical order and how they serve it at the halal guys cart. They also have pickled jalapenos, beets and other fixins behind the counter that you have to ask them for. 

Food: They keep the gyro meat in a metal container that is soaking in grease. When I saw the guy open the lid it made me lose my appetite when I saw all the grease just bubbling through the meat. This location does not have lamb!!!! The chicken is grilled so less grease.They offer sauces for $1 but you have multiple sauce bottles by the soda dispenser. Pro tip: Unleash a bukkake of white sauce all over that bad boy and mix it up! Also and this is VERY VERY VERRRRYYYY important so listen up. Add maybe 8-10 drops of the hot sauce and mix that bad boy up good. This sauce is straight from hell and it will murder you and your butthole if you do not heed my warning.

Overall: If everything is closed or too long to wait, i'll come here when we finish up our late night escapades, but I wouldn't come here wanting to eat. It's not bad but the amount of grease and the fat content of the white sauce will set your fitness goals very behind."}
{"text":"We had tried out the free samples at the Halloween Yelp bash and finally were in the area so we decided to try more. It was easy to find. Parking was a bit werid and when we stepped out of our vehicle we were hit with the smell of weed from the apartments behind but we still ventured forward. The building was very clean and surprisingly empty for the time we were there. My daughter loved that she could customize her Gyro. My partner ordered the platter and that was plenty to share with our toddler son. We also ordered extra pitas and they were amazing. The only thing that was just okay was the hummus, the rest was da bomb. I can't wait to go back and fill up again!"}
{"text":"I came here during their third week opening. The line was still long even then. I waited about 1.5 hours in line. I waited so long, the marijuana cookie I had consumed kicked into effect and then I got the strongest munchies I have ever had. I was supposed to only take one plate because they were about to close and the line was long, but I snatched two anyways. My Greek partner couldn't finish his plate because he found the food terrible, so I ate his too. But even though I managed to totally eat 3 plates - 2 beef gyro, and 1 chicken gyro meals, while high as a kite, I can still say that was subpar middle eastern food. I don't recall the white sauce or the red sauce being particularly eventful. The rice was overdosed with fat - that's basically flavor cheating. There are so many better places in Toronto. If you've got the munchies you'll eat it, but otherwise do yourself a favor and pass."}
{"text":"We had an extremely awful  experience with one of the managers who was extremely derogatory and rude (Julian), however the next time we came in (months later and we used to frequent) Angelo wanted to listen and he made everything right as well as Brian, we didn't want or get a free meal, that wasn't what it was about but Angelo just understood and that is extremely appreciated. We love this place and as long as Angelo is here, we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is an insult to mediterran Food
 I'm from Europe so I know how Gyro looks and tastes this is an insult to any culture that serves gyro 
Mayo on a Gyro you got to be kidding me that's there famous sauce lol
Nasty Oil dripping meat 
No thanks never again"}
{"text":"Nostalgia. This place brings back memories of NYC... standing in the freezing cold after a late night out... standing in line... just waiting for the Magnificent Taste of The Halal Guys.... now it's here!!! That white sauce tho..."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Halal Guys in Toronto. I ordered Chicken & Gyro platter. The meat part was good, chicken and gyros were well cooked and tasted fresh. Like many here, I also had one at New York, but it was many years ago so i cant really compare the taste between two, but it was good, not \"oh my God!\" good but good. However the portion was too small, when i opened the platter first time i was like \"wow the platter is full, looks like they listened to complaints and worked on it\" but i was wrong, there were more lettuce than the meat. I began to wonder how small the \"small\" size be if they charge extra $2.50 for the \"regular\" size."}
{"text":"Customers beware! The red sauce is super spicy! But delicious. A few drops and my mouth is on fire! 

I like how The Halal Guys is one of the few places that open late. The food can be inconsistent which is why I give it 4 stars. When it's good it's really good and I finish all of it. When it's not good, the meat can be too dry. I think it's better to ask for the white sauce on the side. That way, you're in charge of how much sauce is mixed in. The Pita that they give isn't fresh and warm which is something I don't like."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo here. It was delicious. I have to warn you guys the spicy sauce they give you with it is really really really spicy. I cried when I ate it cause I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy. I took a big bite of it and ouch it hurt. It also comes with white sauce but it seems like ranch to me? The staff was friendly and nice. Pretty limited seating so your best bet is to get it to go."}
{"text":"Good food open late. Thank you for coming to Vegas. 
white.sauce is.tasty sauce is very spicy!"}
{"text":"only got three stars cause they forgot my pita....I know right?? And the super duper flimsy to go containers... the dollar store contains are sturdier then theirs!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people see in this food. I've been there twice now and it just doesn't compare to other shawarma or gyro shops. I got the chicken sandwich last time and it was cold when I bit into it and pretty low on flavour other than the extreme amount of sauce they put into it. The chicken itself lacked flavour."}
{"text":"WARNING: the hot sauce is EXTREMELY HOT! I made the mistake of trying Halal Guys in NY and dousing my platter in hot sauce, don't follow in my footsteps unless you can handle spice.

On to the review... This franchise is famous for their NY street cart Halal food, now with multiple locations across the USA. They have a very simple menu offering: Chicken, Beef Gyro, Combo, or Falafel in a platter (rice, lettuce, tomato and pita) or in a sandwich (pita). Regular is a couple dollars more and a substantially larger portion. I ordered the Regular Combo Platter.

Beef Gyro: A+ 
WOW. The beef is incredibly seasoned to the max and extremely tender. The other people saying the food is bland either didn't try the beef gyro or had their taste buds burned off from the hot sauce. One of the best Halal meats I've tried over the years.

Chicken: B
The chicken was solid, but not nearly as good as the beef. It still had a good flavor, could be slightly more tender. Better than the street cart I had in NY though.

Pita: B+
The pita is pretty basic, but I like it. Very soft and fluffy, goes great with the meat and white sauce. Scoop up some of the lettuce and tomato and you got yourself a mini gyro sandwich!

Sauce: A+
White sauce adds a creaminess that compliments the meats wonderfully while the hot sauce adds a new dimension of flavor. I suggest taking one sauce packet and dabbing/mixing it into the meat conservatively if you can't handle too much spice.

Service was fast and friendly. There's plenty of seating. This location is more like a cafe than a sit down restaurant with service though. This Halal Guys just might be my new favorite spot in the area for Halal food.

Food: 5/5
Value: 4/5
Service: 4.25/5
Overall: 4.75/5"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, the staff is super friendly, the atmosphere simple and somewhat industrial. We took a couple sandwiches to go: falafel and combo. I rate both average compared to other gyros I've had; the pita is industrial and not \"homemade\" style. Big appetite alert: the sandwiches are relatively small, so if you are not buying a side of fries or others, you might want to plan on a second sandwich, which might defeat the purpose of the whole economy dining concept."}
{"text":"Small menu, but everything on it looks delicious.  This place recently opened and seems to maintain a daily crowd quite well.  Their food is good and reasonably priced.  I tried the combo platter with white sauce and enjoyed it.  I love spicy sauces/foods, but I don't recommend their hot sauce unless you can really handle heat though!"}
{"text":"Thanks Angela,  the office party went over great the food went fast everyone loved it.  I hope to use you for future parties."}
{"text":"Let me say this to start: I'd go back.  I wouldn't rush back but, if I were hungry and in Caesars Palace, I'd go there.  Definitely a good value in an overpriced environment.  I thought the two young girls at the counter were very friendly, helpful and courteous and, as I was the only one at the counter (it was about 11:30am), we were able to chat (this was on Tuesday 2/27, in case management would like to recognize them--and you should!) and laugh a little.  I ordered the chicken sandwich.  I was served promptly! It was quite tasty.  I had the white sauce but didn't do the hot sauce.  I just felt that the chicken was a little dry but it certainly was edible.  It is plenty of food and I left stuffed.  Didn't eat again until 6:00pm.  I may try the location on Spring Mountain in the future as it seems to get better reviews."}
{"text":"We have ordered 2 times via UberEATS, first time the order was cancelled by them after an hour wait and now, i given them an other try and they forgotten to include the sauce with our meals... food is good but..."}
{"text":"A lady who worked there didn't know anything about the reward card. She should've just asked other workers what to do. Instead she just stood there and gave me a false information. I wasted almost 10 minutes signing up for an account that didn't even attach to the reward card. They told me that next time when i come just tell them my number only. I dislike how this system work. Because I expected to able to use the reward card the next visit. I will give two stars because the food was great. But that sign up thing just ruined my experience. I probably not going to come back again."}
{"text":"I ordered Halal Guys on the UberEATS app from my hotel. The food came quickly and in amazing condition! I was worried I may not get plastic ware, as that happens a lot with to go orders, but I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely getting this again!"}
{"text":"With The Halal Guys being offered on Uber Eats I can now snag lunch from here on weekdays. I hadn't enjoyed The Halal Guys since they first opened so I wanted to give it another try.

I ordered the Chicken Platter. It was a sizeable portion for me and I didn't need to eat again that day. It's a really simple platter with chicken, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, rice, and pita bread. The pita bread was nice and soft. The chicken is cut into tiny pieces and moist, but it's pretty plain. I found that the white sauce was necessary to flavor the dish. At 330 calories a packet to add flavor I'm not sure I would enjoy this often. I liked the hot sauce since it really packs heat and is unique from hot sauces at other restaurants. The rice is also simple and free of any exciting flavors. 

Overall, the food is good, but it doesn't excite me. I'll eat there again when my coworkers are ordering through Uber Eats, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get The Halal Guys."}
{"text":"So, just like everyone else I have heard how delicious this place was so I was pretty excited to try it! My boyfriend and I went to lunch here the other day and I got the regular sized platter with chicken, my boyfriend got the regular sized platter with the beef. The chicken was very flavorful, the rice was....eh. 
I tried the beef and it was OK. The regular sized platter was more than enough food for me because I didn't finish it (because I was full). The white sauce is really good! 
Was it as great as everyone made it out to be? No, not even close. Would I go there again? Yes, if my boyfriend wanted to go, but it wouldn't be my first choice by any means."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about. There are way better \"tasting\" place than this! Come on people it taste like plain ground beef with pita. The white sauce taste like ranch dressing. The red sauce according to my husband was real spicy."}
{"text":"I had the chicken plate here and it was ok. It was really bland until putting the garlic sauce and hot sauce on. I did really like the hummus and pita and they have good fries. Definitely NOT my new favorite."}
{"text":"Soon after the Costa Mesa restaurant opened up, I heard of new of the Las Vegas location opening and decided to wait to try it here.  They are located in the same plaza as Krung Siam (the sign isn't visible when you're coming off of the freeway.)  I came in during the afternoon on a Monday and luckily there was no line! So I moseyed my way up to the front and ordered a small combo platter.  

The small combo platter comes with chicken and beef gyro, a bed of rice, some lettuce, tomatoes, and three pieces of pita bread.  On the menu, it says they charge for extra red and white sauce, but the sauces are actually next to the sodas (free of charge! - so you can add as much as you want!) 

Small vs regular?  There's only a dollar difference, but I was only able to finish half of my small combo platter for reference.  

How did it taste? I was hoping for...more.  After putting some white sauce on, I found my chicken to be a little dry. So i continued to go to town with the white sauce so the chicken could soak up some moisture.  It helped, but still wasn't what I had hoped for.  The meat lacked flavor and I found myself heavily relying and the white and red sauce to bump it up.  Be warned: red sauce is extremely spicy, so don't go HAM, unless you know you can handle the heat. 

The place is also extremely tiny!  There are 3 tables and 8 stools on the side.  All the tables were occupied, so we ended up sitting next to another couple on the stools.  Get comfortable with small spaces because you're literally sitting elbow to elbow with one another.  

Great thing is that they are open until 4AM!  But I wouldn't see myself craving it again."}
{"text":"First time having it! My friends tell me the NY Location is the best but this will have to do until I go there. 

Service was good. They greeted as I came in, told me they'll be right with me to get my order since they had a large family order right before I came in. 

Food was delicious. They have two sizes for the plates. I believe it's a regular or small? Or large and regular? Anyways the bigger plate is perfect for 2. I forget if it's called pita bread or naan bread but it was soooooo soft and good that I wish I had ordered more of it. Definitely makes me want to try the wrap and hope it's the same type of bread. Baklava was delicious. It is sweet as it's primary ingredients are honey, walnuts/pecans (?) and pastry bread. I did wish it was more flaky though. 

Eating area is pretty small for a place that is well know to be good. Ordering was a bit confusing as there was no line or signs in place. But it's just like
Chipotle Eecept you don't see a bar of the food. I was only able to glimpse at the girl scooping rice and one of the meats."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to the opening of this location for so long!

Not the easiest area to get to (to the right of the Target, near the Costco side), but it's still really close to my work. So lunch was inevitable. 

I'm still trying to figure out the perfect meal, but I'm pretty sure it's the small beef gyro platter with less rice and a little more lettuce, extra meat, white sauce, and dots of the red.

So good. So very good."}
{"text":"The worst gyro sandwich I ever had , insanity too salty and not fresh . 
Avoid this place . There are tons of other places that you can get a better shwarma sandwich ."}
{"text":"The food was almost inedible. I ordered the combo platter with chicken and gyro meat. The meat was dry and flavorless. The rice was similarly tasteless. The salad on the side is just a bunch of iceberg lettuce and chopped up tomatoes, the white sauce tasted like ranch dressing, and the pita flavor was something close to cardboard."}
{"text":"Got the chicken and beef platter with a side of fries. Taste as good as the one off the strip. The hot sauce is money. My choice for healthy eating."}
{"text":"Hard working people, the place was busy but worth the late. Food tastes so good. The food smells amazing too. Never really eat Mediterranean? food so I'm glad I decided to try something different."}
{"text":"Okay. First of all.. If you come here expecting legit, bougie, gourmet Middle Eastern food, save your drive, money, and your Yelp Review. It is not warranted in that capacity because this food is for the DRUNK and the HURRIED.

For context- I have eaten from the Halal Guys cart in NYC numerous times and no experience has been before 9 pm prior to my lunch visit here on a Saturday. This chain started off as a hotdog turned chicken/rice platter cart for Manhattanittes to grab a bite of lunch on the go. It also evolved into late night drunk food for club patrons-- being open until early morning. 

If you've heard of how amazing this place is through the grape vine and leave your experience disappointed, I don't blame you. This place has been hyped up the wrong way. I recommend visiting New York and going to this cart so you can see how it fits into the NYC lifestyle and isn't quite the same as in Vegas.. or even LA... etc.

Anyway-- surprisingly there was no line when we arrived. Seating is sparse but patrons are respectful and will not dawdle in conversation when they are finished eating so to allow for those who are waiting to sit and eat. (Note: If you see this review please heed advice and be respectful of seating.) Order to go if you're in a hurry. Unfortunately, unlike in New York, you can't really sit on the curb/sidewalk wall and eat this.   

Presentation is the same as the NY cart-- aluminum to go container with a plastic cover which includes meat (chicken, gyro, or both), yellow rice, iceberg lettuce, and slices of pita bread. If you're from New York (as my husband is) and craving this.. it satisfies. It's not as greasy and you don't feel as accomplished after eating it but the size (regular) is hearty enough for a second meal. Douse it in \"crack sauce\" but go easy easy easy on the hot sauce. Seriously though.. it is what is it. If you're not stuck up about your food then you'll appreciate it. 

Service is very good. Someone is constantly wiping tables, taking out the trash, and refilling condiments. They also greet you nicely and thank you when you leave. 

Like I've said.. so many popular eateries are opening up here in Vegas which is nice. I'll definitely come back when we are craving chicken and rice.. perhaps at 3am after hitting the strip or even for lunch on a week day."}
{"text":"Very clean place, service was great but the food was just very Mediocre to me I mean Shwarma vegas got you guys beat hands down the white sauce was ok not all hyped up like people say , I will give you guys the hot sauce tho , it's really hot... over all I give you guys 3 stars"}
{"text":"I heard the hype about this place from new York just a couple minutes when we got I  there was a lineup the shawarma is average but with that white sauce is dynamite. I think that is what makes them stand out than regular places would I come ba k here maybe. I think there are definetly better places to try for sharma but not bad"}
{"text":"If you're familiar with the Halal Guys in New York City this has the same formula. It's very tasty and it's open late until 4:30 a.m..   The hot sauce is definitely one of the hotter sauces available in any restaurant so please be careful."}
{"text":"Awesome to find a good gyro place open late! This place just opened a couple days ago sandwiches between Target and Hobby Lobby off Rey. Food was awesome and they have a couple great garlic sauces they finished my gyro plate with that where phenomenal."}
{"text":"I normally only post reviews that are good.  However, this was terrible.  I ordered the Gyro combo plate.  Once I got home I noticed that there was no pita bread.  Also, their \"white sauce\" is nothing more than ranch dressing.  Not the bright lemon cucumber yogurt sauce you would expect.  It didn't come with a red sauce either.  For $10 you are better off going to one of the local restaurants to get authentic greek, lebanese or middle-eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about Halal Guys, so when I was driving past Christown Mall and saw the sign, I had to stop and give them a try. They are located in the SW corner of the parking lot, across from Target and next to Chase Bank. 

I ordered a gyro and chicken combo. 

The gyro and chicken meat were both good. Nicely seasoned, hot and fresh, without being dried out. The rice was okay. Not exceptionally good or bad. The salad was a little boring. I appreciated the kalamata olives, but some sliced cucumber would make it perfect. I wasn't crazy about the pita bread. It was grilled on the flat top and then sliced, but it seemed a little soggy. I also got some white sauce on the side. I asked the girl working if it's like tzatziki, and she said yeah it was. It's sort of like tzatziki flavored ranch. 

Overall, the food was pretty good. I would go back. But I wouldn't go out of my way for it. For Middle Eastern food, it's nothing special. But the quick service is nice."}
{"text":"I've lived in NJ the past 13 years and during my time at college I'd take the train up to visit NYC and get food at The Halal Guys. From what I remember the food was good for its price at the time. When I heard it was coming to Vegas I went on opening day.

Result: The food was not as I had remembered it. Back then it used to be around $5 a plate which made it a bargain. Also, the food is very bland and compared to the other Greek/Mediterranean places at 9 dollars a plate it's not worth it anymore. The sauce is what makes the food but I'd rather not have to lather up my food with that. (considering extra sauce was $1.00 extra)

One big noticeable difference is in NYC you can stand in line for 15-20 minutes but you don't have to worry about parking just finding a sidewalk to sit on. Whereas at this location you have to drive to this spot and here you have to compete with the Asian stores nearby or sit in your car until a space opens up. Therefore, I'd rather drive to a better Greek/Mediterranean place and pay the same amount elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp for the invitations! i went yesterday friday afternoon in their grand opening, since i was in the area & starving! So i ordered the combo plate with Beef Gyro & chicken both were tender & flavorful! You will get a lot for $9.99. Put some white sauce & a bit of their super spicy hot sauce (caution) and its party in my mouth! :) The place is quite small & at the hidden corner of Spring mountain near starbucks drive-thru but a great location tho. Definitely a must have complete protein meal when u're in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"I'd actually give it a 3.5 but I'll round up... the costumer service is really good and the staff is nice and helpful. The place is decorated nicely as well. As well as the food goes... I have definitely had better gyros and shawarmas around the area. The food is okay, nothing too special. I really wish the sauce was better since for me that makes or breaks the wraps and I find it really lacks flavor.  I will be back here though  just because there are not lots of Halal places near ASU."}
{"text":"I wouldnt even call this Mediterranean food. Your choices are lettuce, tomato, rice, chicken, falafel, gyro and sauces. That is it. Nothing else. They marketed the crap out of this plave online and I was thoroughly disappointed. 

There is one thing I pat them on the back for, and that is their hot sauce. They are not joking when they say it is hot. Got one tiny squirt on my food and I couldnt even finish. Neither could my companion. In fact I made him stop at the nearest gas station so I could buy a bottle of chocolate milk to make the pain go away. 

Completely regret going here but their sauce is nuts. Burns coming out too. If spice is your thing they are worth checking out for the hot sauce. Too bad they don't have anything palatable for you to put it on."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here 15 minutes before they close and Tiara was very friendly and welcoming! She went an extra mile to make our visit worth it! 

Shout out to Tiara! Thank you for providing us a great customer service experience!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! My husband got two combo platters and a chicken shawarma for take out the other week since we were curious about whether the hype was well deserved. 

First, the combo platter (mix of beef and chicken) was a great portion - good for two moderately hungry people. It also still managed to look great by the time he brought it home a bit over an hour later. It definitely tastes different from regular shawarma places but that's not a bad thing. I liked that this version of \"chicken/beef on the rocks\" included a mix of beef and chicken, as well as veggies along with the usual garlic and hot sauces. The veggies (lettuce and tomatoes) balanced the spice level of the hot sauce (that small amount packs a lot of heat!) and it's tasty when everything is mixed together. The downside is that it's around $14 with tax for this platter.

The chicken shawarma was just okay. It probably would have tasted better to me if I hadn't tried the combo platter first. It just didn't seem to have as much flavour as the combo platter and the portion was enough for me but definitely wouldn't be enough for someone who's super hungry and eats a lot more. There are better chicken shawarmas out there so I wouldn't recommended getting that from here - you're better off with the platter even though it costs a bit more. 

Overall, this place was worth trying! I would return again sometime in the future if in the area but likely just for the combo platter."}
{"text":"I ate here and was sick within 20 minutes of leaving. Had to miss work, and almost crashed my car trying to get out of traffic due to the fact I got sick while driving."}
{"text":"I, like probably many others, was really excited to try out this place. But oh boy what was I disappointed. I had read all the great reviews about this place and was expecting the food to taste like I had tasted it in some countries around the Mediterranean Sea. It was like one reviewer described very BLAND. Nothing worth to make the trip back to this place. There are several places in Tempe that have the same kind of food which come closer to the taste profile of how this kind of food should taste. 

However two positive things that are an important part of the whole dining experience is the level of customer service and the cleanliness of the place. This place excelled in both. That's why I gave them 2 stars. Unfortunately the food makes up the greatest part of giving them 3 less stars than what they could have gotten......"}
{"text":"In my travels I've eaten Mediterranean food frequently from all over. Eating from this restaurant left me feeling dissatisfied with the food quality. The service was good and the restaurant was clean. The food however was unsavory and lacked flavor. They do not carry tzatzki sauce because they tout an \"American Style\" of halals. I would not recommend this restaurant because it's less than mediocre."}
{"text":"A bit overhyped, but i guess it still looks like halal guys. Hands down, the NYC food truck is tons better. Perhaps its because I went right when it first opened so things were not really in tip top order yet but not sure if things are fixed yet. The restaurant itself is nice and spacious so its quite comfortable to dine in if you're not too busy. Parking is steep though so make sure you take public transit!"}
{"text":"Went here first time today. Arrived 11:30am. Only two people in front of me. Zero diners seated. I ordered a regular sized combo plate for here. Clueless employees could not figure out how to finish prior person's transaction on cash register. 3 employees & nobody bothered caring several food orders were sitting getting cold, including mine. At 11:48am I walked out & let them keep my cold meal still sitting on their side. TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES & MANAGEMENT PLEASE, Or you won't be in business long."}
{"text":"Trying this restaurant for the first time. 
The halal chicken is imported from Minnesota.
The halal gyro beaf is imported from New York.
This chicken sandwich is delicious.
Always put the white secret sauce in your meal.

The staff are really nice and they do a great job.
Worth trying. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"The place was pretty good! I had gyro a couple of times from gyro time in baker. And the place was way better. I had the combo plate., hummus, and the baklava. Everything was great the prices aren't bad. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Menu is basic and easy - you go down the line as they put together a bowl . It's a ver healthy portion , like the size of a pie . White sauce is delicious as well as the bowl . You must love hot hot hot sauce to have it slathered on the bowl . If you're not sure ask for it on the side - it is hot ! Also ordered the hummus ..delicious ! 

They are a few tables inside and out . When I went it was constantly packed . It's open late too for those late night munchies . I'd definitely be back ! 

Staff was very nice and willing to explain the bowl,etc. if you are unfamiliar with this type of food ."}
{"text":"Super yummy fresh food, employees were very friendly! Love that they stay open so darn late!!! Hot sauce is damn HOT tho!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after seeing so many good reviews and plus it's right next starbucks. I got the combo platter which comes with chicken, Gyro, red rice,salad and Naan. The meats were juicy however the rice was sort of dry. Only reason why I'm givin9 g them 4 stars is because when we went we spent almost our lunch break waiting for food and didnt have tine to eat. There was only 3 people working and the inside was pretty packed. Tables were dirty since nobody had time to clean. Would go again, probably not during lunch though."}
{"text":"Having been a frequent customer of the truck on 6th Avenue in NYC, I was so excited to see a local Halal Guys here in AZ!  It took me quite a while to finally get there.  I was very happy with my to go containers.   Very tasty, very good, I will go back.  However, there is such a huge distinction between the food truck, which is so much better than the storefront.  I think the food truck is better because the food is served directly off the flat top grill.  At the store, apparently, the food is cooked and then served out of warming trays.  That makes it lose texture a bit, as well as temperature.  But I'm still a happy customer.  Thank you Halal Guys!"}
{"text":"combo platter very good. first fine eating and very impressed. would definitely come back again for the amazing chicken and beef"}
{"text":"Im debating between 2 or 3 stars. But since the place provides a great customer service, which is one of the essentials for a customer to come back, I will do 3. Thats one positive thing. Another thing to consider is the good flavor/taste of the chicken and beef gyro. The white sauce compliments it, big time. The platter was good too.

Now, comes the Hummus, the Baklava, the Fries. I get it, not the main menu entry but I don't get how you can make Hummus so simple and bland. The Fries was even the same. Simple and bland. The Baklava - the only dessert they have yet tasted like it was old. I can get a better baklava at a middle eastern store. Dont waste your money buying one! Unless they improve it. As you can see, few other yelpers said the same thing about baklava.

UPDATED:

Wow! I thought there would be an improvement after seeing reviews of how bland, tasting like cardboard and old the BAKLAVA is! But no, its the same piece. Such a waste of my money! I gave it another try thinking my review and other customers would change a thing but this place can care less."}
{"text":"Just like home in NYC. So happy they're here in Vegas! Super friendly staff and the food was awesome as expected."}
{"text":"Perfection topped with loads of white sauce."}
{"text":"I love this place. I order delivery from them all the time. However, they are so SKIMPY. 

If you want extra hot sauce. Don't bother. Even if you pay the $.49 for the extra hot sauce. You only get one per order.  It is the one thing that constantly annoys me about this place

Other than that. The portions are good and the meat is extremely flavorful one platter can last me two meals.

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Had a food poisoning after eating their stuff, we were working late in the office and ordered 3 platters from foodora, we all experienced different level of food poisoning reaction later that night and the next day. Avoid this restaurant. :x :x :x"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better food choices inside Caesar's Palace. The service was really fast despite a line of about 10 people. (Next door Smash Burger customers seemed to be waiting for a while.) All the food is pre-prepared and assembled in front of the customer. The plate was very large and definitely worth the extra cost. I requested a bunch of sauces on my plate and they were included in the price. Friendly service."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I see people hype Halal guys on Facebook. I decided to try. The menu offers like 2 or 3 choices and that's it's. Food had no special unique taste. I prolly could have gone to any gyros place and get same or better. I was not happy with my food. Left me wondering why I ate this. Don't buy into the hype."}
{"text":"I was super excited to hear about this place opening up finally in AZ. After going there tho I changed my mind real quick. The rice was flavorless, the falafel was hard and dry, the salad was just lettuce and tomato and the only thing they had was hot sauce and a mayo sauce which barley had any flavor. I was super disappointed. If you want good Mediterranean check out Princess Market..."}
{"text":"Reminded me the first time I ate Halal Guy at the street of New York. It is a shame that they don't offer lamb gyro anymore but the beef is still pretty good. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Oh, dear. I'm afraid I don't have much good to say here. Well, I'll preface my review with this: a few days ago I had the opportunity to sample some of the food, given that employees were going around with small meals to let people try what they had. I liked what I tasted. It was a small platter with chicken and gyro over a bed of rice and a side of salad. It wasn't the best I'd ever tasted, but it was good. I planned to go there when I wanted something quick and reasonably priced. 

Today I tried their sandwich (by the way, why call it a sandwich when really \"pita\" better describes it?) with a side of fries. I was excited because it looked good, and heavens, was I let down. The meat was a bit crunchy and chewy and there was something wrong with the seasoning. Too much salt? Too oily? Both, maybe? I'm sorry I can't exactly put my finger on it, but I just couldn't finish it. Usually I'll still eat the pita bread if I can't eat the meat, but it was covered in oil and I couldn't even finish that! Sadly the word that comes to mind when thinking of the gyro sandwich is \"gross,\" I'm sorry to say. The fries were far too salty. Period. I got a third of the way through them, had to give up, then downed a full bottle of water after to dilute the saltiness. I've got a big appetite and was still hungry, but I just did not want to touch anything else. Then I started feeling nauseous. BAD. Nausea's never a good feeling, but when you're about to start a shift at work like I was, that's particularly worrisome. Thankfully I didn't throw up, but I was damn close. I'm not sure if I'll be able to eat a full dinner tonight since my stomach is now quite mad with what I just put into it. I mean, hell, the only other fast food restaurant that can make me that sick is Taco Bell! 

The service was quite good, though, hence the two stars instead of one. People were very accommodating, friendly, and helpful. One could tell that they hadn't worked out a sort of teamwork groove, as there was some confusion about where some orders of fries were going, but that's to be expected in a new place, and they tried their best to make sure they got it right in the end. It's a shame the food did not match their level of service. I will not be stepping foot inside this place again. Sorry, guys!"}
{"text":"Service 4* Food 3.5* Ambiance 4*
Waited 20 minutes to find out about all the rage about THG. Overall, service was good all things considered. Ordered chicken & beef sandwiches and the beef/chicken platter. Everything's fresh it was pretty good, but not worth the hype. 
Hot sauce is extremely hot. White sauce is good but gets to be too much. Clean dine in area. 
It's worth going to if convenient or in the city. 
Best sandwich place -  Pita and Grill on Derry/Hurontario. It's a 4 because I think there's better places then this."}
{"text":"I was so hyped about this for months before it opened and it def lived up to my expectations. Been quite a few (a lot of) times since the opening and the food is incredibly amazing. What it lacks in variety, it makes up for in taste. This is definitely the new go-to shawarma place for me. However, the price is a bit more than other places. I recommend the sandwich over the plate cuz in my opinion, the plates are quite small and not worth the price difference from the sandwich!

Disclosure: never went to the original Halal Guys in NYC so idk how it compares to that, but it is amazing all the same."}
{"text":"This place had So much hype upon opening and I was pretty excited because I love Mediterranean food. I'm actually pretty bummed to say this but I was not impressed in the least bit. I did order from UberEATS which came within 20 minutes of ordering and the food was still warm so that wasn't the issue. The issue was the food had zero flavor. I ordered a regular combo platter and half the platter was lettuce....... the rice was undercooked, still hard and had no flavor. The portion of chicken and beef was really small so I was left with undercooked rice and an ton of lettuce. The best part of the meal was the white sauce which was what made this meal edible. However I will warn you the hot sauce is HOT. I'm someone who eats hot sauce on everything and this sauce Is almost unbearable, good but really spicy! Sadly The Halal guys did not live up to my expectations and was seriously overpriced for what your given. I'm willing to try them again and hoping it was a fluke night but damn I'm disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is definitely real deal middle eastern type food on the quickness. The portions are more than enough to satisfy your hunger, even the small is pretty damn big. The combo, is the best bet to try just about everything they have.. and the sauces are superb. I especially enjoyed the white sauce, the hot was hotter than expected and should be used in moderation. All employees were on point and helped us out alot with our questions being it our first time here. 2 thumbs up and I'm glad these are popping up more and more."}
{"text":"Halal Guys was decent. This chain sells basically fast food Middle Eastern dishes. The menu is limited to chicken, gyro and falafel as your base to go in either sandwich or platter form. 

I went with the small size falafel platter. Half of it was filled with iceberg lettuce salad, and the other half was filled with seasoned rice. 4 small falafel pieces were placed on top along with a few pieces of pita triangle. You have your choice of add ins (I added onion, jalapeno, and olive) and you will also have your choice of white, hot, or BBQ sauce. I went with white and hot sauce. 

Overall, I wasn't too impressed. For $8 I would have liked something additional to go with the pita triangles, such as a scoop of hummus or baba ganoush. The falafel pieces were pretty small, rock hard on the outside, with a slightly moist filling. The falafel looked mass-produced as if they came from a mold since they had more of a gumdrop rather than spherical shape. For a platter filled only with inexpensive salad+rice with tiny falafel and few pita triangles I think it was definitely overpriced. 

My husband had the gyro sandwich which he said was pretty good. The gyro meat didn't look like your typical thinly sliced meat from a spit. It was more like small chunks of meat, and he said it was well seasoned and tender.

As for the sauces, I liked the white sauce with its mild creamy flavor and the red hot sauce packed quite a punch! 

If I go here again I'll skip on getting the falafel and will probably try one of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Never tried this type of food before ....was blown away by the flavors.  That white sauce ! We stayed at C 5 nights and ate here 3 times. So good and a good value for Vegas. I saw families share the platter."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out. I got there and not 1 employee could be found it literally took like 8 mins until someone came out. That's alright I'm craving some middle eastern food and I can't wait to scarf this combination plate down (chicken and beef gyro with rice)...And than the let down the food has 0 flavor, the \"world famous red and white sauce\" which is watery Thani sauce and sarachi are the only flavor to mask the taste of the greasy grill that the chicken has taken on. Save your money, if you have never had middle eastern food this would make you hate it. Stay away. Too bad, perhaps my expectations far exceeded me....the only saving grace was the free baklava I got from yelp when I checked in....."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here, (the day after Eid how ironic) and oh my it was definitely worth the drive! I came from Ajax. I'm a person that can't handle spice. If you're that type too, even one line killed me. Steam is coming out of my ears as I'm writing this. 5/5 for me!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good so I'm sad to write this review. Really like the chicken. I have been here 3 times but this last time wasn't a good experience. They are really stingy now with the portions. $10 for rice and iceberg lettuce and when I asked for a touch more rice, they said no. Huh? I guess the nostalgia of them being newly opened is gone and it's time to cut portions. There wasn't a soul in the place at 7:30pm, u would think they would want to get rid of the huge pan of rice they still had there. Don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"The Chicken and Rice did not disappoint! 
The white sauce was so yummy.
I've never been to the halal cart in NYC so thank you for finally having one here in LV!!!!"}
{"text":"Hadn't had Halal since my last trip to NYC so I was super excited to find this at Caesars Palace. I was not disappointed! Delicious food--I had the combo platter-- and great service. Take it easy on the hot sauce. I love spicy but totally underestimated it."}
{"text":"I'm from NY and have had it there a million times. So I'm ecstatic that this place finally opened in LV! I was so thrilled I came on grand opening day and the food is amazing still, thank goodness. Must go here as many times as you possibly can lol."}
{"text":"This place is great! I got the combo plate and oh man was it good! The hot sauce is no joke! Use it little by little!"}
{"text":"I thought the falafel was excellent. It was light and not too greasy. The toppings were ok--I wish they had more options like Jerusalem pickles. I took issue with the service. I visited with my two children and they split a small chicken platter. They liked it very much but there was a lot of waste. I wish they had a small kids menu. Here's where I took issue: I asked for water for my kids and they gave me open plastic cups. I requested a paper cup like the one I had paid for and gotten for myself. They said no. I explained that my kids (2&3) would spill in the flimsy plastic cup. They still said no. So I gave my kids water and they spilled. The employee was exasperated with us and had a nasty attitude about having to mop it up--um, I tried to be proactive and prevent that exact situation but apparently saving 8 cents on a paper cup is more important. 

This isn't really a family friendly restaurant. Too bad though, the food is decent."}
{"text":"menu is nice and simple.  a few things to keep in mind:

this is not Boustan. it is different from Boustan. if you want Boustan, go there. don't go here and then be mad that it's not Boustan.

when they say the hot sauce is really hot --- believe it!!! 

the plates/assiettes come in two sizes: \"small\" and \"regular.\"  This is confusing for some people, as it turns out: one guy was angry that he got a \"large\" when he asked for a \"regular.\"  I found a small to be good for lunch.

1/3  to 1/2 your plate will be salad. this is good! salad is healthy."}
{"text":"I love going here, it's a great reminder of my New York travels, the flavor is very close to what I remember having in New York. The flavors on the beef are amazing, & the service is always amazing and friendly. I eat here at least once every two week & I've never had a bad experience here. I'm not sure where all these mediocre reviews tend to eat their food at but this is certainly worth the drive from my North Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"The combo platter was awesome. Topped it off with red & white sauce. Highly recommend to anyone looking for dank food. Angel was really fast making our plates and super friendly. Top notch service fosho."}
{"text":"If you're craving that NY Halal Guys, this is it. Just as good as the trucks in the city. It's a little greasy and heavy but if that's what you're looking for, it's great!"}
{"text":"First time here so I was excited to taste what all the hype was about.  I ordered the combo platter so I can try the chicken and gyro.  It came with lettuce, rice and tomatoes.  Pretty good size meal for $10.  It comes with 2 packets of their white sauce and 1 hot sauce.  I also ordered baklava.. I love sweets!  The gyro meat was tender and flavorful without the white sauce.  Their hot sauce is definitely HOT. The chicken, for the most part was good, but it had dry chunks as well.  After a few bites without the white sauce, I decided to try some of it.  It was pretty good.  Added that \"umph\" to the meal.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the hype that's been going on throughout social media. And unfortunately, I am extremely disappointed. 

MENU:
Meats - chicken, gyro, combo (chicken and gyro), and falafel. 
Small or regular. Platter comes with rice and salad. Choice of onions or jalape√±os. 
Sandwich options. 

PRICING:
8.99 for a small, 9.99 for a regular. 
7.99 for sandwiches. 

QUALITY/TASTE:
I ordered a regular combo with chicken, rice, salad, and jalape√±o. And there was no flavor to anything. The rice and chicken tastes bland. Yes, I poured the white sauce and hot sauce (which is really spicy, btw) and nothing really helped. Also, the white sauce tasted more like ranch sauce with a million calories. The hummus was also nothing special. I've made better tasting hummus in the kitchen. My friend like the baklava. And the crinkled fries were literally the best tasting thing there because it was made to order and salted. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
The employees were nice and helpful. 

Overall, I would not come back here until they learn to season their food correctly."}
{"text":"Good food, pretty average. Didn't knock my socks off. Only thing is that it's very convenient"}
{"text":"Ordered the combo platter without rice or salad- gyro and chicken meat only. Both meats are cooked to perfection! Highly recommend the white sauce; would skip the hot sauce, as the flavor stay in your mouth for a long time! The hummus is good- portion big enough to share with at least 2-3 people. I recommend ordering extra pita with the hummus, as they only give one piece. $8.99 for small, $9.99 for large. Sandwiches is also an option. Hummus $4.99. Bottled water expensive $2.49. Good food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"An average place.  I got the sandwich.   The girl handling my sandwich didn't even know how to wrap it.  Nothing really special that you can't get at other pita places.   Overpriced food and nothing great about it.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time I went had a decent experience.  Good portions and tasted relatively good.  Second time I went they skimped on the meat, gave me hard pita bread.   

No consistency with these guys"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Gyros, Hummus...etc.
I'm a bit disappointed with the halal guys, 
I ordered the small combo ...
My entire combo consisted of salad and rice and maybe I would say a fourth a cup or less of the meat on top of the rice and it was very small pieces and bits. I also ordered tahini on the side didn't taste like tahini.  
The salad was fresh tasted good. 
The rice ..hard and tasteless , didn't eat it."}
{"text":"Overpriced, low-quality food, not-knowing anything staff

The food is not authentic at all! The food doesn't look fresh either or clean.

You can get more tasteful food even from McDonald's steps away.


This place won't last."}
{"text":"Never had halal guys in NYC, so going in with no expectations. There was a 20 minute line but wasn't too bad. Food was good, mainly from the sauces. Meats were just about like every other place, nothing too special. The white sauce was very creamy, nothing like other shawarma places I've been to. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"The first time we came here was when they first opened. We loved it! (Especially their white sauce) but today, it was a little different. Idk if it's because it's not as busy anymore but their meat doesn't taste as fresh. As I was biting into a few bites, I would encounter a very dry hard piece. The flavor is still there though so I still finished my small platter. 
I'm totally down to give it another try (3rd time's the charm)."}
{"text":"Its great that they're open late but their gyro tastes mostly of bread crumbs with hardly amy flavor, their 'white sauce' really needs to taste more like tzatziki than mayonnaise, their rice is okay(can't mess rice up...), something I did like was their hot sauce. Great flavor BUT stupid spicy. Proceed with caution on the hot sauce... And their food in general. 

They also have bbq sauce... Wutthef@kchuck... Not exactly traditional. Their condiment choices are white sauce... Bbq sauce... And hot sauce.

Even when I ate here drunk, their food is seriously sub-par. Save yourself the trip is your looking for middle eastern/Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"@Halal Guys - Averrose N

I have just picked up 3 platter last week and i was charged for additional pouches of white souse. So, if giving 2 free pouch per platter is recently implemented policy within a week than i am happy.

You have not addressed the quality of the chopping of chicken. They are way larger pieces so I would highly recommend that if you can improvise in that direction as well. I also felt that Toronto location has recently started to GRILL the chicken pieces, it certainly add the flavor but large pieces ruin the taste. 

I Love Halal guys more than anything and i definitely would like you to be more successful , hence suggested my opinions. Please know that i am not UNHAPPY CUSTOMER who writes bad review , i am HAPPY CUSTOMER who would like to be MORE HAPPY If you can meet the expectation. 

Thanks,"}
{"text":"After a long day of travel the last thing I wanted to do was find something to eat. After purusing Uber Eats I came across Halal Guys and was looking forward to trying ever since I saw them on Munchies. I ordered the Chicken and Combo plates. The rice and chicken were definitely different than any halal plate I've had plus the white sauce helped kick some of the dryness. I'd steer away from having pita in the to go containers as they were very soggy by the time it was delivered. It just so happened that I ordered a side and they were very warm and delicious."}
{"text":"I usually love to eat at halal guys because the food is good and the service is quick. However, tonight's service was just not on point. It took us over 30 minutes to order and the line look unorganized and chaotic. Will I come back next time? It depends on how bad of a craving I have.

Update: right after I finished my post, we were compensated for the long wait. We received free drinks and extra items."}
{"text":"I have been to Halal Guys twice. I did nit review it the first time because I wanted to try more than one dish. I tried the beef bowl first. It was okay. 

They are not reluctant to pile on the food, but overall it was rather bland. They lost a star for the quality and flavor of the beef bowl. The rice was average. The white sauce was nothing yo rave about. 

The second time I went, I tried the Gyros. Again, the meat was bland. They put their white sauce on it instead of Tatziki sauce. That is not acceptable. They piled on the lettuce, very little tomato , onion, or cucumber. They lost a star for a second poor dish. 

Finally, the restaurant itself has very limited seating, the sauces are left out, exposed, and the tables are dirty. They lost s star for that. 

I will not be going back nor will I recommend it to anyone else. The food is just not quality."}
{"text":"My only other comparison is to the location in Long Beach, however, I actually think the food here was better. The portions seemed a little less than the one in LGB but they hook it up with two white sauce and let me tell you... the hot sauce is HOT - just a couple drops was good for me. I highly recommend a chicken or combo plate! The baklava here is also hella bomb. We got this postmated so we I have no idea how the service is but we placed the order at like 5pm and it didn't leave the restaurant til 6:30 so I am assuming they were a little slow. Other than that, portions are cool even though it's less than LGB and the rice was bomb. I'll definitely be back again when I need my Halal guys fix."}
{"text":"The bowl is tasty but the sauce is so amazing and unhealthy. Don't eat the hot sauce if you're not into spicy food."}
{"text":"I don't understand the low reviews and hate. Halal guys is delicious and my numbed one guilty pleasure food. Everything is fresh, tasty, and the portions are huge! Also, I'm always pleasantly surprised with how nice and friendly the staff is... and always accommodate requests for more if that spectacular white sauce. I'm actually writing this review while eating halal guys because I love it so much."}
{"text":"Couldn't  wait for them to open. What a disappointment. Unbelievably small menu. Ordered a gyro. The gyro meat was cut up like I had not seen before, the pita bread broke the minute it was folded, the white sauce they use is not like tzaziki sauce you've had before-it's this artificial al oily, ranch glop that was horrible. I can name 10 authentic places for middle eastern food that beat this bland menu on every front."}
{"text":"Great food. Almost tastes identical to their street cart in NYC. Definitely the best shawarma in Las Vegas. Service was excellent, weekend day staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Halal guys. I wanted something different and this place seemed hyped up by friends. 

We wanted to eat inside but since their a/c was broke we took it to go. My boyfriend & I both ordered a combo plate with chicken and beef gyro. I ordered 2 falafels on the side. 

The chicken was sort of dry and tasteless. The beef was really good. I loved the rice and veggies on the side. And the pita bread wasn't dry at all. The falafel had a good taste but it was definitely dry inside and probably needed some sauce. 

Speaking of sauce, the white sauce is a must !!! And if you like spicy, I recommend adding a couple drops of the red sauce. I loved the kick that it gave to my meal even though my mouth was burning at the end. 

Overall, the food was good but wasn't anything special or too particular. Would go back if I crave that food."}
{"text":"This place was nothing special.  The hype has already died down and there is no need to worry about waiting in a line.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good but its nothing special.  I won't be begging to come back but if a group of friends want to go I won't resist.

Halal Guys has a reward program that I laughed at when I read the details, you need to get 50 sandwiches to get one free.  Ummm whats the point?  Also the employees don't seem humble when they are working, management will need to figure something out to keep them afloat when they lose the new restaurant traffic.      

Return factor 50%"}
{"text":"Nothing authentic middle eastern food. Falafal was rock hard and found a hair in my platter"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the original in NY and after my visit to this location, I hope its a lot better than what we got in Toronto. 
I went for the combo platter since its their most popular dish. Waiting in line gives you a good view of their cooking process and I have to say, it wasn't the most appetizing thing to look at, with all the oil accumulating below and splashing around the flat top. Their logo is a turning spit but it appears the chicken and gyro are cooked using a different method (?). They were devoid of any flavour from spices or even grilling with the gyro tasting meat-like but with fillers and additives. 
The rice was fluorescent orange but had even less flavour than the meat. The platter comes with a side of \"salad\" - meaning just iceberg lettuce and a few pieces of tomato. The white sauce they squeeze onto the top tasted watered down but added the most flavour to the meal. I've heard the red sauce is insanely spicy and only asked for a little bit but actually wished for more while I was eating since everything was so bland. 
Portions are definitely small and you don't get what you pay for at all. There are so many better options just down the street charging way less where you can grab something in a fraction of the time you'll spend in line here."}
{"text":"The gyro and chicken combo platter we ordered was good. Portion size is good.

Staffs Jasmine and another girl are genuinely friendly. They pay attention to what you need or want. She asked if we're locals so I can get a discount. Appreciate that."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is no where near middle eastern type food. I'm not trying to be mean but the so called sauce they use for the gyros is freakin mayo! Disgusting! It actually gave me a stomachache and made my boyfriends stomach a bit achy too. The meat beef gyro is ok and rice is so so. I honestly wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I guess After having the authentic stuff back home in San Diego and the real stuff cooked for me by my boyfriend.. I guess I just have a spoiled pallet. I really was hoping it was good. Although the falafel was pretty good and so was the sauce it came with.So my two stars are for that. I really recommend you guys change that Mayo sauce, that's a heart attack waiting to happen. Very unhealthy:-/

As for the staff they were really helpful and friendly. But yeah it's not worth the money or my health. I'll be sticking to Niros. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, especially after hearing such good reviews from it's NY location. The staff here is very friendly and the portion size is pretty good. Food wise, I was expecting more but it tasted pretty average to me (even with their white sauce)."}
{"text":"I have had many regrets in life- not saying 'I'm sorry' to my loved ones, not talking to my first love after we broke up in 8th grade, the major I chose in college, moving out of WA state later in my 30's...but the worst regret I have is going to this restaurant. I will never go back to this restaurant chain EVER again. I was hurt after eating here. I've been to MANY Middle Eastern/Mediterranean/Greek restaurants and this restaurant chain is at the bottom of my list... at least I can say I TRIED this place (even a small sprig of cilantro on top of my platter would have given my review two more stars)."}
{"text":"Service was great, very friendly staff. Food was mediocre, didn't meet expectations. Their famous white sauce wasn't all that special. Portions weren't large for the price. The beef was too salty and the chicken tasted like it was boiled instead of grilled. The pita part of the sandwich isn't toasted (for those who like it crunchy)."}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews, the gyro was a bit mushy, the hot sauce was very hot, and the white sauce although tasty was kind of just smothered everywhere."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times & always have gotten it delivered.  The service was really friendly but it is loud in there, so they have to talk extra loud to get/hear your order.  I've tried the combo with chicken & gyro but I usually just get the chicken platter.  The chicken isn't dry & it's flavored well.  I'm the platter comes lettuce, tomatoes, rice & meat.  They also give you their white sauce and hot sauce.

Now, their white sauce is really good, it brings the platter together.  But their hot sauce is some next level spicy.  It's not like a Tabasco hot, it's like a Siracha hot x 10.  I literally take it put a little on a napkin put the smallest amount on the tip of my fork with each bite. Serious props to those who put it directly in their food!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about but when I came here to try some Mediterranean food. It wasn't really mind blowing to me. 

It seemed really basic with only a few items to choose from. I ordered a small combo which came with rice, vegetables, chicken and beef. For a dollar more you could get your money's worth for a bigger plate but I wasn't really hungry for that.

There was a few sauces you could put on your plate which be careful, the hot sauce is really hot and i also added the white sauce to blend the hot sauce to make my meal mild.

There was not really that many tables to sit and eat. The workers there was genuinely helpful and it did not take long to get our food. 

I wanna mention though there was a lady that was cleaning the table was very friendly and gave great customer service. When we was in line, she gave some recommendations and every time someone left the table she cleaned it up immediately and after we were done eating she asked how our experience was. 

Food was okay but the customer service was great."}
{"text":"First time we went here the line to get in was too long, so we decided to go back a week later. I don't know why people were going crazy about it. 

We had our food to go since there was only a few tables and it was full. 

The food was mediocre. For me it was too salty. I've had much better Mediterranean food in Vegas. The white sauce was like ranch dressing, but not as creamy. It was good though. 

Just a heads up the spicy sauce is spicy HOT!!! My husband and I can eat spicy, but I gave up. My husband ate his entire plate but he said the top of his had was itchy. I don't know what that meant but I know he can eat spicy. 

Service was very good, staff was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounding up to 4.  While I've never been to the NY version, this one did the job on a Saturday afternoon.  I got the combo with no tomatoes, and was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the rice and the meat.  At first glance the chicken looks boiled and kind of grey, but upon tasting it, was surprised by how flavorful it was.  The hot sauce tastes kind of generic, but the white sauce was delicious, being that I am a fan of any and all yogurt type sauces.  

The shop was clean and the sauces were in bottles on the side for your application convenience."}
{"text":"Clean and employee nice. The platter is a waste of money. Half of the tin is salad the other Mexican style rice. Then you get a couple spoons of what seemed to be processed Sysco cheap beef on top. No Lamb at all!? They had no onion, how can you have Gyro anything without onion? When he told me that there was no onion I said ok I need to wash my hands I'll be back. I thought that they needed to cut some onion but when I got the food there was no onion. Sauce in packets are basically poison, it has soy, high in sodium and other chemicals which I assume their entire menu does. Hot Sauce is no joke, like Thai food make your head sweat hot goodness. $2.69 for their 16oz soda? They need to check their food quality and prices."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best halal restaurant in town. Gyro Time,  held the standard for their gyros, but the location has always been an issue.  Along with the question - \"is it halal?\" In spite of the lack of lamb, the gyros at Halal Guys is fresh, tasty and huge.  The abundance of white sauce is the reason to dine on location.  I've noticed the number of take-out orders going out the door doing my visits, a sign that this must be a place to be. The food staff is extremely friendly and cheerful. Too bad they aren't allowed tips. I think that I'm going to make them all some cookies for the holidays.  The Women's bathroom is clean and spacious.  Enough room for my dog's stroller and my wide end. The dining area is another issue, obviously most people don't know how to eat gyros. Especially,  the crowd that comes in from the competition,  they are slobs. I hope no one else is in the store when they come in, it's a nasty scene.  No shade on Halal Guys or staff."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. The first time was really good but every time since then I got sick. Managers are oblivious to customer complaints. I got a combo meal with 2 big bones in them (the size of quarters) when I paid $27.00 for 2 combo plates and 2 small drinks. Nobody answers the phone, and you can't leave a message. 

I can't believe this place was allowed to open without AC in July and August in Vegas! Now they have signs up saying they will replace AC units next week! Signs have been up longer than that! Employees are not getting breaks and I heard a manager - Rene screaming at employees! I saw 4 quit at once. Not cool! Get it together! Employees are friendly despite the hostile, HOT work environment. Customers pay attention to how you treat your employees! This is why I refuse to shop at Walmart. 

I don't like the china town location either. Hot and too small so getting food to go is the only logical option. I have to agree with Rachel F.'s review. 

Maybe I'll try again in the future but there are so many other places I will go first that have AC!"}
{"text":"Whether in Cali or Nevada, Halal Guys is the way to go. Here in Nevada, they let you squirt all those sauces yourself to your heart content!"}
{"text":"I loved it and I feel addicted.  This is not the typical white sauce from the usual Mediterranean places, so it is a different taste than what you may expect.  However, it is delicious.  I prefer to dine in so I can have as much as I want.  

Heed the other reviews, that tell you the HOT SAUCE is HOT..  Did I say HOT..  One little tiny dab is deadly.  

Somebody please take me back to Halal Guys today and everyday. 

Don't forget the Yelp check in for the free Baklava"}
{"text":"Come here sorta often, probably too often, but I just can't seem to get enough of this place.  I have only ever had the gyro platter, or the combo chicken and gyro platter and they are STRAIGHT UP AWESOME!  I think they put a chemical in their hot sauce cause I can't seem to get enough of that either.  BTW, their hot sauce is no joke, it will hurt you if you're not careful. 

Reason for 4 stars and not 5 is based on two reasons. The first and most important is that I drove 50 miles from home round trip to come here for takeout so my wife could try it, and once I got home and started eating, I found a big nasty gross pubic hair in my chow. I showed my wife and she confirmed this is what it was. It did put a bad taste in my mouth for awhile, and I don't think she'll ever come back. The second reason is because for there itty-bitty ketchup-sized sauce packets are like $0.61.

Overall one of my favorite places, even though it's a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Finaly made it but really was not satisfied, maybe my expectations were too high ? Maybe if I expected the same food as @ Halal Guys in NYC then i truly was not at the right location .. Having visited the location on a friday night the meat and chicken was just rewarmed and very dry .. Tooo much rice compared to the amount of protein, i was just left eating rice and hot sauce at the end :(! Would i go back ? For sure in NYC :)! But glad i went myself to try it out"}
{"text":"I ordered the combo plate with gyro and chicken, I've never had Halal guys before and didn't know what to expect but the flavors were on point. Both chicken and gyro were juicy. The white sauce that goes on top, compliments the veggies and rice. I even like the burn-your-face-off-level hot sauce. 

Didn't have to wait in line since I came on a slow day, overall it's a decent place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food every single time! The hot sauce is seriously nothing to mess around with and it's rather addictive. Absolutely love this place. Regardless of the location you go to you get fast and friendly service. And the food is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Great portion of food and amazing quality! The chicken platter is the way to go. Decent food for the price. I could eat this everyday"}
{"text":"Idk why it has 3.5 stars, this place satisfies man. Been a fan of the halal guys since I tried it in NYC back in 2012"}
{"text":"This is one of those looks better than it is restaurants... made me sick. it could have been that it was hotter inside the restaurant than it was outside.. and so eating hot food.. plus the hot sauce that is doesn't taste Mediterranean at all.. its just hot! and I like spicy but I've had Habanero sauces that aren't as hot as this sauce.. the tiny water cups didnt help either.. its like 4 ounces.. luckily the only food that was even a little hot was the rice.. the pita bread was cold.. falafels were cold.. wasn't worth 10 bucks.. not even close.. I am so sad i spent 10 bucks on this food.. although I'm not hungry, my craving for good food is still there... so..

also be advised seating is almost non existent.. if you have a party with more than 4 people you will have to get it to go.. there was only 12 or so customers and some of them were wating for a spot to open up. if you just have to eat here i suggest you call in an order and get it to go... if you want far superior mediterranean food i would suggest you go to Philly Steak Express on Fort Apache.. they make the food fresh there.. Halal guys make it before hand and it sits... and gets cold... won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is one of my fast food places to go. Quality and taste is absolutely perfect. Everything is flavorful plus the staff is fast and friendly. I am never dissapointed."}
{"text":"We've only ever ordered through Uber eats, and the delivery package is always garbage.  They forget sauces and don't close lids properly. Which is unfortunate because the food is to die for! 
 I wouldn't say the takeout part is ubers fault mainly because the establishment wraps everything up for them prior to pick up. I find they just aren't careful. See picture. 

This little resto is based off the NYC food truck, which is one of my favorites when I visit. That being said I was so excited when they opened a location in Montreal and it's just as good! 

I haven't been to the restaurant yet but my boyfriend and I order delivery from there far to often. 

If you like spicy food, you need to try one of their mixed plates! SOOO GOOD! 

Will attach pictures on next order!"}
{"text":"Just had my first halal guys experience. Meh. Not sure what the hype is all about. Mzaar down the street is way better in my opinion. Or ghazale, or many other shawarma type places all over the city. When I first heard halal guys was opening here, I had doubts, since we already have awesome shawarma and greek joints here. My intuition was right. Just goes to show how good our ethnic food in Toronto is, compared to most cities. Maybe the NY original is better than this one, but whatever."}
{"text":"Service was basic but employees were nice. Very simple menu and decor to match it's food cart roots Layout similar to a Quiznos. Food was nothing thrilling though, I've had much better gyros for better prices. The food was cold and the meat was cut up in small pieces instead of strips as typical which made it more difficult to eat. I won't go there again, spent $35 on two gyros and some rice with beef and a side of baba ganoush and it just wasn't even close to worth it. Baba ganoush was inedible, took one bite and had to spit it out."}
{"text":"This place is really good if you love mediterranean food. The service here is also amazing!!!"}
{"text":"What was the most memorable part of this expedition to Halal Guys? Actually it was their hot sauce! Somehow they made it actually kind of hot! I was thankful for that. 

Pricing is a bit more than I would have liked it to be. It's $8 plus tax for any of the entr√©es. There are some solid toppings to add as well: onions, olives, bellpeppers, jalape√±os, lettuce, tomato--all making a full spread that can combo off of each other in some way (minus the onions because I feel they overpower the others). I didn't go with any of the regular sauce as I wanted to really sample the gyro and chicken meat as I got a combination in what they strangely call a sandwich. Clearly going for a more deep-pocketed demographic, promoting taste before volume in a competitive market.

Overall: service was solid; portions were small; hot sauce was wonderful; inside was clean--overpriced by $2 for the portion size.  

*I'd go back to try a few other items on their menu .*"}
{"text":"Been here a few times after since my first visit. . 
Last time I came the rice tasted old.  Texture was off.  I asked for white sauce and the girl working covered the whole bowl with sauce. I had to tell her to stop because it was just too much!  
Also,  I've been getting it without the salad because its just cheap filler.

I had leftovers from my last visit which I never got around to eating because I was grossed out by the old rice and the sauciness. 

I think next time I'll go to chickpeas..They have better quality meat,  rice and salad and the portions are double for the price."}
{"text":"Very good chicken, but the meat was alright! Very small menu but overall good chicken."}
{"text":"Location was in a unit complex just outside a Walmart on the corner of a major intersection just south of the 60 at Stapley. There's a lot of other restaurants and shopping around the area, which makes it a convenient stop. 

It was more chain restaurant than I initially though. I thought it would be more independent or authentic but felt it had a \"Five Guys\" meets Middle eastern food. 

Inside, the menu is pretty straight forward. It's either chicken, gyro, or falafel in a Pita or a bowl with toppings and sauce. I got a bowl with half gyro and half chicken. The bowl comes with rice, lettuce, tomatoe, and a few pita slices. I added the onion and olive with EXTRA white sauce. 

The food was pretty good! It wasn't dry and I thought the portions were a good size. I enjoyed it a bit more after I mixed everything together and enjoyed it that way versus separately. I think having it in a pita would have been the best choice (although you get more in a bowl) maybe adding a whole pita to the side instead of the pita slices. 

Overall, I enjoyed the food. I wouldn't be begging to go back everyday but it was a good, different stop and I would return again!"}
{"text":"There's only so much rice and chicken that I can actually eat, until I get sick of it. 

I was super excited about going to Halal Guys! I've heard about this chain based off in New York and how people were raving about how good the chicken and rice combo is. When I got there, it was clean and kinda set up like a fusion between Chipotle and Five Guys. 

I got the Large chicken and gyro combo and they definitely give you pretty reasonable portions here! You are able to choose some additional condiments to add to your rice plate, as well as if you want to add a sauce to it. Of course they recommended to add the white sauce, which is a fusion between a plain yogurt and ranch dressing. 

The plate I got was good. There wasn't anything to \"rave\" about when it came to their chicken though. You can seriously get some more flavorful chicken at places like let's say Panda Express of Yogi Grill. The basmati rice was good, however by itself is a little bland. That's what the sauce is for. 

Overall, I'm most likely not gonna come back here for awhile. Service was excellent, however the kind of Mediterranean/Greek influenced style food was alright. I feel I can get better tastes of gyros and stuff at actual Greek restaurants etc. But then again, maybe I just don't crave this kind of food!

Tips
1) Dont get too much of that red hot sauce!!!! It's super spicy! You will suffer if you put too much on your rice
2) get a normal rice plate, should definitely be enough to fill you up"}
{"text":"Someday when I'm taken as a war criminal in Greece for daring to love the daughter of a Spanish Lord, before they line me up against the wall to face the firing squad I will make but one request.... a regular combo platter with no rice, loaded with white and red sauce. Come to think of it I think that was the plot of the movie Our Fault in the Stars. Either way, if this was my last meal on earth I would be just fine with whatever. i cant recommend this place to anyone enough. Avoid around noon."}
{"text":"I guess if I were to get this food from a truck on a street in New York I'd rave about it (either that or New Yorkers are easily impressed - which may be the case.  They do like the Jets).  But the food I had was at best OK. Limited menu (reflecting their food truck roots).  The set up is similar to Chipotle (but without the food poisoning ;)).  Very limited seating, but the counter seats have several outlets for charging phones and tablets (that's a nice feature).  Parking is kind of tight, but that's nothing new in any of the shopping centers on Spring Mountain.  

Would I go back?  Only if a friend wanted to try it.  Would I recommend it?  Sure, it's not bad, just not great."}
{"text":"The Halal Guys came to Montreal! Of course, this was a big deal and I had to try it ASAP. I had the large chicken and gyro plate for $13.50, which is $3 more than the Boustan's chicken shawarma plate. The flavours were on par with Boustan's and the meat was slightly better seasoned. To be honest, I'm not sure if I'd come back here because I'm having trouble justifying the fact that I'm paying 14 bucks for a shawarma plate."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly and the place is clean other wise I'd give a star less for the food. The gyro sandwich had the worst gyro meat. It must have been sitting in that steamer basket for two days and I came at a normal time of 12:30 for lunch. It just wasn't fresh. It seemed like it was left over from the night before then refrigerated then reheated. Just terrible. I actually felt sick after eating it and had the worst aftertaste in my mouth. I should have sent it back but I hate wasting food and just ate it. Regretfully..."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but just not what I was expecting. The shawarma and gyro both have an inherent fast-food quality to them. I was hoping for a wrap that would be fresher, lighter and  less oily. The food is tasty, but the sandwiches are a little overdone, too much sauce, to fatty and really heavy. All that being said, it's pretty tasty stuff."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this location, stopped by around 6:15 pm and got a beef gyro. The employees were great, quick and efficient which I appreciated. The first few bites were good but then I experienced what a few other reviews mentioned: rock hard pieces of beef. I picked it out and took another couple of bites only to experience more hard pieces. If they didn't have those hard pieces the food would be great, the flavor was good and their sauces are good. I'm not sure if getting chicken will help you avoid the issue, but as of right now proceed with caution when getting beef."}
{"text":"Finally came here after the hype died down.. Food was ok, thought it would be better. It wasn't as great as the original location in New York, but the helpings are good and the service was quick so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. I had the combo platter which is the go to order in my opinion! Tip: ask for extra white sauce!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch today. Had my favorite platter half chicken & beef was delicious as usual... always a great place to eat...."}
{"text":"The dishes are not described so it's impossible to know what comes with the order. For $11 I ended up with a platter of mostly lettuce and tomato, 3 pieces of falafel, small pita, and hummus. No rice included with this plate. I guess I should have ordered falafel platter but how was I supposed to know? Not a good value."}
{"text":"Bad costumer service at this location been to a few ones 

One time they didn't have no chicken for about a hour 

Anther time the manager messed up on my order and blamed it on me 

Smh"}
{"text":"Ordered the combo platter with chicken and gyro and I was not disappointed! Love their white sauce! Be careful of the hot sauce because it's pretty dang spicy. So use it sparingly. Honestly our whole group has been ordering this everyday on our trip in Vegas. We are now on our fourth day lol So I'm pretty halal guy'd out, but that goes to show that it's pretty tasty. Whether you're eating it fresh or microwaving it later, it still tastes really good. I know we have to stop by again before leaving to take some togo to our friends and family. Definitely a must try if you're in Vegas! We've ordered from the restaurant as well as ordering from Uber eats and have been satisfied with the food ordering from both."}
{"text":"I honestly can say I was not impressed what so ever. I was so hyped by hearing word of mouth but damn what a disappointment ......the meat wasn't fresh off the gyro rotisserie and instead is was cooked in oil on a stove top. The floor in the kitchen was freaking dirty and disgusting....there was food all over the counter tops where the separation was suppose to be.....the only thing fresh was the tomatoes and lettuce. The gyro meat was sitting in oil and the chicken was chewy.....the white sauce was good but other than that something was missing, like spices wise."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with food, unfortunately they have nothing going for them when it comes to food flavor. They have great location in an area that is saturated with middle eastern restaurants and in my opinion they rank the lowest among the rest. coming from NY I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Food here is subpar, the beef is minced unlike the meat in NYC. Wanted to like this place as much as I like the NYC location, no bueno, garbage..."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I enjoy the food. Price is right too. I always visit Halal Guys in NY so very pleased they're open here now. There is often a line up which moves slowly. Not nearly as fast as the NY locations but I suppose it will speed up as staff get the routine down. Limited seating but I usually manage to find a spot. On Yonge just north of Wellesley (look for the line up!)."}
{"text":"Did this live up to the hype? Slightly...
-meat is good well seasoned
-rice is cooked nicely
-white sauce is amazing
However, I believe that their meat was overcooked. Some bits were too dry just like their pita bread. This location is tiny and can barely fit anyone inside the place. You'll have squeeze through everything. ALSO, BEWARE THE RED SAUCE. I underestimated it by added toooo much and lowkey died."}
{"text":"Love going here to remind me of when I would eat chicken and rice in New York City. I get the combo plate with gyro and chicken with white sauce and just a couple strips of hot sauce. 

Remember the hot sauce is HOT!! So start off with a little and add more if you need it. If you have too much, it might be too hot and you won't be able to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Not a fan.
Did not have good service.
Not a fav of this fast food Mediteranean restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd been to a few Places  before, which have been great, always good food and fun. Went along to this one with some family friends, to lunch . The place had a buzzing atmosphere and busy, probbably what you'd expect from a Strip casino 

The food was perfect, modest portions and speedy service which always makes for a better evening.

All 6 of us had chicken and gyros  and were very impressed, will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Been to the New York and Costa Mesa location and it's a personal favorite. Decided to visit this one and noticed a huge difference: no line! Odd...  so I got the combo plate and while the beef gyro was fresh they pulled the chicken from the back that was already cooked. And of course it tasted old and stale...it would be nice if we had fresh chicken. Anyway no wonder it's empty here"}
{"text":"Awesome stuff. Just like NYC!! Can't believe I could find the same taste of  New York in Phoenix! The chicken and gyro meat combo with the hot sauce and white sauce just amazing!!"}
{"text":"I'm a long-time vegetarian & love falafel sandwiches, which I've had dozens of times from restaurants around the country.

In the area already, I stopped by around 4:30PM on their grand opening day.   

They're located in a small strip-mall, and I was lucky to find a parking spot quickly -- I think after some of the \"buzz\" about this place ends, parking should be a problem, other than the lot being kind of narrow.

As expected for their opening day, the place was pretty busy, but thanks to their rather limited menu, I was in & out of there in about 10 minutes.   All the staff was very friendly, and I expect by now, they're probably better at knowing what's what.

I ordered two falafels, one with \"white sauce\" & the other with their hot sauce.   They were cautioning everyone that the hot sauce really is hot, and I'm very glad they suggested that they just give me a packet of it instead of them putting it on my second falafel!  

The falafel sandwich consists of 3 or 4 meatball-sized falafels on a bed of chopped lettuce & diced tomatoes, wrapped up taco-like by pita bread, and then with a small drizzle of whatever sauce you want (packets of extra sauce are 99 cents).

Not liking tomatoes, I got mine without.

The price for two was $17 something.  No drink or anything else is included.   It's not a scenic location, no ambience or anything else special inside the place, so maybe I'm just an old, cheap-bastard, but I find the pricing to be very high.   Remember, it's a falafel -- mostly ground chick-peas & lettuce (in fact. I think they put a little too much lettuce in, as a cheap 'filler' for the sandwich.  The pricing might be normal for NYC & would be for the LV Strip, but not the location that they are at.

Falafels have very little flavor.  Most places season them with paprika, garlic, onions or something, but this place doesn't.     Most of the other places I've gotten falafels at have onions that they add with the lettuce & tomato -- obviously, onions add a lot to the flavor.   This place doesn't, and seemed not to have onions at all.   The white sauce that came in my one falafel sandwich was just a very light drizzle, probably the equivalent of half a teaspoon-full.  Not enough, especially when the \"white sauce\" doesn't really have a lot of flavor to it...

Thankfully, as part of their grand opening, they have me two packets of the white sauce, and one of the hot sauce.    To give the falafel any sort of flavor, I used a whole packet of the white sauce, and it's just dumb that the white sauce packet is a 99 cent option, when the reality is it's a requirement to give the sandwich even a modicum of flavor.

Sadly, even then, the falafel sandwich from The Halal Guys was just OK.  Part of the reason it was even OK was simply because I hadn't had a falafel sandwich in a while.

Later on, I opened the hot sauce packet.  Many of us foodies are accustomed to sauces described as \"hot\" or \"spicy\" really being neither, but not only is the hot sauce here truly very hot, but it's also somewhat of a different flavor to it.  I'm glad I sampled the hot sauce via a drop in my finger instead of pouring it on my second falafel sandwich, because I don't really like the flavor (yeah, I know, but at least I'm being consistent...) & even if I did, it would have been a little too hot to eat when you've got to go back to work for a couple hours...


So the bottom-line for me is that due to lack of flavor, and also a lack of value for the price, I doubt I'll be back unless I have a falafel sandwich craving late at night -- it is AWESOME this place is apparently open until 4AM!!!   Hopefully that will last.

For the owner: I doubt you'll lower your pricing, so after the initial buzz dies, if the profits aren't matching your business plan, please think about including a small drink or bag of chips to bring better value to at least the falafel sandwiches!    Also how about more vegetable options (onions), to give some actual flavor to the falafel sandwiches.

Your lamb dishes might taste great & be a good value, but the falafels don't & aren't.  

I'm not happy to write such a review -- I was really hoping to find a great new falafel place that's open late, but for the aforementioned reasons, you currently aren't it for me."}
{"text":"It's the best place in Toronto for chicken and rice the pitas are super soft it's the softest pitas you'll have. The staff are really friendly and also hard working,epically during the open weekend. I hope there are more locations to come across Toronto like (Scarborough). I would perches a franchise if possible (If the price is right). If you do get a chance tho try the original in NYC it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best in its genre in the city.  Mops the floor with nasty-ass \"conditional pass\" Ali Baba or Villa Madina. Paramount is alright but grossly overpriced. Unless Montreal's Amir or Boustan come to town this is the place to beat."}
{"text":"Oh this PLACE!! Yeeeessss puulleeeaasssee! Delicious to a fault! Leaves you full & craving more!"}
{"text":"Edit: I now know why they do this - they are slammed! It wouldn't be fair to take an online order that would trump the long line of people out on the sidewalk! The GM, Nidal, was so helpful and let me know that they do offer Uber Eats, Yelp 24, Postmates and Door Dash. 

Food was fresh and my clients (I ordered for 12 people) were absolutely thrilled. 

I WILL BE BACK! 

First review: Two Stars- I am trying to get food from here but they don't allow you to order online or over the phone. You can either come in or use another ordering site. Seems crazy. Hopefully the food is worth the effort."}
{"text":"This place is phenominal.  I was hesitant about the food at first but so glad I decided to try it. I ordered a sandwich but couldn't choose between chicken or gyro the lady's at the counter put both for me and didn't charge me extra. The sandwich was packed with so much meat that two people could have eaten it. I was happy with my choice to try this place."}
{"text":"I just found this place off of post mates and decided to come in instead!! I'm so glad I did!! Everything was amazing from the greeting all the way to the food. Johnnie is so welcoming and kind! I'll for sure be back! Thank you for making my night !"}
{"text":"I ate the original from NYC branch (when they had lamb) and the taste and experience isn't the same. Even if there is a line up on the street or people eating on the side it just adds to the experience. 

There will be a line up (unless you go early) but service is fast. Although they offer a sandwich and a plate option, they are flexible with the sides (eg: no salad more rice or vice versa)

In terms of taste, i didnt actually enjoy the beef plate. The beef felt dry, the rice felt old, and the salad...tasted like salad lol. The chicken sandwich though did taste yummy. If anything I would probably stop by for th3 sandwich

If you havent tried this place then sure go ahead, but definitly try their branch in nyc as well"}
{"text":"Good food, always busy. The white sauce will kill you, but it's so good and the hot sauce will make you regret eating it the next day but can't have halal guys without it. Get the protein combo. The hummus is also pretty good. The meat tastes good but may be a little too greasy for some people. Line up moves pretty quick."}
{"text":"Came to try this place out after we were on our way back from vacation.. it was around 7:30 when we got there so we got there after the dinner rush.. I ended up getting the chicken/gyro combo which was pretty good.. I got the white sauce on top and put a little hot sauce on top.. the hot sauce was pretty hot and my mouth felt like it was on fire but it was still good.."}
{"text":"Simple menu, simple food.. I usually get the combo platter (rice,lettuce, tomatoes and ur choice of falafel or two of their meats) you can also add green peppers, onions, jalape√±os, olives and they give you two small pieces of pita.. they have a white sauce and super spicy red sauce.. both delicious and goes well together.. just beware for the red sauce it's super spicy.."}
{"text":"The Halal Gurs have great gyros! Generous portions. good flavor and good service! This was my first time here but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went in for the food, came out with great service! I was rushing to work ,stopped at Halal Guys then was meet with  Linda, who  served me with speed and efficiency while still composing a smile..thank you Linda for your service... will become a regular customer as-long as people like her work there ...also the food is great remembers me of my time in New York City"}
{"text":"So happy we stumbled upon this new location in the Caesar food court. Haven't had it since NYC and it was a pleasant surprise to see this. The line was long but totally worth it! I was concerned that it wouldn't taste the same as NY but fear not, it's just as amazing! 
The food court itself was always dirty so good luck finding a clean spot."}
{"text":"This place was busy with a line out the door but it moved real fast and we were able to get a seat inside.  Very good food though and very nice portions..i got the chicken and gyro platter with rice which was filling.  The gyro didn't have that punch seasoning that I'm use to on a gyro but it was still tasty.  Its worth a second trip though for sure..parking is a bit tight too with Dutch brothers next door"}
{"text":"Best customer service tonight by Johnnie! 
Locals get discount on your order! 
Also check in for free baklava!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but there are better placed for gyro in vegas. Very small and hot inside, so many people working but still somehow takes forever. Seems expensive for what it is. The late night hours are cool but honestly not the area I am looking to be in at 2am. Check out Sultan Grill in Summerlin or the Great Greek in Henderson for better gyro."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try The Halal Guys for ages but was hesitant because of the average reviews and I did not want to line up. Yesterday, I finally got the chance to.

What can I say about the experience except it was average. I ordered the small chicken platter and it wasn't terrible but it wasn't fantastic either. The chicken was a bit dry and bland. 

I felt it was a bit pricey for the portion size - $10 for the small platter.  For $1 extra you can get hummus or baba ganoush. Will I return?  Maybe."}
{"text":"My friend and I heard that this place opened up in LV and because there was so much hype about it.. We decided to try it out yesterday. We walked in and were greeted by very friendly staff. Because it was our first time.. The staff were extremely helpful with their recommendations especially warning us that their hot sauce is really hot. We had to get our food to go because the restaurant was extremely small and there were no available tables open. As for the food.. We were not too impressed with it. The small bowl I ordered came with chicken, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, and 4 pieces of pita bread. The chicken was dry and had no flavor. The white sauce helped with the dryness but it was just ok. The pita bread was thin and soggy. I love Mediterranean food so it was extremely disappointing after hearing the hype about this place. I probably won't be coming back again. There are much better Mediterranean restaurants in LV.  I gave this place three stars only for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"So I heard for a while this crazy awesome place The Halal guys was opening here in Vegas so I was interested, hearing so much about it over the years but never have been to New York to try it was finally  my chance to try when they opened here in Vegas yesterday. I wasn't even going to go on opening day having my son with me and all but I just so happened to have to go the that area of town so I decided to stop by and see how crazy the line was. The line wasn't bad at all and was shaded so I didn't mind. I guess the swag was gone coming 3 hours from opening at 1 pm but they had cases of ice cold water to cool you down in the heat. One of the promoters who was working the event even helped me with getting a room temperature water to make my son a bottle who later also helped me inside! Once we got inside it was another line but was pretty quick and they had tons of meat cooking and staff ready to serve up the large crowds. The line was wrapped around the tent once I got in so I was lucky to beat the crowd again. 

I chose the combo gyro platter to try both meats. Seating is limited and was taken anyways to I took it to go. Each order serves you two packets of the famous white sauce and one small but mighty hot sauce. I had cold water in my bag so I skipped the soft drink and didn't plan to stay and eat because tables and chairs were taken like I said but by the time I paid a table opened up for me and my son so we were able to sit down and enjoy our lunch instead of in the car which gave me a chance to feed my son to get a seal of approval. 

The rice didn't have too much flavor but was tender and soft. Of the beef and chicken, the beef was my favorite of the two but the chicken was very tender. Smother it in the white sauce and you're in heaven but be very careful of the hot sauce. I like spicy but it was super hot and I put a small amount on the side and tried before I poured all over my food. I'm so glad I did because man that sauce is no joke! Luckily I put some chicken aside for my son along with pita bread which he loved. Luckily one of the girls who opened the store asked me how I was doing (same one who helped me outside and helped me bring the high chair to the table) and I said I wasn't expecting the hot sauce to be so hot and had wished I ordered a drink but the line was just so Long and I didn't want to be rude and cut and she gave me her lemonade. As a mom with a child you appreciate the small things especially not making me wait in line again for a drink because when you have children everything is a tad more complicated. I don't know your name but if you're reading this I appreciate you helping me more than you know from helping me outside and helping me sit and bringing me a high chair in the midst of craziness and the busy store I appreciate more than you know! 

Staff was super nice and kept a great attitude through the busy chaos all day. Seating and parking is limited so I would recommend taking it to go or stay if you're lucky enough to score a table or barstool!

I heard a few people say on social that the beef was too minced and the original New York stand is way better but I can't compare as I've never tried. When the OG Halal guys is halfway across the country beggars can't be choosers and I'm sure this will satisfy your craving. They're open late and I'm sure will be a hip spot for all the party people as it's close to the strip but I'm sure they would've done great anywhere. Welcome to Vegas Halal guys!"}
{"text":"Since I didn't want to read the reviews and instead come to my own conclusions about Halal Guys, I did not see all the warnings about the hot sauce. We ordered a chicken platter and a gyro platter and proceeded to drizzle a pouch of hot sauce on each. WOW, our mouths were on fire.

Overall, the gyro (beef) platter was WAYYY better than the chicken one. The chicken was a bit dry and didn't have very much flavour. (This might have been the fact that I lost a handful of nerves in my mouth from the hot sauce by this point, but even then, beef all the way!)

The platters come with rice, shredded iceberg lettuce and some flatbread. You can add your own toppings (jalape√±os, olives, green peppers, onions for free.)

Overall, the Halal Guys was good but I don't think it's anything unique. You can find very comparable if not better platters at other middle-eastern restaurants.

If I ever do try The Halal Guys again, I know I'll be sticking with the gyro choices."}
{"text":"Greasy to the max, NO flavor, small portions for price!!! Staff didn't seem to enjoy working there either. So many other better places with higher quality ingredients for similar prices around town. Never been to the one in NY, let alone hear hear about this place. Looks like a wanna be Chipotle and McDonald's colors blew up inside."}
{"text":"When you go to chinatown and decided, tonight is not the night to get some chinese food. Lets try something else. So we stop by here and absolutely enjoy the combo meal. My wife trully enjoys her dinner and my kid absolutely love the pita bread and the chicken and the beef. Long story short, go try it for yourself. Its cheap, super good and friendly staff. Now how many times you go to chinatown and get a friendly service? Think about it people."}
{"text":"Over hyped, too greasy and over priced. Tried the wrap and platter and didn't like either. If you are middle eastern this is not what you would expect the white sauce tasted like mayo and ranch. Hummus was below average not worth paying extra. Red rice was crunch and flavorless. Would not recommend to an American or a middle eastern. Definitely not middle eastern food."}
{"text":"$10 for a bed of wilted lettuce and chunks of tomato with bad falafel. The 2 discs were seriously sooo fried and hard and crusty. Burnt flavor.

When an employee asked how we liked it, we told him kindly that the only thing I ate was the pita bread since everything else was not great. He said he was sorry but as this was my first time at Halal Guys, I wish he offered either another option or a coupon to try something new next time. 

Cant say Id return. Especially not for those prices."}
{"text":"Contrary to popular belief, the Halal guys is horrible. For anyone who actually knows what real Mediterranean food tastes like, this is not it. Totally Americanized and not that great of quality. The meat wasn't bad, but was strangely reminiscent of tacos. I'm not sure why the white sauce is what makes them famous, as it was literally just like some blend of mayo and ranch. I asked if they had tzaziki sauce, and she had no idea what that was and said that the white sauce was the same thing. It was definitely not a Greek yogurt and cucumber dip. Haha. 

Also, the prices are way too expensive for the mediocre quality. For two combo plates and a side of hummus, it was 27 dollars. And most of the plate consisted of iceberg lettuce , diced tomato and rice (Eg cheap filler). Their \"salad\" had no dressing and the service also was subpar. The cashier was nice but everyone else behind the counter was rude and didn't even get my simple order correct. the menu is so small. Definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"How lame. This place is nothing like the NYC cart. I ain't complaining though.  I am still paying for the small portions and higher price for a not so authentic experience.  It actually doesn't even taste very middle eastern either.  I like getting the combo platter with half chicken/beef.  My favorite sauce combo is white sauce + bbq sauce.  The red sauce is one of the spiciest condiments I have ever had, so be very cautious with this one.  Baklava is decent and not too sweet. Falafel is also pretty good too! The customer service is always excellent here. Never had to worry about long lines here.  There is limited seating, but usually no problem since I take it to go."}
{"text":"It was good but I can see why it will get addicting. The hot sauce was spicy and the white sauce was good too. Perfect for after you have had a few drinks. I would definitely keep going back for the 2 sauces."}
{"text":"I can't believe ppl are actually giving this place 5 stars. They must not have taste buds or something. If it wasn't for the white sauce and hot sauce there would be nothing to this. Also, watching them cook the chicken while waiting in line will reinforce being a vegetarian. The Falafel's were just ok and the fries are just a rip off. You want good halal? Go to Bamiyan."}
{"text":"Love the food! Have been coming to this place since it had opened. I eat halal guys  twice a week. Clean food and good service. Their white and spicy sauce is awesome! Even the falafel is fresh and crispy. Just a recommendation they should work on their meat quantity."}
{"text":"Love this place...they just need to warm up the bread. The Halal guys in S.F. they warm up their bread. I don't like cold bread. Otherwise everything else is delicious."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the food and the service has been great, I love the combo platter because you can put it together however you'd like. Some of the best halal food in the area."}
{"text":"Honestly, it does taste like the combo platters back on the East, just maybe a grade worse I'd say. Definitely not quite as good and I can't really point a finger as to why.

It is slightly more expensive and you don't get as much food but if you're craving Halal Guys type Mediterranean than this is a good spot for your fix.

Just keep your expectations low.

That said, the workers are SUPER friendly and the place is decently nice.

It's definitely a spot I'll re-visit after the club when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"First time trying this popular fast food chain in chinatown Las Vegas. Food was just good but nothing really special about this place. Love their pita bread. It's super soft and so good when dipping with hummus."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Yonge St and Wellesley St W in the Church Wellesley Village, right next to the Starbucks at the corner. No parking in the direct vicinity. 

[SERVICE] - 5/5
The staff were very friendly, they also came around with a bottle of white sauce and asked if we wanted extra sauce on our food. 

[D√âCOR] - 3/5 
Clean but nothing too fancy. The chairs and tables served their purpose. 

[QUALITY] - 4/5
Meats were tender, and vegetables tasted fresh. No complaints about dry meat at this place.

[ORDER] - 4/5
- Chicken & Gyro Platter (Regular Size) - $11.30: the star of the show was definitely the rich and creamy white sauce, which paired well with everything in the platter. We also got packets of hot sauce on the side to add some acidity and cut through fat from the white sauce. Orange rice was flavourful and addicting, and pita was soft and fluffy. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
I really liked the platter, but I think they put a little too much sauce (gasp!). Even though the sauce tasted amazing, I felt sluggish after the meal. Otherwise, I would recommend The Halal Guys for some delicious Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"FINALLY Halal Guys is in Toronto. I have always ordered it for delivery so I have never actually gone in person. It is essentially a shawarma burrito bowl and I am loving it. I always get the chicken plate. I haven't had the one in NY so I have nothing to compare it to. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great service the employee Johnnie was very helpful and has great customer service they need to promote that employee! I will tell all my friends about this place I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I work right down the street so I come here often. They have great low carb options.  Basically just ask for no rice or pita and you have a nice keto salad.  The white sauce is zero carbs and DELICIOUS.

I'm also a huge fan of spicy food and their red sauce is no joke.  It's actually hot even for me.

The staff is cool and very accommodating.  I go here all the time!"}
{"text":"If you've had Halal Guys off the streets of NYC then we'll you've already been exposed to this heavenly flavor!!! As a yelper I'm all about the experience so this small chipotle like walk through the with a middle eastern touch wasn't the same as stand in a line that seems endless to only get your food and go on about your business. Oh and let me not steer you wrong the chicken isn't the same. The point is beggars can't be chooser though guys... Drum roll it's a must try especially if you've never been!! 

Don't eat it without the white sauce. Don't knock it until you try it. Get it to go the seating is limited. Don't skip out on the hot sauce I mean it's really hot but worth it. I can't wait to go back once the lines settle down of course."}
{"text":"went here to grab a quick bite and the service was fast. however, i've had better when i got the combo platter from the actual halal guys stand in nyc.

i got the regular size for 11.30$ and it's enough for 1 person. came with salad, 3 pieces of pita bread, rice, and a combination of chicken and gyro meat. both types of meat were dry and salty. the rice had no flavour and was also dry. i actually enjoyed the salad and thr pita bread - they were both fresh. the white sauce was good in a way that it took the saltiness away.

if you're gonna get halal guys make sure it's from the original stand in nyc!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed by this place. Was really looking toward to it from the pics I saw online. When we got there for lunch, they weren't busy, but didn't have any gyro meat ready and took forever. They only serve beef gyro and chicken so how hard should it be to stay on top of things?? When we finally got our gyro combo, the meat was super greasy and overcooked. The toppings weren't anything to write home about. I also ordered hummus which was super bland even with added olive oil and paprika. The staff working was nice, but it was a very underwhelming lunch altogether."}
{"text":"The food was half assed, chicken was undercooked and under seasons the beef taste like hot dogs and the rice was just blah. Would not recommend at all"}
{"text":"This is an F -  Very serious!  Read below.
I NEVER GIVE BAD REVIEWS! 
I just walked out of Halal Guys, I didn't even order! 
I just watched them cleaning their floor, scraping grime off of the floor mats, then turning right around to start  making meals. Yes they are wearing gloves, but what good is wearing a glove that's been all over floor mats! Those mats collect soil, food, grease, salmonella and other contaminants! I watched the one fellow dive right into the meat \"pile\" , while the other started cutting off new gyro contaminating the utensils! 

Do not eat here! This is food 101. 
Wash your hands , and change your gloves!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a veggie meal which is what I had. The falafel was good enough for me to come back for. They have hot sauce that you want to be very liberal with and it is taste. Olives on point. I picked #B for the toubuli taster. Rice was not seasoned the way most places that serve this type of food. Service was A+."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is lining up for this place, but it is definitely not as good as the New York guys. We saw them just make the \"sharwarma\" and Gyro on the flat top. You'd get better Sharwarma from any of the other Sharwarma places around town, and would probably save you a few bucks too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in NY is Halal Guys, so my family and I were counting the days for the Tempe location to open.  We visited Halal Guys on Saturday for lunch and as predicted there was a line out the door.  It took about 30 minutes for us to order our food.  We ordered 2 gyro and 2 combination sandwiches.  We sadly were disappointed as the sandwiches contained barely any meet (not flavorful) and mostly lettuce.  They were also completely cold inside. I can't even compare the gyro sandwich to local Greek shops in the Scottsdale/Tempe area, as this was not like the gyros i have previously eaten at Halal Guys.  I hope this changes!  I don't mind paying more, but they need to get the recipe and quantity to be closer to the original if they want to compete in this market or use the Halal Guys name."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times. The food is good but for the price the portions are really small. I think what makes the food good is the white sauce. I've had better in the Bay Area but for Vegas this is a nice place to dine at. Well, not dine but take away because they really have limited seating. I just wish they would serve enough food to last more than a few bites. I would rather go to a nice sit down restaurant and pay a little more than come here.

If you go, just get the wraps/sandwich. It's a better choice then the bowl."}
{"text":"Overrated and underwhelmed...
I was so excited to hear that The Halal Guys finally arrived here in Tempe. I got a chance to try them out recently and was very disappointed. Although the staff were very nice, the food was just sad, sad, sad. I had a combo plate with chicken & gyro meet and both were very bland and dry. Their famous white sauce was lacking flavor too. Also the pita bread that came with the combo plate tasted staled. Only thing that somewhat impressed me was their hot sauce. It had real kick but otherwise the food was not tasty at all and portion size was very small for $9. If you want real tasty Middle Eastern food, check out Al-Hana inside Baiz Market Place. So much better."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma and Gyros Ive ever tasted I usually never finish a plate but I finished it, waited about 35 min in line today which is not too bad. but it was totally worth it. the restaurant is crystal clean and the employees were super kind. id totally go again. i just wish they'd open another location."}
{"text":"Maybe it was my fault...I heeded the warnings of previous posts about the hot sauce being too spicy so I only applied a few drops to it....But a few drops didn't add enough heat so I unleashed the packet that was included with my order...It made the whole thing inedible .
I tried stirring it all up thinking that perhaps it would lessen the heat but nah....Had to throw it out.
The white sauce?
I don't understand the hype.
I wish I had tzatziki sauce instead.
The only thing memorable about the sauce is that I don't ever care to eat it again.
The free baklava was delicious though.
That was worthy of bringing up the ranking to two stars.
I am not looking forward to the firehole that will leave me crippled."}

{"text":"Top quality mixed plate. 
Average customer service. 
High delivery fee. 
Certainly more expensive than the NY outlet but competitive pricing in terms of Montreal."}
{"text":"Very cool cafe style Mediterranean. The chicken and gyro were both very good and the rice was awesome. Load up on garlic sauce, it's super good."}
{"text":"I've tried The Halal Guys in the Philippines and it was a total disappointment. Finally, I got to try the first time in the US and it tastes way better. My mom would always tell me how good this place is when she went to New York back then. 

I'm a total fan of Middle Eastern food and their platters are worth the money. My personal favorite is the beef gyro platter and I was also able to request extra protein on my order."}
{"text":"If you've never had Halal Guys in New York City, then this place is just alright, mediocre at best. If you've had it in NYC, don't even try it. I'm not trying to be mean or harsh. It's the simple truth. Before it opened here, I craved street halal ALWAYS. Now that I've had Vegas' version (and yes I am local), I don't crave it ever because I rather just not have it until I can get it right from the big apple. 

I want to say it has to do with the preparation. When you order from the street carts, they throw it on their grill and you get your food nice and hot. Here, the meat is in warmers as if you're at Chiptole. It's simply not the same. The flavor is not the same. And if you're expecting your food to be drenched in the sauce as it is in NYC, it won't be.

Don't get me wrong though-- it's still better than other fast food places. It's just not up to par with the expectations the original street halal carts caused me to have. So I don't know if it's their fault or this branch's fault, but I wish it could be better. Super anticlimactic when I was so excited to finally go try it after it opened in Vegas. Darn."}
{"text":"Love it!  Cesar Q. and I were on the hunt for a bite to eat close to work.  We have heard so much hype about Halal Guys so decided it was time that swing by.

We opted for 2 regular size chicken \"platters\" and a side of hummus.  The food was actually really good.  I cannot complain however it was rather expensive, $27 for a fast food type meal is a bit pricey.  It's like this place comes from NYC so they are charging NYC 

Service was on point.  The 3 staff members we encountered were friendly and jovial. While the \"white sauce\" was tasty I would suggest DO NOT LOOK AT THE CALORIES/FAT CONTENT.  Holy Mother of....it's a meal in itself.

Would I eat here again? Yes.  Would I eat here if I were on a diet? Yes, I would just forgo the bomb ass white sauce.  All in all the meal could be considered healthy sans that white stuff I can't get off my mind."}
{"text":"Halal poutine: 
Signature frozen crinkle fries ok, but not double fried, so do not stand up well to hot gravy.
Cheese was served refrigerated, not room temp, so no squeak to show freshness.
Gravy was delicious tho. I added halal chicken, because it's their specialty. No complaints in that regard.
The dish was very tasty, but the texture was sub-par.
I still recommend it, three of five stars."}
{"text":"Hands down the best gyro I've had in Arizona. Make sure to get the white sauce on it! So good"}
{"text":"Shocked at bad reviews. 

This is fantastic food with stellar service. 

Had excellent service this week twenty minutes to close and all product was still out, hot and available which cannot be said often especially in Ahwatukee (you listening Panda Express?!?) Combo is a great value based on what you get and if you think it's too much money then stick to a dollar menu. 

Anyway, give it a serious shot. Comparing to other \"gyro\" places in the area (which I love too) is like apples to oranges. 
This is just a different product and it's phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Not as fancy as I imagined. The beef gyro is tasty. However, not very much choices. Avoid coming during the lunch or dinner hours."}
{"text":"Nope, never again. It was over priced and terrible. We were looking forward to trying this place out. We were very disappointed, lots of lettuce and over cooked meat and the rice looked like it had flavor to it but bland."}
{"text":"I got the Regular size Chicken & Gyro Platter with white sauce for $12.99. It was delicious! The meat was tasty and soft. The naan was soft as well. Overall everything tasted pretty good. My only compliant would be that I find it a bit too greasy."}
{"text":"Halal Guys opened in Vegas at the right time. After having the real thing in NYC last February, I thought I'd only be able to have it if I went back. Since then, Halal Guys started opening up in CA and other parts of the country. Vegas was lucky enough to be put on the map for Halal Guys!. 

I recommend having the Gyro (beef) or Combo (beef and chicken) platter. It comes with a fixing of the meat of choice, rice, and diced tomato and lettuce. Listen to what the workers say with the sauce! You can never have too much white sauce but be careful with the red sauce. Even if you are a \"spicy\" kind of person, a couple drops of that red sauce can do the trick.

After having gone here a few times, unfortunately I must say that the quality and service is not consistent. That however doesn't stop me from trying again since it brings me back to NYC! I don't think it will ever taste the same or have the same feeling as having it outside after a long day walking in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Simple and Tasty. No nonsense spicy delicious food.

Word of Warning : 1 Line of Spicy red sauce is PLENTY

Unless you have a very high tolerance for spicy food, the red sauce will overpower you.

Consistently great food, travels well too."}
{"text":"The hype, the hype, the hype... unfortunately that's all it was hype, heard people talking about this place is the best in new York and than they open up in cali and all my cali friends said it was great, well I got the large combo platter, the rice was 1 out of 5 stars, the gyro meet is 3 stars at best, chicken was the biggest disappointment, it was pulled chicken, we don't pull chicken in the middle east, and with out the white sauce that chicken would be dry, so 1 star out of 5, now the reason I give this place 4 out of 5 stars is the Falafel, the falafel is a solid 5 out of 5 stars, best falafel I've ever had from a fast food joint, If it wasn't for the falafel and sauce I would most likely never come back"}
{"text":"Good service, big portions, friendly staff. Now the bad: Bland, Americanized flavours. Rice is boring, chicken not flavourful. Just not authentic in my opinion. You need a shit load of the hot sauce and the white sauce (which is basically like a mayonnaise with soy oil.... eww) to make it interesting enough to want to eat it all . No thanks"}
{"text":"During my first visit, the food was really fresh. Meats were juicy and flavorful. This time around the chicken was very dry. The lettuce and tomatoes were a bit lifeless. Fortunately, the famous white sauce saved the meal. It only took 1 1/2 packs of white sauce to do the trick. Just beware of the red sauce - it's good and packs a mighty punch. I thought it would be similar to Louisiana Hot Sauce, but it's on a whole other level. I've never experienced heat like that before! Portions are generous and you'll be full for hours to come.

Note: Make sure you check in on Yelp to receive your free baklava."}
{"text":"Thrilled that one is in this town now!  I'm from NY and The Halal Guys are of the many places I miss- but that's changed!  The location/parking lot is a bit tight, but I plan accordingly (when it's not prime time lunch). 
Each time I've been (probably about three dozen times at this point) I place my order with ease, waited no more than a few minutes and it's ready!  Staff is friendly:). The rice and falafel are always flavorful, crisp and tasty.  Yes, even without that sauce which they are known for;)  portion is a perfect size and the pita is always crispy."}
{"text":"When you have had good Mediterranean food and then get this... falafel had no taste, hummus was so lemony and the rice......"}
{"text":"It's not what I expected like other people said. Not cheap and salty. 

They don't give a lot. Most of the Plat is salad. Not even comparable to a normal shish taouk plat in a next door restaurent. 

Overrated."}
{"text":"While I am glad to see the Halal Guys doing so well and expanding to CA and now Vegas, the food still is not my favorite.
The prices are descent as are the portions, but the meats are just not very good.
Still cannot decide which i like less, the chicken was dark meat, the beef rather dry, a mix of both seemed best.
The white sauce is pure mayo, I would much prefer a garlic or yogurt type sauce, the red is very spicy, but needed to cut the thickness of the mayo.
Not bad, but also not worth returning for."}
{"text":"BEST TASTING MEDITERRANEAN FOOD YET! 

Surprisingly delicious! Good price (not great), friendly service, and great tasting lamb and dressings and sauce. Really nothing to complain about outside the price bring a tad high."}
{"text":"Lines always put the door sometimes to the Starbucks next door but it moves very fast! I counted 8 people working behind the counter last time. Their spicy sauce is very spicy I was told 20x spicier than jalapeno!! 

Tip: If it's your first time, get the spicy sauce in the packet so you can add as much as you want once trying it!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place, so it made me excited when I heard one was opening up here. But I was a little disappointed when this place didn't live up to the hype.

I ordered the regular chicken & gyro combo plate with extra white sauce & extra hot sauce. This plate comes with rice, diced tomatoes & chopped ice berg lettuce. Without the white sauce, this dish is really plain. The white sauce is what actually makes the dish taste good. 

The hot sauce on the other hand gives a really good kick. A little goes a long way. I feel like everything was really bland. I had to kind of drench it in white & hot sauce just to make it taste good."}
{"text":"Been here more than once! That white sauce is addicting!! My go-to order is their falafel with lettuce, tomato, and pita bread. It is very filling and delicious. The staff is friendly and service is efficient."}
{"text":"I came back and tried it again,  Showed up around 8 PM, The place had 1 table of customers.

Again remember in NYC this place has lines till 4 am.

I got the combo plate without tomatoes like a real new yorker.
The guy loaded my plate with lettuce and gave me a scoop and a half of rice,  I asked can you do a little more rice?  and he says that would be a dollar more.   LOL

First off,  the whole dish is a RICE DISH on a bed of rice.
MY plate was literally half a salad.

Like I keep saying, you guys don't make it right,  I don't care how much you claim to be original. You guys don't make it right and it shows now,  the hype is over and people hardly show up.

Part of what makes the NY carts so good is that business is so good so the food is fresher.  The plates are also bigger and you don't feel cheated someway.

You guys, on the other hand, try to give people a full salad in a much much smaller plate.  Then offer caramelized onions jalepenos and olives at the end?  Am I at a subway?

Be honest,  if you have any relation to the true NY cart,  you would know.
They charge 9 dollars per plate for twice the portions.
You guys charge more for half.    But what is most infuriating is that the food isn't even the same.

even if you claim to do things a little differently here, 
ITS NOT WORKING,  theres no customers.  
so stop making excuses MR Manager."}
{"text":"Great food this place going great place to stop by for a quick bite. The line moved quickly and everyone was polite. Simple menu which very refreshing can't wait until the next time I come back."}
{"text":"I first encountered halal guys on a trip to New York. It was around $6 or $7 and the portion was huge, the food was piping hot. I actually stumbled upon this place by accident in Montreal thinking it was very similar, now I understand things in Canada can be bit more expensive and I fully expected it to be priced a bit more.

Now to the food... I was utterly disappointed, the meat was cold and they gave me a tiny bit of rice with 2 molten pita breads and a salad. The meat tasted so bland and the rice didn't taste right. The only thing was fresh was the salad. This is for a whopping $11. I ended up throwing it out.  Trust me I wouldn't eat from here even if they gave it to me for free.

For the real experience make a trip to New York City and goto the cart on 53rd street, trust me you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"There are so many fantastic middle eastern restaurants in the area. This is super mediocre even for a late night place. I got a combo bowl. Meh."}
{"text":"Omg the food is amazing the service is great the food is awesome but the thing that got me so much was the amazing service the workers andrew and emina and also the short girl maria were super freindly and very helpful deff will be back"}
{"text":"Fast service and great eats', what more can you ask for. Dining area is small but if all you want is to get and scoot, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this food cart out every time I go to New York but when I go the line is always ridiculous. A friend came to visit and she went on yelp and noticed this location. It must be fairly new because it was super clean! If you check in you can get a free baklava which was a tip from the worker (much appreciated!!)

We shared the combo regular size which was the chicken and beef gyro and got all the fixing. By the drinks they have the white and red sauce to put as much as you want. Be careful with the red sauce because it is extremely spicy! The white sauce is amazing!!! Combined with the platter and the sauce with a side of hummus... died and gone to heaven! 

Only thing I wish could improve was the pitas... I just like my pitas a little bit with a crunch but that's generally a personal preference and nothing to do with this establishment."}
{"text":"This little dive of delicious is on my mind eveytime i drive down I15. Its open 24/7 and priced amazing. I always get the chicken and gyro combo but someday i will get the sandwich, I seen them made. Biggest Gyro in LV! They have a reward plan and local dicounts. Everything about the combo plate is great from the veggies, rice and BOTH meats! If you never been here and are looking for a satisfying trendy New York style plate of food. You should go no further! Best olives also! Winner! They need to expand in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. The gyro meat was so dried out and the pita served was so hard I bounced it off my tray. The falafel was black on the outside and lime green and tasteless on the inside. What seemed to be tzatziki was weird, creamy and strange tasting.
I'm sticking with Haji Babba!"}
{"text":"The Halal Guys never disappoints... I'm so happy this location opened. So much closer to me than the one in Tempe (still would make the drive before this location opened because of how great the food is) I always get the chicken & gyro combo with tons of the white sauce, also fries smothered in white sauce... sooooooo yummy.. simple and great. I will continue eating at the Halal guys !!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times prior. I was here when they did a Yelp Elite event where they treated us to a platter of their signature Halal Guys goodness. 

Whenever I would visit NYC, I would always visit The Halal Guys cart. Nothing beats getting yummy street eats and it's even better when you're standing there in the middle of winter getting a plate of piping, fresh, hot food. I was ecstatic when I found out they were expanding. I even went to their Costa Mesa location a week after it had opened. Alas, these stores will never be the original but I'm still happy that we have one that we could go to. Plus, they're opened until late late! So if you need a late night grub, this is the spot .. sort of. 

The Halal Guys is famous for their lamb over rice platters. But you're able to get chicken over rice or even a combo over rice. I typically stick with their chicken over rice nowadays. Their lamb over rice is essentially Gyro meat over rice. The Gyro meat that they have at this particular establishment is a little bit on the oily side and I'm not sure if it's the same recipe as the one from the cart. As for the chicken, what I do notice is that a lot of the franchise places don't cut their chicken into the same small pieces as the original cart does. You'll occasionally find a huge chunk of chicken here and there on your platter. 

What I do enjoy at this location compared to their Costa Mesa was that there is a sauce station. You are able to put as much sauce as you want. No one else does it for you. I typically put a lot of white sauce and a lot of red sauce as well. Be careful with the red sauce -- it is NO joke. If you think you can eat spicy, think again. Don't go squeeze crazy on that red bottle unless you know how spicy it can get. Without sauce, the platter is nothing so don't give me the whole, \"Not healthy and a lot of fat\" line. If you get your platter to-go, they usually give you two packets of the white sauce and one packet of the red sauce. What I typically do is .. go to the sauce station, squeeze how much I want into my platter and then I leave. 

There is also an upcharge of $1 if you want extra rice. What I usually do is skip the veggies and have them put extra rice, because they like to pile half of the platter with lettuce. I mean, I didn't come to Halal Guys to eat a salad. So if you get a platter like mine, it'll run you about $10.99. 

Overall, pretty decent place. I still miss the original. The ingredients were definitely more fresh from the cart because the turn over rate was much higher. They also give you more food at the cart. They pack the platter so full! However, this location is still okay. The sauces are on point and is definitely from their recipe. I would still come here if I was craving Halal Guys. It definitely saves me the cost of a plane ticket to NYC."}
{"text":"Having been to their original location in New York, I was really excited to hear they had come to town. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed.

When I first arrived at this place, I was hoping for the same freshly cooked meats and fluffy rice I had in NYC. I instead got a plate of dried-out rice and reheated chicken which lacked flavor. I am not sure if they had over prepped food for the day and were trying to get rid of it or what happened, but nothing I tried made me want to go back. 

Lastly, and for the number of people there (4, including us two), there was trash on the floor and more dirty tables than I expected. I guess I will have to wait until my next visit to New York to at the real deal again."}
{"text":"It's about time these guys made their way to Vegas! I've been anticipating their arrival for months now, so you bet I begged Hubby to take me to The Halal Guys Grand Opening.

We've both tried their food at different locations, but this was our first time together (Aww!). I decided on the small platter with beef gyro. Although I prefer chicken, I felt obligated to order the gyro since it's a staple of Mediterranean cuisine. I'm glad I did too since it was sooo tasty! Hubby's chicken platter was equally delicious.

I made the previous mistake of overdoing it with the hot sauce. My poor tongue didn't stand a chance. :( This time around, I made sure to only put a couple drops of that sucker. Paired with their famous white sauce, Kalamata olives, bell peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, rice, pita, and beef gyro, it was absolute perfection!

While others seem rather critical, I can say I loved it. Sure their AC is temporarily broken and their prices are a little steep, but you're getting a substantial amount of oh so satisfying food. The generous Halal Guys even provided free water bottles and complimentary white & red sauce for their Grand Opening. That's all the extra sauce you could dream of, minus the extra .99 cost!

For the best of both worlds, it's a good idea to order the popular Combo Platter with both chicken and beef gyro. The crowds are insane, so it's also probably a good idea to wait for the hype to die down to make another visit. I just don't know if my Halal cravings will allow me to do so. ;-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw this restaurant on YouTube and decided to go.  I was nervous it wasn't going to be worth all the hype but it I'd actually really good!  I love hot food so when they said the hot sauce was hot I didn't believe them and... It's really hot lol. The white sauce is so good . The flavors were on point and the meatvwas seasoned and grilled perfectly.  I will be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"I will say this, I was very excited to try this out when I learned it was in my area. I know about their Origins from a food cart in New York City and how much they have grown since then. I found this location after mistakenly being sent to a location in more North Phoenix that hadn't even opened yet. But regardless I wasn't in a hurry so I was happy to be here. Surprisingly the place was empty as I expected more people around on a Saturday afternoon. The employees were extremely friendly and helped guide me through the process since I had never been there. I got the large chicken and beef platter over vegetables covered in white sauce. I didn't do any rice because I'm trying to be more healthy and no red sauce since I've heard it is just very spicy. I was very pleased with the taste! The White Sauce sure makes it. Overall I am a fan and I hope to try them again someday when I'm more inclined to eating the rice and trying the Red Sauce. I would say give it a shot and see what all the hype is about!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!

I came here after work, excited to try this place that I've been hearing about. 

My hubby ordered me the combo platter which is chicken and beef. The meat didn't have any flavor at all. Half of the dish was lettuce and under the meat is rice. 

Really this just tastes like generic fast food.

I am usually not too picky, but I couldn't even finish my food. THIS PLACE DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Halal Guys since I was in NYC back in 2011? Damnn I can't remember.

This is straight up drunk food or hangover food. 

Gyro/Beef Rice Platter with EXTRA white sauce but be careful with that hot sauce. Just a drop is ALL you need. You have been warned. Is it just me or does it taste better as left overs??

I'll be back in Vegas for Christmas so I'm definitely stopping by for some hangover food! :0)"}
{"text":"I don't get the hype :|

I've heard so many good things about Halal Guys; from long lines in Cali, TX, NY. When I heard little ol' AZ was getting one, I was more than ecstatic to try this place. I knew from the pictures what I was expecting, but maybe I was expecting to be blown away by the taste or something. 

Yes, the servers were nice, fast, and helpful. But the food is another topic. I ordered the combo platter (chicken and gyro meat) with spicy sauce and extra white sauce. The platter was mostly rice and lettuce. I normally like my food saucy, but I now I understand why everyone said to order extra white sauce. The food seemed dry and a little plain. The white sauce helped a lot. I will say, the hot sauce is SOO spicy. When I first saw them sparingly drizzle red sauce over my platter I thought they just being cautious; NO, it was spicy. Thank goodness they didn't add more. 

Overall, I think there are plenty of other better middle eastern food around town. 

Environment: 4/5
Food: 2/5
Price: 3/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"I heard the hype so I wanted to see it for myself and I was so bitterly disappointed. If this is what you can build a food empire on, then we are a society of mongrels. This stuff is just a notch past Oliver's \"please sir, I want some more\" gruel. Just go ahead and save yourself save money and do this to yourself."}
{"text":"Coworker recommended these guys to me awhile back and have occasionally been stopping here since. Perfect place to sit and chow down on a big bowl, or to quickly grab fresh hummus to go. This isn't an a-typical Americanized place. Be sure to ask questions if you're not sure what something is!"}
{"text":"First time trying Halal Guys in Las Vegas. It's different vibe from the one in NY.  They just opened last Friday and it seems running smoothly except the air conditions are portable. I guess the air condition is still under installation. I ordered chicken rice as usual. The taste seems the same but  the portion seems little small and different vibe makes the taste little different.  It's good and I will be back again."}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype for The Hall Guys when it opened so I had pretty high expectations. Sad to say, my expectations were not met. I've had much better gyros at other places. 

I'm glad the chaos died down a little and there wasn't a line to order. I heard the chicken was good but the gyro wasn't that great. I decided to try the combo of chicken and gyro. It also came with rice, pita, lettuce, and tomatoes. Pretty simple but portions were very big. I like the rice, the chicken was okay, and the gyro was a bit salty. But I was really hungry so I still enjoyed the food. 

Because we ate there, we grabbed the bottles of the white sauce and hot sauce (much better than paying extra for extra sauce). The hot sauce is definitely hotter than more hot sauces -- I probably shouldn't have put it all over my plate lol. Everyone LOVES the white sauce but I don't see what's so special about it. I'd much rather have tzatziki with my gyro. 

I'd eat here again if I was in the area but I would go out of my way or crave it."}
{"text":"While the food is good the customer service at this location has been abysmal.  I noticed 2 very recent charges on my bank account and had not eaten here in about month and a half.  I called in and the manager working at 11:30am on the 28th ot May asked if I could hold.  Thinking that she had a customer to deal with I held on and for the next 35 minutes was able to listen to her discuss all of the entertainment and dining options in both Tempe and Scottsdale.  I finally gave up after 35 minutes of being on hold and called the Tempe location where I received an answer to my question about the recent charges in about 2 minutes.  I called back to this location in Mesa and asked to speak with a manager only to find out that the individual that placed me on hold for 35 minutes was the manager.  Oh and she was not helping a customer for those 35 minutes, come to find out of her own admission she was having a conversation with a security guard.  So let's recap an actual paying customer calls in with a concern and the phone is simply placed down off the hook for 35 minutes while the manager has a casual conversation with a security guard who is not a customer.  I would seriously reconsider spending my hard earned money with this establishment. the food is good but the customer service is absolutely non-existant, some of the worst I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"I found the food to be tasty and flavorful.. it's definitely not off the grill like in New York but still delicious.. can't go wrong, hit it when in Vegas and craving"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about this place! It's so freaking good. I came here about a week ago for the first time and definitely have been back since. The falafel is SO good, probably the best falafel I've had in a while. The hummus, rice and their tahini and white sauces are so tasty as well. The store is super clean, the customer service and all of the employees are always super nice when I go in. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who's in the area or has been thinking about coming here because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out The Halal Guys and happened to in Tempe for work. Sadly, I was pretty disappointed. It was just meh. I really don't like giving poor reviews, but there's no way I can give this more than two stars, purely from a food standpoint. 
I used a THG recipe at home once and my version far outshone what I just ate. 
I love falafel and I was in the mood for something tasty, so I headed inside the compact storefront and ordered the small falafel bowl, which consists of lettuce, tomato, yellow rice and three generously-sized falafel pieces. The guy on duty asked me if I wanted pita bread (after checking to make sure I wasn't a vegetarian, so I'm not sure what that was about... are they made with lard?) and gave me about half of a pita's worth. 
Once my bowl was assembled, I could add extras like onions, jalape√±os, green bell peppers, pitted Kalamata olives, hot sauce, and white sauce. I chose the bell peppers, olives, and white sauce. Kudos to the worker for warning me that the hot sauce was \"hotter than 20 jalape√±os,\" because otherwise I would've tried it and been in pain!
The service was pretty quick and efficient, and the place was clean. I didn't love that half the seating is concrete benches. It looks sleek, I suppose, but sorta gives off a prison vibe and wasn't very comfortable. 
I was just completely underwhelmed by the food. There was almost a total lack of flavor. The white sauce lent moisture to the bowl, but nothing more. Perhaps they need a hot sauce that's somewhere between flavorless and burning with the fire of 1,000 suns. 
I think I'll try a mom-and-pop for Middle Eastern food next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"While the food has good roots, it's been Americanized out of being good middle eastern food. If you go, I recommend the falafel since the chicken and beef meat options are both painfully dry. And BE SURE to ask for the \"sesami based sauce\", which they will not offer you, instead of the \"Hallal Guys (TM) White Sauce\" which they push and is actually gross mayonnaise. Unfortunately, there are no pickles, and while you can order a side of fries, it should be an option to put them on top. Meh."}
{"text":"Just as good as NY's. Too bad it couldn't be a food truck or stall here in Toronto. It being an actual restaurant does take a little away from it's spark it has in NY. 

That said. Just as good as tasty as NYC's. The hot sauce is crack!! 

Personally prefer the gyro plate (I had both as I was hungry and it did nit disappoint in filling me up)"}
{"text":"The hype on this place died down when we arrived which was cool cause fvck waiting over an hour on anything....

We ordered one combo plater and baklava...

Combo Plater was fire it was a decent mix and good enough portion that two of us shared one and we both were full...white sauce is good but the red sauce is fire...shit legit had a kick like bruce lee...

Baklava was cool...not the best similar to ordering Apple Pies at McDonalds...you just do it sometimes I guess....

Get the platter instead of the wraps period..."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this spot with all the hype!! I definitely wouldn't say that it's gross and that I'll never come back, but....it's not anything life changing either. I ordered the gyro and chicken platter. I like al dente rice with a nice chew but this rice was borderline undercooked. The meat was a bit overcooked and dry as well. I think the two most disappointing things about my meal was that the white sauce wasn't what I expected and the falafel was horrible. The white sauce I expected to be a cool and refreshing tzatiki sauce but it honestly tasted like a mild ranch dressing so I wasn't about that and will definitely pass on that white sauce packet next time. The falafel was fried beyond recognition and super coarse and dry. I love a good falafel, this just didn't hit the mark. Looking forward to trying the original location in NY someday to compare the difference. I'll be back here to give if another shot in a few weeks though!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from NY so I was pretty excited to hear that Halal guys were opening a store close to where I lived. I went the day after it opened (around 5:30pm) and the lines were still out the door. It took abt ~20min to get from where we stood in line to ordering our food. An employee was handing out stickers. 

There are apparently 2 sizes you can order if you get the platter. I ordered the large [~$9] combo platter, which is the equivalent to the NY one size only platter. Half of the platter consisted of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes and the other half was rice and meat, but more rice than meat. So, it was pretty disappointing for them to skimp out on food. Usually, lettuce is only supposed to fill 1/4 of the container. I heard from several friends that it seemed healthier (not in a good way) bc there wasn't a nice layer of oil covering the bottom once you ate the whole thing. The meat wasn't as flavorful - maybe the taste will improve in some weeks or so~

There were about 7 or 8 two-seater tables inside and ~2 four-seater tables outside. It was a battle to grab a table and then keep it - employees and customers alike gave us so much heat it felt pretty uncomfortable. 

There's a parking lot! However, Dutch bros is right next to this food plaza and they currently have a one way drive through that some cars actually confused as another entrance into the halal guys' parking lot and you can imagine there were a lot of angry drivers and loud honking. So be careful that the parking lot entrance you're entering is the right one! 

Overall, I'm glad I can indulge in halal food whnever I crave it, so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I haven't had halal since I moved out of NYC 5 years ago. When I saw this place I had to give it a try. The white sauce, and powerful hot sauce is on point, and just as I remembered from those drunken nights wandering the city streets, and stumbling upon a halal food cart.

Docked 1 star for them not offering lamb meat."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a special order that was accommodated with no problem by Johnnie, who definitely enhanced the experience for me. Johnnie was courteous and professional. 

The service was quick and attentive, but the good was exceptional. The meat and salad/toppings were fresh and satisfying. I will definitely be back to this spot for lunch and more"}
{"text":"DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE! As I walked in, I was greeted by an awkward employee with little to no customer service skills. He was super weird and a little creepy. I Ordered falafel. It was nothing like I expected. Everything was room temperature and the falafel was dry and wasn't warm and steamy like I am used to. I will not come back here."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes (and because of their GF/ vegan falafel that you don't often come across). Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.

I'd like to begin by saying that the service was amazing, which is why I'm giving this establishment two stars instead of one. The employee serving me was extremely kind and helpful. Additionally, the restaurant appeared to be quite clean, which is always a bonus. The biggest problem was the food.

To be completely honest, everything was absolutely terrible. The falafel and fries were not fresh whatsoever. The rice that came with the meal was extremely undercooked and tasted disgusting. Worst of all, the baba ganoush was absolutely repulsive to the point where I felt sick and couldn't even look at it. My friend ate the pita (thankfully that tasted fine) and we finished our drinks and threw everything else out. I'm not one to ever throw food out, but the meal was unbearable. If you're looking for good falafel, I suggest you head over to Falafel Avenue."}
{"text":"The consistency & quality is the star of Halal Guys. Yes, of course there is better food out there for a better price. But to be able to maintain friendly & fast service while serving a consistent platter of meat, rice, sauce, & bread across the country is truly amazing. 

Even with a long line in front of you, you'll be served in a timely manner.
Order it thru delivery, and it's a nearly identical experience as going to get it yourself. 

The chicken is a bit on the bland side. 
The beef gyro is nice & zesty. 
Pita is soft & tastefully chewy. 
Rice is decent & mild on the flavor. 
Salad is used to cool it down when you get overzealous with the hot sauce. 
White sauce is decent. Bbq sauce makes it better & fun, The Hot sauce is best taken in moderation. 

And a side of fries is surprisingly tasty.  

I've been to this location about 8 times this month & will continue to enjoy my combo platter any time of the day."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, but i have to rate it 3 stars because of service. I get it, it's the holidays, crowds are busy, people can be needy and obnoxious, but please don't take it out on the \"easy\" customers like myself. Linda, the cashier, came off as rude and unpleasant. She asked me to repeat my full order probably 5 times, something that could've been answered by her other coworkers taking and making the actual order. Then she had the nerve to say \"you need to take that ear phone (singular since i only had one in my ear with no music playing). You probably don't know this but you're very quiet. Here, let me show you how you sound like *demonstrates*.\" How embarrassing!! How about you listen to the way you speak to customers next time. What a shame..."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what all the hype was about and the food definitely lives up to it. I got the combo platter to go and it was delicious. 

The chicken wasn't dry like other reviews said. And the beef was seasoned perfectly. Everything in the platter went together so well including the pita, rice and the veggies. The white sauce was good but I was expecting more of an awesome flavor based on the hype but it was still good. I was kinda hesitant to try the red sauce because a lot of the reviews said it was too spicy but I liked it and I used it sparingly and it still provided a good spice. 

Also tried the baklava it was ok just a little sweet and not enough of the nut layers and I felt like for the price of $2.49 for a small slice was kinda overpriced. 

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the service. I came in for lunch and there were only two people ahead of me. And their orders got messed up so the staff ended up taking my combo platter that was already packaged and just waiting to get to the front of the line to the cashier, and they gave it to the party ahead of me so I had to wait about 5 minutes for another one to be made for me. They also had to repeat me order about two or three times after that mix up. Hopefully they work on their service flow."}
{"text":"Only our first experience at the H-Guys.  Super friendly guy greeted us... though we entered through the rear of the store.  He could tell we had not been before and brought us to the front where we could get a good look at the menu.  Today was not a big meal - falafels and baba ghanouj/ ganoosh... and baklava.  Really enjoyed all three items.  Fresh and tasty.  Because they don't have a huge menu, I think they can keep their eye on being good and consistent.  They even came and picked up our trays.  Maybe we look like food critics.... hahaha!   They have other locations, but we will probably return to this one in the near future for chicken and gyros."}
{"text":"This place is great food was fantastic. Great place to eat. Located in Caesars Palace. We we went to show decided to get a quick bite. The service was fast and efficient. The food was just as good maybe better than the carts of New York. The atmosphere was li"}
{"text":"Everyone was talking about this place so a friend and I went during our lunch break. It was the grand opening so there was a bit of a wait outside but luckily there was shade and they provided water.

The place was a lot smaller than it looks on the outside, but then again it's a spot to grab a quick bite. I had high expectations for this place since it was popular in New York. I ordered a small combo platter and wasn't too impressed with it. My chicken was dry and the beef gyro was also dry and pretty oily. It felt like I was eating hamburger meat. I was also expecting some lamb but sadly their gyro is just beef. The flavor wasn't all that special. The rice was decent but had no flavor to it. Their side salad is boring with just lettuce and diced tomatoes. The pita bread tastes like the ones that they sell in grocery stores. 

I recommend going easy on the hot sauce first to see if you'll like it.

Overall, the workers were friendly and the place was clean - however, I don't feel my small platter was $9 worth so I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm at the food court at Caesar's Palace on a Friday night .   Heard so much good stuff about Halal guys , yet been sitting here almost an hour and they're closed! At 7pm on a Saturday?!?  WTF, no note or anything. Can't be that good if they can't stay open on a Friday night in Vegas."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing service! Went at 1am to get 7 platters and they really took care of us. At 1am most are tired and ready to go home, but they were super helpful and efficient. One of the few places who still take care of our military members as well. Thank you for the great service and great food! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Not the best. Had a beef gyro and it was below average. There was way too much lettuce not enough meat and the meat was not very good. Only plus was they are open til 4am on the weekend so good for a late night fix. But if other places are open get a gyro somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love the combo platter! I honestly crave it all the time and order it on Uber eats! It comes with a special white sauce! Ask for extra it's delicious!"}
{"text":"This location does not have the same hype as it does in the states. Flavor wise there has to be something in the seasoning, but a lot of the food lacks flavor. I feel like the servers piled in a lot of veggies instead a fair ratio of meat.

My group and I ordered everything from the combo to falafel platters. We left wanting more. If you travel to this location because of the hype don't buy into it. You're better off waiting till you hit the states"}
{"text":"I was here for a beef pita last week for lunch. Good but not great, definitely not worth the hype. The beef was not grilled to order, it was sitting in a steam table. The pita was likewise steamed rather than toasted on the flat top at the end. The sandwich was so overfilled that I had to eat it essentially open-faced. On the other hand, the white sauce (mayo and spices) was good and the hot sauce packed a punch.

There are many better places for a pita downtown, but Halal guys was fine."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch. Ordered the combo platter. First time here.  

The meat was tasty with a distinct flavor. I felt the white sauce complimented the flavor of the meat well. Without the white sauce the meat would probably be a bit on the dry side.  Rice was tasty and so was the pita bread. Very unique flavor. 

Knocking a star off because of the seating arrangement. The restaurant has a handful of tables and a few stools. They had staff directing patrons on where to sit so it wasn't too hectic but I can see this being a problem during really busy times. 

Staff was very friendly and seemed attentive. 

As far as portions go , they're huge ! The normal platter is very filling with lots of meat. Definitely a good bang for your buck. 

Overall ,  the food was delicious. Glad to have these guys in Vegas. In the words of Arnold , 'I'll be back \"."}
{"text":"Every time I go to New York City, I average more than one halal meal a day, but always just from random carts in Manhattan and Brooklyn - I'd never made it to The Halal Guys' NYC outposts. So naturally I've been pretty excited about them opening up here in Vegas.

It just didn't live up to the hype. Almost every gyros I've had on the street in New York was better than this one.

The best part was the red sauce. I was warned that it was spicy. I generally thumb my nose at what other people consider spicy, so I dumped red sauce all over my sandwich. It was that kind of spicy that hits you like a punch to the stomach.

The pita was fluffy but stiff. 

The meat, which was chopped as finely as taco meat, was bland. And there wasn't nearly enough of it. My sandwich was pretty much all tomatoes.

But the unforgivable sin? The white sauce. The legendary Halal Guys white sauce is freaking mayonnaise. I thought it was going to be some variation on tzatziki but it's spiced mayonnaise.

I always saw The Halal Guys' using the slogan \"we are different.\" Putting mayo on a gyros is different, all right.

I wish I liked this more."}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected. Everyone that told me of the New York and LA locations seemed very enthused but this combo meal just did not meet the hype that was told to me. It's not bad, but it's just not that great. Everything seems a little dry and somewhat bland."}
{"text":"Worst middle eastern restaurant in Toronto. I ordered the chicken shawarma platter and it completely lacked flavour, I could have gone to McDonald's down the street and gotten more seasoning. They compensate the lack of flavour with a ton of salt. The wait is also ridiculous. The Yonge and Wellesley neighbourhood is blessed with a ton of quality middle eastern/shawarma places and this is definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying the Halal Guys even though I've walked by the original stand in NYC multiple times during travels. I came in the day before their grand opening and ordered two regular combo platters and a baklava. One platter comes with two packs of white sauce and one pack of red sauce. After drizzling about one pack of white sauce over the platter, I mixed the entire bowl up because I hear that's how New Yorkers like to eat it - in rush and on-the-go. The food tasted great. After having a few bites I definitely felt like it needed a little more white sauce, reaching for that second pack. Just a warning, their red sauce is extremely spicy. Before drizzling it on your food definitely try a bit first. One platter may seen like just enough of a portion on the surface, but I actually wasn't able to finish the entire bowl! Ate a little more than half of it and was stuffed. $10 for a regular combo is definitely enough for two meals for me. However, the baklava was quite a small portion for $2.50. 

The restaurant space is pretty small. There's four tables, each seats four, and a small high top bar table against the wall that seats a couple more. This type of food is meant to be taken to go, so honestly the small space isn't too bad. I do hope they fix the air-conditioning soon! The service is good, very fast and efficient. It was a great experience trying their food for the first time. I can definitely see myself coming back for more during lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to the Halal Guys opening up in my neighborhood in case I need that late night falafel fix. I'm hoping that with time the owners will improve upon a few of the things on the menu so this doesn't go under like so many other restaurants in Ahwatukee. The gyro meet Doesn't have any lemon in it so the meet comes out crumbly and dry instead of having that lovely slick long slices that real gyro meat has. You should visit Niros Gyros down the street for that perfect gyro meat and they skimp. Not to be nitpicky but it would also help if the guy at the counter actually pronounces the word gyro correctly, and doesn't pronounce it with the G. What supposed to be saffron rice is yellow, under cooked so it's almost still crunchy, and doesn't taste like saffron. The falafel's were great...so good job there."}
{"text":"The Halal Guys was a complete waste of a meal in Vegas. I ordered the chicken and gyro combo platter. Both meats were extremely salty and low-quality. I could barely finish eating half my order because it was so overly salty. 

On top of that, the workers are not that friendly and ask \"hummus or fries?\" with every order which makes you assume that a choice of hummus or fries is included with your meal. However, the sides are actually $2-3 extra. I only realized this later after looking at the receipt. Very shady and misleading! Fool me once..."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to Toronto getting their first Halal Guys location. I had their Chicken/Beef & Falafel platters. Both dope. Not your typical shawarma place, everything has it's own distinct taste (rice, sauces, etc.) Their famous red & white sauce was  great, and the hot sauce was in fact, hot Service was good, & food was worth the money. They don't skimp out on portions, but I had to take off 1 star because the extra hummus ($) was not fresh , but other than that"}
{"text":"Great sized platter for the price. I always get the combo platter, but halfway through always wish I got gyro beef... the chicken is good, I find the gyro more flavorful. Great staff; friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Used the yelp check in for free dessert. Baklava was a little sweet, but that didn't stop us from eating it. Water machine stopped dispensing water, which was a little weird but not a deterrent from coming here again soon. Also great late night food to pickup or get delivered."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better options if you're looking for something quick and affordable to eat at Caesar's Palace (located at food court next to the Forum Shoppes). 

Many Yelpers mentioned the service being slow/subpar, but we didn't have the same experience (NYE, late lunch). It was pretty much a scoop and go sort of place, so you don't have to get a number and wait for your order.

We wanted a light lunch so we ordered the combo plate to share ($11.99, chicken + beef gyro combo). It comes with rice, chopped tomato & lettuce, pita, and your choice of meats (pick from chicken, beef gyro, combo or falafel). I preferred the chicken. Always get the white sauce!

Would definitely add this to my list of quick vegas eats."}
{"text":"The Halal Guys has developed a large following since its introduction in NYC. Naturally, they began to expand and the newest location made its way to Toronto last month. Now, I have tried the original food cart in NYC, and the one in Toronto has absolutely nothing on it. 

A co-worker of mine grabbed a platter for me earlier this week, as she was having lunch there. I was hammering away with paperwork. Anyway, I was quite underwhelmed, as my chicken was rather dry (drier than it should be) and quite bland. The red hot sauce did help, but it's super spicy. I ended up paying $14 for a mediocre lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely an advertising business ! The rice is full of colors, I asked a person working there do you guys use color, they said no! I can believe it is the real deal I eat Middle Eastern food everyday such as at the Tasty Kobob, YOS restaurant, Shawrma Paradise, Moroccan Paradise, and the good is soo much better and genuine, I used to love the Istanbul Cafe the food was way better and genuine compared to the fake colored food at Halal guys, unfortunately Istanbul Cafe has been closed for such a long time. 

I think this restaurant is overly biased I am not arguing about the price it's not overly expensive however I feel like street food in Pennsylvania, New York, Washington Seattle, even Texas and Illinois Chicago is better than this ! 

I feel like they need to improve the rice and the meat, generating flavor with sauces is just like tricking people! However the Falafel is good !"}
{"text":"I came in because I heard all the great hype. Came in around 3:30pm and there was a long line and I thought.. yah this place better be awesome. Unfortunately, it fell flat! I ordered the gyro bowl. The rice and gyro meat where so dry. I was so disappointed. The only thing great about it was their white and hot sauce. I had to keep adding the sauce to put some moisture back into the meat. Unfortunately I will not back. Sorry not sorry!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely the best \"grab-n-go\" food you will find in all of Las Vegas. I've been eating at this place for a couple years now, and it never fails to disappoint me, I've visited The Halal guys in both New York and L.A. as well, and can honestly say that the consistency of service among the different branches truly is amazing. I would recommend future customers to get the lamb Gyro platter to go along with their world famous white sauce! If it was possible to give this establishment 7 stars, I would definitely do so! Overall, AMAZING FOOD!"}
{"text":"First time at Halal, found them on Yelp! while in LA last week and found out they opened up shop here. Went there in the afternoon and had to wait in line outside for a little bit; the line was shaded and cooled by misted fans and free cold ice water. The staff is really friendly. The line inside to actually order went by really fast. Tried a combo plate with chicken and beef...and I couldn't believe them when they said it but their hot sauce is legitimately spicy even if you try a little of it. Overall the food was good, planning to go back to get a beef gyro instead of the combo. I couldn't finish a whole combo plate."}
{"text":"Well when you've been to New York multiple times and make it a habit to eat halal guys three times a day its just not the same. I mean yah sure it had all the hype but the quality of the meal just didn't sit right with me. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed but I am hoping for better. I feel like they will get there. I don't work too far from them and hope the next time i decide to drop in, I am content with the meal."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB. I had the combo sandwhich and could not put it down. Seriously so tender and sooo good. This is a must go and you will not be disappointed. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!!!

Decided to stop and check out what all the hype was about. The line was a bit long and there wasn't anywhere to sit really so we ended up sharing a table with some strangers. No biggie. 

In the chipotle style line, the food looked delicious. The meat was juicy and the menu is very simple. You can't really make mistakes there. However, none of us have eaten there before so we all got combo plates with all the sides. 

THIS IS THE WARNING ---- After sitting down to eat, there are two sauces to put on your food. A delicious white tzatziki sauce and a red sauce that looks like ketchup/salsa but could only be described as hot lava. I was extremely hungry and doused a healthy amount of both sauces on the entire combo plate and took my first bite......in which I learned there was a large jalape√±o covered in this hellfire sauce. I instantly started sweating and was holding back tears while I dined with my friends. I had to mix all the food together and add a ton of the white sauce to cover up the flames. The red sauce is super spicy. 

However, the meat was good, the rice was good, and the menu is very simple. I wouldn't recommend the olives or jalape√±os because the put way too much in and it is way too overpowering. I would suggest getting any of those toppings on the side. After picking out a mountain of olives and jalape√±os, my friends and I agreed that the meal was MUCH more enjoyable. So take my word for it and take it easy on the hot lava when you give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Chicken is very dry and rice is hard. totally different with the halal guys in nyc"}
{"text":"A New York staple now in Las Vegas ? Yes please! Love the falafel yum from NYC used to be a line here all the time so never tried it but for quick food I love their falafel bowls :)"}
{"text":"Make sure you check in to get the free baklava! So I've been to 3 different Halal Guys, including the original in NY, and this place stacks up to uphold the name of Halal Guys. The people here were super nice on the night we came (April 13 at 12:30am) especially Johnnie and the manager. Thank you to their hospitality and delicious food!"}
{"text":"So happy I tried this place!!

The food was so good, I got the mixed platter and it was amazing (no, I'm not over exaggerating). In the platter, there was jasmine rice, lettuce, tomatoes, few slices of pita bread, chicken and beef. They drizzle this really good white sauce on top. 

Only reason I gave this place 4 stars, is because the wait time is insane (yes, I understand that they just opened), also because there's hardly any seating in there.

P.S. the falafel isn't great, it's tiny and super dry."}
{"text":"So happy to have Halal Guys now in LV! Every time I come I can't believe the line isn't out the door. Super friendly staff. Love that they have a small option unlike some of the other locations. Check them out and get your WHITE SAUCE on!"}
{"text":"I see why there is a big hype for this place. Came here on a Wednesday night around 6 with it being very busy. Checking out the place seems very small, and can only sit a limited amount of people which is a downfall. I ordered the Beef Gyro. The inside of the gyro contains small thin cuts of beef patties, lettuce, and tomatoes with the white sauce. I assumed the white sauce is ranch. I like the combination of all the flavors when I took my first bite. Such a simple
Ingredient, definetly great taste. They do offer different sauce of bbq, white sauce, and red hot sauce which is very spicy. 

I love it and I don't regret it. They do have a lot of staff to help the line flow smoothly and everyone is very nice. Will visit soon again just a heads up parking is definetly hard to find in this small commercial area."}
{"text":"The reason I give this  a  full 5 stars is because my experience was great . I went earlier this summer and got the  chicken & gyro combo . I went right  around their opening time at 11 15 am and there was  only three people in line so my service was smooth and   got a really hot and fresh meal. I  will return if my friends join me or if i am in NYC  and in the mood.  The point of my review is to help foodies enjoy their experience by avoiding the bad times. When you go earlier you get a smooth line and better service instead of the hurried rush hour service."}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place. The only complaint I might have is that it's too small. The space was poorly planned considering all the hype that was apparent before this place was opened. There was nowhere for me to sit, so I had to sit outside of the starbucks next door. The food is fresh and delicious. That white sauce was so yummy, I could put it on everything. Next time, I might do a to go order just so that I won't have to think about where I have to sit."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the combo platter at 2 AM. It was delicious. Employees are very friendly and it took under a minute to get our food. The meat was very flavorful and went over and beyond any expectation I've had for a meal at this time at night."}
{"text":"Nothing too special here. It can hit the spot if you are starving, but it's not memorable enough to make the treck to this busy corner of Valley View and SMR. There are plenty of options in town for a gyro plate with rice that equal or exceed this offering."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the halal guys ever since I ate it for the first time in New York. I was really delighted to see them in the Caesars Palace. The taste was spot on and the standard was the same as the NYC ones. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Good food and super quick service. Knew of this restaurant chain from out west and was anxious to try. Had falafel.  It was very good but nothing spectacular. I would return."}
{"text":"This place is alright. It hurts me to say this but this chain does not live up to my standards. Last Christmas, I spent my time at NYC. My brother who was living up there at the time took me to The Halal Guys cart of 53rd and 6th. There was a long line but it was worth the wait. For $7, I got the combo plate which was chicken and LAMB. This location does not serve lamb; they serve beef instead. At the cart they packed up the bowl with a lot of rice. At this location they really go light with the rice and I'm afraid to ask for more because it might be an extra cost to the already $10 charge on their combo plate!

All in all, it's a decent spot but they need to step up their game by being generous with the rice and keep the sauce bottles filled. Definitely will come back because of my cravings but they need to change something..

EDIT: I came here again to give it another shot and may I say I am impressed. There's finally working AC, the employees are more energetic and helpful, and the finally fixed the portion sizes. I disregard my last statement but applause goes out the management for taking the reviews on Yelp and adjusting to the customers! Definitely will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"In all fairness, I went to try (pay for my food myself) Halal Guys on 8/23/16 after the meh experience at their Yelp event. I understand that everyone is learning and maybe the food wasn't up to the company's usual standards.

The best part about Halal Guys is their service. Their employees are so friendly and engaging - they have top notch training for service.

While good service is to be expected at any business, I can't in good conscious give 3-5 stars where the food just isn't very good.

I've had the gyro, falafel and baklava here, at my own expense. None of it is good. The beef gyro is ground back into ground beef, the baklava is okay and the falafel are overcooked and underspiced. The rice is oily instead of flavorful. The white sauce that people rave about is soybean oil and an emulsifier - it legitimately has no flavor of anything in it. I just find it odd that at a Mediterranean / Middle Eastern restaurant, tumeric and cumin aren't detectable in any of their dishes.

Don't be fooled by the NYC bravado / pride and the Yelpese ( reviewers over-hyping mediocre food that they themselves will never revisit) Halal Guys needs to step it up. If you up the flavors and quality, people will pay for it. As it stands, there's nothing on the menu that warrants another visit."}
{"text":"This place is good but definitely not the place to get a classic gyro. First off, the way they label their menu is confusing. They call gyro a \"sandwich\" You can choose chicken or beef - I chose chicken and it really lacked seasoning. The gyro didn't even come with tzatziki sauce. Their \"white sauce\" is essentially just mayo. They also didn't even put feta on it. What good is a freaking gyro without feta?! They put jalapenos on it too....Needless to say, everything about this place confused me.

WARNING: Their hot sauce is blazing hot. Please try it before you drench your food in it. My friend covered her food in it and could barley eat it because it was so hot.

It's a very small place and I'm pretty sure when they chop their chicken their goal is to make as much noise as possible. They literally slap the spatula on the chicken and it makes the loudest noise and it goes on for like 5 minutes. 

Overall, it tasted good but lacked a lot of flavor. I don't think I will be coming here again because I know a lot of other places that have better gyros."}
{"text":"there was a big line up, since yesterday evening before 10pm they sold out of ingredients, we got two free drink coupons. there isn't enough sitting space, I wish they bought the next door space as well. food was quickly served and plentiful, price for a regular portion might be a tad steep though. I found it to be flavourful and fries were good too, not greasy or too salty. employees were polite and friendly. we will be back, don't know when but I will get a smaller portion because it's very filling and I couldn't eat almost half."}
{"text":"Not a family restaurant to dine good for TOGO. Good and limited menu, food is scrumptious.  Good for Halal lovers. Store hours are impressive."}
{"text":"This is going to sound douchy, but: it's not as good as New York!

That said, the falafel sandwich was really good and the white sauce was just as good as I remember it. The hot sauce is still quite hot, which sadly, is rare these days! The queue moved soooo very slow both times I have been here and the inside was in complete disarray: tables were a mess, the fountain pop area was sticky and full of napkins and the floors were a mess. 

I am sure that the kinks will be ironed out in time, but this is a good lunch/quick dinner spot, the prices are definitely right, portion sizes are great and I am happy to see The Halal Guys come to our city!"}
{"text":"The food is very good.  I ate the chicken and rice combo.  The hot sauce is really hot.  Good flavor, tasty, and fast service.

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fast food that's also clean and healthy are things that come to mind with Halal Guys.  I've been a few times already and everything is consistent considering I usually do the chicken platter or sandwich.  I've had the combination platter as well and it's probably the most common dish I've seen people order and consume.  My only issue is that the food becomes a bit bland after consuming multiple times but you can change it up with toppings including jalape√±os, onions and green peppers all chopped up.  The white sauce gives each dish a little more flavor but it reminds me more of a ranch/mayonnaise mixture.  The hot sauce is like fire in a bottle so make sure to just use drops until the right spice level is reached because just a little over your spice threshold and your mouth will be on fire for some time!  I definitely recommend Halal Guys for the fast and consistent food and service and hope their A/C is finally fixed too!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast service, good choices and great food. Has many vegetarian options and at the same time it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Tried the falafel platter, hummus with pita and the falafel sandwich with fries. The spicy red sauce is the icing on the cake"}
{"text":"So I work in Chandler and today I drove 46 minutes to and from The Halal Guys to satisfy my craving, okay? I'm Halal-ed out now though but I'm glad I went. I went for the first time on Friday night and it was everything. I ordered a regular size chicken platter with extra white sauce and a DOLLOP of red sauce. That red sauce is nothing - NOTHING - to play with. My mouth was on fire but it was so good. It's an intense burn but it fades out quickly so I guess that's the silver lining to it being so hot, lol. My husband tried some while we were driving and he almost wrecked the car, he couldn't comprehend how people enjoy it! I also ordered one piece of baklava and a fountain drink. Side note: did you know Fanta made ginger ale? It's a faint ginger flavor but it was great. Also, it was my first time having baklava and it's so good. I was looking up recipes today to try to make it sometime soon. Anyway, I enrolled in the rewards program and when I went today, I got a free drink. If you ever forget to have them add your reward points to your account in store, you can always do it online. I actually preferred my meal more Friday than I did today. I don't know if it's because it was later at night and maybe the chicken had been marinating longer but I just felt like it had more flavor. I asked for extra white sauce but it wasn't nearly enough because ¬æ of the way through my platter, it was pretty dry. And of course, it isn't the same as the authentic NY Halal Guys but it's worth the 45 minute drive from my apartment in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Meh. The beef was salty, dry and chopped so small it fell out of the pita . I'm from LA, where Middle Eastern food choices are plentiful - and this was not authentic and quite overrated. Gyros are traditionally served with a yogurt based cucumber sauce. Greeks call it Tzatziki, while Persian restraints call it by another name. Halal Guys have some \"white sauce\" that was some bland mayonnaise based stuff. I guess everyone has their own preferences for taste but to me - both taste and quality were severely lacking at Halal Guys. Issa no for me."}
{"text":"I drove by this place one night and saw a long line out the door. Pulled it up on Yelp expecting it to have 16 stars or something. Surprised it was only 3.  One review read really positive and it ends with, \"meh, 3 stars.\"  (What?)
I am giving this place five stars because the food is good and so is the service. I had the platter with the beef. Being on the keto diet it's basically salad bowls at most places I go. Chipotle, Cafe Rio, etc. I don't enjoy them, I eat them in a pinch. But this I enjoyed. The beef was really flavorful and the sauce made the dish. The hot sauce is actually hot. I'm talking army of one hot. Not like those places where you order their spicy dish, then they warn you that it's spicy, and it's literally tomato sauce with a pinch of pepper."}
{"text":"Well, I have mixed feelings about this place. 

I was definitely looking forward to trying it after all the hype. We got to the place on a Monday at about 9pm. We thought it was closed because there was literally no one in there except for the two girls working. The interior is kind of dull and flat with yellow and red as the main colors. Kind of like a depressing McDonald's for adults. 

The menu is pretty basic. We shared a platter with half chicken/ half gyro. The girl working pronounced the gyro with a hard g which was surprising because gyro is their main menu item so clearly the training was lacking?! The platter is very basic- comes with lettuce, tomato and rice. The chicken was really dry and not at all \"seasoned to perfection\" like their website states. Once we sat down, we obviously grabbed the squeeze bottles of hot sauce, \"white sauce\" and tahini. It was actually really tasty  with the white sauce all over it, but let's be honest, that \"white sauce\" would be good all over anything! Once all the flavors of the sauces were mixed in, I all of a sudden had a change of heart and thought, ok maybeee I'll come back ;). The hummus was good but 4.99 seemed pricey given it comes w 1 piece of pita bread for an entire container. 

I saw on their website that they are the #1 yelped business in NYC. I'm not sure if their food tastes different on a bustling New York City street but it certainly wasn't that exciting last night."}
{"text":"The customer service was great, the service was fast, the sauces were good, and the menu wasn't overwhelming."}
{"text":"The grand opening is August 12th, but I'm so glad because I was able to go before then. I expect it will be nonstop busy after it opens. Spring mountain is far for me as well as a lot of Las vegas natives but perfect if you are visiting and staying on the strip. As soon as you walk in you can see how small it is. There are maybe 4 tables? However, the food was great. I have never had halal guys on the east coast so i do not have much to compare to but I really loved it. THE WHITE SAUCE. GAWWWWD YES. I am so glad one of the workers warned us about the red sauce, because that shit is not playing!! Its so spicy legit be careful fam. 

I got a regular platter & the chicken and gyro were really flavorful.  My favorite thing was the baklava!! Im definitely willing to go back just for the baklava. The service was great and I think this is a great addition to the Las Vegas food game!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected. They had an abundance of everything already pre-cooked. Looked and tasted like it had been sitting there for a while.the hummus is packaged they just open it for you and sprinkle the chilli over the top. Staff looked like they disliked their job. the food was ok."}
{"text":"Below average halal food and overpriced. Would not come back. Employees were nice, though. I paid eight bucks for a chicken sandwich consisting of lettuce, tomato, white sauce, and bread. What a rip off, especially since it didn't taste good. Apparently they charged lower prices in New York but now they expanded and raised their prices. Take your food chain money to chipotle where you at least get onions in your burrito."}
{"text":"it's definitely good for what it is, middle eastern food truck food. However, it did not live up to the hype that it had prior to opening. It's a little bit pricy for the portions and I feel like they're a little stingy with the sauce and meat. The meat is a little dry (chicken). Overall, pretty tasty with the sauces. Haji baba is better and more bang for your buck in my opinion"}
{"text":"I want to give 5 stars as the halal guys in NYC got me hooked. This place is decent, but lacks consistency in the amount of their serving. Been to this place couple times,  but today I got a stingy share from one of their employees on a regular size all beef platter. The plate looks like there's a reserved spot for the chicken. Life can be unfair, but I hope to get a fair consistent share on what I pay for... consistency pls"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on Spring Mountain & Valley View.  $31.86 got me a fountain drink, a small falafel platter, a regular combo platter, and a chicken sandwich. Visited on Saturday 8-13-16 at 11AM.  

I had to google what halal means...apparently it literally means \"permissible\" and describes food which is prepared in accordance with Islamic rules.  For animals, the whole throat must be slit at once including the windpipe, arteries, and veins.  Thank goodness they are allowed to stun the animal first because it seems unnecessarily cruel to let them bleed out while conscious.  

ANYHOO....back to the review.  The first thing that struck me about this place was the air conditioner was broken.  WHY OH WHY would you have a grand opening with no A/C when it's 110 outside?  Seems like bad planning.  

Inside it's set up kind of like a chipotle assembly line where you order at one end and pay at the other end.  It was much smaller than I expected with only 5-6 tables.   There were about 20 employees behind the counter and it was just mass chaos.  People bumping into each other, having to repeat myself several times, and they tried to short me a falafel. 

The combo plate consisted of a spiced red rice, lettuce, diced tomatoes, slices of pita bread, diced chicken, and beef gyro meat.  It kinda threw me off that the beef looked more like ground beef than the flat shawarma-type meat I'm used to.  The bowl came with two pouches of their \"white sauce\" which tastes exactly like a really weak ranch dressing and one packet of hot sauce.  The hot sauce reminded me of sriracha...I'm glad I tried a little dab on my finger first cuz this stuff is hotter than Satan's ballsack.  The rice and meat were both not warm but not cold. They have a condiment bar with jalapenos, hummus, olives, onions, etc. but it is hidden from view and I didn't find out about it until today from checking their website.  

This was my first time trying a falafel and I think maybe I don't like them.  The one I had was bland, room temperature, and hard as a rock.  I looked up a recipe for them and I think I received perhaps a bad example of a falafel.  They are made from ground chick peas and deep fried and I believe they are supposed to be crispy on the outside and moist on the inside....but again I'm not really sure.  

This food was not cheap, the parking situation was horrendous, they had no air conditioning, and the food was incredibly forgettable.  The portions were very generous but the food was so bad I ended up throwing it all out instead of eating the leftovers.  

  It's a \"one and done\" for me."}
{"text":"What's the deal about this place? I've eaten Mediterranean in the past and enjoyed it, so when I've seen billboards and commericals around town hyping up the grand opening of Halal Guys, I thought I'd give it a try. 

When we walked in, my immediate thought was, this place is tiny! The MMA fight store, the previous business, was four or five times the size of the common area. The other tiny thing is the selection on the menu: Sandwich or Platter. Then choose your protein: chicken, beef, chicken/beef combination, or falafel. 

Ironically, what's not tiny is the number of their staff. There must've been nearly ten employees including the owner/manager type dudes that came out to ask about our experience - nice touch. 

I went with the Sandwich Combo while she had the Platter Combo. They make it right in front of you Subway style, so you can customize your sandwich of three items: lettuce, tomato, and white sauce.  The amount of meat was great, but unfortunately, very bland.  Her platter didn't sit well - she ended up having diarrhea and encouraged me to mention it in this review. 

Overall, the experience was like being on New York City street coughing up nine bucks for below mediocre grub - I guess they nailed it. 

Halal Guys prides itself for founding it's success as street food but it's like they chose not to elevate it when as a brick & mortar. Since they're now in Vegas, they should find a way to put a cart outside the clubs. I'd eat it then, but not before."}
{"text":"Well I was I was just all around disappointed. The pita was old and so hard it was inedible. The falafel was mediocre at best. Hummus didn't taste better than anything I could have gotten at a grocery store. They just generally made my plate wrong on top of everything. I will say that the gyro meat was good an flavorful but that is no where near enough to bring me to get food from here again. I had heard good things about them before so when I saw they opened up I was excited but it was just a huge let down."}
{"text":"I walked by for about a month seeing massive line ups and always wanted to eat here.  I'd heard amazing things about them from NYC.   Not sure I would return.  The food was okay, way better gyro in the area for much better price.

My biggest issue was the staff, I get how it's busy and you only make minimum wage but the majority of the staff looked like they hated life.  There was a short line but only because the staff couldn't move slower.  I grew up in restaurants and I never would have hired the majority of these people.

I got my food to go, had to tell the person three times.  Cutlery by the fountain pop was totally empty, had to tell the cashier more was needed, ordered a fountain and and had to ask for the cup.  Where is the Manager????  Is no one interested in the client experience?  My guess is the manager was doing some menial job \"in the back\".

These sad people couldn't wait to leave, and it was only dinner time.   

To offer an area to improve, it is in management.  All these issues relate to having very low quality or inexperienced managers.

Managers, get involved.  Talk to your guests, get involved in the dining experience and train your people or this will be a short stay in Toronto.



After the very poor experience I had originally i decided to give it another shot.  It seemed more organized.  But still lots of staff not focussed on customers but focussed on random conversations between themselves.  I don't mind waiting in line if the staff are working on fulfilling the customers orders but for over 5 minutes there were 9 of us in line and the staff was not taking any orders they were fulfilling the web orders.  That seems totally counter intuitive, the people who come to your restaurant get less prompt service than the customers who stay home.  If your web orders are going is well create a station where you fulfill those but give the customers priority service if they walk into your restaurant.

I hope they figure it out but judging by my continued experience with very low customer service I don't have much hope.  This sort of service issue starts with the managers and boss figuring out what they want to offer their customers.  At this point I'd say the are making poor decisions."}
{"text":"Mention to the guy on the counter my first time here and local so far I'm not impressed !!! The fact that this guy is so horrible at the food beef/chicken portion I got half of scoop on the beef and chicken ordered a combo platter what the guy at the counter told me to get. He keep banging the cook top nonstop while we eating then he mention if I want to sign up for a rewards card and register it to get a free drink, so I did when I ask him question how to register he simply said I don't know how go to the website and read the instruction(I was like ok???) Them while I'm sitting here eating and saw the bottom right of the menu said (ask about our locals offer!) ask him about the offer he said u suppose to told me your local to get the 10% discount, but I told him I did mention it when I first got in store he obviously doesn't care I'm done with this place HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD TASTE OK

Ask for a manager this guy that been at the counter said he is the manager he won't be able to adjust my receipt for the local 10% offer he said I never mention I was local at the beginning of the order when I got to this place I told him I was local and he stand here and have the guts to tell me that I never mention I was local this guy ANGEL G is a joke, he said the discount only $1.10 it is not the discount it is the principle of this whole thing for manager arguing with me over a $1.10 discount is simply a JOKE!!! I WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently they got rid of the 50% off military discount. Now it's like 10% off. Not really worth it anymore. And the person who made my bowl barely put any meat or rice. Probably never coming back"}
{"text":"Watch out for the red sauce! It's like surface of the sun hot! It has an amazing flavor but it'll literally set your insides on fire.

I went here in between Uber rides as I do a lot of Uber Eats pickups from this spot and I love Mediterranean food. Upon walking in, I noticed that you can either order a platter or a pita wrap. In an effort to maintain my hourglass figure, I went for the platter without rice (too many carbs and it's cooked in chicken stock). Basically I ended up with three or four falafels on top of a bed of shredded lettuce with some pita wedges. The falafels aren't made in house...they come in frozen in a big bag and then are dropped in the frier. They taste just ok. 

The staff that works here is awesome...so friendly and helpful. They asked if I wanted tahini on top of the falafel, which is awesome...and then they cautioned me about the red sauce. I feel a proper expectation was set for how hot that stuff is. 

I think next time I'll try a wrap because there are other things you can add to it such as olives, cucumbers, etc."}
{"text":"Ordered this via Door Dash and I gotta say, this was pretty good. We ordered the chicken sandwich, fries, combo platter and baklava.  All of the food was great and the price was just right when comparing to portion size. The amount that comes in a regular size combo platter is enough for 2 people. Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately they didn't have rice when I went so I settled on a chicken sandwich. Pretty good, with fresh-tasting bread and plenty of fillings. It's almost twice as expensive as a food truck in nyc would be, but oh well. Good enough to get again."}
{"text":"Egh. I ahv heard good things and one opened up by the house. I would say that the consistent complaints about dry meat were spot on. The magic white sauce wasn't very magical. Somewhere between sour cream and tzatziki. Wasn't bad, wasn't good. Likely will go somewhere else but if I am in a hurry and in area I wouldn't be against going for a quick bite if I'm strapped for time"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place or trying Mediterranean food in general besides a gyro here and there. The white sauce was as awesome as advertised. Put tons all over it and the hot sauce"}
{"text":"This place is the worst compare to the other halal guys i've been to. When we got back to our hotel, hubby and I got diarrhea. Something was wrong with the food. They did not put the white sauce in the freezer! The employees don't look happy working there. The chef banging here and there. Oh my, if you dont like your job, just quit! Don't ruined people having dinner!"}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss. Service is terrible and they are overpriced. The hot sauce is good and menu limited."}
{"text":"Doesn't taste as good as the one in NYC or SF. Rice is tougher. Meat too dry but Spicy sauce is still consistently spicy :)"}
{"text":"I have been to the original Halal Guys street cart in NYC many times and to my surprise I was driving on Stapely near Baseline and saw the familiar yellow and red sign in my neighborhood and was so excited, I had to go that night! 

Came in around 6pm and I ordered 4 combos to-go from a very friendly young lady with a great smile. The combos were assembled just the same way as in NYC with a lettuce and tomato salad the amazing rice and the the two meats on top with fresh pita. Oh and don't forget the white sauce and hot sauce packets. That white sauce brings it all together. Hot sauce is very flavorful and hot (which I love), so go easy at first. 

I get home and we all dig in... amazing!!! Tasted just like I expected. Spot on to the original in NYC. Sooo good. Put the white sauce and a little hot sauce on and stirred it up, lettuce and all, and it was perfect. 

The menu is simple and it's all about the food so don't expect some big menu with all these options. It's the Halal Guys and they do it great. 

Open on the weekdays until 12am and the weekend until 2am. Perfect for those late night cravings but it's awesome anytime. 

Easy to find off Stapely and the 60 so please go by and check it out. Have an open mind and know it's a fast casual, simple, and very tasty place to eat in or to-go. 

I will be back many times and looking forward to spreading the word anytime I can. 

Best of luck Halal Guys!"}
{"text":"Came here to try for first time after hearing the hype. Friends gave us a 25$ gift card for as birthday gift. Cashier did not know about gift card and called manager. Manager flat out denied gift card even though the card clearly has their own logo on it! After explaining the card was purchased on their own website, and presenting with a email confirmation from Halal guys, they back tracked and said they were not set up. It's fine if it's not set up. But don't treat your customer with a disrespectful response. Attitude was unacceptable. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I think I was expecting something more from all the hype that was built up on this place. The portion was big, after taste left my mouth tasting of grease. I guess this is a good place to go after a bar since it is open late. Pet peeve of mine was that they ran out of forks. That's like running out of meat but still charging for it. If I come back again, I would order the gyro sandwich."}
{"text":"This is such a simple concept! 

The menu has only a few options and it really makes the service fast. 

BEWARE of the hot sauce. I have never tasted sauce so hot. I think some people must get it just to feel the ridiculous heat. Nevermind that though because the platters are great with just the white sauce. 

If you watch the video running on the screen you'll see the meat over French fries. That's not on the menu but definitely a cool \"secret\" menu item."}
{"text":"Loved their gyros, their fries, and the free baklava (with yelp check-in)!

I wish they had a closer location to the LV strip because that UBER trip wasn't $ friendly back and forth."}
{"text":"Is this some kind of joke? I'm sure this place is tasty in New York, but it missed the mark for me here. The food was sitting out, cold, the bread soggy. The famous \"white sauce\" is just mayonnaise! I was shocked there was no tzaziki sauce (YOGURT BASED; TRADITIONAL). The hot sauce is bitter and unpleasantly hot. I'd never come back. But then again, I know good middle eastern food. This place is just Americanized. Like the Taco Bell of middle eastern fare. #thumbsdown"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try the Halal Guys since they opened up in Toronto last month but wanted to wait until the hype wore off to avoid the lines. There was no wait when I went in early June and I was able to find a seat almost immediately. Since I wanted to compare it to the original food truck in NYC, I got the Chicken Platter again. The price here is $9.99 for a small platter and $12.49 for a regular platter. Even when taking into consideration the exchange rate, the $8 platter in NYC is a much better deal. For those meat lovers out there, you may be disappointed since the platter here has a much larger proportion of orange rice, lettuce & diced tomatoes than meat but since I like my veggies, I was ok with it. Tastewise, I found both locations to be the same since the secret is honestly in their white sauce. I'm very much a sauce person and therefore, halfway through the dish, I went up to the counter to ask for more sauce (it's the only way to eat it!) and the nice ppl there happily obliged."}
{"text":"I loved the concept of coming in and getting the food quickly. Food is pretty good! And employees are super friendly!"}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty low after reading the reviews here, but to my delight this place exceeded my expectations! To be sure, it's not gourmet food or the best dining experience of your life, but it's good hearty and healthy food. I disagree with others who said the meat was bland. I got the combo platter and I was wary of the chicken being bland, but I found it to have a nice flavor and it was NOT dry which was most important of all. Also the lettuce did not take up 1/2 my platter, it was 1/3 at most. I couldn't finish the entire platter in one meal so I feel that it's a fair amount of food for the price. I really liked the rice and the gyro meat.

I ordered from uber eats and my platter came with 2 huge white sauce packets and spicy sauce. It was more than enough white sauce, I didn't even use 1 whole packet and I felt like it was more than enough white sauce. FYI the white sauce is their version of a tangy mayo. That spicy sauce is no joke! But I liked it. 1 spicy sauce is waaayy more than enough for an entire platter. If you can eat more spicy sauce than that, my hat's off to you! 

Overall I would definitely order from here again!

Oh, but pass on the baklava - it's not great."}
{"text":"Sorry the picture is a bit cut off, I was so excited to eat!

Overall had a good experience at halal guys. Finally got a chance to try it after hearing a lot of good things over the past few years. I had the chicken and gyro combo platter. Personally I thought they could've put more sauce and that the gyro was significantly tastier than the chicken. 

I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Food with fresh and tasty. I'd compare it to a Chipotle or a Fired Pie of the Mediterranean. Fresh meats and good sides. Friendly attentive staff. They also have falafel and their sauces are very tasty."}
{"text":"Awful!! Save your money and drive north on 19th ave to the Albertsons Shopping center.  Twice the quality for the half the price.  This place will be closed before you know it!!"}
{"text":"3 because the staff was nice. They don't have lamb. I paid extra for white sauce that they had for free by the soda fountain. And we paid $34 for a meal that would have been $14 with tip in NYC. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just a lot for a cheap imposter."}
{"text":"\"I like it a little spicy but not too spicy... like J-Lo in pajamas.\" ? Craig Ferguson, on The Chew

Any leftover, residue, stubborn, clingy germs from my cold a few weeks ago sprang back to life with the bit of red sauce I used.  I'm still coughing up a lung a few hours after eating!  Whoa!  Be careful with that red sauce, folks!

From a humble street cart in 1990 to becoming an international eatery, The Halal Guys have made it.  We ordered a side order of falafel, a Combo Platter [chicken & beef gyro], and a Falafel Platter.  I must admit that the falafel was a let down.  They were a bit dry and bland but a splash of White Sauce and a drop of Red Sauce fixed that up.  But when you're trying to not get an ass like Nicki Minaj, using excess White Sauce [seems like the love-child of mayo and Greek yogurt] to save your food is upsetting.  I would say the Combo Platter is the way to go.  Platters are a filling and simple dish of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and some rice.

3.5 stars!  At $9 for the large \"regular\" platter [I couldn't even finish half] combined with the late hours, I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Is the hype real? That's what I wanted to know... I had in the streets of the city over ten years ago and I can still remember it. Yeah it might have been three in the morning and I may have been toasted but I do remember even eating the leftovers for lunch the next day. That's how you know it was good. This on the other hand wasnt horrible but just ehh avg. Portion size is generous for $9-10. Half the plate is lettuce half is rice with Indian spice and coloring so it truly is orange. The chicken was cooked right and not dry but all I could taste was salt and pepper. The beef cooked gyro style was pretty good. Decent portion of meats. The two sauces are white and red. The white would've been yogurt and onions combo on the cart in NYC... This I could barely taste  the red is the chili sauce and they ask how many lines you want of each (is this coke they sellin?). I got 5 white 7 red mouth was on fire! I happened to have tzatiki in the car (no lie) but it was still burning my mouth. Glad I got baklava to offset but wasn't enough. Like some other reviews said there are handful of middle eastern joints around asu that you wouldn't have to wait in line for and like even better.... Haji baba comes to mind but I've been away from that area for ten years. Either way glad I tried it.... Not in a rush to go back but it was edible."}
{"text":"One of the best things that happened here in Las Vegas is the recent opening of The Halal Guys!!! It surely is the best Mediterranean food! You have to try it guys!!!"}
{"text":"So sad this place doesn't live up to what I expected. Being to the one in New York, it wasn't the same. The meat didn't have a good flavor and it just lacked. When I got there it was late about 11pm, but he didn't heat up the pita bread, there was a pile sitting there and that's where mine came from. I definitely won't come back again."}
{"text":"Glad I finally got to try Halal Guys! Since this was opening weekend, there was a line to get in but it moved fairly quickly. I also appreciated the convenient parking in the back. 

I ordered the small bowl with mixed beef and chicken which was a good size in my opinion. Overall, it was a nice and quick meal...I think the sauces are really what give this place their name, otherwise the food itself is pretty bland."}
{"text":"Great food for reals! If you go do not pass up the opportunity to get some of their hummus, because it is to die for!!! The baklava is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"WARNING, FOOD POISON ALERT, Really bad experience I was there on the second day they were open, I should have known just by the way the food looked, cafeteria style fast food, food court gyro shop, but I was wrong it tasted worse than that, I would not even leave this review had  I not got terrible food poisoning, u have been warned, being sick sucked, and I know it was this place as it was my only meal of the day."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I go there they have fast service and the food is always amazing. I have tried the combo bowl and the falafel bowl... the falafel was tasty but the lamb and chicken is the best one. They have delicious fries as well. The white sauce here is the best sauce I have had and I am not just saying that, I would put it on everything if I had the recipe. Their hot sauce is hot and a little goes a long ways. Will for sure be going back more"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Halal Guys for a while, so when I heard that they had a location in Vegas, I couldn't pass up on trying it. Like others, I found that the food did not live up to the hype that the New York locations boast. 

The location is a little ways out from the Strip, and the interior of the restaurant is a slightly cramped and dreary. The workers were really friendly though. The food didn't blow me away; again, my expectations were probably too high. The plates come with your choice of protein - gyro, chicken or falafel. They also throw in some rice, lettuce, tomatoes, pita and some other condiments like onion and olives. I will warn you now, the hot sauce they have is POTENT. I had just a little bit and my mouth was on fire for a good 10 minutes. And the white sauce was delicious and probably the highlight of the meal. 

Food is affordable at $10, but I look forward to trying their New York locations someday in the hope that they might live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Wack meat, wack pita, TERRIBLE babaganouj, wack workers, wack place. 
I don't know what the hype is about ? unless you have no taste buds. 
Will never go back.
Never."}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro platter and the meat was well-seasoned and tender. The salad was fresh and the sauces were delicious. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"It's very understandable why this place received 3 stars. I'm not new to halal guys, the beef and chicken are very soft and tender and the white sauce compliments them both very well. This is me explaining my experience at other halal establishments.

If you check my yelp you can see I'm very generous with stars for great service and food. But I have had nothing but anger for this specific establishment. I ordered through the app for delivery and wrote no rice and tomatoes which they gave me as well as missing white sauce. That is not that bad, I've had mistakes happen before no big deal. I've called them for the past day receiving nothing but a voicemail. You guys open from 10-4, as you can see  you don't care enough for your customers who just wanted to switch for a different dish. I didn't want credit or free food, but no one cares about customer satisfaction. Go elsewhere. The stars say it all."}
{"text":"I hate that I did not get her name but the girl with the blonde hair and gorgeous eyelashes customer service was beyond awesome!!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept; have heard bout it & wanted to try it. Very ltd menu, reasonable prices & healthy. Not sure I see all the fuss, prob wouldn't go outta my way but will go back..."}
{"text":"Great prices... very tasty, authentic.... the variety of sauces are amazing...portion to price ratio GREAT leave full!!! Service is great will be back! If you're in the area it's definitely a must stop"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and very fast. Expect the place to be busy. It is located at the busy food court. Easy in and out for a fast bite."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food.  Was so excited to try it.  The pita bread tasted stale with a weird after taste.  There was too much lettuce on the sandwich but generous amount of meat.  I would have preferred slices of the gyro meat.  The baklava was inedible."}
{"text":"No good.  Stick to Pita jungle.  Iceberg lettuce salads, over cooked gyro meat, mayo based sauce thats nothing close to a tzatziki.  I've had better gyros at Arbys. Not sure what New Yorkers are standing in line for."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, I ordered the beef shawarma, and was instead given a substitute of ground beef. The ground beef was salty and dry. The wrap was full of lettuce with some sort of white disgusting mayo sauce. Completely not what I was expecting in a Shawarma wrap.  For a garden-variety fastfood restaurant, this place is a disappointment and deserves a one star review."}
{"text":"To be honest, the last time I had the original in NYC was years and years ago, and I can't actually remember how it tastes, so I may have romanticized the memory...but I feel like the original tasted much better. Which was to be expected, but I was hoping for more.

I came here at about 11:15am or so on a Saturday and there was no wait at all!

The orange rice didn't have much of a distinct flavour. The chicken tasted quite lean, like chicken breast, which means it was a little dry - it was also quite peppery. The beef tasted a little gamey, even though I was told there was no lamb in it, and it was also quite dry. The white sauce tasted fine, though kind of chalky and it was thicker than I expected. For some reason I remember the original to be thinner, more savoury, with more complex flavours, and much more delicious in general. And the hot sauce was hot but not as killer as the original, which I didn't mind. And as with the original cart, I didn't like the pita very much - I prefer mine to be thin and chewy, as opposed to thick and pillowy.

The price seems like a lot compared to the original, but if you translate the USD price to Canadian dollars, it's not that crazy, lol. For $11-12 though, I'd rather have a bowl of ramen or something.

I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't be craving this. Which is too bad, because the people were super nice!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was very disappointed by this place....the hype was ridiculous. Talk about no seating, dry meat, frozen falafel, and the platters don't come with hummus (which is what you would expect in a Mediterranian platter). Also, if you don't like soda, bring your own drink...no iced tea. The hot sauce should have a disclaimer on it because it's blow-your-butthole-out hot. Overall, the quality doesn't match up to the price. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I think I came here with anticipation of it being a Greek or Mediterranean style restaurant. It was not. The chicken was flavorful, the beef was nothing like a gyro. I was not a fan of their white sauce however their barbecue sauce was very good. I only had to take one bite of the hot sauce and knew it was too too too hot for me! The staff was very helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating halal guys. Unfortunately each time I was really hungry and the food was so good I could not take a pic for food presentation...my bad. Ok the first trip it was packed on a Saturday night! But the line moved very swiftly. I ordered the combo chicken and gyro platter with white and hot sauce, 2 falafel, baklava, and a fountain drink for a reasonable price imo. Then as I am paying the card demon hit and bam my card was declined! So in this packed establishment my card wouldn't go through and I knew I had the money! So I sit in a corner embarrassed and on hold with my financial institution. So as I'm holding and my bank is trying to get my card working during their maintenance / update, the Halal Guys manager comes up to me with my order and a fountain cup and said \"this one is on us tonight,\" *my mouth dropped. \"Oh no sir it's ok I really have the money!\" And then he said \"well I already entered it comped so you couldn't pay if you wanted to.\" And then he smiled. My card eventually worked that night but the kindness has one this place a new long time customer! Now to the food...I know ya'll didn't think just cause the manager was so nice I'd let the food review slide. No worries the food was excellent! I enjoy just mixing the whole platter together and have the flavors dance in harmony on my palate. Very tender meat, very very good baklava, and the hot sauce!... some may want to use sparingly, but if you like spicy I suggest a nickel size portion of it is fine. We'll gotta go finish my platter"}
{"text":"The Halal Guys in Toronto has been open for three days, so the first few reviews seem a little bit harsh. I get it, you waited in the rain, the grand opening didn't have the freebies you wanted, whatever. Cut the new kid on the block some slack, and let's talk about their delicious, delicious white sauce. You could put this sauce on cardboard and I'd seriously consider giving it three stars. Luckily, they put it on delicious meats, veggies and firm, orange rice. Get a combo plate, and beware the red sauce.

Welcome to town, Halal Guys. My husband is weeping with joy over your arrival."}
{"text":"got this delivered with Uber eats to my hotel... pretty cool. not as cool as walking to the cart on the corner in NYC but pretty close. the food here is just about as good but the meat was a bit drier than NYC. I feel like the food cart locations there just put more love and effort into the food. still, this hit the spot and awesome that they are open almost all night!"}
{"text":"Just at soft opening! Soo good as usual! Super friendly staff! Im so glad this location is open its so close to my home & work!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their food! I ALWAYS stop in to get a platter and some hummus (my fave!) whenever Im in the area! And everytime I go in the staff is always so friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Some people LOVE this place....some people just think it's alright...I fall on the side of LOVE!!  I have already been to the Vegas location 5 different times since they have opened, and will definitely continue!  Been to the NYC location a few years back, and very happy to have them here in Las Vegas.  Happy Halal!"}
{"text":"Halal Guys is one of my all time favorite spots, at least back in New York. While this location doesn't have the same charm, it's still good enough to satiate the cravings."}
{"text":"I have heard that this place in New York City in the bomb and that the white sauce is to die for. There was a lot of hype with the opening of the Toronto location. I wanted to wait a little bit before I gave them ago. 

Today, I finally got to experience Halal Guys! I just got the small chicken & gyros platter. You get some salad, loads of orange rice, hearty serving of meat smothered with their signature white sauce and some pieces of pits. It was a good enough serving for one and could easily be split into two meals. I opted to not get any hot sauce because my friend had warned me about how spicy it is. So I took the safe route. I would definitely only do one or two dots to see how you fancy the hot sauce. 

I went for dinner and we were in and out within 10 minutes. It does get hot in there from all the cooking plus the sun shining in, so we ate outside. But the warmth would be great on a frigid winter day! 

I can't wait to go again. Maybe even pick up some on the way home when I'm downtown. Seriously though, I need more of that garlic sauce in my life."}
{"text":"Deliver for them a lot! Always smells sooo good. I've only gotten the chance to try their baklava tho which is the perfect pastry and so delicious."}
{"text":"Grand local avec terrasse arriere, bcp de tables, fast food, ca depanne ! Gyros, pita, poutine etc etc.."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with one particular employee Johnnie who not only recommended great food but had a great attitude.  Totally made our night awesome. Food was great and baklava is a staple. Hands down the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"There are a couple good things about this place, none of which are the food.

The staff was friendly. The place is decently clean. The food though? The food was mediocre at best. I ordered a small falafel plate. It took 4 minutes to come out and they brought it to my table. It came with four falafel pieces on a bed of rice pilaf, a side of iceberg lettuce and chopped tomatoes with quarters of pita.

The falafel was burnt and when I tried to pierce a piece with my plastic fork, it nearly broke. The rice was bland. The lettuce and tomato was sad because I could tell the lettuce was old. The pita was hard and chewy and the hummus was too acidic. As for the sauces, their famous white sauce was basically mayo and their tahini was tasteless. It was actually all pretty tasteless. And for the price? It's an awful value for a mediocre meal. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place. The food isn't completely inedible, but for the price and quality, you're better off going somewhere else. Almost anywhere else.

Side notes, they don't offer tzatziki sauce and we overhead an employee pronounce gyro as \"jie-row.\" If you were looking for an authentic Greek place, keep looking. This is not the place."}
{"text":"Everything i'm in NYC I have to get The Halah Guys so when it opened up in Vegas, I couldn't be happier! So good!"}
{"text":"My first time trying gyro was an awesome experience! I heard this place was the bomb in Cali, and seeing the stars level here in Vegas I'm quite surprised. I actually really enjoyed everything from the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out.

Service- 5/5. Super nice and helpful. Very friendly and talkative!

Food- 4/5 Well obviously it's my first time having gyro so I can't compare it to anything else. It was delicious and filling and a great serving size seeing that it filled both the honey and I up. The white sauce is soooo yummy, whatever it is. And I really liked the flavor the jalape√±os gave the meat. Pita bread all the way too, give me more of that!!!!

Price- 3/5 A little more on the pricey side. I mean it's just $1 more to get the large so why not get the large and save it for later if you can't finish it.

Location- 3/5 Seeing that it's located in Spring Mtn is good and bad. Bad cause it's far away from home!!!! And near the strip. But it's good because everything on that street is pretty much open late and they're open til 4am!!! WOW!

Overall, I like halal guys. Thank you for opening my eyes up to new things."}
{"text":"Excited try the Halal Guys from New York.
All employees are very cheerful. Was not disappointed - good food. Be careful about the hot sauce. It is HOT!!
Not enough dining area, parking was very difficult.
Wish they have a dress code. Several girls were there only bikini thong swimsuits. Not too classy."}
{"text":"I really liked the halal guys but I also went to their opening so service was on point!!

I tried the classic combo platter obviously and it was fantastic. The white sauce made it even better. I didn't try the hot sauce but heard it was was HOT HOT HOT!! It was delicious and filling!

I see a lot of people comparing it to the truck in NYC. Ive never had it but  now I want to try it to compare!!

They also gave us a piece of baklava afterwards. Key to my heart much??

I loved it there and would totally return although it's kind of far from me so I don't think I'd go out of my way."}
{"text":"Not worth it. We came here a week after their grand opening and waited almost an hour to try Halal Guys. The service here is good and the portions are decent but the food itself? Pretty underwhelming to say the least. We got a few platters to share and while the beef was solid the chicken was dry. Not too impressed by the falafel balls either. They were on the small side and also dry. The infamous white sauce was great but the spicy sauce? Man, is that spicy! I would recommend mixing it with the white sauce to create more of a spicy mayo or avoiding it all together. 

All in all, even without the long wait time I don't think I would come back. I can get the same dish at any other middle eastern restaurant for the fraction of the price. Or shell out money to get a great meal at Tabule."}
{"text":"The hype train that is Halal guys has finally arrived in Toronto. The food here comes in hearty portions but the star will always be their signature white sauce-make sure to ask for extra sauce! Otherwise, the flavour of the food is fairly bland without it...

This is one of those meals that you'd probably crave for once in a while, but it's not something you'd want to eat all the time. Worth checking out though Imo."}
{"text":"Excellent choice of meats and combinations. Never dry, always a nice tender juicy flavors. My favorite is the baklava. Prepared just the right sweetness and crunch!"}
{"text":"Coming from Southeast Michigan, the Arab capital of North America, I am a bit of a Middle Eastern food snob. This place was aight but definitely not as good or fresh as the food back home. 

I took the Yelp tips seriously and ordered extra extra sauce on my mixed falafel and chicken bowl. I also opted against the supposedly super duper hot sauce. I think the extra sauce helped moisten the (somewhat dry) chicken and the (not so great) falafels. In the bowl, there was shredded taco-like lettuce and tomatoes that didn't add much to the flavor. The pita bread was dry and definitely wasn't fresh. Bowl toppings were limited and the kalamata olives added the most flavor. The small side of hummus ($1) wasn't the best and I actually ended up throwing it away. All in all, the food seemed a bit prefabricated and didn't seem as authentic or homemade as what I'm used to. 

I am sure this place is a nice, convenient option for some folks. The service was pleasant and efficient. I am glad I gave it a shot but I think I'd opt for another spot for my next Middle Eastern cuisine fix."}
{"text":"Great food, portions were decent. Spicy hummus, is very spicy. Usually spicy isn't spicy enough. We come often and plan to return."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break when i was attending a seminar at the Rio. This place was very close and I knew would be cheaper than the hotel's restaurants. The place was not busy at all so service was quick. Not to mention really friendly and helpful. I ordered the combo platter and that was more than enough for me. I couldn't finish it honestly. It was flavorful and that white sauce was a nice addition to my dish. Prices were not bad and I got a free baklava dessert with my yelp check in."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to eat at Halal Guys.

Ordered the Beef Gyro and Chicken Platter, Chicken Gyro Sandwich and Beef Gyro Sandwich along with the Falafel. Both the Beef and Chicken are pretty good and we selected the white sauce over the meats. I am more a beef gyro person, but the chicken was also good and juicy considering it was mainly white meat and I prefer dark meat.

The combo platter comes in two sizes and includes a salad with slices of pita. 

Could really do without the Falafel which is a deep fried ball of peas.

The menu is simple and the counter is quick with prices geared more for lunch style prices. 

This restaurant was very hiped up coming to Tempe next to ASU and is in a nice small strip mall just North of the Dutch Bros. The good thing is the strip mall has not only Halal Guys but Even Stevens Sandwich Shop and Ahipoki getting ready to open soon.

Will definitely be back when I am around ASU."}
{"text":"Awesome! I've read bas reviews here and I can only imagine that it's coming from their Halal competition. I've been to the New York Cart several times..

Things I've read that are completely lies:

-Red sauce is not the same
correction: it's the same and it's damn hot and awesome if you like spicy

-they charge for extra sauce
correction: they never charged me for extra sauce and I ask for a lot on it plus extra packets

-They are twice the price
correction: their large platter is 12.99+tax (just a little under $15). The NYC cart is $7 USD (with the exchange rate that's $9.25 CAD). That's only a few $ more than in the US + you have to consider that we have much higher taxes and that the location is not in a food cart but an actual restaurant). When I heard Halal Guys was coming to Montreal, I expected it to be AT LEAST 2X  more and was more than willing to pay for it so I am pleasantly surprised about the current pricing.

-They doesn't taste like the other Halal restaurants in Montreal
Affirmation: You are absolutely right! And it's Soon much better than any other place in MTL, it beat all others I've tried and I can tell you that after living in Montreal for over 15 years."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and service! I've had better falafel here then in Jerusalem! Efficient assembly line style and a great price for excellent food!"}
{"text":"I didnt like the gyro beef, it was too oily! I was comparing it to the beef ive tried in cali and ny. Too slow servers but great customer service. I would go back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"Great local Mediterranean and Middle Eastern restaurant... The food was cooked fresh to order and the portions were huge! The most delicious halal meat I've ever eaten in Las Vegas! The service was excellent and the prices were reasonable too. I would definitely recommend The Halal Guys to all my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Ayeee for being the 500th review. I like it here becuase its a nice balanced meal. Good source of protein with nice flavor. A go to when in the area for lunch"}
{"text":"Ive been to the Tempe location as well but this one is by far better! The staff knows what they are doing and my food was prepared quickly and accurately. I liked the addition of the veggies on top of the platters if you want them. They didn't have this the last time I ate her. The white sauce is really good and adds a nice flavor to the platters. The hot sauce is HOT! Proceed with caution! I add it myself by using a few drops and mixing it in. I can handle a good amount of spice but this hot sauce really is fire"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for over a month now! I love that it's open late on thurs fri and sats- 4 am! That's awesome. Seems like they are still working some kinks out with the new employees but the food was great! I ordered the regular platter with gyro. Next time I'll get the small I think. The hot sauce is freaking hot!!!!! Let this be a warning to you. It is not your average hot sauce. I used half of a packet and that was more than enough for me, it was soooo spicy and I can handle spicy pretty well. No wonder they only gave me 1 packet when I asked for the hot sauce on the side. The service was below average but I'll let that slide since they are brand new. They forgot my pita bread, which I didn't realize I was supposed to get until I heard someone else ask about it. The girl at the registered seemed to need a bit of help. But other than that I had a good dinner. Solid 4 stars. Wish there was better parking though, I parked behind the building and walked around front. Not sure if that's allowed?"}
{"text":"I was super excited when I found out that they were finally going to open a Halal guys out here in Vegas. My husband kept talking about how good it was in New York so we were glad they decided to come out here. 

It's not the same as the original one in New York but the food was still delicious. The restaurant it self is very small inside with limited seating. We've never had the chance to dine in since there's never usually a table to sit at. I've personally been back a few times since they've opened and always get the combo, but will most likely try other things in the future."}
