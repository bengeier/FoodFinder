{"text":"After another ketchup-y plate of pad-thai at a local restaurant, I decided that I had to hunt for a great traditional version in Toronto. Mission accomplished!

A very late dinner on Pi-Tom's patio coupled with pleasantly humid weather made a few of us reminisce of travels to Asia. Usually bustling & full during dinner, we arrived around 9pm and had full reign of the patio! Still decorated from the Pride Parade, the colourful patio is enveloped in plants and trees, making you forget that you're in the downtown core.  

Yum Mamuang (Mango Salad)
Green mango, red onion, chili, mint leaves, lemon juice
A great start to our dinner, the ingredients were fresh and the lemon juice-chili combination complimented the mangoes quite well. The mangoes were ripe, but still had enough bite so you can get a good stab with your fork each time. The balance between fruit and vegetables was great - too much red onion can kill a mango salad.


Fish Cakes
Deep-fried ground white fish mixed with chili and long bean
What a pleasant surprise - when I heard \"fish cakes\" I was expecting spongy slivers of processed fish. Instead, we received tasty well-marinated slices accompanied with a hearty peanut sauce. The sauce was full of peanuts and flavour with a smooth, non-oily texture. I ended up scooping leftovers on some rice, yum!

Chicken Satay
4 skewers of marinated chicken served with cucumber salad
Tender, juicy chicken with a sweet & salty flavour - I wish these were sold on the street. They'd be the perfect snack! A simple yet winning appetizer.

The servers were very friendly. The food came quick throughout the night, and upon request they gave us a jug of water to save the waitress the hassle of constantly refilling our glasses. We did not realize that they closed at 10pm, but they did not rush us out of the restaurant and did not seem annoyed that we were unknowingly staying well past their closing time.
 
Authentic Pad Thai
Thai rice noodles stir fried with sweet & sour tamarind sauce, chicken, shrimp, root vegetable, bean sprouts, tofu, coconut sauce, wrapped in a fried egg crepe
What a difference from ketchup-based pad thai! Tamarind is by far the superior sauce. While ketchup (or \"sweet and sour tomato sauce\" as some restaurants call it) is very sugary, tamarind gave it a more tangy flavour and the portion in the egg crepe was quite generous. It wasn't sopping with sauce, and there meat, noodle, and sprouts ratio was great, and everything was cooked quite nicely

Duck Curry
Roasted duck in curry, lychee, bamboo shoots, peppers, and basil
Full of bell peppers, broccoli and bamboo shoots, this aromatic curry was deliciously packed with flavour and roasted duck. To be honest, I didn't notice lychee...probably because I was too busy wolfing everything down!The curry was wonderfully seasoned; sweet, comforting and the favourite dish of the night for our table.

Peanut Chicken
Chicken stir-fried with peanut sauce & long bean
The simple peanut chicken dish was very flavourful with moist bites of chicken. As expected, it had a very strong peanut taste, but wasn't at all pasty in texture. While yummy on a summer night, I can really see myself enjoying a bowl in the winter - and Pi-Tom's does delivery!

Plamuek Pad Prik (Spicy Squid)
Squid in hot pepper sauce with bamboo shoots and basil sauce
A generous offering of vegetables and squid, this plate disappeared quickly! Green beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, onions, and squid, all smothered and cooked in an addictive basil sauce. Even when the food was gone, we were spooning the sauce on rice until the plate was super clean!

Goong Pong Ka-Ree (Stir Fried Shrimp Dinner Special)
Stir-fried shrimp with curry powder, egg, onion, chili garlic sauce, sweet peppers.  Served with pineapple fried rice and pineapple salad.
Another favourite of the table - although the pineapples were canned, the salad was nice to scoop up with the shrimp and rice. The fried rice wasn't greasy (something that I'm usually wary of), and the shrimp had a great kick that kept us going back for more. 

By the end of the night, all of us left happy & satisfied. Every single dish was full of flavour, the service was pleasant, and the patio was welcoming. A surprisingly delicious find, just off of Yonge Street and I will be back to try their soups and sticky-rice dessert!

*Update*
Pi-Tom's Mango Sticky Rice  (~$6)
Thumbs down. I suppose I can't fault them for the blah mango - peak season has come and gone. 
Mango Sticky Rice is supposed to be salty & sweet...I would've liked a bit more of a salty flavour in the coconut-milk. I could be wrong, but perhaps the rice wasn't soaked enough in the coconut-milk or maybe there wasn't enough (to my liking anyways. I'm no Thai-dessert expert) because I would've liked a milkier consistency."}
{"text":"We purchased the redflagdeal coupon for pi-Tom. It was the worst restaurant experience even for the 'discounted' price we paid.
The mango salad is just sliced raw mango. Basil duck has 5 tiny pieces of duck that are mostly fatty duck skin. We asked the waiter if it's normal he said that's the normal amt of meat in that dish but they will add more vegetables to it. Authentic pad Thai has shrimps that taste like rubber. 
In the end, we got charged 13% gratuity even though we are completely dissatisfied with the service."}
{"text":"Discovered this through Yelp on my iPhone and I am SO glad I did. After being seriously disappointed by the supposedly awesome Salad King (TERRIBLE FOOD ALERT!!) I was glad I tried Pi Toms.

I had the Lunch Combo 11:
Hot & Sour Soup
Chuchee fish & Rice.

It came up to about $13 and was just DELICIOUS!

I will be trying the branch closer to my apartment as soon as possible."}
{"text":"I remembered this restaurant being delicious.  Sadly, the curry was bland albeit beautiful!  Pad Thai was ketchup like - somewhat like spring rolls (booo). 

The service was slow, but there were several large groups at the restaurant whos food had just come up so I cannot find fault with the service. 

Overall, I won't be coming back which is too bad.  They have a great patio & it is always nice to go there in the summer months."}
{"text":"Food poisoning within hours of dining here!

It was delicious, but boy did I pay for it in more ways than one.

I had the mango chicken with rice lunch combo. The soup was very flavourful, the portions were decent and the presentation was nice. I genuinely enjoyed it while I was eating it, but the outcome of dining here was not worth it."}
{"text":"Pi-Toms is my favourite Thai place ever! I usually order in on a rainy (or hungover) day. I change my order every time, and it's always the best. My favourite is the Green Curry (veggie) and the Vegan Delight.
Every single time I get my food from Pi-Toms it is piping hot (even if I take my sweet time getting there or leave it sitting for a few minutes once I get it home) and flavourful and spicy and perfect. They also have the best deep-fried tofu around. 
The first time I ate there I ate inside the restaurant with my grandparents and my at-the-time bf, and the service was good and efficient, and the bill wasn't too bad. I've only had takeout since then (for no other reason than I'd rather eat in my own apartment) but they are still always super nice when I go pickup my food. And fast. Usually it only takes about 15 minutes. I've never had to wait when I go pick it up, it's always waiting for me.
If you love, like, or have never had Thai, go to Pi-Toms! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is very annoying. Twice in a row when i went there i said i wanted my food spicy as possible and twice it was completely without spice. Get it right"}
{"text":"I have had great interest to try Pi-Tom for a while, since I seen many vouchers bought back then at Dealfind. I heard their authentic pad thai was popular so I decided to give that a try on an empty sunday night 9 pm. Its surrounded by egg crepe which is unique in a way, and the taste is good, but not the best pad thai. Its definitely better than some other so-called authentic thai out there. The pad thai didn't have the ketchup flavour that Canadians are use to, instead, they use tamarind. 

I also got the thai ice tea with milk which was sweet tasting and refreshing. Also got an appetizer good for sharing which were the shrimp chips with peanut sauce for $5. 

My brother got the curry shrimp which is nice flavour and my gf got the glass noodle stir fry which was decent flavour, but dark colour like soy sauce.

Overall the food is not bad and I won't mind coming back to try other stuff. But I'm certain there are better 'Authentic' Thai food out there for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a couple friends. It was a nice day so we sat out on the patio. It's a laid back place just off Yonge street. Service was a bit slow and inattentive. Food was good, but could've been a bit hotter (temperature wise). They could've thrown a few more shrimps on their dishes (only 2 on the Pad Thai). Gratuities added to the bill automatically."}
{"text":"Tasty and price is decent for the portion sizes.  I usually get the standard stuff - chicken pad Thai, spring rolls and mango salad.  I really have no clue what \"authentic\" Thai food is supposed to taste like so I'm not saying this is or is not authentic.  It just tastes good to me.  Pad Thai slightly on the ketchupy side.  I find its a bit inconsistent though - weekdays tend to be better than weekends."}
{"text":"We ordered spicy seafood salad as an appertizer, the salad was tasty but there was only 2 shrimps, 2 mussels and 2 calarmaris. For the main course, we ordered spicy lamb and sweet and sour fish. The spicy lamb was terrible, I had way better Thai food from any fast food joint. The sweet and sour fish  had so  much sugar that you couldn't really taste the fish and veggie. It was so disappointing that they could screw up almost all dishes. 
We had been there several times. The quality has gone downhill significantly and it is not like it used to be.
There are tons of Thai restaurant in Toronto, don't waste your money in Pi-Tom."}
{"text":"I came here on a sunday night to an understaffed restaurant. We waited a long time for our food and when it arrived, it was cold. Staff were rushed (because there were only two of them) and inattentive. The food was mostly good, but nothing out of league of your typical Thai restaurant.  Portions were generally small. Ordered a fish dish an the fish was minuscule -- very disappointing. On top of the cold food, small portions and non-existent staff, they imposed a 15% gratuity on us. Only come here if you have a groupon or online deal!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai Food! Best I've had to date. I love their sticky rice. Especially the one with a hint of coconut milk flavor. Definitely order the curry if you're coming here. Another favorite dish is the Authentic Pad Thai. Truly a hidden treasure amongst a sea of bad restaurants around downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"We went here after buying the DealFind voucher. We ordered the duck salad, pumpkin soup, spring rolls, mango chicken, and two drinks.

Pumpkin soup was great - nice and coconutty; great flavour! Spring rolls were your run-of-the-mill spring rolls. Duck was kind of tough and salad was your average lettuce, tomato, and mushrooms, but drowned in Thai dressing. The dressing itself was tasty, but overwhelmed the entire dish. Mango chicken had an odd taste like bad sweet-and-sour, and like the salad, was drowned in sauce.

Total bill (before discount voucher) came to about $55 for two people. Not overly-expensive, but also not particularly cheap. 

Will return at least once, as I bought a second voucher, so they've got another chance to impress. Overall, not a *bad* Thai place, but not a great one either. There are definitely tastier and cheaper places you could go."}
{"text":"Recently visited this Thai restaurant. Regardless of the horrible reviews, I thought I would try it for myself. Needless to say it was awful & I should have listened to the reviews.  Ordered the calamari & it was sooo rubbery that I couldn't even break it down chewing.  After sending that back, I ordered the pumpkin soup.  That wasn't bad...but I've had better.  I ordered the Thai fried rice & that lacked a lot of flavour. I must have ordered the worst dish on the menu when I ordered the Tamarind Beef.  Out came a few pieces of what looked like shrivelled up beef covered in lettuce, carrots & some strange sweet sauce.  I couldn't even eat it. At that point, I left everything & vowed to never return."}
{"text":"I had a voucher to redeem about $40 worth of stuff here, which is a bit much for just one person, so I came here with a friend. The voucher said reservations were required, but I missed that detail when I got there. The waiter serving us said it was okay though, and he took it from me before serving us. 

It wasn't too busy when we got there, and the food arrived at a good pace. I ordered Pad Thai, my friend got Authentic Pad Thai, and we ordered some mango smoothies and an app on the side. The Pad Thai was a bit strange in taste and look, but still pretty good, and the Authentic one came with a thin layer of scrambled eggs.

Service was, overall, pretty good. The food was decent. It's not my absolute favorite place to go to, but I'd come back here for a quick lunch or take-out."}
{"text":"I HAD to go there three times. Each time was a disaster. The service wasn't good; ordered tea but just got hot water instead after half an hour. The food wasn't good either. In general the environment is unpleasant."}
{"text":"Absolutely unacceptable service. Ordered two soups and a noodle dish for delivery. Was advised it will take 45 minutes. After waiting for an hour I called the restaurant back to be told that the driver just picked up the food and it will take 15 more minutes!  There were no apologies or any form acknowledgement of the unacceptable wait time. When told this was unacceptable service all June - the woman on the phone - had to say was \" do you still want the food.\" 

When the food arrived after an hour and 15 minutes later it was not even what I ordered!!! I ended up canceling the whole thing.

Needless to say, I will never give money to an establishment with such piss poor service."}
{"text":"I went with a wagjag coupon. They somehow modified the rules on the fly that coupon can't be redeemed against their daily special.  It irked me a bit, but I'll let this slide.

Then we sat their for 10 minutes without any attention.  Then we waited another 20 minutes (at least) for food.  I had Authentic Pad Thai, Pineapple fried rice and cashew shrimp.  Pad Thai was the only dish I liked although it's still a bit salty.   It was unique: pad thai wrapped in a crepe.  They put way too much oil in the fried rice.  

The final thing that bothered me was that they knew their service isn't top notch, so they included gratuity of 13% in the bill.  Normally I do 15-20%, but for my experience that night, I wouldn't even do 10%.  

I wouldn't go there again (not even with a coupon).  However, if you still want to go, try their pad thai."}
{"text":"Greetings were not welcoming initially, gradual warm-up, needs improvement.  We were the 1st ones there!  Slowly, more patrons showed up, started to get busy.  Decor boring, mustard/brown small uninviting.  Service was prompt, attentive and persistent, no delays. Food tasty, brought nuances of Thai scents sweet&salty, chilli, cocconut and garlicy.  Not impressed with portion size of dishes, prov. One serving per patron-rediculous stingy portions for dinner.  Really felt like a stingy tasting, instead of a Wholesome Hearty Hot Holiday Meal.  
   Ordered consist of 3 main dishes( thai beef, shrimp thai (disapp. That no multi seafood dish, esp. For a thai rest. 1-Assperrigus)  4-soups (cocconut, pumpkin-disapptmt-HALF bowl but tasty.  2 desserts  (one good size crepe w/ ice cream-pricey ~$7,  1-sweet sticky rice  ~$6.

Going back Pi Tom's-----Restaurant can adjust heat spiciness and Food Allergies per dish, which is a bonus, means freshness and care given to customizing per patron, many thai est. Will not adjust at all !!!   I will continue to go, hopefully they have made improvements by then.  Oh also,  they do provide $15 For $40 Worth food vouchers.  So, I will go many more times towards perfection, but will try Jarvis local."}
{"text":"Been to this place at least 5 times now.

Get their authentic pad thai first. None of that kao san road greasy street pad thai, just a huge bowl of real pad thai wrapped in an egg crepe. No ketchup in the authentic pad thai.

Otherwise, get the regular pad thai, which is bigger than Salad King / Kao San Road's portions. I don't get what the hype is about with those places. I would pick Pi Tom's over them!

Anyways, to reiterate;

Do you wanna starve to death? If not, get the authentic pad thai or just the pad thai!"}
{"text":"Had to visit Emergency due to food poisoning.  My friend got sick as well, but not as serious as I was.  I was sick for the whole week due to food poisoning, had to visit Emergency on the second day of having their food.

Do not recommend this place at all and will never visit this place again, this was my first food poisoning experience that lasted more than 1 day."}
{"text":"This place has a nice patio outside.  The hot & sour soup was way too strong and I couldn't finish it.  The spring roll was nice and filling.  I had the pad thai as well.  It was a bit sweeter than I usually like but the flavour was good and not overly salty.  It's not a place I would go out of the place to visit but it's not horrible either."}
{"text":"Pi Tom is quite alright, you know!  

Finally, I got to try Pi Tom's foods.  I took a friend and my family there for lunch last Saturday.  What a lovely lunch that was.  We arrived just before the noon rush.  Man, this place filled up fast!

Dad enjoyed his Tom Kha soup.  He had never tried a soup with coconut milk before and thought it was tasty.

The sweet and creamy Pumpkin soup was delicious as well.  Light and flavorful.  For some odd reason, I thought this dish would pair so well with garlic naan.  (I wonder if Katmandu would deliver Garlic Naan to Pi Tom.)

Pad Kee-Mao had the right amount of saltiness and kick from the chili, which I love!  If you're looking for a delightful lunch dish with a punch, order this!  

My friend had no complaints on his Duck Salad.  He thought it was well balanced in terms of flavors.  \"The duck pieces are scrumptious,\" he added.

We loved the sauce in the Peanut Chicken.  The creaminess of the sauce and light crunch from the crushed peanuts gave this dish a nice texture.  Put a spoonful of this over jasmine rice and scoop the whole thing up.  Let me tell you, yum!

Nice cozy atmosphere.  Loved the big windows.  Good size outdoor patio (for warmer weather, hurry up summer).  Staff were fast and energetic."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with about a dozen tables plus some patio space. They're not licensed, which sent at least one table packing shortly after talking to the server. Service was slow, but the kitchen was fast. Shame they only had one guy working the whole room. Food was really nice. I'm easily amused, so when my rice came out shaped like a puffy star, I just about clapped. The Vegan Delight main course was really good."}
{"text":"Not sure what is up with this place as it used to be one of my favorite Toronto eateries.  Last week I wanted to have a late lunch.  Sat on the patio and was promptly given a very dirty menu by the waitress. (Ewww!)  About 10 minutes went by and I hadn't seen the waitress again, I gave up and walked out.  Could be a one off bad day for this place but I was really disappointed.   Too many other choices on Younge Street to become a so-so restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have stayed in this part of Toronto.  I was desperate to find some good grub close to my hotel.  I set out and walked two blocks in each cardinal direction from my hotel and Pi Tom looked the most promising.

On my first visit to a new Thai place, I always order Pad Thai.  If the Pad Thai sucks or is average, I know the rest of the food will be pretty uninspiring.

They offer Pad Thai and \"Authentic Pad Thai\".  I opted for the Authentic.  It included chicken and small shrimps with noodles wrapped in a crepe.  This was a first for me.  There was an excellent balance of sweet, sour and salty.  I added liberal doses of Thai chili paste to add heat.  

I also had an order of curry rice.  Good _gravy_; this is enough for 4 appetizers!  It was so good though, that I took the rest back to the hotel to reheat later.

On my second visit, I branched out a little.   I ordered an appetizer of Fried Calamari to start.  Calamari is tricky.  You have to either cook it very quickly, or for a long time to make it tender.  Pi Tom cooked it to fried tender perfection.  It was only slightly chewy.  Bravo.

My main course was beef curry.  Although the cut of beef was a mongrel cut of fatty meat, the curry sauce overcame any qualms with the meat.  I would compare this curry broth with the Roti Prata dipping sauce at Banana Leaf in Milpitas, CA.  It was fantastic.

Pi tom's is right across the street from the Hilton Garden Inn (Jarvis and Dundas)."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai in the city- IMO- better than khan San road. Authentic pad Thai in egg wrapping is to die for!!"}
{"text":"best (authentic) pad thai i found in town!

enough said!"}
{"text":"I love this Thai restaurant. I recently moved out of this area and tried a few other Thai places in the King/Bathurst area but none compare to Pi-Tom's. Even though my new place is outside of their delivery area, I will be making the trip to Pi-Tom's for Thai food since I haven't found anything that compares. 

Green Curry Chicken and vegetables is amazing, the portion sizes are very large.

Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've got this thing for Thai glass noodles with shrimp.  I also like spicy Thai food, so I asked for it HOT at Pi Tom's. This was one of the best I\"ve had. Spicy with extra sauce on the side. Overflowing with large chunks of fresh vegetables and shrimp.  Portions are huge and I ended up taking half of it home.  Sticky rice with peanut sauce as an appetizer was just alright. Service was quick, clean restaurant, though the place could use a bit of sprucing up."}
{"text":"This used to be a favourite go-to spot when I had meetings nearby.  In fact just reading others' reviews is making me crave their lunch special with soup, spring roll and my fav - a generous helping of basil chicken with lods of veggies, rice in the shape of a star and lots of light, spicy sauce. 

This was a great restaurant for small lunches, but they were also very accommodating when I brought a group of 15 for a working lunch and had us in and out in quickly and efficiently.  Bonus is a free lunch when you make a reservation for a group of more than eight people."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  

Disappointed that .... 

1)  The rice offered with the meal was dry, blandish, and I didn't see any option for coconut rice

2)  Seriously lacking vegetarian options

3)  Food was bland - ordered spicy noodles (noodles were not spicy), some sort of duck dish (tasted like chinese cuisine - and not good chinese cuisine either), and some sort of mushroom dish (not memorable at all) 

4)  Prices are high for the quantity and quality

5)  About an hour after my meal, had a bit of a stomach ache"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place a lot more than I did because it had a good Yelp rating so I convinced my boyfriend we should try it while we were on vacation in Toronto. We just got carry-out so maybe that affected our experience, but the food just wasn't as good as Thai we usually get near home. I didn't DISLIKE my tofu Pad See Iew... the tofu and noodles were good, but the overall flavor wasn't anything special. I forgot what my boyfriend ordered, but he wasn't a huge fan so that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 3. Later he saw some other nearby Thai places and we wish we would have tried one of them instead, but this was RIGHT next to our hotel so that's why I didn't do more research. Oh well! It looked cute inside, so maybe if we had eaten there and/or ordered something else we would have liked it more."}
{"text":"Made reservations, came here with 2 gfs and a groupon - had a great time!  Service was fast and friendly and best of all - the food was delicious!  We all agreed we would be happy to come back and pay full price.  

Lots of veggie options as well."}
{"text":"I don't know why I do this to myself. There are only two Thai restaurants I've ever enjoyed in this city, and the rest are usually awful.

I came here for some quick noodles before meeting a friend. I ordered the Thai Spicy Noodles and was just... let's put it this way. I'm not angry, I'm disappointed. Actually, I'm a bit angry, but mostly in myself for making the same dumb mistake again.

The noodles were those wide, flat rice noodles, which I ordinarily love. The problem was, there was so much sauce, that they were super slippery and I couldn't stab or scoop them with a fork. Wait, SCOOP with a fork? Yeah, they were also so torn apart that there wasn't one noodle that was over 2 inches long. Most came in about 1. I was pretty hungry, so this was ridiculously annoying for me. Eventually, I flagged the server and asked for chopsticks, and YES, I know that you don't eat fried noodles with chopsticks in Southeast Asian cuisine, but these were impossible to pick up otherwise. 

When I was able to get more than one noodle at a time into my mouth, I found that parts of the dish were cold. Not cooled down... COLD. The place was busy and frankly, I had places to be and very little faith that they would improve on my meal so I didn't send it back. I ate as much as I could (with great difficulty) in the time frame I had and just left the rest.

Not sure why it was so busy, maybe they're better at other dishes, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to here more than 5 times already and each time I kept returning with new deal vouchers. My girlfriend and I love to come here whenever we can get a voucher. I'll admit that first few times going, the atmosphere were uninspiring, but their food was tasty. I've tried the karee shrimp, peanut chicken, and lemon grass beef and chicken so far and each time they came out good. Their food might not be the \"best\", but I find it good enough for my taste bud. Having only paid $20 for $40 of food with vouchers just makes me want to keep returning."}
{"text":"Went to Pi-Tom's today with the amazing Karl R. I had a DealFind coupon for $40 worth of Thai cuisine and the 2 of us definitely overindulged.

We had the following:

Duck Salad - Wow... Although the salad itself was quite tasty, you can smell it coming from a mile away.  My mother grew up in Vietnam, and I am no stranger to fish sauce, but keeping in mind I was sick and congested and I still found the smell to be overpowering - you may not want to introduce your cousin Cameron from England to such an \"ethnic\" dish.  If I was not Asian, I may have shunned the dish due to its \"funky\" smell.  The duck was quite flavourful, the skin was crispy, while the meat was relatively tender.

Coconut Soup w/ Chicken - My first time having a coconut soup.  It was rather bland for my taste buds.  It tasted like a creamy lemon soup. I just found it to be okay.  However, I will say that the chicken was quite tender.

Peanut Chicken - This was one of my favourite dishes of the evening.  I loved the spicy zing of the dish as it toned down the richness from the peanut sauce.  The crunch from the peanuts also added a different textural component to the dish.

Authentic Pad Thai - Hands down one of the best Pad Thai I've had (though I haven't had many!).  The noodles were piping hot, and it was just the right amount of sweetness - not too overpowering.  It came with fried tofu, shrimp and chicken.  YUM-MY!

Coconut Rice - Meh, for me it just tasted like steamed rice.  The coconut was lost in the steaming process maybe?

Service was average.  Our water glasses were topped up when they ran low.  We were thoroughly stuffed.  It was a bit cold as we sat by the window, so if you're going in the winter, you may want to avoid sitting by the window!"}
{"text":"Great little Thai restaurant located near the corner or Yonge and Alexander Streets (across the street from the Marriott Courtyard). Popular during summer months due to the presence of a sizeable outdoor dining area, the restaurant offers a variety of Thai dishes at affordable prices. Food is better than neighboring 'Fickle in Love' restaurant around the corner on Yonge Street. Service is good and it attracts many local residents and tourists due to its' ideal location and of course, good food."}
{"text":"Pork Fried Rice $12 - A+

I think the name Pi-Tom is inviting and it translates to mean \"older brother Tom.\"  If you're staying at the downtown Hilton Garden Inn, this restaurant is located conveniently right across the street.  I came here for dinner on a Monday night and the place was pretty quiet.  The restaurant is nicely decorated (casual atmosphere) and there are both tables and booths to choose from.  They serve beer and wine, and I went with wine for dinner.  It was a generous glass of Cabernet for $7.  They also offer house wine around $5.  The service was great - attentive but not overbearing.  

There were many things to choose from on the menu, including different kinds of fried rice and noodle dishes to a variety of specialty fish dishes.  They even offer duck, which I was tempted to try, so perhaps next time.  The pork fried rice was full of goodies - pork, Chinese broccoli, onion, red bell peppers, egg and carrots.  It was pretty tasty and even came with a small side salad.  The portion is pretty big and I couldn't finish my meal in one sitting.

I've also carried out one of their lunch specials.  For about $10, I got an order of chicken pad Thai that came with a mango salad and a spiced pumpkin soup.  Both the salad and the soup were especially tasty.  The noodles in the pad Thai was cooked perfectly.

Other dishes I've tried:
Chicken Pad Thai lunch special - comes with a side of mango salad and spring roll.  Pretty good deal and good noodles.

Thai Fried Rice with Chicken - Comes with Chinese broccoli, eggs and tomatoes.  Good Thai flavoring, but I would have added more soy sauce if I had some on deck."}
{"text":"sometimes I actually want ketchupy pad thai. 
this place does it right and is so far the best I've found on delivery in the area.
the spring rolls are big but tasted like an overused deep fryer.
when they said delivery would be over an hour and it shows up within 40 minutes Im especially happy, so 4 stars for Pi-Tom."}
{"text":"Nice papaya and mango fruit shakes to start but they though they taste nice FYI they are thickened by condensed milk I think. Glass noodles stir fry comes with fresh veggies and is pleasant but their Authentic pad Thai is a better and tastier choice. Patio is nice as well as inside."}
{"text":"With a $40 deal voucher on hand, Dora P and I were ready to indulge.

Started off with the Avocada smoothie and the Coconut soup w/ chicken. The smoothie was delicious. Probably the best one I've tried so far. It was a refreshing drink on a hot summer day. 

The Coconut soup w/ chicken was the definition of creamy, citrus/lemon-y tang, and overcooked chicken, but that's all there is to it. 

Authentic Pad Thai - There was the option for the regular pad thai for a dollar less. But why go for that if you could go for the \"authentic\" option just below. Blows my mind. It came wrapped in an omelet, with veggies all around. The pad thai was flavourful, coming with chicken, small tofu squares, and shrimp (2 small ones as a matter of fact - Almost lost count)

Cashew chicken - Most of the reviews were on the peanut chicken, but I tried to be different and opted for a different kind of nut. Curses for not comforming to the latest trends. The dish was just OK. I did find a couple of cashews, but the entire dish was filled with onion and red peppers. 

Ended off with the FBI (Fried Banana w/ Icecream). Oh, the 1 scoop of ice cream is a dollar more. The fried banana was actually quite tasty. Crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. Tasted great with the ice cream.

Where Pi-Tom lost my stars was the service. We were the only customers there and even then, it was difficult to wave down the waiter. And as mentioned and a fair warning ** Auto-gratuity on your bill AND tax on the total of that** I was quite annoyed with that. But it seems like a lot of venues are starting this.

Maybe worth coming back if service improves."}
{"text":"Jarvis is not really an area I frequent but our friends had some sort of coupon for Pi-Tom's new location. I guess they are trying to drive some business which is a smart move! So points for getting involved...

Our waitress was super awesome. Our table of six and our waitress was a good chemistry and I knew it was going to be a good meal. Granted it wasn't very busy but drinks orders were placed and all arrived in a matter of minutes. I like this. And when she came with the drinks she asked if we were ready to order, and we sort of did it on the fly -- asking her opinion on certain dishes and she basically walked us through our order.

The food came fast and furious and we ate it up like vacuums. Everything we ordered was delicious and the service was dead-on. I can't really think of two more important things than this, so Pi-Tom's gets two thumbs up from me upon my first visit."}
{"text":"Went here a few times and doubt I'll come back.  The quality and freshness is so poor.  The fried rice tastes like soy sauce and nothing else.  Go to salad king."}
{"text":"Booooo!!!! Slow service and crappy food.
My taramind fish was cold- just asked for it
to be nuked cuz I was in a hurry. 
Sauce was too tangy I couldn't even finish it. Did I mention that the rice tasted funny?"}
{"text":"Went here because I bought a deal voucher online.  Ordered the appetizer platter, pad thai and curry chicken.  All were delicious, the appetizer platter comes with calamari, spring rolls, tofu, cold spring rolls and salad, the reg pad thai was sauced very well and had tons of chicken as did the green curry chicken.

Prices were reasonable, the 3 dishes plus an iced coffee came to about $50 with tax and tip.

I would recommended this place to my friends"}
{"text":"Bored of the usual delivery fare, I tried Pi-Tom's Thai for the first time.

What we ate:
- Spring rolls (2.5/5): Delicious but omg greasy. No good.
- Tofu Green Thai Curry (3/5): While the flavors were pretty good, the curry was TOO spicy and was the wrong consistently ( too liquid y)
- Beef Panang Curry (2.5/5) The curry was delicious, but the beef was completely over cooked and rubbery.
- Duck and basil (2.5/5): The duck was moist and flavorful but the dish was drenched in oil- no likey.

The bill: 50$

While my craving for sweet savoury curry was met, I am not a fan of the greasy-ness.

Maybe I should stop getting Thai for delivery?"}
{"text":"My review isn't so much for the food as it is for the lack of functioning online reservations. I tried to order food online with a friend of mine, it said the order had been placed annnnnnd an hour later I called and they hadn't received it, weren't terribly accommodating and didn't do anything to make it better. 

I've heard good things about the food, but I feel less than thrilled with the lack of delicious Thai food that is in my belly right now. Boo!"}
{"text":"An absolute favourite of mine....I don't understand why this place isn't getting better reviews. I love love Thai food and Pi Toms does it better than any place I have ever been to, hands down. 

I usually order Pi Tom's own version of Pad Thai....they also have a 'Traditional' version too but I prefer the restaurants own and it is delicious. The ingredients for both dishes are practically the same but Pi Toms dish uses a lighter, more subtle sauce (not ketchup like most traditional pad thai dishes) leaving the flavours of the other ingredients to be fully appreciated. They give pretty decent portion sizes....I rarely finish the entire thing but makes for a great lunch the next day...

The mango salad here is to die for! Really fresh ingredients makes this salad extra special and they use a delicious sweet dressing. 

There are many Pi Toms around Toronto but this one is my personal favourite...its on a nice, fairly quiet street just off Yonge and Wellesley , and has a cute patio complete with romantic lighting, perfect for a dinner date or a relaxing night with a friend. 
 
Great service, great place, even better food... what more can you ask for?.."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place over 10 times and it is really hit or miss.

Sometime the food is great.  Sometimes it is downright bad. I have noticed that the food isn't as good as it was before for sure.  Perhaps the introduction of the groupon deals have deteriorated the quality? No idea on that part.

Anyways on to the food!

Pumpkin soup is really great.  Rich and tasty.
Authentic pad thai is not ketchup based from what I was told and it tasted really good.
Curry chicken (thai curry) with eggplant is always good when you are sick (if you dont like eggplant you can ask for it to be removed)
Glass noodle is another great dish but a little oily sometimes (really hit or miss)

I do not like the regular pad thai here.  Tastes too much like ketchup for my taste (it says it in the menu but you know what I mean :P)

Hopefully the place comes back to its former glory but for now I'll check in every now and then."}
{"text":"Great place to have a dinner date. The restaurant is well decorated, almost spa like, the Thai food was authentic and the server was very nice. Often people order take out so the place had plenty of seating so we stayed for hours just eating and chatting, but since there's so many take-out orders you may end up waiting a little longer for your food to arrive. When the food does arrive, it becomes a spoon of satisfaction in your mouth, I highly recommend the duck salad. Will definitely be visiting again with other dates."}
{"text":"I found nothing particularly special about Pi-Tom, the name itself is quite unique and I had purchased a deal so the \"deal\" is valid for everything on the menu except for the lunch specials.

The restaurant was easily located just in the corner, the server was friendly and we were immediately seated. We ordered the Appetizer Platter, Pad See Iew, Pad Kee Mao and 2 smoothies (Mango/Strawberry). We expected the food would take a fair amount of time due to what we ordered. We waited and we got our appetizer platter, the spring rolls were greasy and the rest of the food was nothing special. After awhile longer we received our smoothies, both tasted the same even though they were difficult flavours. 

When we received our food it was average, nothing \"amazing\" about the experience and the food tasted like \"Chinese food\" nothing like Thai food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, it's just terrible."}
{"text":"Fast service on the night I went, part of 4. horrible food - deep fried calamari was so dipped in so much batter it was rock hard; tom yum soup was way too sweet instead of sour and spice; stir-fry was oily. Save you $ and time, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but not great, opting for quantity over quality.

The patio is nice, and the service is quick-- which makes it an ideal spot for lunch."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place years ago, it was one of the first places I ever had thai food. I was really looking forward to going here again since I recently moved back to the area. Felt too lazy to cook on my day off so thought it would be the perfect opportunity to see if they still measured up. 

First I checked the reviews here, and I almost didn't bother. But I'm quite happy I took the chance. Everything, while not the best I've ever had, we quite tasty!

I had the authentic pad thai, the green veggie curry, the cashew chicken and the spring rolls.

I ordered through a delivery website and went to pick up the food. It was ready in about 15 minutes, and although they normally offer the free spring rolls for orders over 30 dollars only when you order through them directly, they still added them to my order free of charge when I asked why they weren't there. They were quick and helpful although they looked very busy and I might have felt differently if I was dining in. 

Also I forgot to order rice and was quite pleased to find some in the bag when I got home! 
 
As for the food:

- the spring rolls were meh, like a slightly higher quality grocery store spring roll,

- The cashew chicken was very nicely seasoned, although it could have been a touch spicier for my tastes. The quality of the chicken was excellent, all white meat peices that had absorbed the sauce really nicely. Their  could have been more cashews, but I have yet to find a thai place ANYWHERE that puts in enough cashews, so I'm starting to think my standards are too high. 

- The green curry was also well spiced, quite hot and it had broccoli which wasn't meantion on the menu but I was very happy about. They fry their tufo before putting it in the sauce which isn't my personal favorite but was still good. Became very happy while eating this that they had included rice. 

- The sauce for both of those dishes was fairly thin 

- They authentic pad thai was quite nice, subtly seasoned and I LOVE the crepe they wrap it in. 


Overall quite a pleasant experience, and I have lots of leftovers for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Two stars because food was good. I really, really hate more than everything in the worldddddd when restaurants do cleaning or receive products with clients inside. Pi-Tom's did both. The same waitress that took my order was cleaning tables and spilled some cleaning product in me. 

Look, you have to choose if you are in maintenance hours or serving hours. You simply can't do both. It's not polite. I liked the combo I asked for, but I'm NOT COMING BACK to see mops and crates around me while I eat, because this is disgusting. 

Also, if you decide to stay inside, there's an annoying view of a locker full of clothes and food crates. You see, it's not the kind of thing you'd like to see while eating. 

Too messy for me. I didn't feel comfortable. To be honest, I felt awful."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. The highlight of my dining experience here was my mango smoothie - it was absolutely delicious and I'd order that again. That being said, I don't think I'd dine here again unless I arrived without much of an appetite. The service was terribly slow and I was so hungry I was ready to storm into their kitchen and make my own lunch! I struggled to contain myself but after a certain point it's hard to think of anything else when you're so hungry.

Everything was pretty fresh and I liked the appetizer platter, but I thought the basil chicken was missing something and the Pad Phed Talay was overwhelmed with hot spice - there wasn't much flavor after the tongue-searing heat subsided. Considering how hungry I was, the food wasn't anything special.

The patio seating is really pretty if you can find a shady spot; you would not guess it's so close to Yonge from the relaxed ambiance, although I wish they would not allow smoking here.  Bathrooms are pretty clean."}
{"text":"This is the kind of Thai place we get a lot of in California: OK service, nice ambiance, uncomfortable seating. 

But the food was awesome!

We started with the Chicken Coconut Milk soup, the broth of which was spectacular! HUGELY flavorful (Wait, I'm in Canada... flavourful) and wonderful. The chicken was cut a bit too large, but it was very nice. The main courses were excellent. The Garlic pork had a few pieces that were over-cooked and chewy, but big time flavor and the ones that were tender were amazing. The Basil Shrimp was the perfect compliment to the pork, perfectly cooked shrimp and the sauce was excellent. 

The two of us ate for just over 40 bucks, which ain't cheap, but it ain't bad neither!"}
{"text":"Food is great, I have no complaints whatsoever except maybe it's a bit on the sweet side (but that is true of pad thai in general, this is the best I've found, actually).

They know how to fry their fish, get the lunch combo with the fish.

I usually get the authentic pad thai if I go there for dinner."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant using Yelp on iPhone while walking on Yonge st one night. 

I ordered the dinner special which was some spicy chicken cutlet served with garlic rice and papaya salad. My partner ordered their popular authentic pad thai. 

I thought the portions were generous and food was tasty. Service was friendly and efficient. Would definitely visit again.

My only complain is that they used a little too much oil in the chicken, and in the pad thai. The place also didn't feel very clean... i found cobwebs by the window =|"}
{"text":"Their Pad Thai has too much red sauce which overpowers other flavours. In all honesty, I've been to this place twice already and I'm not sure I want to come back when you have Salad King 1 subway stop south. Pi-Tom's has a selection of other options on the menu of course and I should probably give it a second shot, but so far their Pad Thai left me underwhelmed. BTW: their Thai ice tea was not that good either. Salad King's Thai ice tea is way better."}
{"text":"This place has really deteriorated. earlier their green curry chicken, fried rice etc used to be good. No longer. We actually also got a mini cockroach in our take out bag (it wasn't in the food). Ewwwwwwww!!!!!

I don't know if I'm imagining it, but it seems to be getting more dinghy and less crowded by the day.

Many a place has gone downhill and this is one of them unfortunately."}
{"text":"Average Thai food. Not the best service, ok food, nothing spectacular. Stay with their pad Thai and fried rice if you don't want to be too adventerous. All the other dishes I've tried (curry, eggplant, fish, basil noodle) were disappointing."}
{"text":"Located in downtown, so prepare to pay for parking. The parking lots along the Alexander street were pretty taken on Thu night.

The food is fairly good. We had a hot&sour soup which was especially tasty and warming in that cold weather. As entree we ordered duck, spicy pork and seafood medley and we really enjoyed it. The sauce in each one was well balanced, moderately spiced  even being marked by three peppers in a menu. Size of portions is ok.

Dislikes are related to service. Waitress did only a minimal job to take orders, bring food and bill. She never came back to ask is everything in order. Forks were laid on the bare table and not on napkins. The western music was totally unrelated to ambiance of thai restaurant and was pretty loud."}
{"text":"Pi-Tom's may not be the best or the most authentic Thai food I ever have.. but it is A-OK. 

I have to admit I am a little bias with my experience: 
- I was hungry! 
- I was having lunch with 3 of my fellow yogi Yelpers (My non Hot Yoga Date!) 
- I was sitting on the patio daydreaming I was somewhere in Thailand.... 
- We has a voucher thanks for Janna!! YAY! 

Services was a little slow at the beginning but it did pick up nicely at the end... 

We ended up sharing: 

Appetizer Platter $14.95 - A-OK, love the mix and choices of different items: satay, summer rolls, tofu, squid 
Mango Salad $9.95 - The dressing can be better with more coriander 
Basil Chicken $11.95 - meh 
Pad Phed Talay (shrimp, squid and mussels stir fried in curry) $12.95 - have a great kick.. my yelp friend kept commenting how spicy it is! :) Winner! 

Thai Lemongrass tea with honey ($3.75) was a little sweet for my taste..as the honey was overpowering... so I would suggest to do it with 1/2 honey! 

Hmmmm Patio... Hmmmm Sunshine....Hmmmm Thai Food.....Hmmm Yelp Yogi Friends talking in the background....... 

What a great way to enjoy Toronto's Summer!"}
{"text":"Wow this place has really gone down the drain. We ordered the authentic pad thai as usual. It was so incredibly ketchupy this time and didn't taste a lick authentic. They even use less peanuts now! The glass noodles were overly salty. The green curry isn't as good as other thai restaurants nearby that I've recently tried. Decent though.

The service is AWFUL too. They tried to scam us on the tax on a group buy voucher, claiming tax was not included when it clearly stated on the voucher that it was included. We bickered with the waitress and waiter for a bit before the waitress started claiming that we had to order OVER $40 for the tax to be included since if it's not over $40 the restaurant to pay the extra tax or something... made no sense whatsoever. We ordered something like $39.xx so I asked to order a drink then to make the bill reach $40. She then told us the deal was done and that she couldn't go back because the system wouldn't let her. At this point, I mentioned that it says nowhere on the voucher the $40 or pay tax rule. She said tax wasn't included at all no matter what. We  finally asked to see the voucher so they could point out to us where it said tax was not included (it said the opposite). At that point, they gave in and tossed the receipt at us, saying something like fine.. pay whatever you want and gave us a glare. Customer service at its best! I paid the tax and not a penny more. I will not ever go here again because of their unethical and rude staff."}
{"text":"Over the weekend, my sis and I felt like going out for some Thai food and decided to drop by Pi-Tom's.  We ordered quickly as we were starving and went for the Chicken Basil Fried Rice and two types of Pad Thai. The North Americanized (regular) Pad Thai and the authentic Pad Thai. The North American version is cooked with a sweet and sour almost ketchup like sauce, and the authentic pad thai comes with a sweet and sour tamarind and coconut sauce. But don't be fooled, the regular pad thai if cooked well, can just be as good as the authentic version. My sister also opted to get the mango fruit shake, which is a very nice choice. If you've been to Ten Ren's bubble tea, taste just like it. So this fruit drink is recommended.

We were both starving and glad the food came relatively quickly in about 10 mins or so. Dove right in and as mentioned, definitely not a bad pad thai. There was not a single ingredient that overpowered the others. It stroked a good balance and tasted good. My only minor complaint is that I'm a big eater, so I wished my portion was just a little bit bigger. My sister really enjoyed the authentic pad thai and not gonna lie, that was probably the better choice. However, if you're in a mood for a little more sweet and sour, then go for the regular pad thai. The authentic version is definitely a little more sweeter than the regular and has less of that sour kick to it. The chicken basil fried rice was nice and exactly what we expected. There were no surprises; it's your typical run of the mill basil fried rice.

Overall, Pi-Tom's is not a bad Thai restaurant. As a Torontonian tho, we've been spoiled rotten. We have soo many great choices and varieties that it makes it hard for a Thai place to really step out from the crowd. And this is the category where Pi-Tom's fall into. It's not great, but it's not horrible either. I have had the curry before at Pi-Tom's on another occasion and let me say, don't get it. This is probably one of Pi-Tom's weakest areas. But if you want some simple Thai food especially pad thai, then Pi-Tom's isn't a terrible choice. Though I have to say, with just a slightly above average pad thai, I don't know if it's really worth it's price tag."}
{"text":"Service: Great, very hospitable.

Food: Yummy!  They will also accommodate those who love food to be extra spicy (ask for fresh chilies, and prepare to be challenged!); they are also veggie-friendly, Yay!

I loved the glass-noodles w/ veggies.  Pad Thai, is always fun to order anywhere.  Taste is authentic here, not tomato ketchupppy.

I've got some Thai blood, and have to say that this is one of my very favourite Thai spots.  Staff and servers are also Thai, there, if that makes any difference.

Hey, noticed today that there's a coupon deal going around for them.  This place is well worth its value, coupon or no coupon.

* Wish I could give them a 4.5 but we can only give whole scores."}
