{"text":"This is definitely a place I will not be frequenting again.    I dropped by for a quick lunch after rushing out of a late morning meeting.  I looked at the lunch menu and found it extremely limited.  It took me a full 10 minutes to decide what to order, and during that time, I asked to see their dinner menu AND their takeout menu because nothing on the lunch menu interested me.  Seemed a little too heavy on the \"maki\" department.    After agonizing over the decision, I went for the very standard california role and salmon roll set lunch.  I mean, really, if a sushi restaurant screws up those two very basic orders, they might as well close shop.   My lunch arrived.  The seaweed around the salmon make was soggy.  Now, I would normally expect some sogginess in the seaweed especially since this was no Kaji, but when the seaweed is so soggy that it is hard to break even after pulling at it with your teeth, that's when I say forget it.  And \"forget it\" is what I said to the salmon saki.  The salmon was also \"meh\", not particularly fresh.    The california roll was also disappointing.  The serving was not generous and I didn't get that normal burst of flavour that I would expect from a california roll.  The entire thing just looked and tasted tired.  Definitely did not conjure up images of \"california\" when I bit into the thing.  There usually isn't much to complain about the standard miso soup and salad fare that accompanies set dinners at sushi restaurants.  They're usually done decently, if not spectacularly.  However, I found the miso soup tasteless, and the salad dressing on the lettuce salad was too strong and sweet.  I didn't finish either.    Finally, I was not impressed by the cleanliness of Sushi Tower.  There is one thing that I have no tolerance for in a sushi restaurant, and that is a lack of cleanliness.  A place that serves raw food should be spotless.  At the end of lunch, I happened to look at the floor and under the table.  What did I see?  Bits of food were along the edges of the wall and what looked like dustballs.  Not impressed.  Then, after the waitress took my money, I saw the sushi chef move away from the sushi bar and fingered items around the cash register.  I suppose he thought it was OK because I was the only customer in the restaurant.  Still, the thought of him touching my food after touching the cash register was enough to make me feel ill.  I may just have an extra sensitivity, but this was a definite no-no.  As I walked out the restaurant, I looked at the floor near the door.  Again, bits of garbage on the floor.  I definitely will not be back at Sushi Tower in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick sushi lunch/dinner as the price is very reasonable. Cheaper than those I've seen in Mississauga/Oakville area, though maybe quite average for downtown. Service was a little on the slow side despite the fact that my sibling and I were the only patrons there. Portion was average, nothing to go to wow over; not really the best or freshest sushi I've had either. Wasn't impressed with the agedashi tofu, though the salmon and beef teriyaki boxes are an excellent value!"}
{"text":"I think that most people would agree that the sushi served at this establishment is... MEH, okay. The quality and freshness of the fish tends to vary from day to day. This probably explains why the place is never packed.     My biggest complaint about this place is the service. There is nothing worse than feeling like you're being watched while you eat. During my entire meal, the waitress hovered over me like a hawk, waiting to quickly remove any dish that appeared to be complete. She actually attempted to remove plates that were not finished, depriving me of my last sliver of sashimi. Sure, some may say that I'm a relatively slow eater, but why should that matter if I'm one of two costumers seated.   I have tried this place four times and each experience was very similar, with the tastiness of my dish varying ever so slightly.   So, if you're in the mood for eating subpar sushi at a hastened pace, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least twice (it's hard to keep track, really!), but I have to say that I was quite satisfied each time. In terms of vegetarian options, the choices are plentiful. You can get 20 pieces of vegetarian maki, miso soup, and salad for $10.50! I really hate tofu maki though, and they charged me $2 to substitute cucumber maki in the combo instead (which I found to be a bit much, but I REALLY don't like tofu maki!)   The sushi was actually really good and I really liked the consistency and taste of the rice, but the 8 pieces of yam maki were cut quite small (it probably should have been cut into 6 pieces). The service was alright, but they never really came by to check on how we were doing, and we had to ask them to refill our tea when they came to clear some of our plates.   Overall, it's a great value and I'd definitely go back, but I wouldn't say it's at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Went here a few years ago when they first opened. After consuming the plain and flavourless food, I tried using their grand opening coupon I received in the mail that was supposed to provide a discount on the final bill. When I presented the coupon to the server, she said it was no longer valid. Wow! I'd call that false advertising to the extreme.  In fairness, i should have asked for the manager but I'm not one to make a scene. Ever since that day, I have never returned to this restaurant even though I live in the area and truly enjoy Japanese food.  Sushi lovers are better off going somewhere else since this place has sneaky practices. I'm surprised this place is still open for business. Seems like the prominent Yonge St. location makes it very easy for people passing by to get suckered in."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch specials which is really good value. Two rolls with miso sooup and salad for $12. People that work here is really nice and location is not very far from the eaton centre. It is definately a lot quieter than other sushi places but that could be due to the fact that we were there on a weekday."}
{"text":"I agree with Chris P. just another sushi place on Yonge St.  I ate in once and take out once.  Nothing special - for the take out lunch it came with miso soup but by the time I got home lots of it had spilled out of the container.  For dinner I don't even remember.  So nothing memorable."}
{"text":"I am no sushi-connoisseur so sushi is something I find very hard to review but here I am, trying to overcome this obstacle! My friends and I came in within a minute of their \"Open\" sign turning on so it's understandable that they were a little unprepared but they overcame it very well. Even though we were ordering take out, we were given menus and sat down in a booth- very gracious. The waitresses even brought us tea for our wait! And to give us even more comfort, the payment of our food (separate bills) was done as though we were sit down diners. Is it odd that I find it weird to not be treated like a second class citizen when ordering out? Anyways, service kind of stumped me in a good way.   Now onto the actual food; it travelled very well with nothing out of place. I would still like to try out the place for sit down because the results were disappointing. Even after all that good service!   Miso soup- I'm used to having seaweed in it, but this was the same yet rehydrated seaweed that they use for the sushi.  Green Salad- Fresh and crunchy but WAY overdressed. I looked at the bottom and saw a pool of dressing, yet there was still a large smear of dressing across the top.  Spicy Salmon Roll- Kinda dry apart from a huge dollop (given the ratio of sushi to sauce) of spicy mayo. And it was too much mayo without enough spice. So much so that I ended up scraping the majority of it off the top so could actually taste salmon below.  Crab Maki- Just crabstick. Not much taste or interesting texture to it. Sad face.   Having said all of this, there was a lot of bang for this buck- the whole thing came, with a tip, to roughly $8.50- which is nothing for the amount of food given. Go to a more expensive place, get better food. Not always, but in this case that seems to be the way it goes. Sad face."}
{"text":"Great downtown location makes this a lunch staple for me.  It's not overly fancy with incredibly exceptional sushi- but the lunch menu features many items (I would say around 15?) all for under eight dollars. This includes an endless supply of green tea, which is par for the course at a Japanese restaurant, but still good, and miso soup and salad.  The other reason this gets my stamp of approval? I have been to this place somewhere around twenty five times over the past year, and the quality of food and standard of service doesn't change. I always know what to expect, and it is very good! (Occasionally, service feels a bit rushed, but they can be very busy around lunchtime, so I assume this is a direct result of that.)  For lunch, try the Bento boxes- salmon teriyaki in particular, or the Udon Noodle soup- comes with lots of delicious tempura."}
{"text":"From all the affordable places for sushi in downtown, this is the best affordable place. My bill is always close to $20 something and I usually have a gyoza and one roll (my favourite being Sushi Tower Fire Roll).   I wish it was cheaper so I could have two rolls instead of one but this is god's way of making me diet I guess. I haven't tried their bento box yet but seen other people order and it looks good! Maybe I'll try that next time, I would love to go more often but the price just doesn't allow it and all my favourites are the expensive ones!  This place is better than the Akashiro at Eaton and Spring Sushi!"}
{"text":"Spotted: picky eater Laura T. at sushi restaurant.  Although I've heard rumblings about subpar sushi, the beef teriyaki bento box was delish. For a mere 7$, my large lunch included beef teriyaki, salad, 4 sushi rolls, soup.. and other things a bento box comes with that a picky eater wouldn't enjoy. BUT my friends did enjoy my leftovers. The service was lovely and quick, and who doesn't love complementary green tea.   One of the best things - location. Close to Ryerson, the Eaton Center and the rest of the hub-bub happening around Yonge Dundas. Two thumbs up = 4 Yelp stars.  Gets the picky-eater seal of approval"}
{"text":"Came here as last resort as there weren't many place that were within walking distance and accessible.  The prices are decent and there seem to be something to cater to every taste on the menu. Hmm not being a fan to try a sushi place that that seemed to be popular for cooked items I tried to play it safe and stuck to a bento box (Sushi Tower). My dinning companions also went with a similar selection and opted for a vegetarian bento box (which comes with an option of a meat based teriyaki go figure) The miso soup was your run of a mill stuff. The rolls that I got were OK and I would say not much better than the one's found at grocery stores (a bit fresher I guess) The main bento box looked OK and seemed like I would fill up on it but nope it just went downhill afterwards. Tempura is OK, Teriyaki chicken is forgetful, sashimi and salad also follow suit. The rice was inedible . Prices are reasonable so if one has a choice between a food court and this spot I would say by all means try it out just due to sheer variety of offerings. Quality was I would say a step above food court. 2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Alright, so I go into Sushi Tower before class because I only have half an hour and am craving raw fish. Having never been to Sushi Tower, I am expecting an average sushi joint...and that's what it is, but there's certainly nothing wrong with that.  The hostess, who makes very little eye contact but is nonetheless friendly, politely guides me to a seat and gives me a menu. Being a novice sushi-eater, I need a few minutes.  I order the deep-fried tofu. I've never had anything like that before, so I figure why not?  A few minutes later I order the University Roll. I find that fitting because I am on my way to a university classroom. After about ten minutes of me checking my watch impatiently and oogling the girls walking by outside, my sushi arrives. Doesn't look like anything special. Seconds later my deep-fried tofu is placed in front of me.  I crack open the chopsticks with a theatrical amount of effort and grab the first cube of tofu. I feel fairly confident in my chopsticking skills and being the only caucasian in the room, am secretly hoping to impress the asians seated around me. Now, one thing I should mention is that these tofu cubes are massive. If I were to guess, maybe 1.5 cubic inches.  I first test the cube with my tongue for heat. Very warm, but not too hot. I dip it in the mysterious sauce provided and hoggishly shove the whole thing in my mouth. I instantly realize that the thin layer of batter coating the tofu was deceptively cool compared to the searingly hot interior.   My eyes immediately tear up and I fight the urgent sense of panic, try to remain calm, and logically think about what to do about this ball of lava resting on my tongue. Thankfully, the thin veil of batter is protecting the parts of my mouth that haven't been exposed to the scorching interior. I decide that if I breathe through my mouth for a while, the tofu will cool down enough so that I can chew it. I try this for half a minute and realize my attempts are futile. The tofu remains at an even 1400 degrees celsius.   This leaves Plan B: Discreetely spitting the massive mound of tofu into a napkin. My only option. No sooner does this thought cross my mind when a giant gob of slobber falls out of my gaping mouth and onto the table below. I am a charming man indeed.  I can take this no more. I grab a napkin and awkwardly force out what feels like a half-pound of napalm into this flimsy paper. Half way through forcing out the flaming tofu with my roasted tongue, the hostess walks by and looks me in the eye and I haphazardly nod my head and attempt to make a pleasant facial expression.  At last the inferno is out. I feel relieved and self-conscious at the same time. I glance around, and nobody seems to be paying any attention...this is good. I hear them speaking their various dialects and wonder what they are saying about me.  I regather my composure and dip as sushi roll into the soy and then into my wounded mouth. The sushi was as average as it looked, and the hard asparagus was something that didn't quite fit with the other ingredients. At least not for me. It was quite edible regardless.  Ripping into the remaining 3 tofu cubes with my chopsticks to cool them down, I am comforted by the fact that they will not catch me off guard a second time. Hot steam erupts from each cube. The tofu is bland and flavourless, but I suppose that is the nature of tofu. Either that or my tongue is incapable of registering flavour at this point.  Done with my meal, I flag down the hostess for my bill. She comes back a few seconds later, clears the table and removes the crumpled napkins. Oh but if only it were that easy. No, she is professional enough to straighten out the used napkins before placing them in the dish. I know what's about to happen, but I do nothing to stop it. She straightens out the napkin with my tofu inside, and this partially chewed blob of grossness slides out of the napkin and goes 'plop' right onto the table.  The startled couple seated next to me look over and then back to their tables clearly disgusted. The hostess looks up at me, confused. With a mouthful of sushi I think I tried to say \"That one was too hot\", but really what comes out is something like \"Ach onna ooh ock\". It didn't matter though as she dismissed herself mid-way through my garbled sentence.  That was my experience at Sushi Tower. I'm sure it's a great sushi joint on par with any other in the city, as the other patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves and their food. I base my rating on the overall experience. The food was 3/5, the service was 3/5, the ambience was 3/5. My scorched tastebuds disagree, but my overall rating is clearly a 3 out of 5.   WARNING TO THE READER: Never underestimate the destructive power of deep-fried tofu."}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  I definitely thought the prices were a-ok, especially if you order one of the dinners for 2-4.  The fish was fresh and they had plenty of things for the tiny kids to eat.  Very kid friendly and an all around tastey time.  There is nothing like watching your 2 year old stuff her face with raw fish. . ."}
{"text":"Stopped here for sushi after TCAF. My first time coming here was over 2 years ago after a zombie walk where my friend and I shambled in groaning for \"suuuuushiiii.... delicious suuuushiiiii\"... the quality then wasn't anything to write home about - just average. But over 2 years later, yesterday, we decided to stop in and have a bite.   We ordered 2 special rolls - the Sushi Tower Fire Roll and Dynamite Roll, as well as a Salmon Sushi Pizza. Everything was bursting with flavour and the salmon was delicious! The Dynamite Roll that had tempura shrimp in it was a bit structurally challenged and fell apart easily, but that was the only real \"worry\". Even the presentation of the dishes was appetizing and beautiful - check out the pics I put up - and we were treated to Mango and Green Tea ice cream on the house afterwards.   All in all, amazing. I was really taken aback at how much the quality has improved since we were last here. Will definitely not be leaving any 2 year gap in between visits anymore!"}
{"text":"This place is now closed and is the new location of HOT STAR fried chicken."}
{"text":"i love this place. the service and atmosphere is great. well priced and food is presented nicely. i go here whenever im in the area. definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My partner in crime and I were strolling around downtown on Yonge, We did a bit of shopping, got hungry and started to north on Yonge. We wanted to eat sushi so whatever restaurant popped up next, we were going to dine in. Sushi Tower was the pick.   The venue was kindof plain lo,oking, not really decorative but I did like one waterfall piece of art that they had. Server was really friendly, gave us lots of time to choose what we want. The menu had lots of options for you to choose from handrolls, sashimi, Japanese food and dessert. We shared a set of spring rolls, comes in 3. Friend got dynamite roll, she said it was tasty and fresh. I got the calamari roll, which I was scared to try at first but after we both had a piece of it, it was really good, I think it's my fave new roll, and the other roll I ordered was spicy scallop which was delicious. The bill was under $20  Portions were average sized, rolls weren't tightly wrapped so they fell apart before they reached your mouth that would be the only downside but good dining experience if your looking for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Good bento box but I did not get my first choice of short-rib (they sold out of that and it must be good).  Overall, a good place for a quick meal and good value.   The server was attentive and the food was decent."}
{"text":"This is an easily missed storefront style sushi restaurant.  You would almost miss it if you weren't looking for it and I stumbled upon it by accident.  I was in the mood for sushi and walking along Yonge St., saw Sushi Tower and stopped in.  The waitress was a bit odd, she seemed kind of out of it, lack she wasn't totally focused on involved.  She was nice and the service was fine but she was a bit odd.  Food was good, all the pieces were well crafted with fresh pieces of fish.  All the pieces were excellent and the chefs did a great job with the delivery.  I would definitely give Sushi Tower a visit if you're in the mood for sushi and up on Yonge Street."}
{"text":"I come here once every few weeks when I'm craving sushi for lunch and I always get the same thing. Today I decided to try the lunch special C2, which comes with miso soup and salad and I chose the spicy salmon rolls. All in, cost me less than $8 for the entire thing!  I have to say, I'm VERY close to stepping these guys up a star. [EDIT: Okay I had to bump them up. The quality of the sushi in these rolls is pretty damn good for the price. Definitely worth it!] I always get take out and I call ahead to order so that its ready to go. The spicy salmon roll is way better than the dynamite/avocado rolls I normally get (S2 lunch combo). These rolls were wrapped perfectly, didn't fall apart and had fantastic flavor. Different than any other spicy salmon roll I've ever had though. Salmon and avocado wrapped in seaweed and rice with the spicy mayo on top. Just great! Tastes super fresh and I want more!!  They still need to work on the salad - mine was so drowning in sauce that you could hear the swish of the sauce when I shook the container. Still though, the sauce is good so its not so much of a complaint as it is a suggestion. Tasty tasty lunch! Will definitely be back to try some other stuff!"}
{"text":"I had a lunch here, bento box to be more precise and I wasn't impressed. This place is probably good if you want a cheap bento box, but even then the quality of food is not that great IMHO. One time was enough for me and I don't think I'll be coming back. Sorry, Sushi Tower, but you did not make a good first impression, despite fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Sushi wasnt great but i suppose it was decent for the all you can eat lunch price. All the servers were nice other than this one guy. He was rude and didn't seem to want to take out orders. Also threatened to charge us more if we didnt finish what we ordered from the all you can eat menu. Wouldnt recommend."}
{"text":"Just another sushi place on Younge.  I'd say the only difference about this place as compared to others is that the store-front looks more inviting with the nice big glass windows.  Other than that, the prices are higher than most (because they're right on Younge), the presentation is nice, blah blah blah.    Don't go out of your way for this one."}
