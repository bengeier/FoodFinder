{"text":"Great service and good food. Nice establishment and very friendly...I will be going back for more me and my family have been many times before"}
{"text":"Service: Is friendly, keep in mind its a Mexican restaurant so they speak mostly Spanish. Only thing I would like is for them to walk your food over to your table but unfortunately you order, pay and then they call you to pick it up.  Food: My sister recommended this place because it's one of her favorites due to the fact they cook their meats to a crisp (carne asada). Tacos are really good here. Haven't really tried anything else besides a quesadilla and it was good.  Atmosphere: Well very AUTHENTIC, if you have ever been to Mexico you will realize that security bars are used across the country in small businesses to prevent being robbed or something... well this place has them which totally gives it an authentic feel to it... as well as the non modern furniture. Don't pass them up for this... if you were Mexican you really wouldn't mind. haha  Overall, I like going to this restaurant from time to time because its never too packed and there will always be somewhere to sit and not very long lines."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! I've been coming here for years. Keep in mind that if you decide to eat there prepare to sweat your ass off! So I highly suggest you get your food to go"}
{"text":"Very happy that we decided to have El Jalisquillo cater my daughters baby shower.  When I called the first time there was someone that spoke English and was able to explain everything to me.  We went to the restaurant for the free sampling of what we would be ordering and everything was so good we ended up ordering more just so we could have our dinner there.   They do mostly speak Spanish but my son in law speaks Spanish so that helped with communication when it was time to finalize everything.  We paid $330 for three hours of catering plus an hour of set up and clean up and there was soooo much food.  We had at least 50 people and still had left over food which they will leave you if you give them containers.  They were pleasant and friendly and on time.  Will definitely use them again in the future and would highly recommend them."}
