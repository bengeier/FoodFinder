{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!  Everything is so fresh!  My family just had breakfast there for the first time.  The portions were large and everything was delicious.  The banana walnut pancakes were out of control.  I can't wait to go back for lunch and dinner sometime.  The service was excellent too.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Extremely high quality of food! I had eggs Benedict, they were great and the hollandaise sauce was great and authentic. Will definitely be going here more often"}
{"text":"OMG!  The food is delectable!  We go there at least once a week now.  We've tried everything from burgers to salads!  Haven't tried breakfast yet, but am meaning to as soon as we can.  You can't go wrong here.  If they are super busy the wait may be a little long, but I can assure you it is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for breakfast! Friendly service, and HUGE portions! I ordered the English Eggs in the Basket: 3 Eggs, 3 pieces of toast, and a huge order of tasty fried red potatoes. Prices are great. I wish I was in town longer to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Food and service was very good, would have preferred just a little lower price point but when the food came I realized the extra touches that made it better. Premium sausage and extra love in the potatoes.  This is a great little place that also offers hard scoops of Ice Cream."}
{"text":"I went on the recommendation of friends, but not expecting too much. The location was a little tough to find if you are not from the local area, and the plaza was pretty basic. However, my friends were right, it was worth the trip. The menu had a little bit of everything, including breakfast and lunch menu available all day. There were 4 of us and each of us got something different. I had the Mediterranean omelet which was very flavorful and big ( I took 1/2 of it home for lunch the next day). I tried some of my husband's sirloin steak with pulled pork on top and it was also really good. Our waitress/cashier had a half full dining room and we still didn't feel the least bit forgotten. She was friendly and attentive. Great food! I'll definitely refer others."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, and both times the food has been outstanding!!! I want to give 5-stars, but...our family decided to eat here today, a Saturday around 11:30am before a 1:30pm soccer game, and YIKES... the place was at max capacity, but, on top of that, the service was just not up to par. All servers seemed to be very flustered, it took a long time to place an order (about 15 min.), and a really long wait for the food -- about 45 minutes. Once the food came out, it was hot, fresh, and not the junky overly-processed, too-salty garbage that you get at so many restaurants.  Both of my picky kids had clean plates (probably because they were so hungry)! I see another Yelp member, like me, decided to get on here, and post a review today, which leads me to believe that maybe a server called off sick or something happened that made today a bad day. Or perhaps their little kitchen and fresh-cooking formula may not work well with so many people coming in at once. Not sure. Anyway, I'll go back again... on a weekday, this time, as I did the first time that I went there.  Some have said it's pricey. I think the pricing is fine for the quality."}
{"text":"Wow! Outstanding food. Great quality. Service is awesome. I think we found ourselves a new breakfast place. 

The Mediterranean omelet was a perfect balance of yummy goodness, the corn beef hash was homemade with real corn beef not some out of the can substitute, and the pancakes out of this world. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Great little out of the way place. I really wanted to give them 5 stars but they only had a single person working and she got really busy so sometimes you had to wait for stuff. It's not convenient to get too but it's worth a try for breakfast. Great potatoes! The blueberry pancakes were tasty too. Give it a try."}
{"text":"What a nice find! Homemade breakfast food with great service and atmosphere. I had the veggie omelet with a side of home fries - everything tasted fresh and delicious. The home fries were made from scratch and did not disappoint. Found a new breakfast place and will definitely return"}
