{"text":"This little shop offers an array of pastries, baked goods, bread, a charcuterie counter and prepared meals to go. Although I've tried a few of their goods like the cannoli, bread and empanadas, the only thing I'd rave about is their Italian pizza, and it's why it's getting four stars! This place is known for their red pizza and if you haven't placed an order, they might run out if you've come too late in the day. Although nothing spectacular otherwise, it is the only bakery in the neighbourhood where you can get fresh bread."}
