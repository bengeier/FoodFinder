{"text":"Used to be my local bar with friendly staff. Ive heard its gone down hill since a change of management, big shame."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to hang out if you live in the area or are just passing thru.  The bar is clean and the staff is extremely friendly.  I have been coming here for the last year or so since I moved into the neighborhood and I have never had a bad experience.  The food is way above par as far as bar food goes, but the pricing is still comparative to most other bars in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing to catchy with this bar.  As with Las Vegas, there's a bar on every corner.  Nothing too stand-offish.  Just another mediocre bar & grill."}
{"text":"I've been going to Bilbos on charleston for 8 years I love it there and love my bartender shes the best."}
{"text":"New to the area, and on first visit Nader made me feel at home.  He's a pro!  Introduced himself, shook my hand, got my name.  All service afterwards I was addressed by name.  Next night I came back with my wife and Nader greeted me by name and knew what I was drinking.  I need a local tavern, and because of Nader, Bilbo's is it."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place as it has shuffle board, pool table and darts.....including a younger crowd, some good beer specials. But whats the point of good beer specials when you have to wait 20 minutes at the bar to either get a drink or close, out, so annoying....service from the one particular bar man is awful he seems more intent drinking with a couple of the regulars rather than actually doing his job and serving."}
{"text":"Tried Bilbo's for the first time this weekend. Spent many years driving past it to go to work. Wanted to try their food since I've seen specials before.  Upon entering, I must say the place was extremely CLEAN. Might be one of the cleanest bars in town.   The menu was nothing special. No steaks or chicken. Just burgers, appetizers & salads.   Had the Chef Salad. The salad was fresh. had tons of tomatoes (which I was very happy about), but did not have any personality to it. Was just an average plate.   Prices slightly higher than what I would like. $16 for a sampler platter for them seems a bit high. This isn't Claim Jumper.   Service was decent. Not under-attentive or overly friendly. But it was not a weak point.   Maybe if you want a place that is clean, well lit, & knock down some suds, this could be your spot. If you are seeking dinner, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Typical bar, nothing spectacular.  We ordered wings and some sandwiches.  The sandwiches were fine, but the wings were that special.  The service was okay, but we had a brand new waitress and we were her first table that she waited.  I'd go back, but just probably wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Mediocre corner bar.  Over priced food Caters to an older crowd. One star for being next to a Smiths so you can do your shopping before you head home. Second star for being a good hiding place since it is never really crowded."}
{"text":"So my wife and I are on the road house hunting and it is hot and we are getting hungry and want something cold to drink and a bite to eat. There in front of us is a tavern... Bilbo's Bar and Grill, and in we go.  This is a pub loosely based on an Irish pub, but more like most other Las Vegas taverns you will find. There was some sunlight streaming in around the dining room and the typical darkened area around the bar. At this time of day (about 1:00pm) the place is pretty empty, but we sat down and were soon greeted by a casual server with a smile and some menus. Before long we had our cold Ice Teas (nothing special but nice and cold) and were browsing the menu. It is obvious this is your average bar fare just kicked up with an Americanized Irish flare.  Kicked up with an Americanized Irish flare adding cabbage, corned beef and such to the dish. In some cases this is good, in others this is just more food. I ordered the Bilbo Burger, 1/2 lb patty (medium rare) bacon, corned beef, Swiss, and \"onion petals\" on a bun with garlic fries. As long as the burger is cooked correctly the thing here is \"what's not to like\"? It was tasty and satisfying and was exactly was described. My wife had the \"San Franciscan\" which was a turkey sandwich with bacon, Swiss and 1000 island dressing on sour dough. Again, very tasty and hit the spot in a \"that's a no brainer\" sort of way (could have used more turkey however). My side was that garlic fries. My wife said she could taste the garlic, I'm still searching. My wife got a side of Cole Slaw (creamy) that was probably made yesterday but was not wilted enough to dispose of.  One thing about the food... Hair nets. I am balding and silver haired and my wife has long dark brown hair. The black hair on my pickle could not have come from us. Hair nets.  I can see where this can be a cool locals hang at night and therefore let me say I think it is a cool place. The service was exceptional and when you are looking at an average establishment that is a deal maker.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  And since it still makes me angry every time I drive by it, I figure I need to vent and write a review.  My friend and I went here for St. Patricks.  Huge mistake.  I know, I know, it's Irish-themed... why would you go to someplace Irish-themed on St. Patrick's Day.  Because it's Irish-themed!    Apparently only two bartenders decided to show up.  The rest called in sick.  And one of the two bartenders working tried to regale us with the tale of how the rest of the staff called in sick instead of taking our order!  Finally, when he was done bitching, he asked what we wanted.  But, of course, they were out of almost every single kind of beer. (I guess the guy who orders the beer called in sick, too?) And instead of making a suggestion, he just walked off.  Needless to say, we left never to return.  There are so many better places in Las Vegas... this poker bar just needs to close down and become something remotely useful. Ok, rant over!"}
{"text":"We have been to Bilbo's twice now and had fun both times.  They have one pool table, one shuffleboard-sand table game, and 2 dart boards.  It has tables on the other side for people who want to be waited on...but we have not gone that route.  The bartender has been the same both times we have gone and he was always super nice to me...even willing to make shots of  \"something yummy\" for me when I wasn't sure of the flavor I was in the mood for at the time.  We felt like the service was good and the prices were normal, with some beer deals if you like what is on special.  We live close and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"It has gotten better since they got rid of the creepy bartender, Paul.  One time, we thought he had died in the back.  It turns out he was outside crying for an hour and a half...seriously"}
{"text":"I guess your view of Bilbo's depends what you're looking for in a bar. This is by my parent's house, so I've stopped in a couple of times. I was out at Gordon Biersch on a Friday because I wanted to get drunk on beers and watch a baseball game, except it was slammed. And they weren't playing baseball on the TVs.  So I came here instead. There was a handful of people in there, maybe a dozen  - and the bartender greeted me like he knew me, served me a beer and then after checking on the other customers, went to play pool with the chef.  The one thing I would say is that it seems to be mostly guys. Not too many lesbians watching baseball in there and the other ladies were with their men. I wasn't uncomfortable, though one of the customers totally did describe me as a lesbo to his girlfriend from across the bar. Too bad that 'laid back' means it's quiet enough for me to hear that. Sigh.  Still, if you have a fantasy about having a 'Cheers' bar of your own, this could probably be that place for you if you come often enough."}
{"text":"Debating to write a review about this one, but people has the right to know what other people think of the place.  Giving this a 2 star might be to generous.   Located off Decatur and Ann in the corner of the Smith Parking lot, is a bar and grill called Bilbo's.  The place looks nice on the outside, it is decent on the inside.  But kind of felt a bit awkward coming in, since there was no one to really greet us and wasn't really much of a sign to either wait, or take our own seats.  So we just sat to the closest table that was near the door.  The table itself was kind of sticky, I was contemplating to move to the table next to us but didn't want to be rude.    The waitress finally came over after a long while, to give us a menu, which there was very little to choose from.  The wife and I, mainly had the same thing and thought the food was at least edible.  Wasn't great, but edible enough to eat.  Refills on drinks were slow as well.  What kind of got me is that, the place wasn't as busy and it took a long time to be checked upon.  Mainly, if it takes more than 15 minutes to check up on some people, that's way to long I believe.  I can probably understand if they're busy, but 2-3 people in the bar, 2 other couples at the booth.  Shouldn't take a waitress long to check on people.  I'm sure it may be lack of staffing and other situations, but lack of customer service doesn't help the business.    Overall, I probably wouldn't come here again, but if you end up going, it's probably good for beers at the bar, where there should be some one there majority of the time.  I wouldn't suggest to eat there cause it looks like they don't clean their tables very well.  But if you really have no other choice, don't expect much from it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I gave it a try about once every couple months, but every time they would disappoint me. On Sunday mornings with perhaps two other people in here, the waiter and bar tender spend more time watching whatever game is on TV than checking to see if you want to order a drink or food. When you do finally order, expect to wait until half time or the end of the game before you get what you asked for.  I also gave their \"Wall\" challenge a go as well, and made it a point to stop by after work three days in a row. Unfortunately, each day they couldn't find my card and I had to start over, by the third day I gave up and just never went back."}
{"text":"One of these reviews said it was a loosely based Irish bar, wrong.  I talked my husband into taking me here for St. Patrick's Day for our green beer fix.  It was noon and there was no green beer to be had here.  There wasn't even a special menu of Irish food.  Just a typical bar with boring bar food.  We had a chicken quesadilla and french dip sandwiches.  While the appetizer was decent the french dip meat was super dry and chewy.  The staff wasn't all that friendly either so I doubt I would return.  I don't mean to be rude but I could not get a smile from our server at all.  Since they didn't have green beer, the only thing they went out of their way was to offer another drink.  When we were waiting for our bill my husband has his card out ready to go.  The server dropped off the check without waiting to grab the card, so we had to wait again.  It was just a slip of paper not in a jacket so why not just wait two seconds for him to glance at it and grab the card at the same time and save a trip.  Pass."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in for lunch after driving by for 4 years!  Food was good, beer was cold, but the service left room for improvement.  I wanted to love it, love local watering holes, but there was one bartender who was also waiting tables and that didn't work well for a Sunday afternoon.  Otherwise, I'd say it's a 4-star joint!"}
{"text":"Definitely a local's joint. Lots of sports viewing.   Happy Hour menu is cheap. You definitely are getting what you pay for here, which isn't much.   I didn't expect much from Bilbo's, but was disappointed nonetheless.   Why?  The service stunk.  Really.   We waited an adequate amount of time for my beer, which I spotted on the bar--yet the one server working didn't bring it to the table. My partner kindly fetched it for me. [I was thirsty.]  Worse, she didn't even notice that I had it in hand when she brought our tepid, poorly prepared food. Fail.  Advice: go to Bilbo's for drinks ONLY and sit at the bar. If you do anything else, its your own damn fault."}
{"text":"We were planning on going to BJ's, but the wait was a bit too long. My dad and a friend had hit this place up in January and he loved it. Knowing my dad's tastes, I figured we could get some decent bar food here. We were right. Had a salad and nachos. Salad was fresh, but very basic, and the nachos were standard pub nachos (cheese sauce and all). Unlike the other reviews, we found the service pretty good, but then we were the only people not sitting at the bar. We were also the only ones that were not regulars (or so we think). The review would be higher except the beer prices were outrageous. $5 for a pint of Smithwicks, and $4.75 for Sam Adams Summer Ale... yikes.  Looks like it would be a good place for a game, lots of TV's and there happy hour (3-7pm M-F) may be worth it..."}
{"text":"Decent, clean, food was good. I've only been here twice now, but it's good to know this joint is close to home should I just want to get out for a bit. Went with a girlfriend on a Friday night and it was quiet, but nice. No creepers bugging us. Returned on a Sunday after a funeral with a bunch of friends and we were able to all be seated together right away. Took a long time for everyone to get their food, but I guess 15 people is a lot to cook for all at once!"}
{"text":"Even though the bartenders and our waitress were super friendly, the service was really slow, and it seemed like there were just Vegas locals here. WHOA! Everyone knew each other and I felt out of place.  That's what I get for visiting my Vegas friends!  Oh...the  food? It was OK. I ordered Buffalo Wings. I think Domino's is better."}
{"text":"This is a nice little neighborhood bar.  Nothing fancy more or less your typical Las Vegas style bar. Since the smoking law changed I think they changed this from a bar and grille to just a bar. Don't go here for night life or gourmet food - just a place to have some bar food and some beers!  There bar food is slightly above average.  They actually have a pretty good breakfast here.  I went here for The super bowl... errr... The Big Game... and they had dollar draft beers so I ain't gonna hate on that!  I did see some signs for happy hour specials...  One major bonus is free shuffle board!  Damn I love shuffle board!  They have darts and pool tables too.  The darts looked like real darts - hahahahaha.  I guess when ever I see darts with sharp pointy tips; I just assume some drunk idiot will eventually let one fly out of control and stick a dart in someone's butt cheek!   (or maybe I just think that would super funny)... hmmm.  Anyway - a bar with free shuffle board is 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends chill here twice a week. Nader is the best bartender around. Great music, lots of tv's, and great food. I LOVE this place"}
