{"text":"The shawarma's here are so good. I went again today during lunch special and had 2 chicken shawarma's. So good."}
{"text":"I popped in for the first time in years last week and tried old faithful- the chicken shawarma.  I was disappointed that, 4-5 years later, they no longer have shredded cheese and pineapple available. These toppings (believe it or not) take your shawarma game to another level.   I still think Big Grill makes a killer shawarma, but they're no longer worth the drive from Toronto for me. If they bring back the cheese, I'll be back on their doorstep."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in a while but I also haven't been so disappointed in a while. I came here because it was 4.5 stars.   I got the salad and chicken,  the salad was really boring,  thick dressing kinda like store bought,  would have preferred something more authentic.   Very little chicken that came from a metal container,  not the spit,  no crispness whatsoever. Even the hot sauce was disappointing.   And to top it all off only plastic cutlery and uncleaned tables.   Will not be coming back.    Yelping another place now,  left so unsatisfied I need to go for a second lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service, fresh food, never have to wait long. The owner is friendly and seems to value everyone's business. The shawarmas are great and the biryani is fantastic!  A regular stop when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm currently eating a shawarma plate at this restaurant and I have to say it's amazing. Usually when I get a shawarma plate it's usually pretty good but this is on another level. The meat is seasoned great, the basmati rice tastes like it's cooked in chicken stock and seasoned well. And the portion is good. Usually I don't end up eating all the rice on a shawarma plate but I will this time. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I ordered beef shawarma 5 minutes before closing time. They said it was no problem and prepared a nice looking wrap. After I got home, I opened up the wrap and took a bite. It tasted as if a cleaning chemical was accidently sprayed over the shawarma. It tasted and smelled very bad. This was done unintentionally as they were cleaning the counter with some cleaning product and placed my shawarma on top as it was still wet. I was very disappointed and went back to the restaurant.  After explaining the situation to the owner of the place, he offered to make me another shawarma which turned out to be delicious.  Food is prepared in front of you and this place is always clean. Customer service is very good. My recommendation: chicken or beef shawarma!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shawarma dinner at 830 pm (close to closing time).  The staff was lovely - really kind, but the food was average at best.  The chicken was quite dry... Not sure if it would have been better at lunch/earlier but yeah... Wasn't great."}
{"text":"The best shwarma in the neighborhood!! Fries combo is the reason I come back almost every week back on high school!"}
{"text":"They recently updated the dining area, but still the same great food. I stop by here once a week now..."}
