{"text":"Favourite local hangout! Great food, craft beers & friendly staff. Love the regular activities that are hosted here."}
{"text":"Good: nice indoor and outdoor space.  Food: wings, sandwiches 3/5 FYI wings not very spicy at all but is cooked well.  Horrible: Service, Southern fried chicken.   DO NOT ORDER SOUTHERN FRIED CHICKEN. GRAVY FROM HADES!  The gravy was split, separated, no seasoning, just tasted like vegetable shortening with rosemary. How do you mess up gravy? Seriously wondering if they used vegetable shortening cause I love my fats and this had ZERO flavour.   The server was decent at first even though we were bit annoyed that one of the people at our table got the wrong beer that was also the wrong size. But what ever.   I had taken my food straight to the bar as soon as I tasted the gravy couple of times. Didn't bother touching rest of the plate as gravy was covering whole chicken. I got NO apology just the question what was wrong with it.  Some one in the group order the same thing. My thought is that if someone at the table returns the same food item as other person, you check on that other order asap. The thing is the server avoided the table and had to be flagged down.  My group and I will avoid this place like the plague as well as people we know.    The place is fine if your in the hood and you just want some wings and beers; otherwise I would advise that you avoid this place."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch with the wife and son #2. Friendly server. Clean establishment. Great selection of local and not so local craft ales along with some of the  mass produced \"favourites\". Reasonable selection of well priced wines for those that partake. So far two thumbs up. Standard menu for a pub but covers a lot of tastes and it is a \"pub\" after all :). Lots of space so you can bring a gang or maybe rent the party room downstairs for a bday bash.  Two thumbs up. Now the place was empty and it was a rainy Wednesday afternoon but the food arrived super quick .  Two of us the soup and sandwich lunch special and one the chicken Caesar wrap.  The soup (chicken gumbo) was lovely and the buffalo chicken wrap equally so.  Three thumbs up :).  Great value at $7.99 :)  Overall it's exactly as you expect it to be as a neighbourhood pub/bar and I hope they prosper under the new owners. It simply just what Kingston Rd. needs.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Excellent wings, sandwiches, burgers, salads, platters and enhanced by great beers and even better service! Poutine will make you comatose! Today was not disappointed at all with the wings and Southwood burger."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Grover for years, mainly because it's close to home. However, the place was bought by new owners who've been making really positive changes to the place: lots of local beers on tap, good menu, and lots of really awesome events like open mic, karaoke, and even a knitting club! The new owners are also very community driven, and they do care about customer satisfaction (the old owner couldn't care less), which I love.  The only complaint I have is that the service is very hit and miss. Some servers are great and some are not so good, but the place has gone up in quality over the last several months, so hopefully this can improve as well."}
{"text":"This place has been around for decades but has gone through a few different owner/operators.  The latest ownership change occurred over the last few months.    So we decided to check it out to see if there have been any noteworthy changes (or improvements).    Sadly disappointed.  The place has had somewhat of a makeover.  Some new paint, new Tvs and new staff.   The menu has changed but with no great shifts in the overall patchwork approach.   Best way to describe the menu is pub meets diner    We had crab cakes and a couple variants on the burgers.     Meh.    Crab cakes were quite clearly frozen.   Not a huge offence by itself but there was no heart and soul in the presentation or gArnish to make them standout.   2/10  Burgers were overcooked (burnt) and they tasted bland and almost identical despite quite different toppings.   Why bother with variants when they all taste the same?   2/10.   Fries were basic super fries but at least they cooked them as we asked (extra well done near burnt).     Service was pleasant.    Mixed bag of patrons detracted from the venue for us.   A few hardcore bar regulars.   A gang of ball cap wearing bieber wannabes who were loud and loaded dominated the mood.    Music was way too loud for 530pm.      It was just weird and the food was not enough to go back for.    Too bad.   This place was really something 25 years ago known for the best wings in Canada.    They seem to have lost their focus and are trying to be all things to all people instead of catering to a niche for the middle class families that dominate the surrounding neighbourhood.   Hope someone with vision and courage takes over in the near future and revives this local landmark.      Good luck Grover."}
{"text":"Solid pub for a decent meal and a pint.  Have taken the family there several times, kids meal was fine, and adults meals are always good. Nothing spectacular, but good.  Burgers and Sandwiches (Philly Steak) and Pastas are a great choice.  Good Selection of Beers for the area too! Lots of TVs, would be great for Sunday Football"}
{"text":"Love the Thursdays wings nights ! Half price on the wings. Make them super suicide 5 alarm with pepper seeds on them..."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of places An I can truly An honestly say that this is 1 of the best in Toronto that's for sure An the ppl who work here are just so super friendly it's awesome an amazing"}
{"text":"Visited Sun June 18 party of 20.  I'm a member of Beaches Speeches Toastmasters which meets on Sunday in the area. We have been hosting our annual socials here for several years. Not sure why the ratings are so low, this place is a neighbourhood gem which should be supported.   Pros -  Ordered fruit platter, veggie platter and Gerrard platter. Each platter is huge and can feed at least 5-8 people.  Quick and attentive service.  Interested bottled tea called Kombucha which I had never tasted before.  The bottled root beer was interesting as well.  There is a patio at the back that is partially shaded, seats about 20.  Free parking at the back for about 10 cars.  Cons -  No non-alcholic beer available.  The front signage is not distinct enough, considering this place has been around since 1982 and many guests and neighbors including myself have said they have never noticed this place even though I have driven past this place.     Protip - The downstairs is a private dining area for private parties of up to 70 people! There is a huge TV I think 80inches at least."}
{"text":"Came here with a group with beer passports, and decided to grab dinner as well.  Aside from the decent beer selection, it was pretty awful.   They have open mic night on Fridays, so it was a little busy (not too bad). And they had 3 different games on the TVs. Our server brought us our drinks quickly and took our orders.  I got the roast beef dip.   Roast beef: Very unappetizing. It was gray, tasteless, chewy and felt like it was microwaved. I ate about 75% of it because I was really hungry. Luckily I didn't get sick. Fries: Really good! Highlight of my meal. Dip: Was missing, and I had to ask for it. Pretty sure they made a large batch a while ago and stored it.   My friends didn't love their meals either even though they got the bangers and mash dinner special. Not sure if I'll be back here..."}
{"text":"Spent tonight there with my family, and no one walked away unhappy. Food was excellent. Service was to be commended. Plenty of space and large screen televisions available so that you can sit anywhere you like and be able to watch what you wish."}
{"text":"Um bom pub, na região Upper Beaches. Boas cervejas e boa comida. Peça pelo prato tradicional canadense \"Classic Poutine\", que é batata frita, queijo e molho de carne."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a very quiet Saturday afternoon Tried the jerk chicken tacos. Very very tasty, especially with a cold beer."}
{"text":"Went here for their patio opening in May. From what I understand, the restaurant has had quite a few owners and while this was my first time there, it was a very positive experience.  The place really has a vision with the new, young owners who are so lovely and friendly.The patio is beautiful, small yet cozy. Trendy yet elegant. The communal tables work really well, and if that isn't your style there are options for smaller tables. I really liked the decor!  Really nice selection of craft beers which is a new direction they are taking. Menu is large and well-rounded. Something for everyone -- even vegetarians. I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli which was delicious and I would get again in a heartbeat!  I don't go down to the beaches often but if I do again, I'll be back! Hope this place thrives with the new menu, owners and beautiful renos!  EDIT: I've been back here a few times and still very impressed with their beer selection and upcoming events!"}
{"text":"Good food. Cute back patio. Great service. Location is really the only thing lacking here. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"I gotta be honest; its a bit of a shit hole. One of those bars that's better only seen if you're already totally hammered before stepping foot inside,  or you'll notice how gross it really is."}
{"text":"Worst wings I've ever had! Dry, dry, dry old wings that tasted like biting into cardboard. My friend who had the beef dip describes it as \"salty stale crap\". This place looks nice from the outside but take a bite of their food and you'll be running!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night. No one acknowledged us at door so we eventually took a booth.   Ignored for ten minutes and finally left.  Place was busy but not packed. NO ONE made any attempt to acknowledge us, say hi, apologize for being busy. Just completely ignored us.   Went to Feathers down road and had great meal."}
{"text":"I love the Grover.  We used to go there pretty often.  They have beautiful plasma/lcd TVs all around.  It's a great place to watch a playoff hockey or basketball game.... although living in Toronto I suppose I'm dating myself a bit there.  It is good for other things too! . They have a backyard patio and the food is not bad.  I wouldn't want to eat there everyday, but for a pub it's not bad.  They have one burger called \"The Hammer\" and another one called \"The Godfather.\"  I ordered it one day just because I love the name.  I believe it's saute onions, mozzarella and burger.  Good combination but pretty heavy food.  I've also been with someone who had the souvlaki which was also good.  However, the wait staff can be a bit ditsy.  In a funny sort of way.  One day we sat on the patio, and the waitress came to take our drink orders.  She brought a beer for me, and a water for guest who had ordered a club soda.  Then the guest changed her mind later and ordered a martini - another water came.  We also asked for menus which she never brought.  We eventually gave up and just went home.    But as I said, it's good for some things and not others.  Certain times of year if you sit on a patio you're in no man's land because the waitresses would rather work inside.  Although I believe this weird incident happened in May or something.  Except for that, service is pretty good.  Lots of different draft beers on tap, but I don't think they had any Ontario Craft beers on tap, which is unfortunate.  If you live in the area, it's a great place to try.  However I wouldn't go there now living in the West part of the city. It's a bitch to get to.  And having to rely on a streetcar to get me anywhere far makes me want to regurgitate, so I doubt I'll be going back here soon."}
{"text":"After three tries, we've dubbed this place the \"no-place.\" They are very versed in the word \"NO.\"  \"May I have some honey?\" NO \"May I get a grilled cheese sandwich, since you offer grilled cheese on other items? \"NO.\" \"Do you have rootbeer?\" NO \"Could I get my burger medium rare?\" NO \"May we sit in the corner?\" NO \"Excuse me, is there a waiter or waitress available?\" No, we'll be with you soon. ---fifteen minutes later, after listening to the waitress go on and on about the Leafs with a customer at the bar (she wasn't bartending), we got up to leave, and she then says \"Are you ready to order?\"  At least we got to reply with \"NO.\"  We went to Feathers a block down the street.  Treated well, GREAT selection of beers and Scotch, and terrific service with a smile.   The food is fair. The wines are not so good. Great selection of beers. Plan on waiting a looooooonnngggg time for the food to come out. Last night, we stayed through the pain (it was too cold to go elsewhere). After ordering two quesadilla, a burger, and some sweet potato fries, we had the pleasure of waiting 45 minutes. It would have seemed faster, had the waitress kept our ginger ale, wine, and jack/ginger's freshened.  I'd give them one star, except their sweet potato fries are pretty good.  Unless you're really into torture, avoid this place. The owners won't miss you at all. And I promise, you won't miss them, either."}
{"text":"Was told this was \"fancy\" pub food but missed the mark on that one. I ordered a roasted beet salad with steak on top. Maybe there's a new law where you don't have an option to choose how done your steak is, but mine came out well-done. I'm a medium-rare to medium girl and it was not appetizing. My friend ordered a burger and sweet potato fries and the fries were so salty they were inedible. Would give this restaurant a pass."}
