{"text":"Had a decent sandwich, took forever to arrive. Like the ordering on iPads. Staff was a little rough."}
{"text":"Terrible service and over-priced. Their iPad ordering app has the nerve to default the tip to 18% for the grumpy entitled serving staff."}
{"text":"Super shitty food that will cost you an arm and a leg (at least). The man with black hair and facial hair was extremely rude. He should probably actually pay attention to customers instead of flirting with airport employees. Better off going to the Tim Horton's."}
{"text":"C'est un restaurent de pâte et de pizza principalement. Les prix sont raisonnable. Le service et l'ambiance sont très bien. Les pizzas que nous avons commandées étaient succulentes. Je recommande"}
{"text":"Super overpriced food. I paid for the tiramisu (which btw was $10. For a piece of cake that's the size of 2 bites) then they decided to tell me they didn't even have it. Refund took a good 20 mins, cos apparently supervisor isn't here."}
{"text":"If you're on an international flight at Pearson, you can finally have something  healthy and tasty to eat. The menu's are on Ipads, which, to my surprise, I enjoyed because it allows people to use their own language to read the menu and make their order. The waitress was really friendly and helpful. And there are lots of healthy choices, including options for people who are gluten intolerant, sustainable and organic meats, some Niagara wines, mostly craft beers and bistro style options from downtown , such as chickpea and rapini and sweet potato soup, both of which I enjoyed. The price, for an airport, was just right."}
{"text":"I live in little Italy and I didn't see the point to go that far for a pizza. It was also a bad start when we reserved for 2 on a Saturday. The person who answered the phone was a bit rude, especially when we asked if it was BYOB. The information was not clear on the web and we wanted to get the right information. So we were a bit scared to go their, spend our money and have a bad experience. I guess it was just one person having a bad day because it was a really nice evening.  We sat at the bar, the restaurant was packed. We could have a nice view on the bar and the kitchen with their amazing oven. Food was delicious and met our expectations. We shared 3 entrees, including moist polpettas and arancinis, both served with a really good tomato sauce. We also shared a bottle of wine, a good and crispy thin crust margarita pizza and espressos. Everything for 100$, taxes and tip in, it was just awesome! Staff was really nice and friendly even with my friends who speaks English only. I would recommend this one for sure !"}
{"text":"I think even giving one star is too generous... Came by this place during a layover. They charged me an arm and a leg for an \"egg salad\" sandwich. However when I received this sandwich it was literally just scrambled eggs and avocado and lettuce on white bread. Absolutely overpriced and was not good at all! Wish I was able to get my money back."}
{"text":"Un concept simple et parfait ! La pizza est excellente, le vin est bon et le restaurant est troooop beau ! Le service etait aussi très bien ! Nous allons y retourner c'est certain!!!"}
{"text":"Heirloom est une excellente pizzeria. Il y a eu quelques ratés sur les recettes dans les premières semaines après l'ouverture, mais ils ont beaucoup amélioré la qualité et ils continuent ! Le service a toujours été impeccable. Continuez comme ça !"}
{"text":"Un nouveau venu dans le quartier. En fait, il ouvrait ce soir et j'en reviens. On retrouve de la pizza, mais aussi des pâtes faites sur place ainsi que des salades en plus d'un bar à vin.  La carte des vins est plutôt bien. Plusieurs places assises (65 je crois).  Les prix sont abordables, le service excellent. J'ai choisi la pizza au proscuitto. Portion généreuse,  service rapide. Les pizzas se situent autour de 15 à 20$ de mémoire. C'est franchement délicieux. Un must"}
{"text":"Visting from Boston and we ran across this italian place in a rough part of Montreal.  It was amazing.  Classy decor, warm ambiance, amazing food paired with equally amazing service. Would recommend to all visitors."}
{"text":"Julie the bartender was amazing  Knowledgeable and on point Shane has great customer service skills being attentive and caring with everyone that he encountered even though he had a headache I remember him telling me he wasn't feeling 100% I can only imagine how extraordinary he would be. L"}
{"text":"Slow service, crappy food, expensive.  The servers would sooner spend time socializing with each other and the bar tender than getting the food to the tables.  We waited half an hour for the food -- which arrived cold -- and had finished our meals before the drinks showed up!  The only upside is that they comp'd it when we complained to the manager... but tracking down the manager was another exercise!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink while we waited for our flight to board. Kinda fun ordering from an iPad at the bar. Quick and friendly service when we did interact ;)"}
{"text":"As a millennial I am all about electronics. But when I sit down with someone for a bite to eat before our flight I would prefer not to have an iPad in the middle of the table. The food is very expensive ... 2 Caesars and 2 sandwiches cost me 67.00. I don't like that you have to pay first and tip when all the server does is bring the plate to your table.    I felt really bad for the older couples that came and didn't know how to use an iPad or that it was even possible to order on it. One woman asked the employee making sandwiches if she could get served and he said you have to order on the iPad.  When the server came up to help another couple that was sitting at the bar she asked the patron if she was going to show the other patron how to use the iPad (first one was still standing there after the employee making sandwiches told her to use the iPad )  In conclusion: go somewhere else, not worth the price for the sandwiches and the service is less than a subway. At least they take your order."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant qui propose des pizzas à croûte fine délicieuses (et aussi des pâtes). L'endroit est moderne, un peu hispter.  Choix de vins diversifié, très bon service, je vous conseille de réserver à l'avance pour avoir une table car il y a beaucoup de monde le soir"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the enticing looking pastries stacked up in the display windows...  Stale and overpriced... Completely underwhelming"}
{"text":"Excellente pizzeria dans HoMa qui sert de la pizza à croûte mince dans four à bois! Les pâtes sont toutes aussi exquises! Le restaurant est super beau (très instagrammable) !   C'est aussi un bar à vin, donc le choix est assez varié et les prix sont corrects!   Si vous voulez y aller un soir de fin de semaine, n'oubliez pas de réserver!"}
{"text":"They didn't have too many choices for sandwiches at 5am (understandable) and the chicken feta sandwich seemed like the best choice. Sandwich was VERY dry and the salad had too much dressing. There was little chicken or anything else in the sandwich...I was mostly just eating bread for $14 :( Only ate half of it and threw the other half out in disappointment.   Service was very slow even though they had 3 people on staff. They were only serving one other person but it took them a long time to get my pre-made sandwich out of the fridge to heat it up. Well it is the airport and they know you ain't going anywhere else for food lol"}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad!  When I ordered, I was past security. Seated at a table with a tablet that I used to order a single cocktail. It made me pay, and tip, at the time of ordering. I was their hostage. I had to wait, and wait, and wait. I hit a button to call the waitress over several times to no avail. I only got my drink after thirty minutes when I was about to go up to the cashier and complain. It didn't look like what I ordered and it was left on my table by a waitress who said a quick, mumbled \"Sorry it took so long\" and left. That's the extent of the service I got for tipping well on a $12 cocktail.  The management at this restaurant is surely awful, and they take advantage of the fact that you're stuck behind security and have already paid."}
{"text":"The Irish waitress was such a sweetie! Food was really good! A little bit too healthy for me but tasted great"}
{"text":"The iPad ordering system is awkward, slow, and pointless. Traditional human service would be an improvement. I had never seen someone take 15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich until coming here. The sandwich came - bizarrely - on a big, floppy croissant, but was at least freshly made, as opposed to the refrigerated sandwiches found elsewhere in the airport. 1 star for being made to order. No stars for everything else, especially the stupid ordering system."}
