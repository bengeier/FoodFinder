{"text":"3.25 Stars.

Voula has owned this restaurant since 1991, but it sounds like there's been a restaurant at this location for decades.  Get her talking...she's friendly.

My friends and I all had the standard breakfasts, which were just slightly above average.  The home fries were excellent, and the watermelon garnish was a nice touch.  The establishment loses 1/4 stars for the .75 coffee refill.  What's up with that, Voula?  We've been to well over 60 diners and dives in Toronto now (see list) and this has never happened before.  Occasionally, a menu will list \"one refill\" or \"refills extra\" but those policies have never been enforced.

If you're in the neighbourhood and want a diner breakfast, this place will fill the bill.  Don't go TOO far out of your way, though."}
{"text":"Sorry I have to say this, but the experience there was really bad, even though I don't wanna be mean to the elderly lady who served us there and probably made the food herself. I went there with a friend, had the Florentino Burger and it made me sick, it smelled like the oil had been too old and the cooked veggies on top weren't fresh. The washroom also looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages, no soap and a roll of paper towels on top of the towel holder, honestly disgusting. Never gonna go back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this is terrible. I am famished so will eat about anything. I am breaking my fast from giving blood. 

Ordered scrambled eggs, sausage, white rye toast (extra). 
Coffee is watery slightly burnt. Eggs rubbery but edible with ketchup. Sausage is a link of lava over cooked with a slightly rancid aftertaste. Actually spit it out. Home fries are cooked in sausage fat so have residual disgusting aftertaste. 
Server is friendly. 
Good place to sit in front of the window and people watch."}
{"text":"A mom friend and I stumbled upon this little place one day when we decided to take a casual walk to Canadian Tire. It had to be the hottest most humid day of the summer so far and you know you're in trouble when you're like: its just a few more blocks...a few more blocks...a few more....where the fuck is it!? IT WAS SO FAR. 

So without any sort of breakfast in us we stopped in at Smileys for a bite and as much liquids as our bladders can handle. 

We each ordered the breakfast with eggs, bacon and toast. The waitress was friendly and brought over two (not so clean) highchairs for the kids and made lots of space for our strollers. 

Now, I like divey restaurants...but just something about this place was not only divey but maybe a little seedy too, and I'm not sure if that is good. 

The breakfast was tasty but for the portions overpriced - it came out to about $8 which maybe you would pay down the Danforth for the added atmosphere of the place, but here you pretty much feel like you're dining in your grandmother's (the one who doesn't know how to cook THAT well, okay my grandmother) dining room. 

All in all it was a good stop made out of necessity, but I won't be rushing back there."}
{"text":"I ate here with friends once for brunch.  We all agreed it was OK and nothing special enough to try again.

Everything was fine: food, service price but nothing really stood out.  But this is fine too--sometimes you just need a cheap, easy, simple brunch.  If you live within a walk of this place, it is worth popping in for a meal."}
{"text":"Popped in about a week ago for brunch and it was awful. I asked for chocolate milk and got nestle quick syrup in a glass of milk with a spoon to stir it myself. The bacon was slimy and undercooked, the potatoes were greasy & completely flavourless and the eggs were slimy and greasy as well. No fresh fruit as a garnish because they were out, apparently. Service was fast, a little too fast, and the waitress was quick and abrasive. She didn't even ask me how I wanted my eggs cooked or what type of bread I wanted. As she was walking away I had to call out to her \"eggs over easy & rye toast please\" and she responds \"we don't have rye. Only white\"
... Well white bread it is then. 
We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"We ate there a few weeks ago. WE all agreed that our meals felt like bricks had settled in the bottom of our stomachs!!!"}
