{"text":"This restaurant poorly labels their menu items on postmates. 
I ordered a side salad with no bacon.
There was bacon in my food. 
I also ordered the potato salad as well that has bacon.
I had a plain bagel and it tasted like plastic. Will not be returning or ordering ever again.

I posted a picture."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed two breakfasts here while in Tempe. Great juices and smoothies to start a healthy morning. Plus the staff are super warm and welcoming. Thanks for the great offering during my visit."}
{"text":"The service was fast, fresh and fairly priced. It tasted amazing! I was suprised at the quality of the delivery food. I will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Always great food, smoothies, and juices. The sandwiches are a good size sandwich and totally worth the price. The staff is friendly every time as well."}
{"text":"Run, do not walk to this place.  Everything I've had (both acai bowls, a smoothie and two different sandwiches) have been stupid good.  I contemplated a 35 min drive last night JUST to eat here again.  Fresh, creative and amazingly tasty schtuff.  I see the Artie and a Chab salad in my near future.  I'm not going to lie, I'll be bummed when school starts again and it gets crazy busy. Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food is very good but can be a little pricey. The staff were also super friendly. I would just say that the food though takes a bit to come out so if you're extremely hungry you should try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I am hooked on the spicy one salad (minus the dressing). I am picky about salad dressings so I won't hold that against them. A good pico de gallo or salsa (no sugar) or just fresh lime juice could sub for the dressing. I still think it is a good salad on its own. My coworker enjoyed her chicken Caesar salad. I will go back."}
{"text":"Very slow, service left much to be desired. Not great quality. Expectations should be LOW if you are going to try."}
{"text":"Delicious Factory has the best ACAI around ASU! As someone who lived in Brazil, this acai was legit! Great food! Friendly and welcoming staff and owner! I'll definitely be returning throughout the year!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food is always great- usually the service is too. However, I stopped in tonight (3/29) around 5:50- dinner time- and stood at the counter to order and waited to be helped for close to 10 minutes. I didn't see any employees in the restaurant. There were no customers eating in the store either. I was even wondering if it was closed or if it was just that there were no employees around for so long that other customer that had been in weren't able to order either and left.  Eventually I went somewhere else and got food. I've been a regular customer here since they opened and love the food, but the service tonight was completely nonexistent."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a little bit and ordering lunch.  I usually order the #3 or I might get an acai bowl which are both great items for lunch and usually Very yummy! Today I ordered a Turkey sandwich #3 and something was completely off. I opened it up and the greens seemed to have been sitting around a  while as they looked pale and wilted. I also noticed that the bread was not fresh or crunchy like before. I don't know if this is new bread but it tastes nothing like the last few sandwiches which was fantastic. They also put ONE slice of Turkey, yes ONE, in the sandwich and barely a smudge of honey mustard. The tomato was soggy also. I had high hopes for this place, I really did but this ONE time was so bad, I won't order sandwiches again. I am giving 3 stars only because the smoothies and bowls are delicious and so far I have not had any issues. I hope the quality of the sandwiches improve for other patrons! Please! I want this place to succeed!"}
{"text":"Their breakfast bowls are on point! My wife had The Medi, and I had The Mush. Both were perfect for breakfast and perfect for sharing. The staff was sweet and helpful to us as we were with our 18 month old daughter who loves to climb the stairs inside. One of our favorite places to eat breakfast and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.   I only wish that they opened earlier.  If you want a diverse menu of juices, smoothies and sandwiches this is the place."}
{"text":"Good salads and sandwiches! Açaí I don't like so much, but it can be because is very different I'm Brazil."}
{"text":"This place has great smoothies, sandwiches, and açaí bowls! And the customer service is great."}
{"text":"Delicioso !! Muy fresco y original ... el sándwich perfecto balance de sabor ... solo puedo decir Yummm!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. At times the wait for your food can be a little much but it's absolute fresh. The people are friendly, great options to chose from."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. Friendly staff and I was happy with the pricing. Bought #56, which had peanut butter and coconut flakes and all kinds of other good stuff, it was made for me in what seemed like seconds, and it was super good. The staff wanted to know how I liked it. They also had iced mint and fruit water, which was a lifesaver when I walked in off the sizzling sidewalk. Wish I lived here so I could go all the time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food ere was good but overpriced for the portions sizes. They have a huge menu but are severely understaffed. At 12:00 you should assume there will be people in your restaurant for lunch. 
I waited 25 minutes for a smoothie. there were only about 10-15 people in the restaurant. 
Disappointed mainly with service and portions vs price.  We heard many others in the restaurant with the same complaints on timelines of the food."}
{"text":"This place is quite good. I love the interior with all the wood and high ceilings - however, the outside of this cafe is very underwhelming and I passed it 2-3 times before realizing it was a cafe and not a vape shop, which is honestly what it looks like on the outside. 

I came here and got the Spicy One salad for lunch with a few adjustments. It was during prime lunch hour and there was no line and the food was out in less than 5 minutes. Sadly, they forgot the avocado, but I definitely recommend the salad. Will definitely have to come back here and try the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Definite favorite for lunch on Mill Avenue! I love their smoothies and acai bowls. The Acai bowl is very large, with granola on top and bottom. Their sandwiches are also delicious. It's easy to walk by and not think much of it, but give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious Factory, what a cool name! This was the 3rd place I visited for an acai bowl and it was the largest bowl of the 3.  There were plenty of paid street parking on a weekday morning. The spots in the back of the restaurant cost slightly less than the parking spots in front.  It cost about $0.25/15 minutes of parking.  The quantity of the acai bowl makes up the difference in parking cost compared to the other locations.  The acai bowl cost $7 and comes with blended acai, strawberry, banana topped with honey, granola, coconut flakes, chia seeds, banana and strawberry.  It was pretty good and may be my favorite of the 3, but only by a smidge. 

Iced caramel latte $3.25 (M) - Pretty good coffee.

Other great options for acai bowl in the area that I tried: Original ChopShop and Berry Divine Acai Bowls.

{"text":"Food is good and staff is nice, but with no line it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"Really not good. People who think this place is good have never had good food in their life. Had açaí bowls. The bulk of it was Made up of ice in order to cut their cost on actually using fruit. First off too cold and your ripping off your customers! Flavor was bland and boring and for $10 not worth it. 

Also watched an employee comeback from the bathroom, not wash his hands and then scrap banana in the bowl with his bare hands. 

I don't expect this place to last for sure. Way way too many items on menu and clearly they have no clue what they are doing! 

Thinking of disputing because all we got was ice and that was not in the list of items for the bowls!!!!!!

Awful! Threw them out"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Had the tuna salad and the tropical dream smoothie. So tasty! Service was great as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"DO NOT get the açaí bowl from here. Probably the worst thing I have put in my mouth. Tastes like watery feet. The employees seemed lazy and did not even acknowledge me being there."}
{"text":"Soooooo yummy! We had the medi breakfast bowls this am and I got a mean green juice to wash it down. Sooo amazing. The staff was extremely helpful, and the prices are more than fair for such great food. I truly hope this little gem lasts here!"}
{"text":"First time I came here, I was impressed by their O.C breakfast bagel... I work on Mill Ave so it's nice to have go to breakfast place.. Now the next time I went I tried and wasn't impressed with their cappuccino ( little heads up, it's basically a regular coffee with milk absolutely ZERO froth. ) but I wasn't completely turned away yet... I tried them again for a third time but mixed up my breakfast, I went with a PLAIN bagel toasted with cream cheese and their banana dream smoothie.. let me tell you, I was completely dissatisfied with all of it. The smoothie tasted like milk blended with a banana absolutely awful! I could've probably made a better one at home and not payed $4 for it. Than my bagel was nowhere near toasted and they gave me like the tiniest bit of cream cheese on top... all which took them 10 minutes to make. I knew this wasn't a fast grab to eat from my previous encounters but my gosh a toasted bagel and smoothie shouldn't take that long when I'm the ONLY customer in there. Needless to say, I will not be returning nor making this my daily breakfast go to."}
{"text":"We had the Mill Ave and spicy Cc sandwich, both were awesome! Tried Brain energy and mean green juice, also good! Right now they have a special where if you buy a sandwich you get a juice or smoothie for $3. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time and got the mush breakfast bowl. Very tasty! But there was a lot of eggshells haha but that's a simple mistake that even I make! Will be back again. Not for the eggshells tho. (:"}
{"text":"This place delivered to our work. Ended up having paper in a drink.  We lost our appetite and didn't finish."}
{"text":"For a place that advertises itself as a healthy alternative, I find it puzzling that its sandwiches are served on bread made of processed white flour. Wheat bread is not offered as an option. 

That's too bad. Otherwise, I would have made this place a semi-regular stop. Maybe they'll respond to this suggestion."}
{"text":"I came across this place on Door Dash.  I ordered the Avo Lox Sandwich and was blown away!  The sandwich was scrum-didly-umptious!!  I'll be ordering again or checking it out in person.  Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"Bought an acaí bowl from here. Extremely large and worth the extremely cheap price. Went twice in one day! Definitely a place to visit during the warm AZ days. Wish they had one in California."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I order here at least once a week and everything I've had has been fantastic. The volcano bowl is my favorite. Great place for for quick healthy and tasty food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"A little pricier than my bf and I expected but still good! Looking forward to trying their açaí bowl next"}
{"text":"favorite place on Mill Ave. to grab food when I'm at work! They're service is a little slow but so worth it bc the food is so good! I wish their menu was a little smaller bc everything is so good it's hard to choose, but I guess that's a good thing!

I'd say it's the healthiest place on mill which is why it's so appealing to me. I go here average 2 times a week!

Don't forget to get a punch card so you can earn free smoothies or food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic salad & juice!  Super fresh & filling!  
Also the best sandwiches on Mill, and the super fresh and tasty juices are made right in front of you.

Friendly, relaxing service and the freshest ingredients you'll find in the area!

Healthy, tasty, locally owned, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had their \"The Spicy One\" salad with ground beef in it and....I had to throw it out (I ordered delivery) I couldn't eat much of it because it was so incredibly, unbearably salty. I had corn tortillas that I scooped the salad into and ate like a taco to dilute the saltiness and I still couldn't bring myself to eat more of it. Maybe their other salads are great, but I don't think I'll be ordering from them again :/"}
{"text":"Nice little place... Got the Frenchie sandwich and a Raspberry smoothy.  The sandwich was panini pressed and quite good.  The smoothie had good texture, but the flavor did not jump.out and say Wow like some smoothies I've had.  It wasn't a bad smoothie, just not great."}
{"text":"The food is good. And I'm surprise it is not more crowded. Could be, doen side to my visit here, the place smells like cleaning supplies. I'm glad that the place is clean and disinfected but it should not smell like the cleanning pruducts. The smell made it difficult to enjoy my meal here. If they can figure that out it will be better."}
{"text":"My wife ordered a juice and it feels like it's taking 30 minutes for it to be made, really it was like 20 but WTF, REALLY? How long does it take to make a juice? It wasn't even crowded"}
{"text":"Delicious Factory is DELICIOUS.
Probably one of the best options on Mill Ave. Fresh, fairly priced and local. The food is so good!  Fresh juices, smoothies, salads, breakfast bowls, sandwiches, coffee etc.  Great addition to Mill."}
{"text":"After what I thought was a slow start several months back, I held my tongue (and my tastebuds) and gave them another try.  So I re-visited this week once.  Then twice.  Three times.  I can't wait to go back for fourths (dinner tonight)!   Super good tuna salad sandwich, really great healthy greens salads, fresh juices including 'green' selections.  Everything is so flavorful -- I'm hooked, and can't wait to come back for breakfast, too.  Thank you, Delicious Factory owner(s) and employees!"}
{"text":"Once I found them, it was good but they are a little hidden among the other suites. The Cobb sandwich was good but a little skimpy. Their crusty French bread for the sandwich was the bees knees. All the flavors were good and topping fresh. I was just sad about the filling to bread ratio. Hoping for a little more protein and less bread. Otherwise good and I'd go again. Plus I love downtown Tempe. So they're lucky to be there..."}
{"text":"Got the avo smoothie as a quick pick me up and the price did not disappoint! You can't find a smoothie that size for $4 anywhere!!!! It was somewhat lacking in flavor, but did the job! Would go back to try their juices and salads!"}
{"text":"I have come here often for there breakfast bagels. The bagels are fresh and soft. I have also had lunch here and the salads are so tasty and fresh as well as the smoothies. Prices are reasonable and I will continue to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was great and it's such a cute place! But between the three of us there and their three workers, it took over twenty minutes to get my acai bowl....there was very little teamwork, and the poor girl making mine was doing her best! Would love to see some improvement but I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I just went here to get an acai bowl. It wasn't very good, I wouldn't go back. The acai bowl was $10, it was a big size, but most of it was smoothie part that wasn't very good.The atmosphere was decent. It looked really empty.. and i kind of understand now"}
{"text":"Everything from here is SOOOO good!! Not many people know about this place yet which is nice because it's rarely crowded but I'm sure that will change quick."}
{"text":"Very fresh and clean option for the Tempe area. Great vibe and the workers were polite and friendly. For a place that has great salads and shows football, that's a win for me. I will make this a regular spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've been here like 5 times and service is good, price is great, and very tasty. The OC breakfast sandwich is awesome. One time they took along time to make my food and they came and apologized for the delay and gave me a complimentary drink and got my food right out!"}
{"text":"I tried the Avo Chicken sandwich, there was only one slice of avocado in the entire sandwich. I felt cheated. This was my first experience with this place and I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great funky ambience, excellent service. I'm enjoying a hot soy latte."}
{"text":"Great healthy food. The taste was great, had a spicy one salad. Wife had the cheeseburger, and she's picky but ate all the toppings. Almost 5 stars but it took 35 minutes to get our food!!! Don't come hungry, or you will starve by the time the food comes. They don't have a great system of calling out the orders, as one person called our food number, gave me half my order, then 2 minutes later called out spicey one salad, they should do one or the other as that's confusing..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good sandwich, panini, or salad, this is a great place. The veggies are super fresh and there are a lot of options. The folks running the place are very friendly and you get excellent customer service as well.  Highly recommend as a fresh and healthy alternative to some of the other places on Mill. Lots of healthy juices and smoothies too"}
{"text":"I love going to this place for a salad or smoothie on my lunch break. Their breakfast scrambles are super good too. The only complaint I have is that the one time I ordered an acai bowl, the ice wasn't blended well at all so I was eating chunks of ice and it was pretty bad. I get my acai bowls elsewhere now, but everything else I've had has been awesome!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Delicious Factory! Restaurant is super cute inside. Friendly staff. Food is Delicious! Everything I have had has been stellar. The Tuna Salad is my favorite along with the Mill Panini! Love being able to get an iced latte along with it. Would love an iced coffee option but its not that big of a deal. I would dine every day for lunch if I could. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite health food restaurant in Tempe. I am so sick and tired of these overpriced, stale health food restaurants so stumbling upon Delicious Factory was a delight. not only can you order ahead through Eat24, the food and beverage is incredible, especially the breakfast! If you are someone who likes a nice, healthy, sandwich/salad, smoothie, fresh pressed juice or other treats, look no further! Great service, great food and a great vibe!"}
{"text":"Only place in Tempe to go find phenomenal fresh pressed juice with delicious vegetables as well as great breakfasts and sandwiches. Haven't had a single thing bad from there since they have opened and I try to get a juice every day. The #33 mean green juice is my go to and they're always happy to add anything extra. Do your self a favor and try it out, even if you're not a health nut. Get a bacon cheeseburger, regardless you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Their açaí bowl are about $10 and  huge! The bottom part is pre- packaged I was told and that part did not taste as great as I expected."}
{"text":"EVERYONE! EAT, DRINK, AND LIVE HERE. Cute.

Oh hey DF- love you. I'll be sure to say something next time for my own preferences but how's about asking ppl about ice in the juice, man. We gotta get on the page before doing that kind of thing willy-nilly, ya know? It's weird. I googled opinions for ice in juice and felt justified in writing this ridiculous Yelp review. Good day"}
