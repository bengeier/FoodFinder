{"text":"We went here to watch the World Cup final. Luckily enough Spain won, because the place was 99% spanish fans.

I can't speak to dancing shows, maybe they are nice. But I would caution anyone coming here just for food and drink. The food was fine, but nothing special, however service varied between slow and rude. They simply weren't organised.

There is a general sense of neglect about the place -- in the upstairs nightclub, the stalls in the men's washroom don't lock, and one doesn't even have a block on the door, so there's no way to even hold it shut with your hand. Plus the washroom smelled like piss before anyone had used it. 

In another example, when they turned on the projector so we could watch the football, it said \"replace lamp\". Their solution was simply to reset the projector. It worked throughout the game, sure, but wouldn't it be better to actually replace the lamp? I feel that if the owners really cared, they would fix minor things like this. It doesn't speak well of them that they haven't."}
{"text":"Let it be known that I am not much of a fan of dancing. Yes terrible, I know, but true. This however, was until tonight!

Plaza Flamingo was one of those places you pass on the street and think 'wow, that's really cool. We should go sometime...' and then never end up going. 

First let me explain how Plaza Flamingo works. On Fridays and Saturdays they have a 'dinner special package.' So you make a reservation for dinner (starting after 6:00pm), and before, during, or after dinner enjoy one of two, or both, flamingo shows. Make sure you reserve for the 'dinner special package.' The first show is 8:00 - 8:45pm and the second is 10:00 - 10:45pm. Keep in mind that the show times are rather loose. After dinner, wine, dessert, and coffee you have the option of going upstairs for free salsa and merengue lessons from 9:00 - 10:30pm. After the lessons you are welcome to stay till 4:00am enjoying \"the best of Salsa, Merengue, R&B, and the most Exotic Latin-American Rhythms you can imagine.\" 

This is my suggestion for planning your evening. Make your reservation for around 7:00pm or 7:30pm. Make sure you allow enough time to enjoy your meal, drinks, and desserts before 9:00pm (the time the dance lessons start). Take your time and enjoy your food and drink. The first flamingo show starts at 8:00pm. If you don't want to be eating during the then simply make your reservations earlier. At nine, head upstairs for your free dance lessons. Choose to stay and dance the night away, or feel free to leave after the lessons. Either way, make sure you go for the dance lessons. 

Ok, finally here is my review. A LOT OF FUN! I took my better half (who loves to dance btw) to Plaza Flamingo for our 3 year anniversary. She's wanted to go for a while and I thought what better time. I decided to suck it up, slap on my dance shoes, take a deep breath, and jump in head first. Remember, I am not a dancer.

We got to Flamingo just before 8:00pm, say around a quarter to. We ordered our wine and ate our appetizers. The flamingo show started about 25 mins late, just in time for out meals to arrive. We sat next to the stage so we had a great view. Unfortunately I was sitting with my back to the stage and kept having to turn around between bites. After my main course, instead of keep having to turn around, I switched sides so we were sitting side by side. We enjoyed dessert, the rest of our wine and coffee like that. Quite romantic in fact. We didn't end up settling (paying the bill) until about twenty after nine. We got our dance lesson tickets with the bill. We headed upstairs - where the lessons are and the dance / club floor. In hind sight make sure you are done dinner and settled before 9. Arriving to the lessons late and trying to catch up is killer. Just be upstairs by 9:00pm, ok! 

Before I get to the dancing let me tell you about dinner. The food is good. I said good, not great or fantastic. I have decided that you do not go to Plaza Flamingo for the food. You go for the atmosphere, show, music, and dancing. Now back to the lessons...

The lessons are great fun. I don't like dancing, and near hate it. I will find any excuse not to do it. So if I had a good time it must be good. I almost never go dancing with my better half, so it was the least I could do. I wanted to do something nice for her. If anything I wish the lessons were longer! (We are thinking about taking weekly lessons - and yes, I agreed to this.) We were first taught the salsa and then the merengue. After the lessons, the floor is opened, the music is turned up, and the night begins. We ended up staying a while trying to cement our new skills. I have to say that I really enjoyed the night and we even got some dancing out of me!

Make sure you go at least once. I'll bet you head back for a second though. :)


PROS:
Good flamingo show, great lessons and tunes, super fun dancing. 

CONS:
Food is good, but not great. ...but that's really not why you go anyway."}
{"text":"We went there for weekday buffet. The price was really cheap, but the food was cheap as well :( Very small selection of foods, and the taste were not anything near special."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to the infamous Plaza Flamingo as my friend's date/ wing girl for his friend's birthday party.  Since learning to latin dance, I've always wanted to come here to see what it's like, -I've heard so many great things from so many people.  Upon arrival and entering the restaurant/ dance club, I was surprised, I saw dining tables, but I didn't see a dance floor!  My friend and I were ushered to the birthday party, seated and given menus.  As we waited for our drinks, we browsed the menu which featured a somewhat pricy selection of latino dishes but nothing but the house salad was vegan friendly. (Minus one). We also found out the dance floor, ie the actual club, was upstairs.

I settled on the house salad, which wasn't very good for $6.95. My friend ordered three empanadas, which he described as mini fried beef patties.  We weren't hungry because we got ice cream/  sorbet at Baskin Robins en route to Plaza Flamingo -I needed something COLD to ice my sore throat. 

As we ate, a LIVE flamenco show  came on a couple of times, which featured two dancers and a spanish guitar player. A Mariachi with a white wide brim hat came to serenade each table, particularly our table because we were celebrating a birthday. Both performances were really good contributed to the restaurant's attempt to create a latin dining and 'theatre' experience.

When we finally finished dinner and everyone who was supposed to come arrived, we made our way to the club on the second floor. To my surprise, it wasn't extremely packed and they did play latin music. My friend and I immediately made our way to the dance floor because we were both anxiously waiting for it... we had planned to have a friendly competition... a dance-off between the 2 of us.... which wasn't fair in my opinion cos I was sooo sick. But I did my best to show him that I can still rock the dance floor while sick... and I did! =) My latin dance training, in classes and in latin clubs most def paid off. 

While I did have an awesome time at Plaza Flamingo, and won't mind coming back, there are some things that must be noted, especially in comparison to Wednesday nights at Marlowe -where I usually frequent for latin dancing....

1. The music. They play lots more of reggaeton and  some top 40 mixes. I really don't like how latin clubs would play those 2 when everyone came to get their salsa on!  At Marlowe, they play alot of latin music: salsa, bachata, and merengue mostly. They also have a LIVE band that plays the same. I love LIVE music. 

2. The crowd. It's a younger and less dance disciplined crowd at Plaza Flamingo. The patrons seem less concerned about the art of latin dancing, but rather they just want to have a good time dancing to latin music.  At Marlowe, the majority are older and seasoned latin dancers from suburbia... mainly Richmond Hill. At Marlowe, it's typical to see dancers doing crazy latin dance tricks/ moves on the dance floor, myself included, and thus there's a more competitve and sophisticated atmosphere than at Plaza Flamingo. I didn't see anyone doing any crazy and showy tricks/ moves on the dancefloor at Plaza Flamingo, other than me and my friend, and this guy who asked me to dance while my friend took a washroom break.  I also find the gentlemen that frequent Marlowe more respectful of the dance and of the ladies.  But I'm probably basing that on the guy who asked me to dance: it looked like he was showing off to his friends who was standing nearby. But he was a strong male lead... I can't dance with guys who can't lead. In latin dancing, it's the guy's job to lead... the girl shouldn't need to backlead. 

3. The club. Plaza's a bit run down. It's dark and dingy looking. Marlowe's more upscale, cleaner, and prettier. Go R-Hill! 

4. The washroom. Plaza's washroom is kind of gross and looks like what a typical night club washroom would look like. That's not very good for them because they're also a restaurant for a good part of the time. Marlowe's washroom is cleaner and better maintained. Does not remind of a night club, but a nice, snazzy restaurant in suburbia. 

5. The cover. Plaza's cover is $12 if your bill does not total over $30...that's $30 per person. That's kind of steep to me. Marlowe's -no cover, but you can always order drinks and food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good salsa place, don't come here. You're better off at El Rancho or somewhere else. 

Granted, they are renovatiing the dining room, where I remember you can have dinner, and watch a flamenco show, and have free cover to go upstairs to the club. It's renovating now, and they took down tthe Plaza Flamingo sign and it's called \"Club is Open\"

After paying the steep $12 cover, you go upstairs to this dingy room. They did renovate a little since I was there, and there's nice couches you can grab even if you don't have bottle service. You even get waitress service. 

The dance floor is simple and very loud. The bass was turned up so high, that you had to shout. It got better after a bit. There are lots of laser lights. 

If you're looking to pick up, all the girls here are either attached, escorts or just not looking. 

What was really disappointing was that during the 3 hours were there, they played maybe only 2 Salsa Songs. Lots of Meringue and Bachata and Cumbia/Reggae. 
There were also some top 40, but that's not what we were there for. Actually, we danced more hustle in the room than ever to the pop songs. After 12, we just go lots of gino beats, with the crowd to reflect that. 

Not really our scene. 
After 6 years, I wanted to give the place another chance, but I probably will never come back again."}
{"text":"A hidden dance class!

SALSA
So my friend wanted to go salsa dancing so I found this place Plaza Flamingo place.  $12 per person and you get 1.5 hrs of dance class with 2 instructors which is pretty good I say.

What was even better was that we went on a Friday night and there were barely any couples there. I think in total there were 6 couples and 2 instructors. Ratios pretty good.

BUT, more couples did come later so it did get crowded.

They taught us 3 dances.
1. Salsa
2. Meringue
3. I forget

After the dance, they had an open club where you could practice what you just learned. 

The lights got me really dizzy however and I felt like I had to vomit.  But if you avoid looking down, you'll be fine.  :P

INSTRUCTORS
I thought the instructors were really good. They corrected you and challenged us to do more difficult moves. However I would not let my partner catch me by my head.

VENUE
The salsa is upstairs above the restaurant. When I got there, it looked pretty gross and dirty. But once the class started, I didn't notice. I guess that's what all clubs look like when the lights are on."}
