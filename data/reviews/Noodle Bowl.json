{"text":"my boyfriend is vietnamese and said their beef ball noodle soup is one of the worst he has ever tasted. way too salty but lacking flavour and weird texture."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I've been there 3 times and each time, the servers are always rude and inattentive. The food, REPULSIVE. I don't know why I keep going back because I always leave hungry, since I can't even finish my food."}
{"text":"not worth any stars in my book. The food was bland service was just not there. I had to stand up and wave my waitress down just for a fork and they didnt check on us while we were eating. My advice stay far far far away from this place. Just bad service and awful food. Im shocked there still in business"}
{"text":"Forget other negative reviews. As another 4-star reviewer wrote, if you're not on a date and not looking for a 5-star place, then this place is great for the following reasons:  -reasonable taste -quite reasonable menu -quite reasonable prices -very reasonable portion sizes  Slightly better than takeout and with a lot of choice, portion size and location, it's great place to go to if you're hungry and cheap. Sure, it's not the cleanest for a sit down place, but the benefits make up for its drawbacks. I've come here many times and intend to return many more."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place only has two stars, but I've never had anything else here than the noodle soup so maybe that is a reflection of the other food? It is sort of cafeteria style in the sense that you order up front and pay first. I do like the pho here though, and although I'm not a big chicken eater, the steamed chicken they include is flavorful and tastes great.  10$ will get you a huge, spicy noodle soup and include the tax and tip. It's a good place."}
{"text":"I walked in and ordered rice paper rolls- first the service was not great, lady at the cash was rude. Then my rice paper rolls were stuffed with lettuce and a few noodles and that was it. The rice paper seemed old too."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE AND GO ANYWHERE ELSE!  I live in the area and have always been flabbergasted at how packed it is. I leave it up to downtowner non Chinese people who have absolutely no frame of reference to know what half decent Chinese food is.   Nothing tastes like it should. You are gypped on all fronts. The meat is grey, the vegetables wilted, and an overabundance of rice to fool you into thinking you got your money's worth.   You are better off eating a sandwich at Tim Horton's. Hell, you are better off getting a cold cooked item from the 24hr Metro.  I have no idea how this place stays in business and I lament its amazing location every time. Something else needs to come here and stat."}
{"text":"Disgustingly filthy. Greasy grime and dead bugs everywhere, i.e. floors, windows, tables, kitchen. Has not been cleaned in years. I don't think anyone has ever even mopped the floor. Despite this food can be ok but very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Just found that they retired from business last week. The restaurant has been there for many years. First Honest Eds, then Noodle Bowl..."}
{"text":"Agree with others on the portion of the food. I have only tried their veggie rice noodles in soup, it was big. I didn't try other stuffs there as the they look greasy in the pictures. Overall it was okay, food came fast, I don't think they spent much time to make the food look better (presentation).  They gave me cold water at first and switched to hot when I asked for it.  No complain but I wouldn't go there regularly."}
{"text":"I think the comic sans font that titled their \"Noodle Bowl\" should have been the first sign that says \"Turn and run as fast as you can.\" My room mate told me that the food was over priced for its quality but I love noodles so I thought I'd give it a shot anyway.  I walked in and the place smelt like burnt chicken and was very smoky. My clothes definitely got the full blow of it. I planned on sitting and eating there but the environment didn't seem that nice. So I got the spicy calamari and Stir Fried Beef and Noodles to go.  While I waited I had to hold back  the puke that came up as soon as my hands touched the table. It was very sticky. When I went to the front to pay for it I couldn't help but notice the disgusting state that the kitchen was in. The floor was dirty and there was something that looked very much like squashed fly on the wall.   I got home after and ate my food. The calamari was FINE. It was a bit doughy but eatable. The main dish on the other hand...it had no flavor. I had never put so much salt and sauces in my food. Also it made me feel very bloated even though I had not eaten that much. I threw it away and I felt sick the morning after.  Bottom line: Do not go to the noodle bowl."}
{"text":"First of all I just want to warn anyone who even THINKS about eating here: a bad idea... The place was like an oven, hotter than outside. The waitresses didn't even seem to care if you were a customer or not. The food was putrid to the point where I took it back and told them that I refused to consume such filth. Avoid."}
{"text":"The portion sizes were pretty good, presentation of food was good too. However the flavour was lacking so much. The restaurant is so dark... they have lights but none of them are on all the lighting is coming from the big window outside. The floor and table legs are covered in really gross stuff. Along with the windowsill. There's food and sauce stuck there. Lost my appetite right away. They were also taking care of their baby while making food. It's a family business so it's understandable but it doesn't seem safe for them to be in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Came here randomly because I was in the area and hadn't had anything to eat all day. I can honestly say this has probably been the worst restaurant I've eaten at in Toronto. I ordered Thai chicken red curry - the portion was good but the food lacked any kind of flavor. I may as well have gone and got a timmies plain bagel. Food was so extremely disappointing, NOT worth $9.99 let alone $5 or $3. No one should ever be served food that poorly made.   The service was also terrible. Both waitresses were both completely uneducated about the food on the menu. When asked if the curry comes with rice she went and asked if my boyfriend's vermicelli dish comes with rice instead (???). Asked for a can of coke and she asks if we want diet or regular, we said regular. She came back with diet.   Walked out extremely dissatisfied. Didn't leave a tip either."}
{"text":"I was walking by the noodle bowl, I couldn't remember if the reviews were good here or not but it was pretty full so I went in. My pad thai had zero flavor. I had a few spoons of it and gave it a rest. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Recently moved near the area and was always amazed how packed it is.  Ordered Cantonese Chow Mei for take out last time and it's really not impressive.  Portion is ok but flavour is lacklustre.  Can definitely get much better value heading Chinatown.  The place also doesn't look clean all.  Definitely won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, generous portions.  I've had better pad thai at Thai restaurants but I think that's what you get when you go to a place that does not specialize in one cuisine.  The menu as mentioned has Chinese, Vietnamese, Sczechuan and Thai noodle/rice dishes."}
{"text":"So I came in for a quick dinner after a Long drive. First  thing I did was use the washroom, which was so disgusting. Completely filthy, floor to bottom and the not one but two soap dispensers were totally empty and no paper towel. Clearly the washroom hadn't been tended to in quite some time. At this point I'm thinking to myself, \"if this is what the bathroom looks like, they clearly don't give a shit about cleanliness, I can only imagine what the kitchen is like anyway, against better judgement, I decided to stay. I didn't have a lot of time and was hungry. I figured I would give it a shot.  Next thing I notice when I sit down is how dirty the surroundings is looks like no one cleaned the windowsills in months and tables are place right next to them.    Customer service....pretty poor. Server doesnt give any greetings or any verbal communication besides just taking my order. Nice. A smile and a friendly welcome would have gone a long way at this point. But clearly the staff don't really give a shit either.  Ordered a Tom yum vegetable noodle soup $10 which came out quickly but unfortunately tasted off and I couldn't eat it. I've had many Tom yum soups but it tasted awful. Very little spice, WAY too sour. Looking at other reviewers now, I see I am not the first to say the food tastes bad. So quite disappointing in all regards. The portions size was good but ended up being a total waste since I couldnt eat it anyways.    Left hungry ( of course no one greets you when leaving) and irritated.  Definitely wouldn't go back. This place just looks like a place that's given up.  I would NOT recommend. Take a few minutes and head down to china town instead."}
{"text":"The Noodle Bowl is a very decent restaurant. The prices are reasonable, ranging from approximately $9-15, in light of the generous portions. The restaurant presents a wide selection of Asian foods, including Vietnamese pho, Thai green curry and many well-liked Chinese fried rice dishes. If you like Asian food this is a great place to go with a group of friends due to the hefty portions and broad assortment of dishes. Eating \"family style\" is very popular here."}
{"text":"Terrible service today.   I have eaten here from time to time for a few years.. Not for the taste..just because it was my memorial place. But from today I will never come back to this place anymore.  Of course I didn't have any expectation good service on this place because they are usually poor at service.  I ordered seafood with rice there was no spoon so I asked her spoon, she gave it to me so rudely.  After meal, I asked her bring my check  but she rudely said \"Pay at front!\"  There was only 1 customer except me..even not busy at all. :(  Food was mediocre. I ordered stir fried seafood main dish but there was so little seafood in there."}
{"text":"Beware of the cockroach running across your table.   Ate there for the first time in over a year with my girlfriend recently. We hadn't been in a while because it starting feeling dirty, and the day we went they had a 'conditional pass' in the window for food stored improperly (I think).  We decided to go in anyways. Ordered, got our meals, then a cockroach appeared on our table and ran across it.   The waitress came over, took a napkin, killed it on our table, removed it, and walked away. She said nothing in the process.   I then noticed another cockroach on the window a few minutes later.   Somehow we ate more of our meal, then informed the woman working at the cash that there is a cockroach infestation and we wouldn't be back. She smiled sweetly and stupidly at us, and rang us out at the full cost of our meal.   Won't be back.   Ever."}
{"text":"I am with the other 4 star reviewers.  It is definitely not a fancy place by any long shot of the imagination, but it is perfect when you are looking for cheap, decent taste, accessible location and good portions.   My partner and I have been going there mostly for take out for about 6 - 7 years at least once a month.  Our orders don't change much:  both the regular and the curry Pad Thai are -perhaps surprisingly- pretty yummy, the fried rice with vegetables is a personal favourite (although I usually order extra veggies), and my partner loves the mushroom chicken.  Location is great, service is usually good, (the ladies who work there are usually sweet with a few exceptions here and there)."}
{"text":"I don't know why people hate this place. Not the most authentic place but it's pretty decent.  - good portions - the taste was pretty good (tender meat, decent flavour). It's like takeout food but more authentic. To compare, this place tastes better than Thai express...I assume you guys are familiar with the joint.  - convenient location ( 5 mins from spadina station). Especially if you're a uoft student, this place is close to the northern part of the campus   I think the other reviewers hate this place cause it looks dirty and it has a terrible atmosphere- definitely not romantic or nice to look at. This place is great if you want food and you're not on a date but just chilling with a friend. By the way, the washroom is a little icky- it's dingy and old looking.  I rated this higher than other people because I don't care if the place looks dirty. I have a terrible stomach and this place didn't give me any stomach cramps or problems. I've had problems at cleaner restaurants so you shouldn't judge a place based on how it looks. I guess the rating was heavily based on the taste and portion- relative to the many places I've eaten at..."}
{"text":"Went there today with my lady and found it to be a pleasant surprise. Now, beware the fact that we both were famished when we went in so the fact that the food arrived instantly and that the portions were generously large was incredibly gratifying.   My girlfriend ordered the chicken chowmein and I ordered the beef stir fry with rice noodles (and I asked them to make it extra spicy). They definitely spiced it up, with a healthy sprinkling of chopped red chillies which certainly turned on the heat. The food was incredible and much to both our liking. It really hit the spot and it was wholesome and hearty. The rice noodles were particularly filling, and I realized if anyone has gluten-free needs then these would be a most excellent choice! The beef too was tender and well spiced, and the whole texture of the onions, beef and noodles really worked on several different levels.  This place is no fancy restaurant, and there was even a dead bee near the window sill where my gf sat, yet what it lacks in style and elegance, it makes up for in expeditious service, generous portions and good, solid food.   Give it a try, despite the bad reviews it's been getting of late. It just might surprise you - pleasantly might I add!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were feeling like Asian so we thought we'd give Noodle Bowl a try. First impression is cheap, grimy, tattered and simple. We sat at a table by the window and the fresh air was much appreciated as the air seemed hazy or smoky inside.   My friend ordered the General Tao which came a good 7-10 minutes before my Marinated Chicken Vermicelli and Spring Roll came. I hate that awkward time when the other person's food arrives long before yours and you say go ahead and eat but they insist on waiting. Mine was not worth the wait. The chicken was bland and seemed reheated. The vermicelli noodles were overcooked and shaped like spaghetti instead of the the thin ones I like and they were cut short like I was 2 years old. And the fish sauce vinaigrette sauce wasn't at all flavourful or well made.  The spring role was the worse frozen style bland thing I've ever had, even the sraracha sauce couldn't cover it up! My friend said his General Tao was bland and not spicy. He didn't finish it.   Also the service was inconsistent. And everything was sticky - the table, the cups, the soy sauce bottle, the sraricha bottle. Also weird cheap plastic plates were a little meh. Overall with so much else int he area that is so much better I don't think I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Quick food but a little noisy and the servers seemed distracted and would forget simple things like water or cutlery. i had soup it was good but this place smelled kind of funky maybe because they had no AC so it was really hot inside. Its good for soups & chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"This place knows its target market: students on a budget.  The service is quick and friendly.  The menu provides ample choice.  The portions can be quite large.  The price is reasonable.  However, the quality and taste of the food suffers from this 'cheap and cheerful' business model.  There's something missing from the food and I can't pin it down - maybe love?    I would go here again because it's not pretentious and satisfies any immediate soup-noodly/fried rice cravings in the Annex area.  Given more time and desire though, I would pick somewhere else.  Last thing - it gets smokey in there from the open kitchen, and you might leave with the smell of food in your clothes and hair!"}
{"text":"So against my better judgement, I rejected the many bad reviews this place received, and went to take a go at it myself.  As you can probably tell already, I genuinely wished I hadn't. I'm sitting here - well, laying now, feeling sluggish and greasy and sick to my stomach after just one meal here. Here's my take on it.  I read that one cockroach review. Got me freaked out, not gonna lie, but man - noodles were cheap. I'm cheap. Match made. Didn't care if there were bugs in the floor, so long as my food was good and cheap, all was well with the world. But no. You take one sip of your soup, there's a fly in your noodles. You eat your noodles, there's a suspicious looking insect now in your tea. You drink the tea, eat the noodles, and sip the soup - keeping an eye on everything - now there's a spider crawling up your goddamn leg. This place can't be stopped. I swear I was almost impressed.  The pad thai was store-bought noodles slathered in sesame oil and peanut sauce.  I would know because I made the same thing a week ago. College kid troubles.  Wonton soup was nice, until I came upon the 4-5 large lumps of \"dumplings\" that tasted like chewed and spit out liver (I was told later on it was chicken).  Only thing I would really suggest here are the shrimp rolls, in which they give you 4-5 thin little coconut-shrimp-like rolls of heaven.  That got one star, along with the fast service, so this place is a genuine \"probably never again.\" But hey! You might find a new kind of bug you haven't seen before."}
{"text":"Well I wish I had read the reviews first. Now I am on the toilet and it doesn't look good. Never ever go here unless you want to end up violently sick. Will be making a complaint with the health board. 1 star because I had to. If anyone was here on January 18, 2015 and also became sick. Please get in touch with me."}
{"text":"Noodle Bowl offers a good selection of meals from a variety of Asian cuisine (Chinese, Vietnamese, Singaporean etc) and the main advantage here for me is it's decent food, prepared quickly and good if you're on a budget.  The food quality is good, but the taste is somewhat lacking in most of the options, but I attribute that to the meals being more healthy than something you would find at a chinese joint in a food court.  I also find the waitressing staff more friendly than average for a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"Went out with friends for a late night dinner, only to have the worst experience possible! We ordered Pho and my friend when to ask for extra bean sprouts, only to have them serve it to her on a plate that had a baby cockroach in it. WTF...."}
{"text":"I can't say I was thrilled about the food. I ordered the chicken pad thai and it tasted flavorless. I kept having to add more and more sriracha & hoisin sauce each bite. The only great thing about this place was the quick and friendly service. Unfortunately I don't think I will be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Checking on past reviews it seems others have complained about cockroaches as well this past month. I don't know why Toronto Health is so slow to investigate (assuming people actually filed a complaint).  Toronto Health aside, my family and I spotted five cockroaches tonight near we're we were sitting. One climbed up the wall and fell on our table.  We let a server know and she just shrugged it off. There were also small bed bug like insects in a huge mass under and on the side of our table. This place is infested, and clearly nobody has a concern about cleaning it up. Sure tons of places in the city have pest problems, but for them to be crawling around the dining room where people eat is ultimately disgusting."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good and it just did not come through.  It is inexpensive, but that is not enough of a reason to go. I would love to have a better noodle place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very typical Chinese restaurant you'll find in New York City, but this one is located in Toronto's Annex neighborhood. Close to the Spadina subway station on the TTC's Bloor-Danforth line, the food at this location is good for the price. Although its a fast food style operation, the food surpasses the quality found at Chinese fast food chains such as Panda Express commonly found at food courts at major malls.  With an array of different Asian cuisines (Chinese, Malaysian, Thai) the place is good for a quick bite that won't hurt your pocket."}
{"text":"Absolutely 2 stars  Portions were large, but flavor was lacking  Other reviews are correct. If you want good Asian go elsewhere and head to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Trust the multiple Yelp reviews that tell you the food is really bad because it is. I took a chance because a friend wanted to eat here but I'm still feeling the effects of a bad lunch. Greasy, oily, tough chicken. Really not good. But the staff is very sweet."}
{"text":"Food came really quickly, and prices are fair.  The food was just mediocre. Flavours were very one-dimensional. The portions are quite large, one order would be more than enough for lunch.  This is a nice spot if you're in a rush for lunch and need a quick fix."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and fast. We were seated promptly and the lovely lady provided us waters and menus.   Food arrived quickly and... that's about all the great things I can say.  Ah, never again. $15 (incl tax and tip) could be better spent elsewhere for higher quality and way. better. tasting. food. I'd opt for Tim Horton's or even 7-eleven processed food before stepping in here again."}
{"text":"Ooh, not a fan. I came here with the lovely Steph L. when the preferred Kenzo was closed. I definitely agree with Jorge in that it's both cheap and fast. The restaurant definitely relies on the student population in serving huge meals which are not delicious.  We were rushed to pay our bill and my Tom Yum soup was insanely salty.  I won't be back in a hurry."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place as we were wondering down Bloor West.  It's nothing fancy.  The food is good.  Soy Sauce, teriyaki sauce and hot sauce are at the ready if you need a little extra flavour.  The staff is very efficient and the prices are quite reasonable.  We'll definitely hit here again.  :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Noodle Bowl on Sunday after I said \"I feel like stir fry\" and being in a rush and around the corner from the place, reluctantly stepped in. Living in the Annex, I've walked by Noodle Bowl hundreds of times and have always noticed the huge plates of food being consumed by the diners in the window. I would have never, ever gone here if we weren't in a rush and looking for some cheap eats.  Well! As soon as we walked in we noticed the smoke filling the dining area and the general haze- why we didn't leave then I don't know. We ordered our food and waited, the smelly smoke bothering me more and more, even starting to irritate my eyes. My boyfriend's General Tao arrived, which was flavourless and severely lacking in any \"spice\" whatsoever, and mostly consisting of fried bits with very little chicken. The rice was plain and standard. My unnecessarily large \"platter\" of beef stir fry with rice noodles and black bean sauce was heavy and again flavourless, the noodles extremely overcooked and sticking together in large, soft clumps. I ate a few of the vegetables and pieces of beef, but we were quickly done with our meals, leaving about 3/4 left on our  plates.  I understand the whole \"cheap & cheerful\" thing, but this place is far from delightful, even if it's supposed to be mostly catering to students. The fact that the place was unnervingly smoky and dirty (the fans on the ceilings were yellow and grimy), so that should be a turn off itself and to be honest, I really don't understand how this place passes health and safety standards.  We left quickly, the smell of the smoke trailing behind us in our hair and jackets. Never again."}
{"text":"I've given this place plenty of chances due to it being just around the corner from me and laziness in filling my Asian food fix. Noodle Bowl is just not good at making anything!  Things that I've tried: - General Tao: This was SO bland and NOT spicy at all despite having a spicy symbol beside it on the menu. - Chicken \"Pho\": Also bland and it didn't taste like pho at all. I mean who puts broccoli in pho? - Beef Noodles in Black Bean Sauce: Why are there carrots and cabbage in this dish? Where are the green peppers? - Fried Chicken Wings: So fried that the meat could barely come off the wing.  Noodle Bowl, I tried to like you and despite many attempts, it just isn't working!"}
{"text":"Some dishes are a lot better than others. Overall I've never had anything I didn't like. The staff is always super friendly. I've always received my orders super quick. The place is usually packed for a reason. You get what you pay for here, it's not some super fancy restaurant, but it's also not very expensive."}
{"text":"My office has a name for this restaurant: \"Meh noodles.\" It seems that everyone who visits or joins our office tries out Meh noodles because it's close, and in the hope that it'll turn out well; everyone comes away disappointed. There are much better choices for noodles just a little bit west: Walk in, Wok out for example. Avoid."}
{"text":"One word; Ew.   If you dare to eat in, service is slow (when there is service), water glasses are scuzzy, there's almost no ventilation so it can get really smoky and you will ALWAYS leave with the delightful scent of deep fried je ne sais quoi in your hair and on your jacket.   I used to order take out from Noodle Bowl to avoid smelling like the place but the last time I ordered P2 I had a cockroach leg in my soup... Yup. Just the leg. Can't make that shit up. I'm not naive, I know that every restaurant has some sort of bug hanging around but unfortunately part of this one was cooked up in my food, who knows where the rest of it ended up. And that was all I needed, the last straw - I am done with you Noodle Bowl.   I pretty much live beside this place and although conveniently located, I avoid it at all costs - and you should too."}
{"text":"A year later I finally got around to ordering the crunchy chow mein - went with the veggie.   I should have tried this years ago - truly worth a full three stars now - it was excellent."}
{"text":"I was here with my friends 3 years ago. We ordered some pho and pork chops, the food was ok. But there were 2 roaches on the wall. Left the place without finishing the food. I don't know if the cleanliness of the place improved or not, but it was the worst experience."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this is a solid two star place. Yes it's another restaurant that truly caters to its UoT demographic. The food portions are huge (2 meals for $8 is always great!) and the food is prepared quickly - and that's where the two stars come from.  I've been here twice for food to go and the service has always been solidly bland with a side of sour looks. While you do get huge portions of food, it's your essential mix of sesame seed oil (lots of oil) and soy sauce with sugar. Which is perfectly fine if you're looking for drunk food. But if you're looking for a decent lunch at work, you might find that the oily sauce gives your stomach a bit of flip flop fun (as my coworker unfortunately found out).  I suppose the service is to be expected considering that it's cheaper food, but it's curt and dismissive. Expect your basic \"what do you want\" service.   Quite frankly there are better choices down the road."}
{"text":"I used to come here at night looking for some decent noodles just to enjoy when I missed chinese food from uptown. It was so conveniently located that I would come here a few times until the not so good taste finally got to me and I decided that I should just eat other types of food even if i was craving popular chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Food is awful. Customer service is rushed and awful. The smell of bleach in the air as you try to eat your noodles is worse than awful - who mops the floor with hot water and bleach while customers eat?? The door was closed so there was no way to air out the place because even after propping the door open the staff banged it shut because it was too cold for customers ... just awful overall. Never ever coming back !!"}
{"text":"Two words. Cheap and fast.   This is a kind of restaurant that wants to finish your food in twenty minutes. The food is prepared so fast that sometimes I wonder if they know what I'm thinking - sort of know what I'm about to order and start preparing as I walk in. Creepy thought.   Bring a date here and you'll have something in common - smell of smoked jacket. Yum. But hey, you'll only spend $ 20 including tips for a one course meal.   Just steps away from my place, I go to this place for two reasons; when I want to eat fast or when I feel depressed. Oh... that lemon chicken always perks me up. I am not counting calories.   You can be creative and alter ingredients of your Pho.   Food is adequate - not that great. But this is a good cheap thrill food. If that makes sense.   Chow."}
{"text":"This is like a fast food fusion place with a good selection of \"Asian\" cuisine. You've got your Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Singaporean, yadda yadda.   I got some chicken vermicelli thing. It was alright. I wasn't expecting to get my mind blown here or anything, so it wasn't a surprise. There is plenty of other places in the area with better food, but in a pinch Noodle Bowl will do.  Hot tip: In the men's washroom they have some really good advice just above the toilet! Worth visiting the place just for that (not really)."}
{"text":"Got lost looking for another restaurant, and ended up eating at the Noodle Bowl. I don't really know why we decided to go in, but it was probably because the place was packed on a Saturday night, and usually when a restaurant is packed it means it is good, right? I usually refuse to eat at empty restaurants for this reason. Well, I was dead wrong about the Noodle Bowl. It was packed, and yet, it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Toronto.  So thank you, Noodle Bowl, you've made me rethink this assumption, and I stand corrected.  I've learned my lesson.  So we went in, and quickly noticed the \"help wanted\" sign on the door.   We could tell everyone in that restaurant looked stressed out and overworked, which is usually not a good sign.  The menu has a lot to choose from: Chinese, Szechuan, Cantonese, Thai, Viet, etc. With so many options, you have to wonder what makes each dish special. After looking at the almost 10-page menu, I knew I couldn't expect a complexity of flavours from the Noodle Bowl. No chef could pull off such a feat.   We ordered dumplings as our appetizer, and as our entrees we ordered the General Tao Chicken and the Chinese chicken stir-fry. For drinks, we had a Labatt Blue and a coke. We got our drinks right away. Sadly, my soda was really warm, and our waitress disappeared without saying a word. She never came back, so I was stuck with a warm soda for the rest of the night.   The dumplings arrived 5 minutes later. They were good, not great. They were a little bit too oily and bland. About 10 minutes later, my fiance's General Tao chicken arrived. At first he tried to wait until I got my food to start eating, but I told him to go ahead because I had a feeling I was going to be waiting for my food for while. I was right. By the time I got my food, my fiance was halfway done. And when I thought the night couldn't get any worse, I tasted my food.  It was probably one of the blandest things I've tasted in my entire life. No flavor whatsoever. The sauce had a pretty disgusting after taste, and the noodles were way overcooked. My fiance, on the hand, seemed to be enjoying his food. I guess I must have ordered the worst thing on the menu.  So I asked for a bite of the General Tao chicken, and even though it was a little bit spicy, it was also pretty bland and dry. It was better than my stir-fry, but not by much.  No wonder they have such a huge menu! I'm a pretty terrible cook, but I'm sure I could come up with a better tasting meal given the same ingredients.  I hate being so overly critical, but the only reason The Noodle Bowl does so well is because the food is ridiculously cheap and it has huge portions. If you have money to spare,  I would avoid this place like the plague. You can find tastier food, better service, and lower prices a few blocks down the street. Hell, give me the money and I'll cook a better meal."}
{"text":"this is a greasy spoon in the truest sense of the word. the portions are huge (kind of enough for two persons) and very greasy and filling, it's hard to finish most of the dishes I've tried. highlights were chicken pho and sweet and sour chicken. prices have gone up like 33% from 2010 to 2016 and there are significantly fewer patrons than there used to be. I went to eat there few days ago around 6pm and a single person was sitting inside, a few more came later on so practically empty. the waiting staff are revolving door so the service is hit and miss, I can't rate that. some are very attentive, some not at all. anyhow, it's easier to be attentive when there are few people inside than back few yrs ago when it used to be full. I must say that I can't recall we ever waited long on our food. last yrs we came here like once max twice yearly although its on our way every weekend. before that, we used to come every 2-3 months."}
{"text":"stay away far away!!  went on an early weeknight- only one waitress running around with her untied long hair flying all over the place i ordered the \"Vietnamese\" pho with chicken  i got a \"Chinese\" style bland soup  no fish sauce, no fresh lime or chili or basil which is traditional of Vietnamese pho  they refused to give my money back  left very angry,over the horrible soup  and it cost me $10.00"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I always walked past but never went into for a reason. I think the Comic Sans type pretty much says it all, but my friend picked the place so...  While the menu was impressive, I apparently ordered the blandest food item on the entire menu: pho vegetable. I've never had pho before and I was excited to give it a go but it was tasteless. Really. It tasted like nothing. Then I chose to douse it in hot sauce because they wouldn't prepare it spicy for me, and I wound up with what looked like a bowl of blood-soaked noodles that still managed to taste like nothing, but spicy. If I could give this negative stars, I would.  My friend and I both got the tom kha? vegetable soup (the last soup on the menu) and it was unbelievably amazing. This alone gets a star. If I ever go back to this place (which I won't), I would just order three of these soups. It actually blows my mind that their soup was incredible.  Like everyone else said, this place is total food court material. My friend and I were slightly charmed by how food court-esque it was (I tried going down the \"hole in the wall\" route) but in reality, I am not sure how this place stays in business. It's the Annex. There is pretty much only Asian food in the Annex, the competition is ridiculous.  The wait staff was friendly and they deserve to be acknowledged. My favourite thing about them was I saw that there were two reserved tables right next to mine and I thought \"Who the hell reserves a table at Noodle Bowl?\" but at one point, several waiters descended on it and ate in pure silence. It was almost a cultural experience."}
