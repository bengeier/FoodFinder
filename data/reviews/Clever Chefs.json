{"text":"A food truck/catering business- they were present at the Bite of Las Vegas festival, and one of the most popular booths! Putting out a variety of house-made fries, available plain, with cheese, cheese and jalapenos, loaded baked potato, or Asian chicken (with a sriracha cream drizzle and cilantro). They smartly had all of their featured styles on display, and despite having one of the longest lines, it moved pretty quickly. 

Chips were fresh, portion as huge for the low $5 price tag, and they were generous with the toppings. Their old-school ticketed ordering system helped keep things running smoothly and ensured everyone got what they ordered, as they turned their ticket stub in to pick up their food. Their website indicates that they do general catering, and I'd be interested to hit up the truck if I see it again to see what other food they put out."}
{"text":"YES! I was at Life is Beautiful this past weekend, and I was so disappointed at the mediocre food options that cost an arm and a leg. Which this stuff wasn't cheap, it was worth every penny. So much that I wrote down the name of the cart, and wanted to write a review about it. I got the loaded baked potato option, and it was exactly what I needed. I loved this cart and would totally want this at a sporting event or something. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I just tried Clever Chef at The Great American Foodie Fest over the weekend. The various loaded chips were calling to me each time I walked by. I had the Loaded Baked Potato Chips. The chips were delicious and obviously freshly made. The idea was great and the taste was A-OK. The portion was huge and the combination was rich so it would definitely be best shared among two or three people. 

The service was very friendly and my order came up quickly, especially compared to the wait time at the other stands. The chips were $10 which seemed a bit steep for chips, even at a food festival. Maybe a smaller portion for $5 would be a good festival option."}
{"text":"The food was soooo good.  The shredded pork was moist and flavorful.  The loaded chips were the perfect comfort food.  The people were really nice.  Great experience."}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful company I have ever had contact with. I would recommend it to anyone. The best food and the coolest chefs ever. You have to try their food. MUST HAVE. I hired them for catering and didn't have to worry about one detail anyhow price was amazing!!! Love them!!!!"}
{"text":"Love finding them at various events in Vegas. The loaded chips are simply sinful. Best option for a cheat day. Go big or go home. Loved the Asian influenced sandwiches when they have them. Simply the best."}
