{"text":"I had drinks with a few friends here on a Saturday night. I cannot comment on the food as I didn't order, however, my friends seemed to be pleased with their choices. The restaurant is quite pricey (over my price range). The atmosphere is nice, a bit loud for myself, but not complaining.   Is it customary for pricey restaurants to have rude, pretentious staff? We were sitting at the bar and some of the bartenders were intolerable. It took an incredible amount of time to get an order in and once we did we were treated as if it was a waste of his time. Oh, and clearly it was since he never brought us our drinks. We had to ask another bartender for them. The staff is quite young and clearly interested in only serving young attractive women. I am not picking on the men as it wasn't only the male bartenders the female bartenders were extremely aloof and ignored us as well.   I guess next time I need to give them my fancy credit card or wear my push up bra to get decent service.  Not worth my time or money."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Brunch on weekends is great. Dinner menu is always excellent. I like the bar too. Great option in Madison"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Clearly, put a lot of thought to make unique selections all across the menu  Been there twice, sat at the bar both times, and had great service  Food-wise, everything I've had has been amazing.  Deviled eggs are super unique Ham sandwich-ham had great smokiness to it Pork belly app has tuna and foie grais. Tuna gets a little lost, but overall flavors are fantastic Haven't had a big enough group to try the pork entree, but hope to get to it  All the cocktails I've had have been unique and great beer list"}
{"text":"Went for Brunch.  Started off with the bacon bloody and the ham cinnamon roll--both really good.  Chorizo omelette was also very tasty but not very large in size.  Hash brown side was good.  Overall I think a 5 star place exclusively on \"taste\" but bang for your buck a 3-4 star--hence my 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Very popular place, but I am just not a fan. I have been several times, and there was something wrong with my order every single time. The staff has been wonderful every time, I just don't think the food stands up to the reputation."}
{"text":"It just gets better and better!  The more I eat at this restaurant, the more that I am impressed.  I regularly come here whether it's just for drinks or for their delicious food as well, and each time the menu surprises me! The last time I ate here with my boyfriend, we ordered the roasted beet salad, the tempura, and the crisp pork belly & black fin tuna.  The beet salad was the best that I have ever had.  It had macadamia nut butter and dark chocolate shavings. I should have ordered it for dessert! It was so rich and delicious. Definitely a must-try.   The tempura is a Wisconsinite's dream come true.  Bacon wrapped fried cheese curds? Yes please! These come with a variety of dipping sauces and are super tasty.   But my favorite part of this meal was the pork belly & black fin tuna, which features pickled mango and pineapple compote.  I don't know why I have this current obsession with savory and sweet pairings, but it's one I can live with. :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled into the Heritage late on a Friday night.  We did not have a reservation, but no need as we were able to sit immediately. The hostess and wait staff were efficient, knowledgeable, and pleasant.  We were very impressed with the level of detail given about all the menu items.    The restaurant feels very comfortable.  Retro finishes with warm wood-tones, soft-lighting, and comfortable seating.  Also, there was a nice musical selection playing in the background.    The food was INCREDIBLE! We took the advice of the server and ordered the Pork Spaetzle.  The sausage was cooked to perfection, excellent taste.  The cabbage was tangy and sweet at the same time with some local berries (cannot remember the name) the tasted like a tart blueberry. The spaetzle was buttery and drizzled with a sweet balsamic.  The pork was breaded lightly and browned.  Tender and delicious.    An even greater victory was the dessert.  I admit that I don't know the name, nor did I notice it on the menu (at this point, I had just finished my manhattan!).  I spied it on the table next to us and thought it was a cream puff.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a pastry but instead of cream filling, it was ice cream! There was also a nice caramelized drizzle of some kind that was delightful.  SO GOOD!!!!  Before I forget, I am pretty sure if given the option, I would have licked the whipped butter out of the dish.  I am not sure what is in it, but WOW."}
{"text":"Damn son! That Clint dude, meet the mad man behind the madness these featured drinks will truly blow your pants off. The punch will make you the happiest on earth"}
{"text":"I had the Roasted Beet Salad, Pumpernickel Crusted Wisconsin Trout, and Caramel-Pecan Profiterole. My husband had the Lamb Tartare with Green Mustard Whipped Cream, Grilled Beef Sirloin & Tamarind Glazed Ox-Tail, and Dark Chocolate Beet Cake. The salad was a great ratio of greens, cheese, and sauce. The trout had one of the best smells I have every experienced in a meal. The dessert was a bit tricky to eat, but it did not take away from the sweet taste. My husband loved his rich 3 course meal. The tables were a bit close together, but the ambiance was still lovely."}
{"text":"First trip to Heritage Tavern since it opened. Very good experience with traditional decor and warm atmosphere. Great service. Food was very good to excellent. I had the braised lamb belly. It was perfectly cooked but had a very strong if not too strong of a lamb flavor. Friends had the braised short ribs which were excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Freakin' awesome cuisine!    This is one gifted chef -- hi artistry is unbelievable given he is still a young man.  Drinks were outstanding.  The restaurant has an upscale look.  The bar looks very nice too but we were seated immediately so we didn't spend any time there.  The table spacing gives a more intimate feel to it.  Newton's folly drink was very complex and tasty.  Warm beet salad was sublime.  My husband had the tomahawk pork chop -- awesome!  I had the bouillabaisse which was THE BEST!  I've been to France a half a dozen times and this is the best I've had.  The stock was incredible.  I'd order it again (and plan to!).  Our waiter was Josh and he is a trained chef that was very knowledgeable about how the food was prepared.   This is one of the best restaurants in Madison -- hands down."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but great food.  Tempra Bacon-Wrapped Cheese Curds are great.   Excellent and novel cocktails.  We really liked the Bouillabaisse, the Schnitzel was good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drinks. Modern and delicious. We went for restaurant week and had a great time."}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS and the service was fantastic. I was planning a business dinner for colleagues visiting Madison and am very glad I chose to bring them to Heritage Tavern--they gave it rave reviews as well! We shared a few small plates and one of the entrees, and every single dish was just lovely. My personal favorite was probably the risotto! Once we mentioned a nut allergy at the table they were also great about keeping us informed of nut-free options. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a 1/2 dozen times and have not had a bad morsel of food yet!    It's pricey BUT worth it.  There are a # of other restaurants at this price point in Madison, that don't deliver the food or experience that Heritage does, a must for anyone looking for a good meal in Madison, great if you have company in town, this place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great service,  beautiful ambiance, and most importantly, delicious, well executed cooking.  Chef Dan is very talented; it's abundantly clear that Heritage Tavern is the real deal."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely great time at Heritage. The food was highly and carefully crafted. Salmon was terrific. Wine list was short but both fabulous and affordable. The atmosphere is very cool and a combination of local bar and comfort restaurant. Sarah at the bar was terrific - efficient, professional and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Excellent 5 stars for flavor, creativity and presentation. Great ambiance as well. Been here three times and had a wonderful experience each time"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu! Can't decide? Ask the waitstaff for guidance. Our waiter Timothy was phenomenal. When my friend couldn't decide between two drinks he helped her choose by analyzing her likes and matching it with \"one of the best drinks\" she has ever had. Although it may seem a little on the pricey side, Heritage Tavern is well worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Was happily surprised dining hear for brunch as a gluten free non meat eater, but the staff were really accommodating and very nice!   I knew BF would love the meat selection, and he stated these were the best steak and eggs he has had in MSN!! The eggs were almost soft boiled and fried?! Crispy exterior which he raved about.   I had a bloody to drink which was crafted well and was unique compared to most I have had in MSN.  The market vegetable omelet with zucchini carrot and cauliflower did not disappoint. Not your typical omelet vegetables but it was AmAZING! All the vegetables were seasoned to perfection and the goat cheese added a nice creamy contrast! Also, let me add that the portions were great. Will definitely be brunching again!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation with my fiance. When we got there 5 minutes early they said they overbooked and could wait an hour or eat at the bar. No apology"}
{"text":"Heritage Tavern makes it difficult to eat anywhere else in town. Constantly wowing my taste buds while being mindful of my eating restrictions.  stop for a MALÖRT and deviled eggs...your happy hour will never be the same!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the first month it has been open, and I cant wait to go back.  The menu is creative and hits all cylinders.   The portions are generous, the cocktails creative.   The bar buzzes, and the dining room is warm and inviting.   Don't miss dessert,.  I wont review individual dishes because the menu changes all the time.   Just know that this is a restaurant which means business, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything is great here. I've even been satisfied just getting a salad, because of the quality of ingredients and the perfect preparation. The vibe is casual, retro, and elegant. One of the more characterful restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING. We had the vegetable cake for dinner and it was simply heaven in our mouths. Every component was delicious. For dessert, we decided on the special of the evening which was a peach torte. I don't even like peaches but I loved every wonderful bite of the tasty treat. We will be back!! Thank you Chef Fox!"}
{"text":"OVERRATED!  After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!  Has the host ever worked in this business before?  Walked in & waited a good couple of minutes while he chatted with co-worker about the previous night.  We had reservations & multiple tables available but seated us next to another table....requested a different location & it was like they couldn't believe it. I like the space but tables are tightly grouped & the whole dining area feels cramped. Moving on......waitress was sullen at best!  18 minutes from drink order to execution for 4 drinks......yes, I timed it after no action after 5 minutes!  Ultimately, Waitress  messed up food order & barely acknowledged wrong entree. Food was passable, but for those prices I would expect WOW!  Sorry folks, I think they believed the HYPE and forgot the execution.  I give them 9 months!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I was blown away by this place!  We had Dinner there on Saturday night.  Although you can eat at the bar, you better have a reservation or be prepared to wait for a table.  We tried a few drinks from the Bar Menu (still trying to figure out the Malort Thing). Once seated, we enjoyed appetizers including the Crisp Pork Belly & Tuna Sashimi (that is one item!), Gilled Octopus & Fried Cocks Combs (again, one item!).  The appetizers were terrific but the most memorable item, which strangely caught everyone's attention, was the candied bacon & slow roasted nuts (again, one item!).     The mix of the bacon and mixed nuts was fantastic.  There is a theme of mixing Heritage Pork with other ingredients which is quite intriguing.  The entrees were delicious   The Duck Breast was outstanding as was the Beef Rib Loin.    The Family style dinners were really interesting (Fried Suckling Leg & Chili Blackfin Tuna Sashimi or Fried Whole Snapper & Ginger Butter Poached Lobster) but since it was our first visit, we wanted to explore the menu.  Overall, their mix of flavors and ingredients was quite unique and on top of great service, drinks and appetizers,   there is still so much on the menu to try that I can't wait for a return visit!"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed many nights at Heritage. We love the vibe of the place. Great bartenders. Sophisticated decor. Interesting menu. But our recent trip for dinner is likely the last. The waiter, Brian, was dismissive and distracted the entire meal. If it weren't for the assistant server pitching in, the entire meal would have been a disaster. Not sure if I represent the masses, but if we drop close to $300 between dinner and drinks, I expect at least a half hearted effort - this isn't Qdoba after all. Go for the small plates at the bar and skip the sit down dinner, there are better places to spend your money in Madison."}
{"text":"Heritage is a beautiful, smart space with a warm, welcoming staff celebrating creative, delicious food and drink.  Madison is growing up fast thanks to establishments like this.  Great work.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new restaurant. My boyfriend and I made a reservation a week in advance. We were seated at a tiny table, so close to a couple we could have shared our food. I asked for a more private table because we were going to be discussing important things that I didn't feel like sharing with the 21 year old, twirling her hair that was practically in my lap. Of course, they couldn't move us. The first drink I ordered we sent back because it tasted like old lady perfume smells. I knew the owner had a pig farm and had a heavy pig menu ahead of time. I ordered a vegetarian dish since I do not eat meat. My tomatoes dish was good, but ridiculously priced. The foie gras on the menu really annoyed me. I typically never support a restaurant that serves up that cruelty. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foie_gras_controversy. What really upset me was a photo Heritage Tavern posted on Facebook the next day. A suckling pig's head on a platter as an entree. Now I throw my veggie burgers on the grill right next to my friends and families' meat burgers and I go to restaurants that serve meat, but I didn't think it was as creative and avant-garde as the owner. It's barbaric and disrespectful to the animal that lost it's life for the next fatty to have his or her coronary."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu sounds amazing, but of the 7 or 8 dishes my party ordered, only two lived up to our expectations.  The duck confit and sashimi/pork belly/foie gras small plates were wonderful, but some of the others seemed to miss the mark flavor and temperature-wise.  The octopus in the salad was overcooked and tough (but the fennel was really nice), some of the plates were not very hot when they reached us, and the beer cheese soup was lacking depth and seemed overly thick and salty.    Atmosphere is visually pleasing and comfortable.  Beverage service was excellent, and our server was very attentive, patient and accomodating.  From the menu, this is the type of place I would frequent several times a year if I lived nearby, trying everything and enjoying the changing of the seasons.  Nothing blew me away though, and the acoustics made it hard to hear the people at my table, so I'm not going to rush back on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"First off I'm new to the Madison area from Miami Via NYC and I am blown away! It was a pleasure to have this be my first dinner in Madison.  Outstanding use of the local ingredients with such care to the theme of each dish presented. I especially enjoyed and still dream of the deviled eggs, just a simple dish made into something special in each bite. Can't wait for another dinner at Heritage!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing! Super good vibes here; felt like a warm place from the minute I walked in. I met a friend at the bar for a few drinks and was greeted by the Owner himself, Dan Fox (he's super handsome, ladies!). Great, friendly, efficient bar service. The wine/tap list are small but obviously meticulously placed. I tried their Aviation style cocktail and was super impressed.   I did not eat here but saw a bunch of different plates go by and they are gorgeous!  The five stars is only appropriate because the bathrooms are super clean and very swanky. Other places you might not want to hang out in the bathroom but I would've taken my drink in these bathrooms and stayed for awhile. Single stall, however, so there is going to be a wait on busy nights!   Enjoyed my first experience here and will definitely go back to eat a delicious entree soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great drinks and servers aim to please. But if it's winter avoid the windows tables it can get super cold! Oh and vegan options are pretty non-existent for brunch"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Cocktails were creative. Beet salad delicious.  The mussels weren't as moist as we hoped. Apple bread very yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Service was great. You're paying the big bucks but you know why."}
{"text":"Wonderful interesting food! Great waitstaff. Looks like a great place for drinks at the bar.   Our table of 9 had small plates: Deviled Eggs, Bacon wrapped, tempura battered cheese curds (x3), Foraged Mushrooms, Flank Steak with Chimichurri.    Big plates: Angus chili-rubbed steak, Sea Bass, Heirloom Tomato Concasse, Pork Schnitzel with Knochwurst.  Their house French bread was Great!"}
{"text":"When I'm looking for someplace special to go for dinner in Madison, Heritage is always at the top of my list. Every time I've gone the food has been outstanding!! We recently went with two other couples and we had a blast! The cocktails are divine, unique and always bold. I think we ended up ordering almost every single cocktail between the six of us just to try as many as we could and they were all delicious. We started with a medium charcuterie & cheese plate, and not a morsel was left. For the entree my husband swears by the schnitzel and always orders it and I mixed it up by getting the sirloin this last time (I usually get  seafood). Like everything else we order, not a morsel is ever left! The restaurant is upscale and reminds me of a French bistro with a hip and modern Wisconsin farm-to-table vibe. I highly recommend Heritage Tavern for a special night out."}
{"text":"Warm and inviting atmosphere, excellent food, the best service we've had at a Madison restaurant (and we've lived here for 35 years). Prices as expected for the superb quality of the entire experience. On a personal note, it was our anniversary which I noted while making the reservation.  My sister-in-law & brother brought a dozen roses; the folks at Heritage found a vase and allowed us to keep the flowers on the table during dinner. Our menu had a \"Happy Anniversary\" banner, and the staff offered their good wishes when we arrived and left. Highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"The soft shell crabs were excellent.  The entire experience, ambience, service and food make thus restaurant one of the best in Madison."}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails, tasty food, and a promising menu.   A friend and I stopped in the first night Heritage was open to the public. The staff were eager and ready to serve, coming off last week's soft open.  My only complaint is that I'll have to return for a late night visit in order to try the poutine.  That day's Malort Thing incorporated lemonade and orange juice. It was a surprisingly refreshing summer cocktail.   We tried the deviled eggs, which were delicious. The beet eggs were wonderfully briny, the charcuterie savory, but the porchetta egg was amazing. The half egg was lightly breaded and fried before being topped.   The tempura appetizer was incredible.  The breading was light and delicious.  I was especially fond of the string beans that were still squeaky fresh, but the bacon-wrapped cheese curds were a close second.  The nori-wrapped shrimp didn't excite me, but my companion thought them fantastic.  The kitchen is quite open. Sitting at the end of the bar, one can see down the length of the bar and into the kitchen. It's easy to see how busy the staff is, and glimpse the work they put into each dish."}
{"text":"Family holiday dinner for 6 of the Heritage pork and tuna. The food was outstanding, the service nicely paced, the cocktails fabulous and topped with sharing some luscious desserts. It was such a great evening - sharing food and conversation. Really liked the family style concept. A memorable evening. That pig tasted like luv!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. The roasted beet snack was probably one of the best dishes I've had. Ever. It came with roasted figs but it's definitely a must. The heirloom tomato salad was okay, nothing special...tomatoes werent exactly ripe, it was lacking some flavor but it was fine. The snapper was delicious, it came with grits and was a nice portion.  Cocktail issue. My friend and I both ordered the mallort drink of the day, it was watermelon with ginger liquor, lemon and lavender, she wasn't a fan. The waitress insisted she get another and charged for both...Maybe it was a mistake, not sure but it wouldve been awkward to say something...  Overall, definitely recommend this restaurant. Great quality food. Delcious."}
{"text":"If I could give it 10 stars I would!  The food was fabulous.  FABULOUS and so were the drinks and the service.  One of the items we had were escargot and headcheese.  Seriously you should try it.  The flavors and the sauce were AMAZING.  I would go back there in a minute."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the food is like but the hostess was rude and condescending.  We showed up at 5:10 on a Monday evening.  We were treated to a lecture about not having reservations; not once but two times by the same person.  If you can seat someone then do so graciously, I am not there to be lectured that I did not have reservations.  We did not stay, and we will not return.  The menu looks interesting but I guess you need reservations."}
{"text":"I love Heritage!  This place is amazing.  From the food, to the staff to the physical space, it's perfection.  Upscale, but cozy and surprisingly reasonable for what you get.  You can tell they think about every detail, it's not just farm-to-table--it's the experience beyond the food too.  The staff is professional and many of them I recognize from years at other great restaurants.  I even love the dinnerware and their vintage fireking(?) plates.  The food is delicious and  inventive, but not intimidating  portions are generous for a restaurant of this quality.  I remember loving Underground Kitchen here, but I always left hungry and  broke.  Heritage takes reservations which is nice.    I hate waiting for tables in Madison.  I feel like I live in Madison so that I don't have to wait an hour-plus for a table."}
{"text":"Very very good. One little letdown was the Bailey's gone sour at the dessert and when we said it wasn't a problem, they left it on the bill. The other small thing was that there was no really full-bodied red on the menu. But these are just nitpickings, all in all: good menu, and very well executed, we really had a good time, good service, this will be a regular for us!!!!"}
{"text":"On October 26 me and family went to heritage tavern for brunch.. We were expecting a great service and great food.. But we did not recive that. The service was bad. The staff rush us to order the food... The food took for ever and the place was empty, we were the only ones there.. When the food came it was ok.. Though the forgot one of my family members dish... It took them a other 30 minutes to cook it...   PS: Don't go there for brunch not good, Or just don't go to heritage tavern.."}
{"text":"My new favorite date night restaurant. We enjoyed our night out with drinks and an appetizer at the bar, followed by dinner. Loved our cozy corner table. The cocktails and food were all amazing, as was our service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"There are three reasons Heritage Tavern deserves 5 stars:  1.  Service:  The servers and the bartender were extremely attentive and helpful.  The staff was readily available without becoming overbearing, which is a fine balance. 2.  Quality of food:  I've had both brunch and dinner here.  In every instance the quality of ingredients has been incredible.  Extremely fresh with great flavor.  Much of the flavor is due to the skill of the chef/cooks, but the quality of produce and meats cannot be dismissed. 3.  Atmosphere:  Timeless design while maintaining unique characteristics (see: fox cutout on chairs/stools).  The restaurant also feels loved and visited by its patrons without becoming too noisy or compact.  I visited on the recommendation of a friend.  I absolutely love this place and will continue to visit as frequently as my bank account will allow!"}
{"text":"Heritage pays attention to even the smallest details with their food and drink.  That, paired with a knowledgeable front of the house, made for a very pleasant experience.  It was my third time there, twice for dinner and once for brunch.  It remains one of the top places to dine in Madison in my opinion.  The cheeseboard had nice portions and solid accompaniments, the goat cheese and marrow plate had great flavor, and the beet salad was great.  Don't forget dessert!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner again tonight at Heritage Tavern.  Deviled eggs are to die for!!  Thanks Chef Dan Fox for another  perfect meal!"}
{"text":"I dined here for brunch last weekend. Having arrived earlier than the group I was with, I sat at the bar until they arrived. I had been to this location as Café Montmartre many times before in college, over a decade ago already now. It was a place where my friends and I would go out on nights we felt adventurous enough to walk \"all the way\" there from campus and feel like we were at a French wine bar. I remember back then the bar was on the opposite side of where it is now at the Heritage so as I sat waiting I was reimagining the space and atmosphere. Café Montmartre was never spotless and their kitchen back then wasn't either. However, as I began scoping out the Heritage I began to appreciate just how clean they keep the space. Not only was the dining area immaculate, but the somewhat open kitchen was meticulously clean as well.  At the bar I ordered a Café Latte as well as the fresh squeezed orange juice (each cost $4) - the orange juice was served with no ice cubes which means you don't get skimped on the juice, which I appreciated. As I viewed the menu I realized just how pricey this place is. It isn't pricey for what you are receiving, but pricey for someone like myself. It is definitely a special occasion kind of place for the ordinary person.  Having said that, not only is the space clean but it is also amusing. The antlers on the beer taps, for example, are a fun added touch. As are the little pig knick knacks hanging out around the restaurant, some more obvious, others harder to locate, almost like the venue would be perfect for an Easter \"Pig\" hunt. Once we were seated we noticed some little pigs looking down at us from the corners of the ceiling - I enjoyed discovering this because it makes the place seem less pretentious.   I ordered the ham and cheese omelet with the rosti potatoes and mixed green salad. The presentation of all of their food items is outstanding. My omelet was excellent, I could tell that it was made with quality ham and cheese. We ordered a side of bacon which was also good, it could have been served crispier. The croissants are mammoth and delicious. We were there for my cousin's birthday and the dessert tray they brought out for her celebration was amazing. It was served on a wooden board and among other items featured homemade sugared beignets that were still warm. They were delicious.  While I did notice one table with a sleeping baby, overall, this place seems geared toward adults. It is very loud inside, so given the fancy ambiance and noise level I don't think I would bring my small children here- although I am sure they would appreciate pointing out the little pigs."}
{"text":"We had heard good things so my wife and I were excited to try Heritage last night.  Bottom line is that we were very disappointed in both the service and the food.  We showed up a little before 7 without reservations and we were seated right away.  At the time the restaurant was 50% full.  We order two glasses of wine and waited at least 15 minutes before the were eventually delivered. No apology from waitress for taking too long, just a blank stare when we expressed our frustration.  While waiting, we observed that the restaurant is run by college kids with clearly very little service experience.  I have no problem with that at most places in Madison, but not where entrees run $25-$30+.  If you want to charge big-boy prices, hire big-boy servers/managers.  Food was WAY too salty and greasy. The tempura appetizer was inedible and we sent it back after one bite each.  Batter had no taste, the oil clearly wasn't hot enough when fried because it was a hot, oily mess.  To make it worse, they spread some chili mayonnaise on top which was the last thing this already heavy/fatty dish needed.  Manager asked if everything was OK when she cleared the plate and we told her the problems.  I don't have a problem paying for the item since we ordered it, but it clearly wasn't executed well and in my opinion removing it from the bill would have been the classy thing to do.  We also ordered the brussel sprouts, mixed salad, coconut soup, and ham sandwich \"snack\" items.  Brussel sprouts were swimming is some soy based sauce with bacon and they were salty to the point where we couldn't eat more than the top layer not buried in the sauce.  My palate was still burned this morning from the excessive salt.  Any texture that was developed from nicely roasting the sprouts was ruined by placing them in a bowl full of sauce.  Best item was definitely the ham sandwich.  Nice portion for the price and balance of flavors was outstanding.  Salad was solid, but unremarkable.  Soup also had good flavor but portion size was too big IMO.  Instead of charging $14 for a bowl of soup, I would serve a smaller size and lower the price, especially since the soup is rich and you don't need more than a cup.  Total bill for 2 glasses wine, 1 beer, a 5 items off of snack/appetizer menu was $100 with tip.  We recently moved from Chicago and have eaten at similar restaurants in past (Publican, Purple Pig, etc).  Heritage is falling short of those models."}
{"text":"Did not live up to the hype at all. It is a nice place to dine in, but the food and service is not worth what you pay. The person who served us started off friendly, but for some reason became extremely hostile as the evening went on and we have no idea why. We weren't drinking (maybe not ordering drinks offended him?!), or being loud or anything, so we don't understand why he became so hostile towards us. Some of the dishes we ordered were ok, but really not worth the price. Overall, a disappointing experience from a highly rated restaurant. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Loved our Sunday brunch. Steak and frites with salad was amazing, but the fried poached egg threw it over the top."}
{"text":"Really great experience.  Restaurant was packed and we did not have a reservation.  Waited about 5 mins to sit at the bar.  It was an amazing evening.  Recommend it to everyone.  Bar staff were really fun, great recommendations on local bourbons.  Watched the kitchen which was really cool to see.  Had the deviled eggs and tempura cheese curds.  Must have if you go there!  It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Ate here for restaurant week with 2 others. We shared all three appetizers. Lamb tartar was good, needed something... Not as good as I've had other places. Head cheese with escargot was very good. Crunchy, breaded exterior gave good texture to the gooey, fatty interior of the head cheese. Great for sharing. Heavy to eat all alone. Escargot plump and tender. The surprise for me was the beet salad. Never had beets taste so good! There were various types, all unique. One that quite cleverly looked exactly like tomato wedges. There was great acidity and maybe hazelnuts mixed in. Entrees two of us got the pork trio. Lovely flavor on everything. Boudin very authentic, pork belly luscious richness, and the cabbage underneath was drenched in the juices and almost as good as the meat! The other entree we tried was the fish. Well cooked, delicate, with a Thai type broth and vegetables. Broth had coconut but lighter than traditional Thai, very good match with the fish. Another success. Desserts we again tried all three. The Apple pastry was flaky, but my favorite was the dense chocolate cake with hazelnut crumble and espresso ice cream. Each piece of that concoction just fit together perfectly. Great meal. Service was excellent. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with no reservation when wait at another place was over an hour. Our party of four was seated right away. Service was relaxed and professional. The soda of the day was delicious and a real bargain. The cocktail menu was creative. There is an extensive liquor list--I got the feeling this is a cocktail place more than a beer and wine place. I ordered a main, and the other three shared six small plates. My fried fish was outstanding. They clearly label their gluten free and vegetarian options. My fish was fried in a dedicated peanut oil fryer. The other standouts were  the risotto, the roasted beet salad, and the deviled eggs. For dessert the others shared the maple caramel profiteroles--which came as an order of three. They raved about them. I had the flourless chocolate cake, which was served with strawberries. (I find the constant pairing of raspberries with this dish to be so trite as to make me primal scream in my head--so I was really thankful to see berries of the straw variety!!). I really wish I had not flown up, because they had a selection of port I wanted to try. Next time... There was live jazz: a lady singer and uke player paired with a man on string bass. They were lovely. A great experience and a special meal. Pig power all the way!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent as was the wine we ordered (a Rioja).  And we really liked our dessert.  But the main dishes were rather \"flat\".  They lacked taste. Maybe it was an off night for the chef."}
{"text":"It's no wonder Mr Fox has been nominated multiple times as a James Beard award finalist.  Always creative approaches to routine and unique dishes.  Incredible amount of flavor and inventiveness in everything from their cocktails, to their assorted deviled egg tray or bone marrow, to something that could be so simple (but he makes its incredible and complex) the lake trout.  Always a treat, and a destination when we come through Madison!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites in Madison! I have food allergies and they are super helpful in making sure my food is good and that I can enjoy just about anything on the menu. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, I really like the schnitzel though."}
{"text":"Dan and his team continue to present and create memorable experiences and fantastic food."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week and were amazed. The food was fantastic. The presentation was phenomenal. The drinks were lovely.  I'm also a huge fan of the interior décor!! Staff was very friendly and had wonderful recommendations and lots of information to share. We will definitely go again :)"}
{"text":"This is THE best overall restaurant in Madison, on par with many fantastic places in New York, Chicago, Miami, etc. in terms of food, cocktails, and overall ambience (and certainly leaps and bounds above most Madison establishments).  It blows my mind that people rate places like The Old Fashioned with the same amount of stars. The Old Fashioned and its equivalents (Great Dane, Brocach, etc.) are trash compared to this place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times over the past year or so, and it's definitely one of my go-to restaurants in Madison when I'm looking for someplace on the nicer side but not quite the production of a L'Etoile or Harvest.  The atmosphere is refined but still relatively casual, and the cocktails and small plates are absolutely top notch.  I especially love their deviled eggs, which change periodically but are always interesting and tasty.  My one criticism would be that the entrees don't usually seem to live up to the standard set by the small plates, but I've only ordered entrees twice, so my experience there is limited.  The service has never been anything but excellent."}
{"text":"Good place to visit, I like the atmosphere of this tavern. Awesome local beer options. Friendly servers. Open kitchen which is a nice feel."}
{"text":"Best place for dinner in Madison. I've had dinner here at least a dozen times by now if not more. The food never disappoints the service is always great. They offer food late. The drinks are fantastic. There really is no comparable place in Madison. Sometimes I feel like I could have ordered something a bit better looking around at other plates. However the menu changes regularly enough that you are always trying something new. I'll definitely keep coming back. It's way better than places like Sardine , graze, four quarter, and especially harvest (most overrated place in Madison).  Update: knocking it down 1 star for an uninspiring menu lately."}
{"text":"holy Crap I love this place!  The waitresses can be snooty but the food is great. Like Forequarter only better....sort of illustrates what forequarter is trying to do but not quite doing.  Update 2016-I feel a little bad about my Forequarter comment because I think they are much better and more consistent now, but still not quite as good (Or to be fair, as expensive) as Heritage."}
{"text":"Last night we chose to go to Heritage Tavern for dinner before heading to a show at the Overture. We had been there before and had always been pleased with the food and service. Last night was no different. We shared 3 small plates and one large plate. Heritage has deviled eggs that are not your average deviled eggs. We got the serving of 6 (also comes in 12). Delicious! 3 different varieties - unfortunately I don't remember exactly what was in them, except they are so good we order them every time. We also had the beet salad and a lion mushroom dish that was excellent. Our large plate was called Heirloom Tomato Convasse. It was a large tomato with different vegetables stuffed in and around it. We did not leave hungry, but we weren't over stuffed which is the way we like it! The great food was complemented by the great service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is not a place for vegetarians or pescitarians. Maybe it should have been obvious by the pig plate pictures on Yelp, however, typically meat-centric restaurants (especially in Madison) will offer a veggie friendly option. Not here. Even the mushroom risotto and the spinach and leek soup are made with chicken broth. Why??  I am giving 4 stars because the service was great and my husband had the bouillabaisse which he gave extremely high ratings, but other than that, options were very meager."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Well, It's winter and I need something to do... as I am not into \"winter\" sports. I just can't believe in freezing my tush off outdoors for fun. I just ... can't. What the hey, let's do something crazy, like drive the 20 min, into downtown, pay for parking, on Wednesday, for date night! GREAT idea (even thought we're still \"outside\" walking around.)  We landed at Heritage - I've been meaning to come here. Menu looks good.  Ambiance - chic, fun bar, GREAT lighting. Well, I like to see my food, so I loved the lighting. Everything is cream color and clean lines. Look for the little pigs and foxes. I really appreciated this space.   Food - Dietary limited me to small plates, but there were plenty for me to try.  Deviled Eggs - we got the 1/2 order = 6. Very fun. Sure it's $9 for 6 eggs but they put some thought into it, and fresh raw tuna into 2 of 'em! This was our favorite plate. 2 were fried eggs (with a faint sweetness in the breading), 2 were soy soaked with a hint of soy/salt in the yolk, and the last 2 had a \"tuna salad\" where the yolk is (nice mix with scallions and wasabi \"chip\"). Great starter. 5/5  Lamb Crepinette - well, descriptions can be deceiving. We were expecting lamb in a crepe, or some version. What we got was shredded lamb meat encased in a gelatinous wiggly, weird mucous casing that looks like a burger patty (but moved like jello), slopped onto this liquid explosion. We were.... taken aback. I don't really do red meat. But I figured \"it's lamb, this place knows what their doing.\" So I looked away, prodded through the membrane, then tentatively tried the meat. It's good. It's like beef, but not as \"meaty.\" It had a nice flavor, warmed me up. The sparse veggies: spinach and carrots were cooked fine, but not really needed. The white onion sauce under the lamb had a milk base so I had to ignore it, but I did try one smear - it went well with the lamb. (Unfortunately didn't get a pic.) So, the look of this dish is 1/5, but the taste is 4/5. Overall this dish gets a 3/5.  Mushroom Gnocchi - Ummmm. This is GOOD. G-OO-D good. Like Guuud. Maybe I just haven't been eating the right gnocchi (chances are high), but I finally understand why they are \"little pillows.\" \"Those aren't pillows!\" These are so light and squishy. Amazingly though, this dish is actually upstaged by the mushrooms. Maybe they aren't anything funky or new, but they are very rich: in texture and flavor. No puny little button 'shrooms here. These are portobello, shiitake, oyster, and enoki. They have a madeira wine sauce mixed in. Great sauce. (Comes with brie, unknown form, but I had them remove it for my tummy). 5/5  Salmon Char Siu - ok ok ok. I know I always say \"I never get it because it COULD be fishy.\" Well, I didn't listen to my own advice. Damn you Google! Google shows these really great char siu pics =  BBQ glaze. I was drooling. But this dish is mostly raw salmon with a smidge of mango salsa under it (I didn't feel any Habanero). I didn't taste any sweetness (char siu = honey, rice wine, soy, sugar) on the salmon itself. I only tasted the black vein \"fishy.\" There was some interference from the veggies and pork belly. The veggies didn't do anything, and the pork was actually a bad idea for this dish. The Salmon is family line-caught and flown in from Sitka, AK. I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. The Other, however, did. We both woulda liked more sauce on it. OR maybe just the Char Siu flavor? If you like Salmon, you'll probably like this. Split decision = 2/5   Service - Friendly, but too Laissez-faire for me. Made some lactose exceptions, but didn't completely follow through on all of it. Ex: Me - \"I can't have milk, cream, cheese, lactose.\" Her - \"Is it an allergy or you just intolerant?\" Me (thinking) - That's like \"will you DIE? or do you just wanna FEEL like you wanna die for the next 6 hours?\" Me - \"um intolerant.\" Her - \"well, I don't think this one has anything in it.\" Me - \"ok ok, can you check?\" Her - just brings out the food then \"oh, yeah, there's some right there. Just try to avoid that area.\" Ok, I have to start being a bitch again. 2/5   Overall, I like this place. They have put great thought into some bites and overdid some others, but at least they are trying some inventive ideas. I will come back, BUT I will have to be more strict about my lactose, and I will have to ask for full descriptions from a more experienced waitress or manager."}
{"text":"Heritage Tavern gave me one of the best meals I've ever had in my life, and that's no hyperbole.    I went there with several coworkers, and the whole dinner was practically a blur of good food and drink, with all the sharing that took place.  Drinks and appetizers and main dishes were passed around, since everything would surely be delicious in its own way, and it was only right that we all sample the widest possible spectrum of flavors.  While we waited for our initial food, we sucked down expertly formulated drinks.  My favorite was a \"Chartreuse Sour\", a fruity creation enriched with a topping of raw egg white, which I enjoyed as many things flew into my mouth: mushroom gnocchi, bacon-wrapped cheese curds, sweet potato fries, an assortment of deviled eggs.  I was only able to try two of the eggs, one of which was a breaded and fried egg white holding a deviled egg mixture.  I ask you, how often, in your life, would you encounter something like that?  I was selfishly sad that I didn't have the entire plate to myself.  My choice was predetermined: the pork schnitzel with knockwurst.  The menu indicated that it was prepared with some kind of mustard sauce, but for whatever reason, I was given an \"old\" version, which involved spaetzle, pickled beets and cabbage, and some kind of berries (aronia?) - no trace of a mustard sauce to be found.  I certainly wasn't complaining, and the first bite of the schnitzel took me away with its crusty crunchy porky pigginess - it had a hint of the same flavor I remembered from my mother's pork cutlets, but was richer and more complex overall.  I quickly learned that the optimal experience was obtained by combining schnitzel, spaetzle, pickled veggies, and berries all into the same bite; at first, I thought the knockwurst was superfluous, but then realized that it provided an interesting contrast in how it stood up to the other items (stronger, saltier, perhaps a better pairing with the pickled veggies).  The schnitzel, however, remained the main attraction, and I would have been perfectly happy had it been the only meat in the dish.  So engrossed was I in all this that I fell way behind on the swapping of entrees.  I only got around to trying one other, a chicken thigh cooked in a manner that yielded a most delightfully crispy skin.  The visual star of the entire dinner was the braised pork and tuna shared between four people, a veritable mountain of meat that, unfortunately, I failed to sample.  I'm told it was served with head cheese - something that revolts me but which was apparently enjoyed by all who had it.  Only one of us, I believe, indulged in dessert.  We were fooded out: not painfully stuffed Thanksgiving-style, but pleasantly full of superb, well-executed, memorable food.  Well, meat, really.  So much meat.  Were I already familiar with Heritage, I'm sure I'd have opened this review with: \"What do you expect? It's Heritage!\"  They know who they are and what they're doing.  I foresee them becoming a fixture for our future Madison trips."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's 24th and was super impressed. Let's just start by saying I'm a student on a budget, so I was the girl eating all the complementary bread to fill up. Potions were small, but they tell you that flat out. Expect to spend a penny here but know that it won't disappoint.  We started with the tempura bacon-wrapped cheese curds with sweet potato and 3 dipping sauces (of which I can't quite remember). The curds were bomb! The tempura made for a light, airy batter. We LOVED them. Not a huge fan of the fish sauce...it was a little overbearing.   I ordered the small plate special of the night, beef brisket gnocchi. I was anticipating larger gnocchi, and I thought they were a little dwarfed by the hefty sauce. That being said, the heirloom tomato sauce with the tender brisket was on point. I paired this dish with a Pinot Noir.   The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was due to service. Particularly, the problematic hostess. When we arrived, we notified her that the reservation changed from 5 to 4. She called my friend out saying that our reservation changed multiple times today and our that our friends must be \"flakes.\" Later in the evening, I told her it was my friend's birthday. She said Heritage doesn't do complementary desserts but they could \"stick a candle in something for us.\" Off-putting."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food with great drinks. A bit on the pricier side though. Make sure to ask the chef for the family style roasted pig if you have a group of 4+ people."}
{"text":"I went here this past Saturday night. This place is farm to table, which to me translates to extremely fresh food. We sat at the bar while we waited for our reservation and tried a few of their specialty drinks. The bar was very unique with Edison light fixtures above and antlers as the beer tap handles. Once our table was available, we were led into a separate dining area that featured photos of local farms, and low lighting. The ambience was warm and inviting, with furniture reminding me of being in someone's home.   For dinner, we ordered a few small plates to try. First was the lamb tartar, and it was phenomenal. The flavor was light and the presentation was beautiful. We then had the pickled beet salad with provolone and shaved chocolate, by far the best salad I've had around the square and hope it remains on Thier menu as it changes depending on what is in season. The third dish was a brined and braised pork and tuna sashimi that was phenomenal.  Overall if you'd like a dining experience that is in an old world, warm, inviting atmosphere this is your spot."}
{"text":"I like so many things about Heritage that just setting foot inside the door makes me happy.  The decor is great, the servers are friendly and helpful, and the dishes are SO GREAT.  Also, all the chairs have the fox head logo cut out in them which is awesome.  :)  Heritage offers a unique menu of small plates, that feel a little larger and more put together than appetizers, large plates, build your own cheese and charcuterie boards, and family style meal.  We took a previous trip to Heritage with some Yelpers after an event and just snacked on cheese curds (which were AMAZING) and deviled eggs (also AMAZING), but this time we went in for the whole shebang.  We started with a cocktail for me (Sao Paulo Smash, would recommend) and a glass of wine for the hubs and did a build your own cheese and charcuterie board.  This is where my biggest irk with Heritage started...   We were clearly two people at the table, ordering the board to share.  And i am a firm believer that in a nice restaurant, you should cater dishes to the customer as much as possible.  This means that when you construct a cheese board (a very fluid dish) for a table of two, everything on the board should come in a multiple of two.  I know that presentation dictates that everything be an odd number for aesthetic purposes, but no one is thinking about aesthetics when they are trying to decide who gets the third bacon wrapped date.  And to be perfectly honest, I don't WANT to be nice and give it to the hubs, even though I totally did.  (wife points!)  So don't make me do it!  Give us 4!  Don't give us 3 pieces of bread or 3 pickles with our crudite plate!  Adding one more piece of bread is virtually no cost to the kitchen and makes me feel like I've been taken care of as a customer.   Moving on.  Everything on the board was delicious, loved the cheeses, loved the jams and butters, it was great.  Then we got the kit and kaboodle of braised pork shoulder, roasted veggies, fried headcheese (1 patty we had to cut in half) and tuna sashimi (3! pieces) with butter lettuce and fish saucey dipping sauce.  Now, I love braised pork shoulder and I love good tuna sashimi, but I'll be perfectly honest, I have no idea how they go together.  They were both tasty individually, but I was not feeling the cohesiveness.  Also, they gave us a massive amount of butter lettuce for only 3 slices of tuna.  I ate all the different components in about every combination possible, but none of them stood out so much that I felt THAT was the way I was \"supposed to\" eat it.  Overall, it was yummy and I enjoyed my meal.  We also had a sizeable amount of leftovers that will make a delicious sammich for work this week.  Nothing on the dessert menu tickled our fancies, we weren't quite ready to try beet ice cream with chocolate cake.  In summary: Service is excellent (thanks for taking care of us Paige!), food is tasty and well executed, decor is fantastic, drinks were tasty, and we will be coming back in the future!  Looks like we should probably try brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing. Each dish better than the last. The dish I will be talking about for weeks to come is the heirloom tomatoes with tomato sorbet. Simply spectacular. Also, the pork belly with black fun tuna was unforgettable. Honestly, better food than acclaimed restaurants in much larger cities.   Milwaukee, you'd better seriously step it up."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch expecting to walk away knowing I had an excellent brunch at one of the finer restaurants in Madison by a James Beard nominated chef, but I actually walked away being amazed and will not be able to stop talking about my new favorite thing: fried poached egg.  That's right. They deep fried a poached egg. It was crispy on the outside, perfectly set whites, and a runny yolk.  A perfectly poached egg that was crispy.  Mind Blown.  Their cocktails are amazing and regularly change and use spirits that are generally not used many places such as chartruse and malort.  They even have their elixir called Hum.  I do not know if this a regular thing or not, but the day I visited, ice cream and frozen cocktails were being produced by the bar manager on a liquid nitrogen ice cream machine.  It is quite the show to see for a cocktail."}
{"text":"Oh. My.  That food was good.  We got: Assorted Deviled Eggs (6) - three different kinds each.  SO good... so good.....  Tempura Wrapped Bacon Cheese Curds - I usually feel gross after I've gotten my fill of fried cheese, but this was perfect, and lighter than expected.  Delicious!   Root Vegetable Cakes: I can't remember the exact name.... but it was a perfect blend of textures with the perfect medium of sweet and savory veggie cakes with a lightly cooked blend of greens and other vegetables on top.  Thai Fish: Again....can't remember the name, but the fish was perfectly cooked, and after being in Thailand a few months ago, it had the perfect blend of spices to remind us of the curry we made there.  This is one of my new favorite date night places.  The only negative I have is that it was a bit noisy - but it could have been the guy sitting at the table next to us who seemed to yell all of his stories to his dinner date..."}
{"text":"Going to eat at the Heritage Tavern is not just dinner it's an event. Service could not have been better with well timed spacing between the shared plates,we had 4 small and 1 large plate . Grilled octopus Crispy headcheese and escargot Assorted devilled eggs Bacon wrapped cheese curds Chilli rubbed black Angus striploin Hey there are a lot of tastes going on here!! I think I actually liked the assorted devilled eggs best! The cocktail's before the event were excellent. Next time it's cocktail's, eggs and dessert."}
{"text":"Very good food. Excellent cocktails. Fantastic wait-service.  Wifequist and I recently visited to take in an early Valentine's Day date (my wife encouraged me to go have a weekend-long bender with high school friends instead of staying in Madison for Valentine's Day -- lucky, I know). We settled into an attractive booth near the entrance. I was pleasantly surprised to see the ample seating, the beautiful layout of the restaurant, and the view of the patriarch of Heritage making delectable items the kitchen.  The cocktails were varied and all looked very good -- I settled for a Manhattan, which quickly turned into two. Alongside my delicious drink was a bowl of their Candied Bacon & Spiced Nuts as well as a plate of the Tempura (bacon-wrapped cheese curds [what?!?!?], aori-wrapped shrimp, and truffled fish sauce), both of which was very good.  For my main course, I had the Pistachio Citrus-Crusted Grouper, and was amazed at the rich flavor of the fish that seemingly melted in my mouth. I wish I could delve more into the complex flavors that accompanied each bite, but let me just focus on what I know: it was goooood.  Mix all of that together with our fabulous waitress Genna (Jenna?) and you have a night to remember.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Heritage once for dinner and twice for brunch...and the brunches happened two Saturdays in a row because it was just that good. I'm def going to focus on those experiences in my review because I was so impressed. Brunch is often done kind of...well...halfheartedly. This place knows what's up.  The ambiance is fabulous whether you are inside or outside. Very chic, semi-rustic...you definitely know you are in for an experience when you sit down. The wait staff are also very attentive, but not overly so.   The coffee is delicious, smooth, and with generous refills aplenty.   Both times my date and I ordered the lamb sausage, which is incredible, and come with fried poached eggs. Yes, you read that correctly. Poached eggs which are coated in breadcrumbs and then flash-fried so they are still runny in the middle, but crispy outside. Oh. My. Science. These also come with duck fat fried hash browns, which are great and come with several of the dishes. The lobster omelette is also just as good as it sounds, with big pieces of shellfish and veggies.  Can't wait for round three."}
{"text":"Lovely interior and tasty food. Went during first week & got a 1st come / 1st serve table in bar. No gluten free entrees on menu but they were able to come with a lovely punt. Looking forward to returning to see the next generation of the menu & a few opening kinks ironed out! Overall - highly recommend but call in advance for reservations or go early for a walk-in table."}
{"text":"Another favorite of mine in Madison.  The dishes are very clearly prepared with love & care, and I really dig the atmosphere as well.  I do think that the prices are a little high, but that might've just been because I ordered wine and desserts and the bill really added up without my noticing (that tends to happen).  All in all, this is one of my favorite restaurants on the square and I'll definitely return sometime!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for more from The Heritage. Two us had a starter, a drink, and a main. It came in over $100, and I left hungry. We walked down the street and had a slice of pecan pie and fries at Graze."}
{"text":"The fact that Dan Fox, the chef and owner of Heritage Tavern, was Madison's Chef of the Year is no coincidence.  Heritage Tavern is only one of two Madison restaurants where the food and service are always outstanding (Lucas Henning's Graft being the other).  If, at some point in time, chef Fox's mother told him to stop playing with his food, he didn't listen--and the result has been grand. A roasted beet salad with figs and dark chocolate shavings makes you apprehensive? Just try it and see; it all works, and it works wonders! Bacon-wrapped cheese curds with tempura vegetables and several dipping sauces? How could you not order that (and you'll be glad you did). Foie gras, pork belly, a great assortment of deviled eggs--even the truffled fries that are not on the menu but they'll come if you ask for them; one thing is more delicious than the next. The main courses are as diverse as bouillabaisse and pork schnitzel, always with a unique twist and always delicious. You didn't save room for dessert? Have some anyway; you won't regret it. The profiteroles (three of them, big enough to share) are out of this world, but you'll be hard pressed to choose a single dessert. Talk your friend into having one and try theirs too; this is the kind of restaurant where dessert is worth pausing your diet for.  Heritage Tavern also offers a great environment; unique and warm on the inside with some outdoor seating in the summer too. The service is as good as the food without being stuffy and pretentious (often a problem at really great restaurants), which says a lot about the attention to detail that has gone into everything.  I'll be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Every single time gives me more reason to visit!  Love cornmeal crusted soft-shelled crab. Love tomahawk pork chop. Beet salad! Bacon and nuts were amazing too. Love the deviled eggs!   Sometimes I wish the menu didn't change so often so I could eat what I had the last time. but nah, i think I like the new surprises!  Thank you Chef Dan and crew for the amazing food and drinks. Awesome experience, every time."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Good vibes. High end pub food. Immediately add another star if you personally like a more adventurous menu. I myself feel like restaurants like this (and at this slightly higher price point) need a handful of \"fastballs down the middle,\" and as a more meat-and-potatoes orderer, I always find myself wishing I was up the block at Coopers, Tipsy Cow, etc etc.   Rock solid brunch.   All in all a good spot, and definitely a 4/4.5 Star if you're into the more adventurous tavern/pub menu."}
{"text":"YUMMY! Heritage is delicious, with great multi-room decor as well. More casual bar/table in room #1, more 'fine dining but not pretentiously so'-type atmosphere in room #2. There might be more rooms, but I was so hungry and anticipating food that I forgot to take note, oops.  Appetizers, my friend Paul and I had a 3-cheese plate that was solid. You can also get cured meats with this, but he wasn't into them. For appetizers, we had delicious beat salad, and I had cheese curds, which were done super creatively. They use tempura-style breading for them, and they tasted great with the three sauces provided (one a more traditional ranch-style thing, one a kind of tangy \"Asian fusion\" fruity thing, and some other one I forgot because I was so into the other two.)  Actual meal, I had this red snapper special/whitefish/veggies/rice/lobster tail gargantuan plate that I finished all by myself. Rice had a nice cheesy (as in the food, not the pejorative) flavor to it, and the whole thing was delicious without being uncomfortably gut-busting. I weigh ~140 on a good day and am 5'8\", so if I could handle these portions, those above my weight class should be, too. I'll post pix later maybe.  Great spot. I'm definitely coming back. One of the best I've had in Madison. Super friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Great spot for upscale brunch. The food tastes deliciously indulgent & luxurious. A great place to treat yoself."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is upbeat but yet incredibly chill. This, combined with elegant food that doubles down with adventurous flavors while maintaining a level of comfort food roots makes for a perfect night out alone, on a date or with a group."}
{"text":"This place is bringing next level food to Madison. The food is shockingly good. I recommend the grilled octopus and chicken dishes if they are still on the menu (it changes frequently). Probably the most subtle and still flavorful octopus I've ever had. The chocolate desert was incredible. The staff was very attentive, respectful, engaged, and knowledgable about the dishes and the business' history and continually volunteered valuable and intriguing information. Definitely prices to match the experience but if you are not native to Madison and have relatives in town, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Having eaten at the Heritage often, I was excited to taste the food with the addition of Chef Tory Miller in the kitchen.    The food by Miller was of course enjoyable.  However, the service was incredibly gut-wrenching.  In summary, a colleague of mine who explicitly expressed that he did not eat meat was delivered a pork dish that was presented as \"sturgeon belly\".  She literally said, \"here is the sturgeon dish\".  The new menu must have caused confusion, which we were all very sensitive to.  However, instead of being accountable for a grave error, the server avoided interaction with us and the staff hid behind the fact that they didn't have management. Sure.    Imagine if it were someone with a peanut or shellfish allergy that was delivered a dish with such ingredients.  Surely that would cause more clamoring by the staff to assuage the situation.  However, they were nonchalant and acted as if it didn't occur.  The disregard and insensitivity of the staff was gross. It's unfortunate, but as diners know all to well, the staff play a critical role in delivering an experience.  We will choose to dine elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good!  Had the special: foraged mushroom gnocchi.  So great.  The bacon-wrapped cheese curds were tasty too.  My colleague regularly drinks a lemon drop martini (smelled delicious! :)) and eats the bouillabaisse (which is messy, but she swears by it).  Great atmosphere, but only special occasions for me.  Pricey."}
{"text":"Neverending surprises!... Beautiful interior... attentive staff and luxurious flavor. I took my foodie friend from out of town for her birthday. She had a lovely time and I knew I delivered when the roast for two appeard... completely worth the wait...the look of \"disgust\" at our gluttony... wonder and jealousy on the faces of the other diners was worth the price alone. I should also note my bill included two cocktails two appetizers a salad and a lip smacking roast(  half of which went great with eggs in the morning!) And was under a $150.00 this was a fantastic value!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and drink selections. They have a wonderful cherry cider from restoration cider on tap. I really like their bar area atmosphere, it is more casual and relaxing. Their food is great and most can be made gluten free. They use local ingredients and you can tell the food is made thoughtfully. Overall, it's a great place to grab a drink and get some local Wisconsin fare!"}
{"text":"Flavor bombs of flavor! I went with friends and got to try many delightful tidbits of food, but I'm going to simplify your reviewing experience by sharing just one.  Deviled egg plate.  We opted for the six egg options which is twelve halves (duh, right? but not what I was expecting, so, bonus) with four different combinations of flavor brilliance. I liked the pink one. It was pink, so I liked it in a heteronormative way, but also because it was pink because of beets. It had roe on it. Roe. Tiny baby fish. On a deviled egg. Yes.  So in summary - are you looking an experience that will make your mouth go to uncomfortable places it hasn't been before but will be surprised and proud to realize it likes? Go here.  P.S.: There is a family-style whole roasted pig option.  That is all."}
{"text":"This would be a four or five start based on the food and service received from those who were attending to our table.  The demerit is based on the heavy handed management.  I understand the need to mentor and train staff, but there is a tactful and discreet way of doing this.....not in front of the customer.  We were served very well by our server tonight.  She was \"in training\", but did a wonderful job with a great attitude.  There seemed to be an overabundance of \"over the shoulder\" coaching from others that just seemed to undermine her confidence, which was completely unnecessary as far as we were concerned......really, lighten up.  The food was great, our service was great, and we were having a great time, up until the management cloud put a damper on things.......lighten up, people are there to enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"Heritage's cocktail menu is beautiful. I ordered the Templeton's Orchard and found it to be the most delicious thing I've ever had anywhere near my mouth. The drink, served in a coupe and accompanied by a small decanter containing about half as much as the coupe (which feels quite a bit like when you order a milkshake at a diner and they not only bring you a full milkshake but also whatever's left in the metal cup it was mixed in. BAM! Second milkshake!), features my good friend Templeton Rye and is accompanied by apricot liqueur and honey, which ameliorate the sweet-yet-fiery Templeton. Lemon and angostura bring the perfect level of acidity while the frothy egg white and rosemary brighten the whole place up. It's perfection."}
{"text":"Chef Dan Fox knows pig. The ham sandwich is probably the best I've ever had! The menu changes often, but I am glad that item often makes an appearance. In general, the meat dishes are really good. Often find myself disappointed by the fish options. The deviled eggs (comes with multiple variations on the dish) are a delicious and fun starter!  I go back and forth on drinks as well. I have been disappointed by the Bloody Mary (at brunch, weirdly chewy), and many of the Malort things. But I am a big fan of the fox trot! Good beer and wine options as well!  I really like the atmosphere. Overall, I generally leave being pretty impressed by 1 or 2 dishes, and underwhelmed by the others. Never had anything I dislike, but I go in with relatively high expectations."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't get it? This place is the definition of ok. Like the best restaurant at an airport.   A friend and I had brunch here a few weeks ago. There was no wait, an unexpected treat when there is a two hour wait at Graze.   The coffee was good, the bloody mary was good. My friend had an craft cocktail, with gin and hibiscus - also good. Our food was, you guessed it, good! I had the short rib sandwich, which, and this is fine, although you should just know, is quite literally just that. As in when you order this, you will receive a plate with only a sandwich on it. It's a great sandwich, it'll be ok. My friend had salmon Benedict - which was good. She noted that the eggs were perfect.   Our service was good - another reviewer called it Laissez-faire and that is pretty spot on. It wasn't exactly inattentive service... somewhere between not giving a **** and anticipating needs, albeit 5-10 minutes after they occur. And no, it was not busy.   The ambience... so yeah, I just don't get it. It's super plain. Like classy plain, but still very nondescript. I looked for things to like, but came up short. I liked that I wasn't sitting in a bank entry way for two hours in the cold (sorry Graze). But seriously, this place could be anywhere. Nothing notable.   The music was hilariously bad when we were there... not a knock, just worth mentioning. Michael Bolton happened.   A couple people mention the great lighting. The lighting must be different for dinner? Wait, I've been here for drinks and apps in the evening. I probably just don't get it. I mean, it's good lighting, but not at the level of something to mention."}
{"text":"Try Heritage for weekend brunch. It was amazing.   Was looking for a place for Farmers Market brunch as Graze and Marigold had huge waits. Walked by Heritage and found they now serve on Saturday and Sunday. Have had many good dinners here so we decided to try it. And while the menu had a lot of meat, there were a few vegetarian options and the Chef is always willing to try to accommodate.   While the service can be slow, it is also very friendly. And the cocktails are very good.   My vegetarian friend got an egg scramble and I got lobster Benedict. Both came with excellent potatoes, although the roesti has duck fat - would be good to have a veggie option here.  The eggs on both plates were cooked perfectly - not too hard, not too soft, just perfect. Sauce was excellent, and the amount was just enough to coat everything so the flavor was well incorporated.  The veggies were fresh from the market and great, with a nice blend of shitake and button mushrooms. The lobster was the highlight for me.  Not claw meat, but a decent portion of tail meat, blended perfectly. Likely the best breakfast egg dish I have ever had, and I've been around a while and traveled a bit.  Thanks Chef Fox and Staff, especially for being kind to vegetarians and the people who love them.   Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Although it is expensive, it is a great place for a special occasion. The deviled eggs are mad genius flavor profiles; the Asian was my favorite, hits all the flavor notes.  We both ordered the Wagyu beef and we were both happy we did so we didn't have to share. The beef was tender and full of flavor. The side of Brussels sprouts was delicious and large enough to share. The chocolate cake with beet chips and ice cream was the only disappointment of the meal. The cake was more like a dense brownie and the ice cream was more icy than cream. The beet chip was the best part of the dish. Service was good and pleasant. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Love the staff...... They serve and take  orders with such a casual grace-- without making you feel like you \" don't belong\"   Our hard earned dollars are well spent in a place where a degree of respect is shown to all of  the patrons.       Only slight \"comment\" is portion control.    The same meal can very in size quite a bit.    Last week we went with a couple of  friends, and two of the folks in our group ordered the Copper River Salmon         ( excellent.)   and one of the plates came out with a \"much\"  larger salad.   We were surprised the food made it out of  the kitchen  and more surprised the server placed it in front of us without talking it back for an adjustment."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to love this place, I really did, but it just barely fell short for me. I love that Dan Fox breeds his own pigs for use in the restaurant (where he literally uses every part of the animal), and I truly believe he's a culinary genius. However, I left feeling conflicted about my experience. On the one hand, the food was incredible. Our group split the deviled eggs and beet salad to start. Both were inspired, and the flavor combinations were so unexpected yet had so much depth. I then had the ramp pancakes with gochujang butter for my entree, and found it equally delightful. My only qualm with the food is the dollar-to-grub ratio. There was simply far too little food for the price. The $12 beet salad provided the two of us splitting it with hardly more than a bite, and while my entree was exquisite, there is no reason for a vegetarian \"pancake\" dish to cost $26. Which brings me to my second qualm: the confused atmosphere. On the one hand, the exposed brick, hardwood floors, and jean-clad waitstaff gives the place a laid back, comfortable feel. But then the menu-wording and price counteracts all of that. The menu descriptions feel inaccessible for someone who hasn't memorized a culinary dictionary, and as mentioned before, the price is quite high. SO, basically the food rocks, but the price is steep, and the laid back decor is countered with a \"hoity-toity\" feel to the menu. Thus, just shy of a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"O.K.....yes, I'm here all the time but there's a reason for that.  The staff is amazingly friendly and the ever changing menu demands constant return visits. So I oblige. Tonight it was Wisconsin Trout Lox & Assorted Caviar. Do not raise your eyebrows! I defy you to find anything better in southern WI! The trout itself was absolutely perfect, accompanied by chopped parsely, chopped egg white, chopped egg yolk, chopped onion, salmon roe, and flying fish roe, paired with a ramekin of creme, and all accompanied by Batch Bake House bread toast points. You'd be hard pressed to find an entree that has this much simple, yet complex, flavor ....but this is the appetizer! Chef Dan Fox is still pushing the boundaries of comfort food beyond the stratosphere. This is epicurial enjoyment at its finest! Throw a glass of 'That Maloort Thing', expertly made by Raphael, 'Raffie' to his patrons and friends, to compliment the dish, and you have the best way ever to celebrate Mexican Independence Day! The next time you're in downtown Madison, don't even think about it.....just get to Heritage Tavern. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Everyone should make sure to stop by this gem during Madison Restaurant Week!   The prix fix menu had some delightful choices for all three courses and the featured wines went great with both of our choices.   I had the meatballs, curry trout, and flourless chocolate cake with the Hugel Gentil.   He had the beet salad, curry trout, and rhubarb sorbet with El Coto De Imaz Reserva Tempranillo.    We are out of towners but will definitely be back next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is really great and the food is really great, but it just doesn't make five stars for me. They have a lot of adventurous dishes, and exciting rotating combinations. Pretty much all of their stuff is locally sourced and timed with the season, so you're going to see a lot of greens and a lot of meat. But I think the ambitious creativity behind the plates sacrifices quality a tiny bit. But obviously not by much since I still said four stars. Also be aware, $$$!"}
{"text":"My first time at Heritage Tavern was for drinks and late night snacks, and I was impressed with their thoughtful cocktail menu. I was curious about the food and atmosphere that mixed delicately fried arrangements, good lighting, and a wisp of Japanese pub.   Then, I came back with a party of 15ish for a pre-planned family-style meal to celebrate a good friend's 30th birthday, engagement, and Chinese New Year. Let's just say at least one pig was sacrificed in the making of this party, and it was the most delicious, dark, succulent, and crispy pig I've eaten in my life. The cutesy pig platters and knife coming out of the pig's head was a nice touch; I can't tell if the chef has a sense of humor or if I do. The evening's festivities were a smashing success, thanks to the tremendous role of Chef Dan Fox and Heritage.   We've been back for things like poutine, and there are always some animal's organ parts snuck in the menu. It's almost as if some of the Madison area chefs have a bet to see which parts they can get customers to eat, but at least I can say that my palette has been around the world, and challenged once or twice, in Madison.  If in doubt, order all the fried things and the deviled eggs."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time for their weekend brunch. Great atmosphere, exceptional service. Christian was very thoughtful and easily answered all of our questions about the menu. I ordered the Tavern Benedict, and the hollandaise sauce was some of the best I've ever had! My partner commented that although there are times you order a well-intentioned dish but the flavors don't make much sense together, everything we tasted felt like a cadence to song. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I normally meet friends for brunch on Saturday for some on-the-square fine dining after farmers market.  We normally go to classic American dining with prices similar to heritage tavern.  I was blown away by how much better my experience was at heritage tavern today than it has been at many other spots on the square.  All the dishes had some unexpected delightful element to them that made them special and, more importantly, cohesively delicious.  The atmosphere is great, we were seated immediately, and the wait staff was attentive."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to eat at Heritage Tavern since its opening, so was excited when they had a table for 3 open Friday night. We started with salads, the roasted beet salad for my daughter, brussels  sprouts for me, and the Caesar for my husband. The roasted beet salad promised aged goat cheese and dark chocolate, but neither were detectable. My brussels  sprouts salad was delicious, but puny for the $13 price tag. Faced with $26 for a chicken breast, $22 for a bowl of white chili, $32 for lake trout, or $38 for wagyu beef short loin, we opted for the \"snack\" menu and ordered the $14 grilled cheese and heirloom tomato soup, the $13 wagyu burger (supposedly stuffed with Gouda and short ribs, although you couldn't tell), and the $11 tempura (bacon wrapped cheese curds, \"market\" vegetables, and a shrimp or two served on long wooden skewers with three dipping sauces).  The kitchen is in full view and quite beautiful with gleaming copper pans on display at the entrance. Dan Fox himself fusses over every dish as it exits the kitchen, swooping in with bare fingers to rearrange the plate, drizzle oil, or sprinkle a few fresh herbs plucked straight from their black plastic greenhouse container.  He looks like a perfectionist who could be difficult to please, but he failed to notice that the burger and its brioche bun were dry (one of my husband's tempura dipping sauces helped with that) or that the tomato soup had a strange vinegary taste. The tempura was, well, tempura and if we expected more for our $11 we shouldn't have ordered from the snack menu.   My excitement at being in the great Heritage Tavern turned to disappointment and it's not likely that we'll be back, even if there are plenty of tables open on a Friday night."}
{"text":"2nd review to say that if you get the chance, sit at the end of the bar and watch the bartender make drinks. It's quite the show!"}
{"text":"There were some really great cocktails. The food was good and the decor was also appealing.  The service needed some improvement, but the manager recognized it and we did not need to complain since she addressed it without prompting. That's actually worth the special note."}
{"text":"Can't say much about their food, but they have some interesting cocktails.   I would recommend just trying things off their menu, because chances are, they'll all be pretty good. The unique drinks list definitely lives up to the label of a gastropub.   The prices are higher than usual Madison-standards, but you're also paying for the atmosphere.   We also had some fantastic service from a very sassy waiter. Thanks for the laughs!  Will definitely have to come back here for their food though, if everything tastes as good as they look."}
{"text":"We visited Heritage Tavern on a Saturday evening in January. The service and food were excellent. The drink menu is full of creative cocktails, but with the giant ice-cubes taking up most of the glass, there's not much beverage considering the high cost. For appetizers we enjoyed the tempura bacon-wrapped cheese curds and lamb tartar. For entrees we had the tortellini and trout. The flavors were all spot-on although portion sizes were smallish considering the price. Our server and runners were knowledgeable and friendly. The cons were that it did take quite a while to get our entrees and the price is hefty for the amount you receive. That being said, the tastes and textures were excellent and worth trying."}
{"text":"Portions are way too small and way too expensive. They have to lower the prices and change the menu a little.   I went twice. The first time, the salmon dish was way too salty.   The second time, we had the chips - ok/not filling. The Peach salad - good but too expensive, the noodle dish was ok - nothing exceptional.   I'll go back for drinks at the bar - but if you're hungry and want to drop $75 - $100 for 2 people, I would go to Graze or Osteria."}
{"text":"I come to Heritage relatively often, but a recent visit stood out. A friend and I stopped in after Concerts on the Square for a late dinner. Our waitress, Deborah, was knowledgeable about the menu, especially the beer and wine list. I selected a wine which they'd just run out of, and she let me try several generous tastes of other options. She was attentive, pleasant to talk to, and patient (I'm notoriously indecisive when it comes to ordering a drink or meal). I usually have a good experience at Heritage, but this time was excellent."}
{"text":"Five stars for service! Four stars for value - pretty pricey. That said, our salads were delightful and the mixed drinks were one of a kind. Wish we could have come back for brunch."}
{"text":"WHOAH. Firstly; the \"mini ham sand\" on the happy hour menu... There is nothing mini about this thing! I was stunned... for 5$. It was the best ham sand I have ever had, Also I normally hate ham. This thing had me going hog wild. The drinks were great. I just had a bad vibe from the bartender. She seemed annoyed for some reason. I think service quality is more important than the product. I like that the employees get to wear jeans to work. That is really nice."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Heritage Tavern. I'm a sucker for the trendy/cozy/casual/sleek atmosphere, and the waitstaff is always pleasant. I've visited Heritage three or four times for brunch and once for dinner. I walked out happy each time. I've had the veggie eggs benedict and veggie omelet for brunch visits. The benedict was fine. The eggs were cooked just how I like them, perhaps a little too soft for others. The veggies were lacking. There were a few pieces of spinach and some tomatoes. Overall it tasted fine. I was a big fan of the veggie omelet and inhaled it in about five minutes. It was full of root vegetables including carrots, parsnips and some other vegetables I didn't take the time to observe. The egg omelet itself was delightfully fluffy and not at all overcooked like you may get with some novice omelets.  I cannot remember what I got for dinner, there were many drinks involved and my meal in general is just this vague recollection of deliciousness. It was some kind of polenta dish. I can say with confidence that the drinks are very good. I don't think this place is for everyone. My friend was a big curmudgeon about the decor, edison light bulbs, the fact that he had to ask for salt and pepper, and then that the salt was served in a cute little glass swan. It's definitely on the hipster/trendy side, I would call it a stereotypical Madison destination. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a gem!  Had dinner here during Epic UGM and the place is packed!  But the cocktails and the food were awesome.  We had a party of 4 and shared the a handful of small plate appetizers- the heirloom tomato salad and cheese curds covered in bacon were among my favorite.  For entree, we had the Gnocchi with Summer Veggies, Pistachio Crusted Grouper, Bouillabaisse and the Pork Schnitzel.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  Service was excellent and the ambiance was casual.  Definitely recommended for dining when you are in Downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Yay! Best breakfast we've had in a long time. By a long long shot. Awesome bacon bloody, super huge French toast, something fancy eggs Benedict with the house name on it. Awesome. Perfect waiter and ambience. For sure will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Heritage Tavern for breakfast at about 9:30 am on a Sunday. I was the first customer there. I took a seat at the bar and ordered a much needed coffee.  I decided to order the Biscuits and Gravy which, from what I was told, is one of the newer additions on their menu. Food came out promptly. It was a total of two in house baked biscuits and a mini pot filled with the gravy. My first thought was that the plating was different from what I've had at other places, but I did think the presentation was very nice. The gravy was very rich and thick. It seemed to have bacon in it. I'm not certain. Overall, it was a pleasing dish and the bartender was attentive and polite. I'll be coming back, but I plan on trying their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Got to try heritage for the first time tonight and it knocked my socks off. Both pairs. Yeah, I wear a lot of socks.   Heritage features top-notch foodie food at solid prices for what you're getting. They care about presentation, and everything's cooked and seasoned to perfection. You can't go wrong.   I've had a lot of great steak in Madison, but Heritage still managed to impress.   Small portions, but that's understandable for what you're getting. 10/10 will be back.  Edit: was back, still 5/5, and maybe the best food in Madison."}
{"text":"Great date spot. Cool bar. Bartender was passionate and knowledgable. Manager came by a few times. Chef stopped by. Had a great sample of the menu and everything was unique and delicious. Serving size was small, but it allowed us to enjoy a variety of items."}
{"text":"Uh. Maze. Zing.  My friends and I came here for Madison Dining Week and their menu is to die for. I started my evening with the lamb tartare, which was a pretty good portion to start the night off with. For entree I had the braised pork shoulder and crispy pork belly.. Oh. My. God. Loved this. This was the $H1T! The meat just melted in my mouth... It was everything I hoped and dreamed for. Finally for dessert I had the chocolate flourless cake with ice cream and that was pretty good too. Our server and host were both very friendly and accommodating of our large party (of 6) and very knowledgeable. All in all, the food was great and the service was spectacular. I couldn't ask for a better dining service. :) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I got a last minute reservation for three on Father's Day, probably because the brunch service at Heritage is relatively new.  The restaurant was full but, miracle of miracles, we could actually carry on a conversation because the noise level was moderate.  Our server was pleasant and attentive. I had the Classic Eggs Benedict, another in our party had the Lobster Scramble and the third person ordered the Smoked Whitefish, Crab and Bacon Cake.  The Classic was excellent.  The ham in it was a standout ingredient and I polished off every bite!  The Lobster had good size chunks of the star ingredient and was tasty--the duck fat fries were satisfying--crisp on the outside and soft on the inside--but very rich so a few go a long way.  My husband found the Whitefish cake to be a little bland and wished he had ordered the Belgium Waffle with pickled rhubarb, strawberries and whipped fromage blanc which looked fabulous when delivered to a table next to us. Brunch was much better than our two previous dinner experiences at Heritage.  Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Pro: -A m a z i n g  food and I'm a snob -Zero wait time the four times I've visited  -Attractive finish/design  Con: -Lil loud for my oldish ears -Very pleasant service, just slower than I fancy  Bottom line: Excellent"}
{"text":"I dream about the burger here. The one on the brunch and late night menus. Just order it, because I can't think of the right words to describe it's tender savoriness.   The restaurant itself is gorgeous--wish I could move in--and service is usually pretty good too."}
{"text":"We went here on suggestion from friends.  Having few occasions to spend money on nice meals, I was scared after looking at the menu that I would be disappointed, but I was so wrong.    The owner has a heritage pig farm and raises all the pork products.  They also do their own pickling.  They frequent the markets for ingredients as well.  When you consider all this, their menu has fair pricing.  Bloody marys are house-made and just the right thickness for me.  SO good.  We also tried the market champagne cocktail, which this week was a pear, absinthe, pickled grape perfection.    I had the breakfast sandwich add ham (which was more like bacon).  The complexity of all the different flavors made this remarkable.  Perfect bun that was a vehicle for the sandwich but didn't over power it.  Fried green tomato, perfect sunny-side up egg, salty \"ham\", pickled veggies, greens and stone ground mustard with aioli.  SO GOOD.  My husband tried the Heritage Tavern Benedict and we were super enticed and excited by the fried poached eggs - fried yet creamy yolk!  Again an excellent plate.  Would have loved to dip into the sweet side of the menu but we were too full.  Excellent service at the Bar from Clint.  Overall an amazing experience and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Ok food. Period.   Server rushed out first few orders to the table after ordering a good pricey bottle of wine. ( hello..  your customer orders a good expensive bottle of wine slow the fuck down.  ) Cheese board was great. ( fois gras with honey- fucking genious!!  Incredible!!!) Goat cheese salad- nothing special. There were beets? Bacon cheese curds. - too much garlic in the buttermilk.  Fish sauce?  Otherwise. Great idea!! Dessert was great."}
{"text":"This place is the paradigm of the ideal dinning experience. I sat at the bar on a Monday night and had two busy but very attentive and extremely knowledgeable bartenders guide my dinning experience. They where eloquent and passionate about the menu. The best part.....the food surpassed all the hype.  Everything was executed to perfection. The flavors are truly unique in dishes that seem familiar and falsely predictable in their flavor profile.  The chef really elevated traditional American dishes to a higher level. Truly a superlative dinning experience."}
{"text":"The place is cramped and loud but the service is outstanding.  I know folks are devoted to this place, but the food is HEAVY, even for the midwest.  Meat, dairy, more meat, more dairy.  And bland.  We picked the most \"flavorful\" items on the menu but still didn't hit \"moderate\" on the flavor meter.  I spent most of my life in CA and Boston, so maybe my palate isn't sensitive enough - seriously.  The restaurant is what it advertises and does a good job of what it purports to do.  Just not for me."}
{"text":"Man, the food here is just unreal. Everything is so, so, so, SO good. Service has improved drastically since my previous review, and I have had most of my favorite meals in town at this place. Phenomenal."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying that I've come here twice, and I'd give Heritage 2.5 stars for brunch and 5 stars for their bar food.   I'll start with brunch. We went to Heritage at 12:30pm on a Sunday. The restaurant has a pleasant and understated atmosphere with its exposed brick walls. Does anyone else appreciate a nice bathroom? Well, Heritage has them. And they were playing 80s pop music, which I'm a sucker for. As for the service and the food, I don't have as many positive things to say.   We were seated and ordered drinks (a latte and a Bloody Mary), which took too long to get to our table, particularly the Heritage Bloody Mary. Not that the wait staff weren't perfectly nice - they were - but, in spite of the fact that the restaurant wasn't very busy, everyone was moving as slow as molasses.  The drinks turned out to be great. The Bloody Mary was seriously spicy and came with a toothpick speared with pickles, a tomato, asparagus, and bacon. The latte was strong and the single brown sugar cube it was served with provided just enough sweetness.   Once our drinks came, we could finally (FINALLY) order. I got the Lobster Scramble. It came with a huge and super-crusty and overly buttery croissant. The scramble itself, which had plenty of hollandaise, spinach, and lobster, was quite tasty. The ample portion of shredded potatoes was pretty good too, particularly with a mix of the Sriracha and ketchup served on the side.   My dining mates' got the Heritage Benedict and the Lamb Sausage with Savory Toast respectively. The Heritage Benedict was reported to be a little simple: none of the flavors stood out. Bacon would have been better than the pancetta it was served with, and the eggs were over-fried and a bit tasteless. The Lamb Sausage with Savory Toast was reported to be alright, the shredded potatoes being the real standout.   Now onto the bar's offerings. The bartender was as sweet as pie and gave my friend a special antique store bought cocktail glass. We ordered the medium-sized meat and cheese plate which sells for around $20. It was worth every penny and then some. We asked the bar staff to surprise us and recommend their favorite meats and cheeses. When it came out, our very full platter included almond-hickory nut butter, stone ground mustard, bleu cheese with volcano ash streaks, head cheese, figs, sheep's milk cheese, and many other cured and fermented surprises. My friend and I both have big appetites, and, despite the fact that everything was delicious, couldn't finish everything.   My recommendation: stop at the Heritage some evening for a glass of wine or a beer and the tantalizing meat and cheese platter. As for brunch, skip it."}
{"text":"After one visit to Heritage Tavern, this place has leapfrogged about a dozen Madison restaurants into elite status as one of the top two or three best.  The crux was when I ordered a cocktail off the menu, yet my lovely and discerning date asked for a limoncello martini--off menu.  After a moment, my drink arrived and I told my dining companion that she might just be SOL.  Yet after another minute, the bartender, Grant, himself shows up with a NO2-charged carafe and a tall glass full of lemon and orange peel.  He even checked in with her about exactly what she wanted and went quickly back to the bar for a fine tuning.  He then explained how this NO2 process would favorably compare to the traditional limoncello soak.  He got it all set up and used two NO2 cartridges for the charge.   The result was exactly the lively citrus essence that my beautiful spouse was seeking.  The food was thrilling and adventurous.  The dish with the sashimi, pork belly and foie gras was predictably rich, and too much after the few small courses that we'd already split.  Next time we'll back off one appetizer.  Yes, the deviled eggs were spot on.  The Wagyu and fried shrimp app was a revelation.  Heirloom tomato salad was so tasty.  Then the coup de grace was the bill.  We had feared that the elaborate custom cocktail would well exceed the cost of my $10 menu drink.  Nope--$7.  They probably paid nearly that much for the two NO2 cartridges.  Can't wait to get back and venture further."}
{"text":"I was in for brunch a few weeks ago and asked for one of the sandwiches to be prepared without cheese and with some extra veggies to make it vegan friendly. Our server came back a minute later and said that that sandwich couldn't be made 100% vegan, but that the chef was more than happy to make me something that would be vegan friendly. The chef wound up making me a sandwich with apple and caramelized onion, and a side salad. It was SO good. I've never had a chef offer to make me something special and not on the menu, and apart from it being really thoughtful, the meal was DELICIOUS.  On top of the amazing service and great food, the drinks are phenomenal and the atmosphere is bright and modern. I love this place."}
{"text":"I brought out of town guests to the Heritage Tavern for Saturday morning brunch and we couldn't have had a better experience! The service (Victoria), food, and atmosphere exceeded our expectations. We especially loved the maple ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Certainly one of our favorite and most frequently visited restaurants since we moved here a little over a year ago. Chef/Owner Dan Fox has taken \"food to table\" to heart raising his own pigs and recently purchasing Willow Creek Farms. That's only the part of it. He's got the goods and the talent to take the vision and practice to the highest levels. No restaurant is without missteps but they are few at Heritage Tavern. We've had the good fortune to have had great experiences at many of the best restaurants in the US. Our favorite restaurant experience in LA has been Providence. Here, in Madison, last Sunday Chef Fox and his team created what is for me one of the most memorable dining experiences of my lifetime. The title of the event \"Heritage Tavern Pear Cocktail Dinner Featuring Death's Door Spirits.\" Some background is necessary. The bar manager decided to grow pears in the bottle at a friend's orchard. This is a labor of love/passion. I didn't ask how many bottles didn't work. But among the ones successful the bottles were filled with the local Death's Door gin. Each course was accompanied by a cocktail using the pear/gin and flavored to completely complement the course. There were five courses. Blue Marlin Crudo, Foie Gras Mousse, Willow Creek Pork Belly, Cocoa Nib Crusted Venison (best venison dish I have ever had) and \"Glass Pear\" dessert - which was an absolute work of art - a blown sugar pear surrounding a pear mousse on a hickory nut cake, brown butter and lavender crumble; totally mind blowing. You had to be there! Each cocktail perfectly complemented the course. I think most were at wine alcohol levels so it was like having a tasting menu with a terrific wine for each course. I'm on board for every day dining (we may show up a couple three times a month) and for their special events. This last one was fantastic. Looking forward to the next one."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"dining experience\" places, which we are so fortunate to have in Madison. I love everything about this restaurant, the food, the drinks, the decor, the service... It's one of my favorite places.   This is a great place for a very nice dinner with your favorite person or a small group. But what I may like even more is sitting at the bar and ordering off the \"snacks\" menu. We did this during a recent Friday night on our way to see a play.  The bartenders were very engaging and even made my husband an off-menu drink with bitters. He likes drinks with bitters and we love it when we have a creative bartender.  We enjoyed the pickled vegetables with our first drinks.   I ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese. It was plenty for my dinner, even though it's on the snack menu. It was the most wonderful, gourmet grilled cheese and tomato soup I've ever eaten. I would order it again and again.  My husband had a cheeseburger that he said was to die for. I was so focused on my meal I didn't want to taste his, but I'll take his word for it."}
{"text":"Went last night (saturday) with my wife for a 9:00 reservation. Place was packed, but our table was ready on time so things starting brilliantly, especially with the amazing drinks mixed by their bartender...however, the cocktails ended up being the highlight of the night...  We got the tempura which was ok. Next up was the strawberry and blue cheese salad with sorrel, candied lemons and proscuitto. After we ate it, i re looked at the menu cause it seemed like there were ingredients missing...i remarked to the waiter that, \"it says proscuitto and sorrel on the menu, but there were neither on the salad\" and he replied, \"oh my gosh, so sorry. I'll totally make it up to you.\"  Well, the bill came and the salad was still on the bill. more bad service.   The roast chicken and tortellinni main was impossibly salty. It was clearly brined and not rinsed...or cooked in its own brining liquid or something, cause it was insanity how salty it was. If we hadn't complained on the salad, we would've mentioned this as well.   Also split the waygu burger...served asked how we'd like it cooked. We said, \"medium\" it came back VERY well done...another fail.   There are too many other good restaurants in madison that serve the same style of food with much better care and service. don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Our new favorite brunch spot in Madison!  Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter. Omelette, cinnamon rolls, bacon, egg sandwiches, all terrific. We have a 5 year old son, and a 15 year old daughter - and we are all leaving fat and happy!  (We love heritage for dinner too - but want everyone to know about their amazing brunch too)."}
{"text":"We had a great meal and a really fun time at this restaurant. We started with the charcuterie and thought that the bresaola was especially good, although everything on the tray was delicious. We shared several of the small plates including the roasted beet salad, the lamb appetizer, the pork belly with tuna sashimi and the mushroom risotto. The wine list had some interesting choices including a sparkling rose by the glass that I especially enjoyed. The opera cake dessert was perfect for sharing. Recommended."}
{"text":"Passing through town to play a concert. SO glad to find this place! A gin list 25 deep meant perfect (and BIG) martinis. Deviled eggs, bacon wrapped cheese curds, steak, and burger. Open late after playing a concert. Really terrific!"}
{"text":"Went on Father's Day for brunch and it was pretty loud and hectic in the main dining room. Food was very good (got the omelet, and the ham sandwich and fries). Good service but overall a little slow, and I found the menu a bit overpriced and somewhat limited in options. I would go back again to try on a not so crazy day, and perhaps give it another shot for dinner."}
{"text":"I really had a great time. Sat down at one of the walk up tables by the bar. Great service. Cocktails are outstanding and I would even dare say one of the best in Wisconsin. Food is very good. Pork belly and tuna sashimi dish is fantastic. Not a big fan of the tempura. Risotto was good. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"First time here, large party for Sunday brunch. Everything is so good. The French toast, the eggs Benedict, the steak and eggs. The bacon. The bloodys. Oh my god so good. Service is top notch. Very Gluten free friendly- we had a Celiac in our party. Can't wait to try dinner sometime."}
{"text":"From the first bite I was hooked. The bread and butter appetizer was light and flavorful.The dilly beans and midget pickles were very fresh and spicy and led very well to the Pork Spaetzle which was cooked perfectly. Finished the meal with an ice cream filled cream puff which had a honey crunch drizzle over it. Loved everything!! I cant wait to come back"}
{"text":"Heritage Tavern is my favorite restaurant in Madison. I have been here 5 times now, and the quality has been consistently good.   Happy hour:  the two times I have been here for happy hour I really enjoyed their 5 dollar pork tacos and their beer selection. The tacos are very well executed, and a nice modern variation of the classic carnitas  Dinner: Their menu changes often, but always offers an interesting selection. I liked pretty much everything I ate there. Definitely try their chocolate cake dessert and the lamb tartare. The wine selection is also quite a treat and affordable.  In summary, great consistent high quality place. A bit pricey, but worth the money."}
{"text":"Tonight, I had the wagyu beef chuck roast.   It was perfect.  It was so good, I fed a bite to a random pregnant lady sitting at the bar next to me. It was so good, I starting texting people to tell them about it. It was so good, it warranted a 5 star yelp review.  Even if you don't order the wagyu beef (you fool!), you will love the cocktails, your server Kevin, and anything you order off the menu, which will most likely be made of pork.  Get ready for a fatty, heavy, rich experience followed by a blissful food coma."}
{"text":"We went to restaurant week with friends who LOVE Heritage.  Well, we fell in love too!!  We were comparing dishes and trying to see whose would win over the others....all WON!!  I'm not a fan of papaya, so I didn't order the Peanut Oil Whitfish, but I got to try it - what papaya!?!?  OH my gosh, was it delish!!  Thank you for everything and WE WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"We had a very special evening at Heritage last night, a lovely experience.  Starting with the friendly and efficient service, each aspect of the dinner was memorable.  Shared a starter of Anabasque cheese with garnishes then a unique and delicious beet salad.  Our entrees were the salmon special and a chicken dish.  Both were so unusual--very hard to describe and so good!.  Only had room for a dish of maple ice cream for dessert.  I've dined there many times and it never disappoints.  Highly recommended for your fine dining choice but it's also possible to go and have a couple of yummy \"smalls\" if you are not up for the entire gala evening.   Chef/owner Dan Fox is the most unassuming and personable chef I've ever met.  Kudos to Dan and his people!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before seeing a show on a Thursday night. Started with 3 appetizers which were brought out 1 at a time ( great idea when the food is so unique ). Had to start with the bacon wrapped cheese curds, outstanding, really surprised how well the fish sauce and curry sauce went with them. Then had the dozen deviled eggs, favorite was the tuna tartar. Had the fried head cheese with escargot last, my co worker was turned off but I loved it. Main course was the schnitzel with spatzel and red cabbage with a knock wurst kicker. Being from southern Germany, this was a close approximation of a traditional German meal, rot kohl was a bit too sweet, and the knock wurst was very salty, but very good. The cocktail selection is out there but they explain them really well if you ask GREAT PLACE TO GO AND TRY NEW FLAVORS!!!!"}
{"text":"As always, the food and the service at Heritage Tavern was as good as it gets. It's Restaurant Week in Madison, which is a busy time and normally I'd expect abrupt service, but this was not the case at Heritage. Our water was very attentive, taking the time to talk with us about the evenings menu, pour our wine when glasses got low, and got our food to us as soon as it was ready.   The dinner menu at Heritage always has some unique items - our table had a selection of the Pork Trio, Beef Short Ribs, appetizers and desserts. Again, we normally don't go during restaurant week because of how busy things get, but were pleasantly surprised with the menu and the service.   If you're looking for something a little more casual, they have a great bar menu and super friendly bartenders, and brunch is always a bit there with our out of town guests. Brunch and the bar menu are also a little less spendy - still with the same quality you'd expect from Heritage.   5/5 stars - there's really nothing to complain about here. Thanks Heritage!"}
{"text":"Creative dishes, fresh ingredients, I could type a hundred words of praise and still not adequately describe how good the food is here. Just go and give it a try."}
{"text":"Best overall dining experience in Madison in a long while.  Great service, drinks and food for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We were visiting in laws and needed to celebrate an anniversary.  We considered ourselves lucky to obtain a reservation so we leapt at the chance to go to Heritage.  Tables were even switched for a little more privacy.  Very accomadating The food was creative and well prepared.  Deviled egss were incredible.  Service was stellar even after asking for a few tweaks to our order.  Chef Fox came out and personally delivered a double yolk egg on top of his cole slaw...magical.  We thanked him profusely and finished our meal watching the place really shine. If back in Madison, we will pay a return visit.  A real treat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Heritage Tavern for brunch on Saturday after the farmer's market around the Capital building, and I was surprised it was mostly empty around 12:30pm.  Maybe we missed the rush or it's a little hidden a block off the square . . . either way, it worked out for us.  The hostess asked if we wanted to sit in the front or in the back where it was quiet, and we opted for the back.  We were promptly sat next to a table of 3 extremely loud guys.  Luckily they were just finishing up and left shortly after we were seated, because the tables are pretty close together.  This is one of those places were everything on the menu sounded delicious, and it was a difficult decision on what to order.  I got the Heritage Tavern Benedict, and my boyfriend got the Maple Lamb Sausage and Toast.  My boyfriend loved his meal, and finished all of it.  I was jealous because his came with some really yummy potatoes.  I really enjoyed mine was well, although I wished afterwards I had picked something else.  Turns out I don't like porchetta (my fault), but the rest of it was so yummy.  I'd never even heard of fried poached eggs, but now I want to try to find them in Chicago.  I wished it had come with a little green salad or potatoes or something, but I walked out stuff anyways (too many cheese samples at the Farmer's Market :) ).   If I lived in the area, I would definitely be back to try some other brunch menu items or dinner.  Delicious coffee too!"}
{"text":"I finally made it out to try this place and it's great! The decor is nice and spacious which you can't tell from the outside. They have room to handle large groups and they do take reservations. The staff is not pushy or stuffy which I love. The home run for me is that their dishes are unique. They have cheese curds but they add a twist using tempora batter. And they have red wine beet sorbet! Complex flavor and delicious. We also had sturgen and and octopus which was cooked to perfection. I also recommend the appetizer that has sausage, pork belly, and duck confit. Can't wait to go back to try other items!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison. Their cocktails are so delicious for starters. Every meal I've had there has been super delicious. I've been for dinner several times and brunch twice. My husband complains that the menu is too limited, but he is annoyingly picky, he usually doesn't want seafood or pork. I don't care and I make him go there because I love it. And if I don't see anything new that I want to try, I can always go for the schnitzel because it's really amazing.  Also, free bread/butter/pickles!   I know this review isn't very long but it's mostly because I have zero complaints. Service is always great, food is always great, location is great, what more could you ask for?   PS: I've taken my kids to brunch (ages 9, 7, and 4) and they were great, very accommodating to their requests for bacon and eggs.  ETA:  To the commenter who said the bartender was rude but you are \"from LA and spend a lot of time in New York\" whoop-de-do, who gives a crap? I've never seen a rude staff person at this restaurant, but I'm also not conceited about all of the places I've traveled so..."}
{"text":"Hot damn.  Can we just talk about how glad I am that Heritage started doing brunch? I've only had the Maple Lamb Sausage and Savory Toast but I can't deny that the fried poached eggs were everything I wanted that morning. The sausage, eggs, and bread to mop up those runny yolks was exactly what I needed. AKA fancy hangover food.  Being the glutton that I am...not only have I indulged in Brunch, but the Late Night Menu is the bomb dot com as well. I used to come here for late night snacks and cocktails ALL THE TIME and let me just say to the bar staff, you guys rock my socks off. I have never had a bad night sitting up at the bar sipping on an Angostura Sour and noshing on the Tempura Spicy Tuna Roll with some friends.  That roll calls to me. I have to say that thoughts of that roll, with its crispy pork belly, and fresh citrus layered on top of a tempura fried tuna roll has DEFINITELY been the cause of many of my late night voyages to Heritage.  The menu is really rich and unctious. I would most definitely recommend Heritage to those seeking out a delicious and possibly coma inducing meal."}
{"text":"Had a great cocktail: Evergreen & Ruby. Enjoyed the bacon-wrapped cheese curds and Hearts of Palm salad."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times.  The first few times were 5 star experiences for both service and cuisine.  Last night I went with a few clients and coworkers.  Service  - excellent, very attentive.  The menu is diverse and interesting, something for everyone.  I would give a 5 star for this review but my schnitzel was more than a little overcooked.  Everyone else at the table raved about their food - especially the person that ordered the bouillabaisse.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and walked by this restaurant one night. I was not disappointed! The atmosphere was nice and the food spectacular. I wish I had taken so pic of the tempura battered bacon wrapped cheese curds, they were amazing. My co worker and I also had an appetizer of 6 deviled eggs for an appetizer. I then had the pork schnitzel for dinner. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Heritage was on New Years Eve with a group of our friends. While our group loves a good meal we value craft cocktails more. The cocktail menu was better than your average non-undergraduate upscale bar but nothing extremely impressive although it did give us confidence that the bartenders were well trained. This confidence was further promoted when we met Clint, who turned out to be the bar manager and our new favorite Madison bartender. It was very apparent that Clint and his bar staff enjoyed experimenting with new cocktails and had no issue making off menu drinks catering to our specific tastes. Most of our cocktails were off menu and non-ordinary but all were amazing. We especially liked their use of vermouth and house made bitters in many of their drinks which a lot of other local places are hesitant to use. I highly recommend getting a drink with their tobacco fig bitters! We are now regulars at the bar and although Clint isn't always there his staff is very experienced and make it a fun enjoyable atmosphere. We also really enjoy that there isn't blaring music like many other places nearby.   I have brought my fiancée there for dinner several times. We've eaten both at the bar and in the fine dining area. The bar food is surprisingly good, especially their take on deviled eggs which were amazing. The bar food and drinks are higher priced than many local bars but the quality in my opinion is well worth it.   The fine dining experience was also positive. We went to Heritage for date night and made sure to make a reservation which is highly recommend. We started out with their bacon wrapped cheese curds. This appetizer was not my favorite, the batter wasn't typical and the cheese was more solid than melted but I can see how many would like if. In all fairness our server did a perfect job of describing the appetizer before we ordered it. I'm a sucker for trying new takes on cheese curds, especially when bacon is added!   We then had their Tomahawk Steak for two. This was one of their nightly specials which we were warned took about 45 minutes to make. I'm one that typically thinks you can only make standard dishes like steak amazing to a certain point before it can't get any better. I thought I'd already experienced the best but I was wrong. The steak was season with something I can only describe as magical as well as grilled bone-in which is the only way one should grill a steak. It was then sliced and artfully stacked on a serving plate. We both left highly satisfied already planning on returning in the near future.  We love the downtown life and I'm glad to have found Heritage. It's now one of our new favorite spots."}
{"text":"I went last Wednesday. I'm shocked the chef was nominated for a James beard award. We had some nice food but overall the experience left me disappointed.  Too many wrong things ... My drink was weak - $11 for a weak drink? The server said it was a balanced cocktail - is that code for pouring weak drinks? My sisters entrée was so salty she sent it back My soup was supposed to have butter poached lobster - not!"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening.  We were celebrating my daughters 13th wedding anniversary.  Everything far exceeded ou expectations."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times before, but were just here with a large group of 10 people.  They asked us to reserve later on in the evening (8:30) and we were seated right away.  Had some great drinks, any of their cocktails were a big hit.  Someone had the deviled eggs and they were simply beautiful! Tasted great too.  The star of the show was the family style heritage pork and blackfin tuna.  You have to order in a group of 2 or more and it's $30 per person; but easily worth it because you got quite a bit, even enough for leftovers. Nice hunk of pork shoulder - almost crispy on the outside but fall off the bone tender.  Only a few pieces of the tuna, I'd say 4 small slices.  Two big hunks of fried headcheese, on a bed of veggies.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Extra points to our server for asking about allergies & food intolerances BEFORE we ordered. That was very thoughtful.  They had a Yorkshire pudding on special. Theirs featured pulled pork and was almost too salty to eat. I would've liked to know that there was pork in it...I'm not vegetarian but I usually try to avoid pork and I wasn't expecting meat inside of the pastry. I left the crust at the bottom because it was swimming in enough oil/butter to make Paula Deen weep for joy. I'm a foodie...I cook with ghee and butter and oil, but this much liquid fat pooling at the bottom of my dish was pretty gross to look at. I wouldn't order their Yorkshire? pudding ever again. And their pork was just way too salty. I felt kinda gross after eating it, like I needed a kale & cucumber salad to feel 'clean' again.  The tiny cast-iron ramekin it was baked in was adorbs, and now I want a set of them. I'm sure I can make way better Yorkshire puddings at home.  I had the Peanut oil Fried white fish and it was very good. Hubs had the pistachio-crusted grouper. We tried each other's? dishes and were very pleased.  Chocolate Espresso Opera cake for dessert, along with a cappucino. Wine was good too!  Service was great. I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the cheese curds even if you get them without the bacon are fried in the same vat as the ones they put the bacon in. Wines are also good, as is the service."}
{"text":"Very worth it.  Heritage does a number of things very well. First off, please have the culatello salad. Big nod to the chef for including the truffle of the cured meat world and even more respect for slicing the meat properly-good and thin.  The deviled eggs are interesting and a saavy way to meld haute cuisine with Wisco charm and culture.  Bravo. Two things not to miss in my view are the porchetta sandwich and the tomahawk pork chop. Children of Abraham, make an exception for these dishes-fantastic. The chop is not terribly thick like your usual pork chop and the grill is perfect. Parts closer to the bone are crispy and the meaty parts are very tender. It's quite a feat. The sandwich is a simpler dish but delicious and perfect if you want a slightly smaller portion allowing you peruse other items.  All in all, a great addition to the Madison scene that manages to produce excellent cuisine without falling victim to too much bougieness that occasionally puts good ideas out of business (ah em Magnus)."}
{"text":"Wonderful tavern with a great atmosphere and service. Their beer tap is a bit different than most capital bars which is always a welcome. Food was delicious but cost quite a bit more than expected for the portion size. Overall, a great place to check out!"}
{"text":"We met up with my nephew here for brunch on a Sunday. I can see why he made reservations - this place was fantastic!  I enjoyed the Heritage Benedict and my wife also loved her Vegetable Benedict. Mine had a deep fried poached egg that was incredible and perfectly done! My nephew had his go to Breakfast burger that they serve and I swear there enough fries with homemade dipping sauces for the entire table.   We will definitely be back when in town and would recommend this to any local that has yet to try it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Madison. Chef Dan Fox is an absolute rockstar. Perfect place for date night, dinner with friends, brunch on the weekends, etc. Amazing atmosphere, awesome drinks and DELICIOUS food."}
{"text":"We had an early brunch and the food and service were excellent. We shared their Old Fashioned Cinnamon roll with ham and walnuts and an ample amount of sugary glaze along with the donuts with an espresso chocolate panache dipping sauce. These were our \"appetizers\". In fact, we had them save half so we could enjoy later because we knew the meal would be a lot too.   My wife had the Lobster Scramble and I had the Old Fashioned Ham and Cheese omelette. Both cooked to perfection with a side of soft cooked rosti potatoes and a herbed hollandaise sauce.  Hers came with a buttery warm croissant and mine with a mixed green salad.   As I said, the service was great and the food amazing. Definitely recommend and hope to try dinner there soon too!"}
{"text":"We had our first Heritage experience last night and it was decidedly mixed.   Positives: Five star server (Kevin). Craft cocktails (Paramore, Manhattan). Dessert (Chocolate Tart). Ambiance (mostly great build-out and vibe).  Not all positive: Food. My wife and my opinions differed to a great extent. I found most of my food overcooked and, strangely, lacking \"pop\" on the flavor side. Trotters in Trotters & Escargots were overfried, dry and tasteless. Escargot were completely lost in this dish. Grilled Octopus were tough, tasteless and, again, this dish had nothing to define it. My pork chop, to be cooked medium rare, was overdone. No matter the source of the pork, if it's overdone, the quality will not save it. Same here.   My wife had the Peanut Oil Whitefish.  She loved it. I gave it an OK. She also found the trotters and octopus good.  We agreed the sheer number of ingredients in each dish is way overkill. This certainly contributed to the lack of definition and focus.  Also, we had 7:45 reservation on a very busy Friday night. Service was prompt but it seemed the kitchen must have been pushing really hard to get these creative and unnecessarily complex compositions out.  The (really) bad: Despite making reservations more than 24 hours in advance, we were seated at a two-top table that sits open in the midst of the main (side) dining room. I believe there are 3 of theses tables and they should definitely be saved only for walk-ins if not removed altogether. They are isolated from the ambiance while at the same time being smack in the middle of the traffic patterns. Ugh. Fortunately, Kevin was able to move us to a far better table a couple steps away. Host was completely indifferent to our dissatisfaction. Heritage may have eked 2 stars out of me if we had been forced into what would have been a very abbreviated dinner at that table.   TIP: if you have read the menus online, be sure to READ YOUR MENU at the restaurant because your dinner menu will appear the same but will be different. Neither good nor bad.  Just be aware.  Of course Heritage is a great addition to Madison dining. I am sure it will have a long and improving run. We will be back soon, likely not on a weekend, to check on the food. And PLEASE, not those tables for us!"}
{"text":"Spirit master Clint will blow your mind (and taste buds) with his expert infusions.  Try the Heritage Punch or Templeton's Orchard.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ambiance is wonderful, food is tasty and surprising. Cocktails are unique, inventive and usually on the strong side. Never fails to impress out of town guests from the big city. Servers are helpful and usually perform with alacrity. My only downside is that it can get loud, and a bit hard to hear conversations at the table. Not enough to keep me away though. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were really well done. We split the small plates; I definitely recommend the suckling porchetta and the tuna/pork belly/foie gras"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch a few times and dinner once, and each visit has been fantastic. At dinner last night, I had the beef short rib and it was INCREDIBLE. Like, probably among the top five pieces of meat I've ever had. It was amazingly tender and literally fell off the bone. I didn't have a drink, but the people I was with had the house punch (I think). I had a sip and it tasted like juice - but boozy, delicious, fresh-squeezed, fancy juice bar quality juice. Yum.  Dinner isn't cheap, but very worth it; brunch prices are pretty average. Very friendly service. Overall, a great spot in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Wow, could have been one of the best meals I have had in 2014!   Perfect combination of flavors, textures, seasonal selections.  Great bartender and outstanding and well executed cocktail menu.  Server said the whitefish we had Tuesday was caught on Saturday -- so fresh and layered with multiple flavors.   Roasted beet and pear starter could have been served in the best restaurant in N.Y.   Love the use of Mac nuts and Asian flavors throughout menu.  Smart to partner with Batch bread on bread.  Flourless chocolate cake was outstanding and generous portion.  Chef came out and thanked us for our small group business -- totally not expected.  This is easily the best restaurant in Madison, though still love Forequarter. No wonder it was jammed on Tuesday night.   Well done, Heritage -- will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and enjoyed great food and really good service from our server Anne. Heritage always does their best to use local products. So this means that the vegetable omelette this time of year still features fall vegetables such as carrots, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, etc.   Easy to make reservations on Yelp."}
{"text":"I only came for drinks, but I really enjoyed my time here! The cocktails are really fancy, and we didn't know what a lot of the ingredients were but the bartender clearly explained the drinks, what was in them, and what kind of flavors to expect. Then he asked me what kind of drinks I liked, and prepared a drink for me that wasn't on the menu! He was a lot of fun and made us feel at home there. My friend got Newton's Folly, which tasted like spiced apples and was reminiscent of a nice fall day. I want to come back to try the food, since I have only heard good things!"}
{"text":"They have the best happy hour menu in Madison. The service is fantastic and the cocktails are always perfectly done and visually appealing. So many amazing dishes and I've never been disappointed! I tend to head over on cold winter evenings. It's just a cozy feeling and comfortable atmosphere when you sit around the bar."}
{"text":"Checked out Daniel Fox's new Heritage Tavern last night.  My husband and I ordered the charcuterie platter, pork belly with tuna tartare, and the peanut-oil fried snapper.  The snapper was the standout of the night - the flavors were AMAZING, and the fish was perfectly cooked.  The charcuterie platter was wonderful, but we thought it would have been better if we had more people - the pate and pot of meat were very rich, and a little too much for just the two of us.  The proscuitto-wrapped melon rinds were lovely, and the sausage was melt-in-your mouth.  The pork belly and tuna tartare were also very good, but again, the snapper outdid them both.  We finished with the apple cake, which had a lovely sauce, but otherwise wasn't too special.  The server recommended a lovely reisling for me, and my husband had a nice pinot noir.  We will come back!!"}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite restaurant in Madison.  I have now been here several times. Both in large groups or for a quiet date. Late evening or early for a drink. And have always been happy.  I particularly love the family style dishes. I had the pork, the Thai style fish and when it was still on the menu the lamb. And all of them are consistently delicious. The slow roasted meat is fall apart perfect: tender, unctuous, crispy on the outside, savory and comes with great sides and sauces. Particularly impressive is the ssamjang dipping sauce, even more when spread on the lettuce and wrapped around a couple of bites of tender slow roasted pork. The Thai style fish is also delicious: fried whole and served over a bed of vegetables and rice cooked with a coconut sauce. And a bit of deliciously poached lobster too.  On the small plates, I love the vegetables: the beet salad and the Brussels sprouts are my favorites. The pork belly is also delicious. The tempura is a bit of a disappointment. It is good, particularly the sauces, but compared to the rest of the menu a bit underwhelming and while the coating is always perfectly crispy, I more than once had a tempura bite that was just a tad undercooked. The deviled eggs of course are their thing and definitely recommended for large  groups.  Another favorite dish of mine is the burger. It is now in the bar snack menu and it is really worth ordering. I think it might be the best gourmet burger in Madison. It comes with a side salad not fries, which I really appreciate.  Service is always pretty much impeccable and great care is take in taking care of any issue that might arise. For example one night the family style pork came with no head cheese. When we asked about it, they brought us a platter of headcheese with mushrooms and cheesy grits.  Will keep coming back. And recommend you do too maybe with a group of foodie friends."}
{"text":"This is such a lovely spot - warm interior and attentive staff.  It is one of the only places in Madison that carries Few Bourbon Whiskey, so I instantly loved it.  The menu covers all of the bases - excellent options for all diets.  I highly recommend stopping by and settling in for an evening of catching up with friends."}
{"text":"The beet salad was outstanding and the burger the best I have had in a long time. Ann our server was very friendly and helpful!  Nice atmosphere !"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, service is great and the plating of the food is top noch. I think I am in the minority because the place was busy but I thought the menu was limited and the food was just OK. It might just be to fancy for my taste. I also thought the prices were steep but sometimes you need to pay for the art of the food."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about trying escargot, this is probably a great place to do it. On Saturday, I came to the Heritage with family and ate escargot (with much trepidation) for the first time ever, and was not actually traumatized. They make it extremely non-intimidating and actually appetizing - so I guess it's clear now why it's a French delicacy.  Moving past my introduction to escargot, Heritage Tavern is gorgeous, classy, and cozy. The restaurant feels romantic and fancy and would definitely be a great spot for a date. The menu is priced on the more expensive end, but with the high-quality ingredients, excellent drinks, posh surrounding, and creative and delicious plates it is worth every penny.   We ended up just ordering drinks and appetizers to share: The crispy headcheese and escargot, tempura bacon-wrapped cheese curds, a charcuterie plate with three types of cheeses and three types of meat, and finally a killer white chocolate mousse. Everything was excellent, but the highlights for me were the Old Fashioned and the white chocolate mousse. The only thing I didn't absolutely love was the chicken liver and foie gras mousse we ordered with our charcuterie plate - it was a little too thick and the accompanying jam too sweet for my taste.   I would absolutely recommend this restaurant for drinks, small shared plates, or dinner. It seems like a great place to stop by with friends for a cocktail after work, as well."}
{"text":"Best in MSN! Everything is done with so much thought and care! Great staff awesome drinks. Literally never had a bad menu!"}
{"text":"Dear Chef Fox,  You make my belly happy, oh, so very happy. So happy in fact I have a belly crush on you. That's right a belly crush. I love your food so much I felt that this review deserved a different format than all the others-a belly love letter. Your restaurant is a lovely space that is somehow upscale without being pretentious. It is warm and inviting and I want to sit there all evening. The cocktails are unique and while there is a large selection, I always find myself drawn to the Bootlegger Manhattan. Oh that market cherry. So simple. So divine.   I don't even know where to start for the food. Everything I have had-brunch or dinner has been outstanding. As my boyfriend so eloquently put it \"every subsequent meal I have at Heritage is the best meal I've ever had in Madison.\" How you continue to out-do yourself is beyond me. You don't cheat us during Restaurant Week. Even little tastes at Yum Yum Fest, amazing.   Yes the service is spotty. I don't care. I want your food in my belly. Like I said, I have a big ole belly crush on you. The flavor combinations you come up with are just incredible. I can't wait to try them all. And I do in fact, have every intention of making my way through your entire menu.   Yours truly, my belly"}
{"text":"Heritage Tavern definitely lived up to a 5 star rating.  We LOVED the tempura bacon wrapped cheese curds as an appetizer.  We could tell the bacon was super high quality and had SO much flavor.  And it was fun that it was served with three dipping sauces - my favorite was the buttermilk one as I think it went best with the cheese curds.  My husband ordered the Braised Lamb Shank special which he thought was incredible besides a little more fat on it than he would have liked.  I had the Peanut Oil fried white fish...it took me back to Thailand with his flavors of coconut and red curry - so good!  The portions were perfect on the entrees in our opinion.  Our waitress was fantastic and really knew her stuff.  The ambiance was great too, a little loud, but we loved the unique decor and cozy feel.  Parking is convenient right across the street in the garage.  We would certainly come back!"}
{"text":"Fried. poached. eggs. I don't know how they do it, but I want the recipe! I have only been here for brunch and it may very well have been the best breakfast I've ever had. I went with the Wagyu Steak and Frites. It was cooked to perfection and the aioli was just on point.  Great service and affordable. I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey.. but fucking worth it. This resturaunt has a special chef who is creating a culinary experience I feel ia worth checking out. This place could be in the Manhattan, Brooklyn, wherever... and would do well. I experienced the porkbelky with pickled mango and pineapple and it was a magnificent blend of complimentry flavors! My main dosh was the steak over puree butternut squash and shredded brussel sprouts.. that was so delicious, I'm recalling my meal from 2 months ago from memory! Lol mmm keep up the good work Chef. (Pigs are from his farm!! Gotta love that)"}
{"text":"Best beet salad ever - never a disappointment at Heritage"}
{"text":"Looking for a delicious and unique meal in Madison? Heritage Tavern is pretty darn good with a cool & trendy, but slightly upscale atmosphere, wonderful service (our server was pretty aloof but the rest of the staff was phenomenal and on point) and some good local beer selections.   We started with their half dozen deviled eggs ($9) and they were so uncommon that that made half the fun of eating them. One was a fried rice deviled egg soaked in soy sauce and topped with what you guess it would be. Another was pork rillette. breaded on the outside and full of piggy goodness on the inside. Finally, there was a miso egg all Japanese out and wonderful! These deviled egg flavors change from time to time but we sure hit some winners! As a deviled egg connoisseur, I approve.  Our other eatings of the evening -  Head Cheese & Escargot over creamed grits ($12) - heh. Head cheese. heh. My buddies loved this dish but sadly I could not partake due to the shellfish. Stupid late in life food allergies. I know your delectable taste but never again will your sea-ness caress my lips. Tempura Bacon Wrapped Cheese Curds ($12) - I loved this take on cheese curds! The homies and I had this pact to get cheese curds at each food spot we hit up in The Land of Cheeseheads. Not only were these overindulgent cheese curds wrapped in bacon to make them more beastly, but they came with three different sauces to dip them into. I love having options so enjoyed that. Plus this dish came with deep fried tempura sweet potato, too, to semi balance out the unhealthiness going on. Mushroom Gnocci - ($15) - One of their rotating pasta dishes and man was this creamy, full of fresh veggies and just downright delightful.  Aside from the great food, Heritage Tavern had a full beer & wine menu, as well as some tasty sounding cocktails. I had a couple beers that were slightly over priced but one came out in a kick@$$ holder for the glass which gave me pseudo good feelings of being cool.  Ending 2015 on a high note with a road trip to Madison was fun and ending Yelp 2015 with a five star review leaves me happy! Yay Heritage Tavern!"}
{"text":"I only came here for cocktails, so I can't speak to the food. We ordered 4 cocktails in total. The first 3 we ordered off the menu (a watermelon fizz thing, a whiskey based drink, and one with berries). All of these were so sweet they were almost unpalatable. My date asked to send back the watermelon one after a sip (to be fair the bar tender was extremely accommodating).For the last drink we ordered a gin martini. The martini was pretty good, the bar tenders were friendly, and the atmosphere was pleasant.  However the sickeningly sweet cocktails really reduced my desire to return."}
{"text":"Top notch -- wonderfully friendly and thoughtful service, excellent cocktails, and great food. Stylish but comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails and gourmet food! The bartenders were generous with the liquor, and it's a wonderful experience just watching them preparing the cocktails. Had crispy pork belly, foie gras and black-fin tuna. Super delicious! Foie gras was a little overcooked from my point of view as it's not \"melting\" in my mouth, but still the combination of these three made it a outstanding dish. Ordered the bacon-wrapped  cheese curds out of curiosity. The sauces were tasty, though I still prefer the original cheese curds... A little pricey for \"tavern\", but the food and drink worth every penny.  Adding pics..."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch with my husband this weekend. Even though the downtown area was busy with the Farmers Market, we got to sit outside and was waited on right away. I had a champagne gin cocktail, my husband had a negroni with rhubarb. For for we got the eggs Benedict and I got the waygu skirt steak that came with deep fried runny eggs, fries and a salad. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Our entire experience was perfect, from start to finish!  We were in town for the weekend for Great Taste of the Midwest.  I made a reservation that Friday afternoon for 6:30- shocked there was a spot for us.  Hostess was great and we were seated right away, waters were given right away and our servers came over to introduce themselves and went over the menu with us.  Super knowledgeable and gave great drink recommendations.  Cocktails were amazing and you could tell that a lot of time went into the planning of that menu- so much detail! My husband and I ordered several small plates to try and share and each one was just incredible-again, so much attention to detail.  The plates came out timed perfectly and the servers were amazing about clearing and replacing used silverware and plates.  After all the plates and cocktails, the bill was extremely affordable, given the amazing service and quality of food and beverage that we received.  It was so good, we took our friends for Dinner that following night because we wanted them to try it! We will be back the next time we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place kills. The geese curds are insane. Order an extra side of the truffles fish sauce for whatever you get. Bar menu is my favorite id encourage you to eat here instead of table"}
{"text":"The location is good, and cocktails are great. The food itself is alright. I also find it to be a bit on the pricey side for Madison."}
{"text":"I'm going to add a needed addendum to this review, and make sure that you, Yelp reader, are aware that Heritage also does brunch. Not only do they do brunch, but they do it as awesome as all of the other Madison favorites. We went pretty all out with our selections, and these were the highlights:  - An amazing breakfast sandwich. It only had egg, cheese, and greens on it (although the menu gave these descriptions much better; I'm just being blunt), but my lord did everything just meld together so well. Also, it was on such good bread as well. My girlfriend, who keeps a good log of Madison breakfast sandwiches, says this is her favorite. -The veggie benedict was also stellar, and one i'd recommend for anyone who's a fan of that style of dish. - The house croissant is comparable in quality to all of the other baked goodies you'll find downtown or at the Farmer's Market. - The cocktails are interesting too. They aren't really like what you'll find at other brunch spots, so it's well worth trying any that sound appealing.  I'll definitely be back for Heritage's brunch, as well as their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this review only reflects one brunch and will need some revision after a second visit. I was pretty eager to try out Heritage after moving back to town. We went for brunch and I had the maple lamb sausage with rosti and fried poached eggs. I admittedly wiped the plate clean but felt unsatisfied and have tried to pinpoint why. Everything on the plate was interesting, from the eggs to the sausage to the savory French toast. But there were too many stars and not enough supporting acts. The result was that the dish smacked of too many competing seasonings and flavors. Everything was incredibly over-salted, even the salad dressing (which I thought would cut everything else, but unfortunately it didn't). And I'm a huge fan of salt -- I'd asked for it before taking my first bite because I find it preposterous when restaurants presume they've seasoned the food perfectly and you shouldn't dare alter it in any way. Plus, any brunch place should have salt so you can salt your egg as soon as you pierce the yolk. I digress. In any event, I think the dish would've succeeded if the French toast had been sweet to offset the onslaught of savory. But I'll be back to try some other menus, just in case this was a fluke.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the waitstaff professional."}
{"text":"unique dining and adult beverage options. portions are large with unexpected combinations,  service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I immediately liked the vibe at Heritage Tavern.  It helped that it was a beautiful night so the town was buzzing.  We had the tuna and pork belly which was a nice match for my husband and I bc I like the tuna and he likes the foie gras and pork belly.  The peaches were a delicious accompaniment.  We also shared the mushroom risotto which had some truffle tinges that I don't think were mentioned on the menu bc truffle is not my favorite so we may not have ordered?  It wasn't too heavy on the truffle though.  Lastly, we shared the schnitzel and we both liked it but the sausage that it came with was not our favorite...great spaetzel though."}
{"text":"Space: decoration very cute. Not super upscale or anything but nice for a date.   Staff: very nice, willing to make suggestions, not overbearing   Food: expensive. Few vegetarian options but from their seasonal menu, willing to make changes to food as I requested. I loved my gnocchi, which was completely vegetarian to start with. One of my boyfriend's favorite dishes as well, although he also ordered pork  Drink: I got the cucumber Benedict or something - very tasty and refreshing!   Overall, good date night spot!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this restaurant but unfortunately will probably not be back.  We had the pork belly and tuna appetizer, and it was a complete waste of $19. The pork belly we got was just mushy fat, with a tiny bit of actual pork belly in it. Server didn't come back until we were done, so didn't have an opportunity to send it back.   I had the sea bass, which was very flavorful, particularly the broth in which it was served, and the fresh peas with it were wonderful. Husband had the steak, and ordered it medium rare, but it was rare.  I tried a bite and it was under seasoned.  I did request a brandy old fashioned sweet, which was the best part of the meal.  The bread and honey butter was also good.  Service was just ok, not as good as I'd expect for the price point. Food was VERY slow in coming out."}
{"text":"This ranks among my top 3 favorite restaurants in Madison for good reasons:  Quality food, nice environment, incredible servers and a caring owner.  The meat is local, and there is so much effort put into menu choices. The drinks are magic, but pricy. When people complain we don't have good local restaurants, I send them here or the Alchemy.  Great for brunch.  If you don't have a reservation, consider going to the bar and ordering, while watching local hipsters flirt."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations during Restaurant Week. Timely, attentive service.  Great meal with ample portions."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Madison! It had amazing cocktails, wonderful staff and bartenders. The food is just yummy! We've been here quite a few times now, and each time we have left impressed. The one day I felt like the good could have been a little more impressive, they apologized and gave us a gift card. We were so surprised, because we only hinted at it, not really criticized. All in all, a great place."}
{"text":"One of the best places in town.  Highly recommend any of the pork dishes since they are from the chef's farm."}
{"text":"Food was great, decor is really nice. Falls a little short of pig in a fur coat and forequarter in my opinion. I wasn't wild about the menu, and the service was pretty slow. At least we finally have a place that takes reservations though..."}
{"text":"Sort of a five member family reunion. Had deviled eggs, and head cheese with pig trotters for appetizers. These were all fabulous. We had gnocchi with octopus, and duck breast. This was truly fine dining. Portions are small, but prices are more than fair, and quality and service were superb. Looking for an adventure In fine dining? Here is the place."}
{"text":"Last minute choice because our first choices had very long wait times and my coworkers were hungry! We were met by 2 of the most friendly hostesses and seated quickly.  At first glance the menu was daunting and honestly none of us knew what to order.  Our waiter came over and introduced himself and went over the specials for the day.  I was down to the chicken (safe choice) and the special Tomahawk pork chop.  I decided to go with option 2, and boy am I glad I did!! It was the most moist tender tasty cut of meat I've had in a long while!  It had a nice smoky flavour.  It came with spaeztle(? Prob spelled it wrong) which tasted like gnocchi but not.  Perfect meal!! Before I forget, the meal came with fresh baked bread and butter and pickled crux d'tee (excuse the spelling).  I could've just eaten that it was so good! The pickled veggies had a sweet but hard bite to them... I wished I could take them home!  Overall, the service and food were perfect!  If you are looking for something different try this place!  (BTW- they have a pig dish for 110$, I would've ordered but no one else wanted it But the couple next to us ordered it and it was literally a cooked pigs head.  It actually looked good, but maybe next time)"}
{"text":"Came here with my parents and grandma and we all loved it. Our server was extraordinarily friendly and knowledgeable and he gave good recommendations. We split the bacon wrapped cheese curds to start which came with tempura sweet potatoes and three different sauces. It was very tasty and great to give a taste of Madison to my out of town family. On the servers recommendation my mom got the salmon and my grandma got the pork belly and tuna small plate. Both were delicious. My dad and I got gnocchi and while tasty we were slightly disappointed with the serving size. It wasn't much bigger than the small plates and we were both left a bit hungry. Overall great, fresh food and kind servers but we could have used a bit more food."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp didn't have a rating system.  Heritage Tavern is an excellent establishment, but for me personally it was just okay.  Maybe I just wasn't feeling the atmosphere.    I went there as a four top and despite having made reservations, there was some wait for our table.  Their bar was super crowded, which made standing around holding onto our coats and not bumping into people super awkward.  I found the bartenders incredibly attentive though.  Despite the crowded bar, one of the bartenders saw us enter the bar area and immediately made eye contact and asked if we wanted drink menus, despite us not being right up at the bar.    Their drinks were yummy and well made.    Unfortunately, the dining area was also small and crowded and it took some work to get seated and around the waiters.  It was also too loud for me as I had trouble hearing my fellow diners across the table.    We had the deviled eggs, charcuterie, pork belly with tuna sashimi, grilled octopus salad, ribeye, and whitefish.  We shared everything so we were able to sample lots of different things.  We enjoyed the creativity with the deviled eggs, but we found the eggs themselves rubbery.  The charcuterie was good but I prefer Osteria Papavero's charcuterie plate.  My fellow diners loved the wagyu ribeye best, but I personally perferred the sweet and saltiness of the pork belly.  I found the tuna sashimi with the pork belly unnecessary though and would've preferred they made the pork belly a larger portion and made it into an entree dish.   In summary, it was evident there was care and attention to each dish, but there just wasn't anything in particular that made a strong impression on me."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  World's best Bloody Mary's are served here.  This is my favorite Sunday brunch venue.  The eggs are fantastic and there are creative scramble combos, e.g., lobster and eggs.  This visit, we tried a cinnamon roll....mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Delicious! We were around and decided to try it out and glad we did! We sat at the bar starting with a cinnamon roll that was very yummy and a mimosa -- all of the drinks they were making looked amazing. I had the breakfast sandwich with the fried zucchini and over easy egg that was awesome. My daughter had the steak and eggs which came with fries and a deep fried poached egg that was really good too! Everything was delicious and fresh, paired with great service. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about chef Dan and his staff! The food was indeed James beard worthy as advertised!  Perfection, attention to detail and flavor profiles that match one another who could ask for more?  Oh and did I mention his plating? Perfect. My pork schnitzel was cooked exactly as it should be , tender and crisp. Placed on top of the spaetzle that was tender and flavorful.  His risotto made my husband want more and he hates fresh peas!  I can't recommend this place enough. If I am ever in Madison again I will be at this restaurant, guaranteed!  if you live within 100 miles get there it is worth it!   Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Ambiance, food and service was super duper. Thank you for a lovely dining experience. Would definitely return the next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"Love this place! We came late around 11pm for some late night cravings and the bar had a fabulous menu to choose from! We ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup and nearly fell to the floor when it was served! The Brioche bread and the gourmet cheeses were amazing together! Thick and buttery and melting on the plate and in your mouth.  And the creamy tomato soup garnished perfectly, was to die for! The atmosphere was warm and inviting.  The lush woodwork and perfect lighting lent itself to a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and ambiance. Great service as well, even on a busy Friday night. A lot of very unique options on the menu and my girlfriend and I both really enjoyed our meals and cocktails. Definitely hope to be back. Perfect place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"One of my best friends was graduating from UW Law School and a few of use decided to come here for a celebratory bunch. I honestly don't know where to begin as it was all so amazing. We'll start off with the Bloody Mary. I have very high standards for my Bloody, Heritage Tavern set the new standard for me. The mix was hand crafted in house and absolutely the perfect blend of spices and tomato juice. The garnishes, I can't even remember all of them, but they were just what I needed to hold me over until my Eggs Benedict arrived.  Sometimes I worry about ordering a dish with poaches eggs as busy restaurants can tend to mess up. Definitely don't have anything to worry about here. These were the best Eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. Words just can't describe how delicious they were."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast and found some spots along the bar. Everyone enjoyed their food and drinks and the ham sandwiches looked incredible. I had a coffee and donuts with a chocolate expresso ganache.   Good environment, good food, I'd love to stop by again and check it out for dinner."}
{"text":"Very nice place. I had the Hazelnut French toast and it was fantastic. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because they did not have flavoring for the coffee."}
{"text":"earned 5 stars again. Sat at bar. I give very few. This place exudes chef caring food and hand crafted drinks. It's in Madison so the scene is muted. Even better as I travel to many large cities that have great venues over run. Tonight they had lions mane mushrooms with spinach. It was Devine. I also had head cheese and fresh cherry tomatoes. It's the end of the season in WI. Their drinks are inventive and the dessert was great. A deconstructed brandy (it is Wisconsin) Alexander. I'll bring a group back tomorrow evening. A consistent performer."}
{"text":"Given our experience at heritage, it's hard to imagine anyone had a bad experience.   The deviled eggs: two of the three were incredible, but one was a bit too strong on the vinegar.  The tempura: fantastic. Lightly breaded, perfectly done.   The lamb & octopus dish: The best lamb, and I've had good lamb. Tender, lean, juicy. Never thought I'd love octopus with my lamb, but I did.    The cocktails: they are not made by a bartender, but rather by a mixologist- which I thought to be a rather irrelevant distinction until I tried the drinks at heritage. These drinks are definitely worth the price tag- as opposed to the drinks served at bars, which are something I could make at home. We had cocktails, but their wine is supplied by Square Wine Company- a fantastic wine retailer around the corner. If you love what you taste, you can probably pick it up at Square Wine.  The service: we tried Graze first, which had a two hour wait. So we tried Heritage- were seated immediately, and had good service all night long: attentive, but not overbearing.   A restaurant for foodies, but not pretentious at all. I think that's the best part of it."}
{"text":"We have been to Madison a lot and tried a lot of different restaurants. Heritage is clearly one of the best. Not cheap, but you really feel like you get your money's worth. Amazingly complex dishes. Sometimes when restaurants get this complex, you wonder if they are trying too hard. Not here. It really works and they work for their money. I appreciate that in a restaurant. If you are in Madison and you have a special event, you can't beat Heritage"}
{"text":"Recently dined here for brunch with some friends and was disappointed.   I ordered the old fashioned ham cinnamon roll and that was the highlight of the meal. We ordered the lobster scramble, beef sirloin, frites and eggs and the classic benedict. Presentation was beautiful but all the food was very bland and unsatisfying, even their homemade ketchup. No real flavor.   Very cute space. Simplistic, natural vibe.  Maybe that is what they are trying to do with food but it was not working for me.   Server was friendly and the space accommodates groups and families."}
{"text":"Heritage, you did not disappoint, but there are just a few things that hold you back from perfection. I have had the benefit of getting to know you after two visits now. Both times away you left me satisfied and curious about what else you offer, wondering if it would be better than what I just put inside my body.  Upon entering Heritage, you are greeted by a very trendy decor. Heritage is slightly below ground level so it has a sort of old basement feel to it with the splash of exposed brickwork, along with the wood paneling. The furniture, lighting, bar, and chairs all match this feel perfectly. I love the small touches like the fox head cut into the back of all the chairs. For me, the restaurant was perfectly lit. It was dim enough for the atmosphere to be intimate, but it was bright enough to still have your food well lit.  Warning! Due to being underground, getting a cell signal can be dicey. Luckily, Heritage has free Wi-Fi for you social media fiends. You may have to use Wi-Fi to check in while inside.  I started with a glass of a Grenache blend wine, priced at $6. It was quite drinkable for the price, but it wasn't amazingly complex (not expected at that range). I was originally looking at the beer selection but nothing really blew my socks off or seemed interesting. Wine seemed like it would pair better with the cuisine anyways. My wife ended up ordering a Sao Paulo Smash, one of the many craft cocktails. All of the cocktails at Heritage are made by a mixologist and well executed. While I did not appreciate the rose water in the cocktail, I can appreciate the proper execution of this drink.  We ended up starting with one of the charcuterie boards. When you order a charcuterie board you get to decide how many and which items you want on the board. We chose bacon wrapped dates and two cheeses. The board was very well assembled and came with three spreads and some toast. I appreciated the light snack before the main course. The three item board ran us $15.  On a separate visit I had an order of the deep fried cheese curds on my quest to find notable cheese curds in Madison. These cheese curds are NOT traditional in any sense, but they are incredibly well executed and pleasing to eat. The curds are wrapped in bacon and lightly fried in tempura. They are served with three dipping sauces, all of which are very interesting. Heritage has earned a well deserved place on my notable cheese curd list with this menu item! They are fantastic, but do not expect your typical pub curds!  For our entree, we ordered \"family style,\" which is a menu option for 2+ parties. All of the food is on one massive plate, and you pass it around to share it like a family would at home. Cool concept! The typical family style meal includes braised pork, tuna sashimi, lettuce with Asian sauce, fried headcheese, pickled veggies, and something on special (in our case, porcetta). Ordering family style will run you $30 per head.  Every single individual component of our meal was well executed and enjoyable on its own. My main issue with Heritage is an issue of pairing. I didn't really \"get\" why sashimi was being served on top of a roasted pork shoulder. Why? They didn't really go together what so ever. While they were delicious on their own, they didn't complement one another or really go. The entire meal (for the most part) was on a single plate as a mound of food. I do not think food should be served in a giant mound if it isn't all meant to be consumed in a bite that contains all of the components on the dish.  The whole dessert menu was kind of pricey and there were some very interesting items on it (beet ice cream, anyone?). Between the price and the interesting culinary decisions, we were not feeling adventurous.  Our service was very attentive, and I really felt taken care of while at Heritage. I appreciate the well thought out dish descriptions and attentiveness to detail. Our server, Paige, always made sure that we had everything we needed and that our waters were topped off.  The decor, atmosphere, service, and food are all great at Heritage. The beer list definitely leaves me wanting more, but I am satisfied with the wine list. The cocktail list is well assembled and well executed. Unfortunately, the food just seems kind of thrown together and lacks cohesion. I can appreciate individual elements of a dish, but I just can't love the whole package that Heritage offers. Heritage, we can be good friends, but I don't think we're besties yet."}
{"text":"What happened here? Normally wonderful, Heritage made multiple gaffes during our Saturday brunch on 8/8, including: forgetting our order of pickles but charging us, bringing one of the five plates out 10 mins before the others and ice cold, forgetting a side of lamb sausage, and charging an exorbitant price for a small beet salad (we think that there was supposed to be a bakery item with it but no dice.) The whitefish cake & eggs was heavily over-salted as well. Usually Heritage is a winner for both food & service, but not today."}
{"text":"Love this place. They make the best pork belly in madison!! The pork shoulder is also awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Stellar Brunch review coming through!  Must get the Bloody here! I could arguably say it's one, if not the best in Madison. Great flavor, bacon is thick and magically still has this crisp to it even when soaking in the bloody.   Entree awards goes to Smoked Whitefish, Crab, and Bacon Cake, Hazelnut French Toast if you have a sweet tooth, and the Heritage Tavern Benedict (great twist to a classic with frying the eggs and giving a kick to the hollandaise sauce).  Other Honorable mentions to consider is the Old Fashioned Ham and Cheese Omelet and Truffled Egg Gratin (could use a little more truffle).  Save your stomach to complete your meal with the doughnuts & espresso-coffee ganache. Great pair and the slightly bitter ganache levels out the sugary sweet doughnuts.   All-in-all delish and recommend!"}
{"text":"Great design and atmosphere. Wait staff great. Food is pricey for the quality and very limited selection. Definitely not suited for kids under the age of 15. In a group of 5, not a single one of us enjoyed what we got, all very underwhelmed and honestly disappointed. Honestly wouldn't recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Heritage never fails to be amazing! Great food, a wonderful wine list and our server Laura was fantastic."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant in Madison. Heritage Tavern has a unique ambiance and lovely atmosphere. Cocktails are inventive and delicious. Service is top notch. But the food is the main attraction as it should be. My squash lobster soup was to die for, tempura cheese curds wrapped in bacon with truffle dip were the best ones we've had in Wisconsin (yes,even better than at Craftsman and Old fashioned). My octopus was good but I was not blown away. Pork belly with tuna belly and foie gras was the craziest surf and turf we've ever seen on a menu and was simply an explosion of taste. And finally porchetta ended up impressing my spoiled European husband to the point of him admitting that it was the best dish he has ever had anywhere! We are gonna be back SOON!"}
{"text":"Been here for brunch, dinner, and late night and all are extremely good! Brunch has a great menu with a number of specialized benedicts and delicious brunch cocktails.  The dinner menu is always changing but the one thing I'd always recommend is the deviled eggs! I love deviled eggs and they do such a cool spin on them I have to get them every time I go.  For late night, u always go for the burger. Extremely solid and well cooked!  The staff is also extremely nice and do a great job on coursing out your meal if you order multiple small plates and giving drunk recommendations to pair with your meal :)"}
{"text":"I love places that play with the whole tapas concept. You get to try several dishes without breaking the bank or wasting the food if it wasn't to your palette! This place kinda falls in the middle with a good portion of dishes tapas style and the rest typical dinner sized.  Ambiance : Modern and has all the right elements for a fine dining joint. But nothing stands out as it plays safe, which is fine. The place where we sat had a long couch lined up against the wall , split up to accommodate several tables, but you could easily get the vibe of a community dinner if you sat in the front middle :).  Service : Decent, not bad not great. Our server/s took a little longer than expected to kick things off but eventually got the dishes on time. They never bothered to ask how did we find the food/dishes. We were though informed about each dish before being served.  Food : We decided to avoid the larger plates and play around sampling the smaller ones. We ordered Crisp Pork Belly & Black Fin Tuna, Tempura Bacon-Wrapped Cheese Curds, Lobster Mushroom and Foie gras (Forgot the actual name) and for dessert Rhubarb Crisp  The pork belly dish had 3 actors - the pork belly, foie gras and tuna. All three are champions of subtle flavor so although this dish was very tasty, it missed a \"punch or dynamic\" element to balance it.   The cheese curds were our favorite! The combination of bland cheese and salty bacon was spot on! And the trio of dips had a fermented fish sauce which elevated this \"stick\" food to a whole another level!! A must try if you come here!!  The Lobster mushroom dish was our least favorite. The mushrooms were a bit too earthy and hard for our taste. Not to mention the raw flavor did not go well with the otherwise excellent foie gras. And I wasn't a big fan of the sandwich toast bed even though it did absorb the sauce like a sponge to help the flavor when you ate it all together.  Lastly, the dessert was another star for us. We love Elderflower. We love rhubarb. Pair them together and you get sweet dreams!! Yummm  Not perfect, with room for improvement (lobster mushroom no no) but a certainly one of the better joints in the city!"}
{"text":"Wow...how have I not reviewed Heritage?  I have been here a half dozen times for dinner and even more so for drinks and never go home disappointed.   Last night, my girlfriend and our friends brought me here to celebrate my birthday and what is present it was.  This also happens to be restaurant week, here in Madison, and the 3 courses were outstanding.  Our table ordered and shared the following:  First Course Roasted Beet Salad Lamb Tartare Head Cheese & Escargot  All three were solid but I thought the head cheese was out of this world.  Crispy headcheese goodness served over creamy grits.  Unctuous and rich, the meat was balanced by fresh herb and lemon salad.  Second Course Braised Pork Shoulder, Boudin Blanc & Crisp Pork Belly Sturgeon seasoned with winter spices served with mussels, carrots, radishises, and kale chips with a beurre-chestnut emulsion.  (This was an add-on from their RW menu) A side of roasted brussel sprouts served with Humboldt Fog cheese  I am a sucker for all things pig related but the sturgeon took the prize on this one.  It's hard to describe the taste of sturgeon.  It's flesh is white but has a rich undertone that other white fleshed fish have.  Normally priced at $32, I would get this every time I see it on the menu.  It's that good!  Third Course Flourless chocolate cake with espresso-cocoa nib ice cream Warm Future Fruit Apple Strudel  Feel it was a toss up on these two desserts.  Both were well prepared.  The cake being a perfect mix of chocolate and coffee and the strudel enveloped in a flaky butter shell that made you believe you were back eating at Grandma's house.  I am always a skeptic when dining during Restaurant Week.  At times, I feel the restaurants \"dumb down\" their food to bring in new diners looking for a bargain.  Not the case with Heritage.  Top notch food, top notch drinks with a efficient wait staff.  An excellent night."}
{"text":"Nice place, food is great.   Nice place to stop in for a drink before going to the theater next door."}
{"text":"I feel like I just accepted an award because experiencing this restaurant was such a reward and I have so many people to thank.  I'd like to thank Ashley for taking me here. Your beet salad was exceptional, and the dark chocolate made me feel like I was eating a healthy dessert for a meal. I'd like to thank Lucas, our considerate and efficient server who got us our drinks and gave us amazing suggestions. I look forward to sitting at the bar the next time so I could have him as our server again.   We sat at the bar, and we were immediately greeted and given drinks and a menu. Lucas was so attentive and checked up on us frequently, which was such a pleasure seeing how busy the place was. There weren't many dairy free options, so I assumed I'd just have a drink (which was amazing. See attached photo). However, Lucas informed me that Dan Fox would be willing to cook me a special dairy free Wagyu burger (there's cheese mixed into the meat). I was so happy with my burger, and I was even more happy with the experience. Seriously some of the best bar service I've seen.  We had the fries after with some various dips (one spicy, one savory). A bit salty for my taste, but still very delicious. I enjoyed this whole meal so much.  Yes yes yes, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been there, and the second time that I've had to wait 90 minutes  between ordering, and getting our entrees.  The food is great, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food with a sophisticated taste. Knowledgable wait staff. Candied bacon and nuts appetizer was amazing. The Wagyu Chuck was a little dry. Great cocktails."}
{"text":"Thank you Chef Fox for making the only eggs Benedict I have ever truly enjoyed. The vegetable Benedict was awesome, I really enjoyed the fried poached egg with a velvety hollandaise sauce and the rosti was super crispy. Next time, we will come for dinner!"}
{"text":"Heritage Tavern is a gem in Madison and I can't wait to go back! Guests should definitely try the deviled eggs. They were amazing and so creative! Never head deviled eggs with ahi Tuna before, and clearly I have been missing out. The bartenders were fantastic. They take time to make a great drink, not just pouring vodka in a glass and mixing. They know how to make a good cocktail."}
{"text":"Cocktails are superb, but definitely not cheap. They generally have a good selection of beer and the staff is pretty nice. I haven't had their food because it's pretty expensive, but I imagine it's good because it's almost always busy. Definitely a nice place to come get a drink on a date or something."}
{"text":"We went to an cocktail competition here on Sunday, and it was so fun! $15 to try 6 mini (but surprisingly not that mini...) cocktails by local bartenders/mixologists and heavy apps by Heritage Tavern. Proceeds went to charity. I haven't been there before, but I think we'll be back. We had a great time!   The food was awesome! Super good potato salad, delicious and cool deconstructed bibimpbap board, great cured meats, and flavorful Asian-inspired wings. The flow of the event was great, and I really like the decor and space inside. It's warm and inviting without feeling crowded. The hostess was really nice and friendly too. Great service.   The drinks were all really good too! I think one of my favorite drinks was from Heritage bartender, but I can't remember. Regardless, all the drinks were good.   We went with two friends, and it's one of their favorite restaurants. We can see why; can't wait to check out the full menu some day.   I hope they have another event like this in the future!"}
{"text":"Being a total wet blanket here, but Heritage was just another overhyped restaurant in town that completely under-delivered. So disappointing!  Went there for my birthday dinner (nope, they do nothing for your birthday even if they know) and had the charcuterie plate and tempura for apps to start. The charcuterie plate was basically just bread and super bland pate with other bland, boring accoutrements, while the tempura was just drowning in grease and the truffled fish sauce was just inedible.    For entrees, we had the short ribs and the braised pork shank. The short ribs were just a total salt lick and after eating just half of it, my mouth was tore up like how it feels after eating too many chips, and the pork shank was nothing worth even discussing.    Our server just seemed annoyed to be there, and barely performed her job. Nothing good to say about our service overall, except that it was slow and underwhelming.  What a waste of a night, especially a birthday dinner. Don't bother going here!"}
{"text":"Come one, come all to ye Heritage Tavern, where paupers & princes alike dine as kings! You say that the foie gras dish at your local watering hole isn't rich enough for you? Then we will add pork belly & tuna and you will be satisfied, says the Heritage Tavern. You complain that your cocktail only has a dash of bitters? Please come to the Heritage Tavern for a drink composed almost entirely of bitters.  More shaved truffles! More candied bacon!! More Wagyu!!! More everything!!!! Huzzah to the purveyors at the Heritage Tavern for their wacky refinement & delicious excess!"}
{"text":"Delightful, flavorful, creative, a bit strange, surprising, porky- All good descriptors of my recent visit.  I have a hunch that one of their missions is to prove that pork is the king of all the meats.  No need to prove, we all know that's true.  What I tried: Tempra Bacon-Wrapped Cheese Curds- yum, yum, yummy yum yum! Mmmm. Did you get all that? Order this one if you have any love for yourself and those at the table. Crispy Suckling Prochetta- intensely savory, very good porky goodness. I loved the chewy/crispy texture of the prochetta Crisp Pork Belly and Black Fin Tuna Pork Schnitzel and Knockwurst- I'm a sucker for a schnitzel and some spaetzle. This was a winner! Opera Cake- coffee-rrific! Can't go wrong with an opera cake Caramel Profiteroles- Huge! you get 3 giant profiteroles with a big scoops of ice cream on each. It's a really good dessert to share.  Also, the cocktail menu is very interesting. They have some combinations I've never seen before. I tried one that was just like drinking a glass of bitters. I love bitters, so I thought it was amazing.  The wait staff was very helpful and kept my water glass full the entire meal, and we were there for a good 2 hours. Top marks!   Somewhat unrelated, I love that you can make reservations through Yelp. So convenient!"}
{"text":"The quality has definitely fallen off for this restaurant. Everything is way over priced and portions are small. I had the bouillabaisse (salty, cheap fish). My friend had the strip steak (chewy and not cooked to temperature). The $14 dessert recommended by our server was mealy, dry and the ice cream was tasteless. Even my martini was poor. I'd advise going somewhere else especially because of the high cost."}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  If this were based only upon my experience, it would be a four star review.  But, my husband had the Wagyu steak (tri tip?)--it was delivered medium rare as requested--but really chewy and not much flavor--no juices from the steak to flavor the vegetables--all for $30-some dollars for his entree alone.  The steak was a one- or two-star event.  He left hungry.  Got a Frosty from Wendy's on the way home.  From high-brow to low-brow . . . .  My ham sandwich was really good and the market greens salad was too.  The maraschino cherry in my brandy old fashioned was amazing.  It was not an ordinary maraschino cherry--in a good way, had a strong cherry soda flavor--I would like my own jar for home.  We'll give Heritage another try because the ambiance is great.  Service was good.  And we received our \"gift from the kitchen\" of a bread basket that was carefully explained (like a previous review noted) and that was a trifle odd in an eye-rolling kind of way."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, but very slow. For example, I waited 15 mins for a gin and tonic while THREE bartenders were talking to friends and not making a single drink. Our server was apologetic. We orders an appitizer that never arrived. My husband's shnitzel was on the verge of being burnt on the outside but pink on the inside. His sausage was also under cooked. My ancient grain and chili dish was cold. We waited another 15 mins after requesting our bill to actually receive our bill. $75 + tip for two drinks and two entrees! Hopefully the staff and cooks get it together with some more practice soon."}
{"text":"Moved to Madison about four months ago and still on the hunt for a good go-to brunch place within walking distance of my house. I've seen photos of Heritage Taverns food all over Instagram and was very excited to try it! So I called to make a reservation for Saturday morning. Upon walking in I was blown away by the decor. It is super cute in there.. from the holiday themed entry way to the antler beer taps. The hostess seated us right away, but it took at least 7 minutes for our server to address us (wasn't too busy), which is always kind of frustrating when they walk past you five times and don't acknowledge you or say \"I'll be with you shortly\". He was very friendly once he finally came over, and gave me a sample of their Bloody Mary mix to try.   I ordered the beef sirloin, frites, and eggs. The sirloin seemed decent quality, but the rest of the dish was pretty lackluster. Nothing really had much flavor.. the fries seemed bland, and didn't seem like an appropriate pairing with the rest of the dish. The fried poached egg was over-cooked, and the hollandaise lacked any flavor profile as well. It seemed strange because the presentation was beautiful, but the meal was overly pretty bland. My friends felt the same way about their dishes (lobster scramble and tavern Benedict) It could be that this restaurant is aiming for an overly simplistic menu but I wasn't blown away. All in all, this place has a great atmosphere and other things on their menu intrigue me, but it wouldn't be my first recommendation."}
{"text":"I've only been here for their late night menu. 10-1am. It's a perfect end to a long day of working a later shift at the hospital.  Their Waygu burger is a steal for just 12 dollars. Every bite is better than the last. I don't even know how that is possible but more flavors kept presenting themselves as I ate the burger.  The Tempura Spicy Roll is a awesome alternative to your normal sushi. It is served warm which is a nice change of pace. The sauces they give you are delish. Forget soy sauce why would you want to cover a masterpiece with that!? Fried perfection, but with the fish and rice sorta healthy right?   Their poutine is fatty goodness. However not one of my favorites on the menu. With their other items displaying a lot more dimension this fell short a little for me on flavor.  Their cocktails are very creative and some are entertaining to watch while they are being made. One where the herb is dipped in alcohol lit on fire several times to bring it's flavor into the drink. My only complaint is that they are a little bit on the pricier side. Running about 10-12 each.  I'll have to make it out for their regular dinner menu some time."}
{"text":"A boyfriend and I came here several months ago. The service was excellent. We loved the tempura cheese curds and the dipping sauces to accompany them were delicious. We both really enjoyed are drinks and were feeling pretty darn good after just a single. We also ordered the lab tar-tar but neither of us really enjoyed this. The plate was displayed well but perhaps just not our style"}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Madison.  I don't want to understate this, every meal I've had there has been a top dining experience. Every dish I've had causes me to stop mid bite and moan.  The small plates are all delicious and one of a kind. Anything with there Heritage pork in it that they raise themselves is something you'll be talking about for day's.   Also the late night bar menu with their burger or their ham sandwich will make you slap yourself"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food.  Cool atmosphere. Not cheap.    Highly recommend the meat and cheese boards and Apple and Jicama salad."}
{"text":"The chef and staff at Heritage know whatever alchemy it is that makes a dish more than the sum of its parts, and they know it so well that they turn food into divinity. The tuna and pork belly small plate is one of the best things I've ever eaten every time I get it. And then there's the schnitzel, and the savory French toast (at brunch), both of which are meal-sized plates that are so delicious they should not be allowed."}
{"text":"This review is for brunch only.   My two friends and I arrived around 12pm on a Saturday for brunch, which apparently the restaurant has just started offering because the place was DEAD despite being a block from the Farmer's Market and having outdoor seating. I'll be honest that the main reason we stopped was the restaurant had outdoor seating in the shade, but I'm glad that we did.   The brunch menu isn't too big but again, it sounds like they just started offering brunch. Approximately 8 entrees, 3 salads, 5 sides (toast, cinnamon roll). Everything sounded pretty yummy but also pretty typical for a $18-$30 dinner place, if that makes sense. I mean, eggs benedict, of course -- just with their special flair. French toast, crab cakes, etc. -- all moderately high end entrees with a special touch, but nothing on the menu that made me say \"wow, I've never heard of that before.\" I opted for the \"market eggs benedict\" (I think that was the name) and was really, really pleased. Delicious english muffins (I could taste the butter), wilted spinach (but not so much that it made the dish bitter), a very generous portion of roast pork, two perfectly poached eggs, and creamy hollandaise sauce with a twist. The dish looked beautiful, it tasted great, and it was hearty -- I didn't leave wishing that I'd also ordered a side.   My friends got mixed drinks and I got a honey ace cider -- also very good. They have four ciders, three morning cocktails, and a large wine selection on their brunch menu, which was great.   The service was good. Not amazing, but there wasn't any point where I was looking around for my server and bugged they weren't there. I asked our server what her favorite thing on the menu was and she said since they just started serving it, she hadn't had much, which was a little surprising -- you'd think the restaurant would give them a preview so that they could make recommendations.   The brunch definitely made me want to go back for dinner, but when I looked at the dinner menu, it looks a bit pricey. Brunch was definitely much more reasonable and seems like a good way to get a taste of the menu without breaking the bank.   I only stepped inside to use the restroom but the interior is beautiful -- it made me want to come back and have a drink at the bar.  Overall, I would definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"I've been waiting with bated breath for Dan Fox's new venture to open up and it does not disappoint. A fan since his days at the Madison Club (my boss is s member), I have long thought him to be the best Chef in Madison. My opinion has not changed.  My bride and I made our first trip to Heritage on the Saturday of Homecoming weekend with another couple--it was more than a little busy that evening, even at eight p.m.  We started with cocktails and wine.  That is to say, I had a cocktail while everyone else decided it would be safer not to mix alcohols. I stand by my decision.  Grandpa Jim's martini is excellent, the lemon oil and riesling complement and contrast the oily (in a good way) texture of the St. George Terroir Gin.   Octopus on the menu? I will order it 100% of the time. The plate of perfectly cooked octopus was accompanied by crispy prosciutto and some of the most wonderful fried calamari I have encountered in some time. We also tried the roasted beet salad. Typical fare until you add confit of figs and shave dark chocolate on top.   I was intrigued by the notion of the chocolate when we ordered the salad, but it still caught me off guard when I tasted it: revelatory.  We could not help ourselves but to order one of the family style entrees for four. The kitchen was out of lamb for the night, so our roasted lamb leg turned into roasted goat shoulder with tuna sashimi, roasted potatoes in mornay sauce, and bibb lettuce leaves.  I will talk about this dinner to anyone who will listen. It may easily be one of the two best meals I've had in Madison in the last 13 years.  Bravo to Dan Fox and the Heritage team for opening my favorite restaurant in town. Tears for opening months before I move to more northerly climes...  A note about the interior of the restaurant. It is wildly changed from its time as Kitchen or Cafe Montmartre (I suppose a \"total loss\" fire will do that), and it is GORGEOUS. My only complaint, to the extent it is even a complaint--the restaurant is very loud. But that likely means you have a lot of happy, talkative diners.  Magnificent."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast. Five of us dined at Heritage for brunch and we all loved it.   The atmosphere is casual and non-touristy and non-collegy. The waitress was prompt and helpful and the food and drinks came out in good time.   The food was delicious. Eggs Benedict cooked perfectly, hazelnut vanilla french toast was amazing, mimosas were great. We left stuffed and happy.   The next day we went somewhere else for brunch that was disappointing, and we regretted not going back to Heritage for another awesome meal."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines day, and was highly impressed! The atmosphere was really pretty, and service was also great. They had a special Valentines menu, and the food was beautifully presented and tasted absolutely amazing. I don't usually drink, but their cocktail menu was so tempting that I couldn't resist - can't remember the names of the drinks, plus the menu has already changed.   Strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had heard so much about the brunch we had to give things another try. And so much better of an experience this time around! Service was great, and food was fantastic. The biscuits and gravy were out of this world-- ham bits in the gravy were perfect and the biscuit was just a bit on the hard side before gravy, making it perfect (and not soggy at all) with addition of gravy. I had the ham and cheese omelet which was similarly amazing. Maybe we'll have to give dinner another try, because we had a much better experience this time around!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. Based on Chad's review, this was on our list. As usual he was spot on!  Thx Chad.  Good wine and beer selection. Food is the star though. We shared three dishes:  freaking amazing deviled eggs. Very creative and omg taste. Also tried cheese curds. Also top notch. Star of the show was the schnitzel. One of the most flavorful pieces of pork ever!  Loved every bite.  Only negative for us was server seemed to think we had never dined out before and explained what spaetzle was, and pointed way to close to our food for our comfort. Some may like that style but it was off-putting for me. I believe its better to ask \"have you ever had x, Y or Z\" before rather than assume your customer is a pendejo.  Other than that we really enjoyed out meal.   Place is upscale so dress accordingly."}
{"text":"We had ANOTHER fantastic experience at Heritage!  Amazing food that is very unique but not too off-the-board.  And great combos like the squid and sopressata which keep us coming back for more.  We tried a new dish last night, the porchetta, and practically licked the plate!  Definitely one of my Top 5 in Madison!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison, hands down! I have been for brunch, dinner, and drinks, and each experience has been fantastic. Great service, delicious food and chill ambiance.  The ingredients used are clearly fresh, and the presentation is beautiful. I dream about the chili rubbed steak.   They have an inventive cocktail menu in addition to a good tap and wine list. Try the Chartreuse Sour - you won't be disappointed!   Tip: if you sit in the bar area, you can order off a less expensive but equally tasty \"snack\" menu. Get the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"I love heritage. Only the best ingredients, and always a good time. The bartenders are top notch as well. This is the only place where my husband and I will eat pork. The grilled cheese with ham is a must try. The price is really good for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"We had family in town and made reservations for dinner at the Heritage Tavern.  I was very excited to try this place, but came away sorely, sorely disappointed.  That's not to say that there weren't some  highlights, but the lowlights and moments of sheer mediocrity  dominated.  ATMOSPHERE: The space was very nice and the seating was comfortable. Our party of six had a great table that seemed to be both centrally located and somehow shielded from the hustle and bustle on a busy Saturday night.    However, we all found it to be uncomfortably hot in the restaurant, and our wine had to be kept at least 10 feet from the table, which was odd.  SERVICE: The service was somehow both warm and pretentious at the same time.  The waiter promptly announced that, \"I don't have any additions to the menu tonight... I won't even use the 's-word' [specials] that other restaurants use to try to feed you repackaged leftovers.\"  That was the first 'are you kidding me?' moment.  The second was when another waitress came to the table with a, \"dish compliments of the kitchen.\"  Was this some sort of innovative amuse bouche?  No.  It was bread.  Don't get me wrong-- I'm all for serving a basket of bread, but don't act like you're bestowing some amazing gift on me.  It's bread.    Oh, wait... it's not just bread, because for some reason the plate had to be explained to us.  See that butter? It's honey butter!  See that little cup with a few pickled veggies on it?  That's a little cup with a few pickled veggies!  And did you notice the random little pile of salt?  That's \"course sea salt, to cut the sweetness of the honey butter.\"  (I'm not sure how you're supposed to do this-- is every member of the party supposed to lick their thumb and grab some?  Somehow I managed to deal with the sweetness of the butter without doing that.)  All that being said, I actually didn't mind the service.  The waiter was friendly and classy, and he handled our one major issue (see below) gracefully and appropriately.  APPETIZERS: I had crispy head cheese with escargot.  The head cheese was fried into two little croquettes.  They were light and not too dense or heavy.  I wouldn't have known I was eating head cheese.  The escargot, however, was completely lost in the dish.  I scraped a bit off one of the croquettes and it was very good on its own, but I would have had no clue that it was even there if I had eaten everything together.    Several members of the party had a beet salad.  Everyone liked it. No one raved about it. In general, I thought that the appetizers were fairly successful, if not amazing.  ENTREES: And here's where the wheels came off the cart.  My mother ordered the Wagyu burger.  It was tiny and served on the edge of an enormous plate with absolutely no garnish or accompaniment.   My sister had the salmon.  She said that it was, \"very fishy.\"  Her fiance had a sirloin.  He didn't say anything about it.  He's very polite.  I had the bouillabaisse.  It was pathetic.  This is a simple dish, and it needs top quality ingredients to work.  This wasn't top quality seafood.  It was absolutely indistinguishable in size, taste, and texture from the stuff I can buy frozen at Woodman's.  There was hardly any broth at all, and it somehow didn't taste like seafood at all.  It was just vaguely salty. This dish should have never made it out of the kitchen.  That wasn't the worst dish on the table, though.  My wife ordered a pork chop.  That was apparently sold out, but the waiter said that they could make the same dish with a pork shank.  What came out was a large bone with a little sliver of meat and an ENORMOUS amount of fat.  I honestly have no clue how this pig even walked on a shank like that.  It was disgusting and inedible.  Had they not taken it off the bill, it would have plunged this to a one star review.    The only person who was happy was my father, who wasn't all that hungry and ordered the tomato soup and grilled cheese.  That was one of the cheapest items on the menu.  In sum, they sent out three mediocre entrees and two completely unacceptable entrees.   Was the food bad? Not really.  Was it anywhere close to what I would have expected for the very high prices? Not in a million years.    I haven't had such a disappointing meal in some time."}
{"text":"Dang. Everything that touched my lips while I was in Heritage was unreal.   The beet & dark chocolate salad is a symphony of flavor. Pears? Macadamia nut butter? Is this real life?  The pickled market vegetables are yummy and a nice vegetarian side or small appetizer if your group is chowing down on charcuterie. For dinner I got the scallion pancake with root vegetable slaw. Fried tofu and a soy emulsion, plus go-chu-jang butter and cashew make you taste buds do a happy tap dance.   The service was a little slow, but it was Friday night and they did what they could to keep our drinks full and make sure we were happy, which was appreciated. The menu is very meat heavy, but they don't slack on the vegetarian options in the flavor department. I'll be back next time my taste buds feel like a little dancing."}
{"text":"PROS: Great happy hour deals CONS: Pricey regular menu  Happy hour is a steal. $5 for 2 tasty, normal-sized tacos with fresh, high quality ingredients! I was less impressed by the regular menu, but would come back in the future for more tacos and beer during happy hour."}
{"text":"The food was great and service too, the pork was slightly fatter than other places. The bualibesse was great. Great dish."}
{"text":"Sometime it's the food.... I eat lobster scramble - made exactly right.  This time ---- is the waitress: her name is Allison.  So nice! So good! How can she's knows my wife likes her water with no ice? Always on time - always available - and always with great smile and attitude.  A good reason to come back!"}
{"text":"This is getting 3 stars because of a few ridiculous things that occurred during dinner at a place that had great food but not the service to match. First the good: the family style pork was perfectly cooked and delicious. The roast beef and pork schnitzel were enjoyed also.  The sauces that came with the bacon wrapped cheese curds were interesting and yummy. Of course, as others have pointed out, the deviled eggs are delish! Sadly, some things were disappointing. A restaurant of this size should have more bathroom space. People were waiting to use the restroom in a very small space right by the kitchen traffic. One of our guests had ice tea and was never offered more even though their glass was empty for more than half the dinner.  We were there more than 40 minutes before any bread was brought out. Most farm to table restaurants are very conscious of not being wasteful which is why we were surprised when one of our guests switched from drinking alcohol to coke and was brought a bottle of coke and a glass...use the fountain coke that you probably have anyway for bar drinks. It was also loud last night.  Might have been an anomaly but it made our soft spoken waitress very difficult to hear. The three star rating doesn't mean that I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to others, but for the price they should be on the top of their game."}
{"text":"Before I begin, let me preface by saying that the above rating is only in regard to the visual aesthetic of the room, as I have yet to do a full inventory of the menu.  As a denizen of the former establishment at this address, I thought it only fair to walk in at the end of the first business day to check out the new digs.  Clearly, a strong vision was employed in the construction of the kitchen area, as it is the star of the room.  The bar itself is flanked by the wall which faces Webster St.  The taps do not actually reveal what beers are being featured, you have to look at the menu for that.  Speaking of which, please be prepared before you pick up the food menu as you will immediately realize that you are \"no longer in Kansas\" (as Dorothy would say).  Owner Dan Fox is an \"oink-o-file\" in the extreme, and the variations on the theme of this menu lays it out in spades.  My next installment will cover some of those entries, but for now, lets just say that the beer selection was a little like one of those young broadway starlets trying to draw attention to herself, only to realize that the real action was not on her block.  I can also say with impunity that the Central Waters' \"Hop Rise\" tastes as close to rancid ursine semen as I would ever think to imagine.  I hope to give more details on the food in the next review, which will hopefully yield better results."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed the bacon-wrapped cheese curds! I'm not a big fan of the truffle fish dip... but the buttermilk ranch is great. We got the special that night which was a pork shoulder marinated in soy sauce, mirin, etc with fall veggies, tuna and lettuce wraps. It was a little salty, but overall delicious and the pork was cooked perfectly. It was a special for two, but could have easily fed three to four, we took extras home with us! I wish our server was a tad better. We were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, and it actually ended up being an hour. He didn't come check up on us during the wait, or even let us know that the wait would be longer. Even so, all the other servers were great and the food was good."}
{"text":"Yelp needs a \"4.5 stars\" option-- Heritage Tavern almost nailed it.  Definitely among the best in Madison.  Like most \"fine dining\" restaurants, I did not end up \"stuffed\" like I usually do after the meal (ok, that's probably a good thing, but I generally have a hell of an appetite...)  Chef is famous for pork, so that's what I got and it was all awesome.  Only thing that knocked it from a 5-star was one of the desserts (a chocolate cake-- forget the exact name) that would have been more at home on a buffet table at the Hilton than here (and it was ~$12 or so... this place ain't cheap).  The other dessert (squash cake?) was great (but again, pricey). Definitely a special occasion type of place unless you are seriously loaded or someone else is picking up the tab!"}
{"text":"Heritage Tavern is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison, and the brunch they serve in the weekends is amazing! We had the doughnuts & espresso and the old fashioned ham cinnamon roll as sides, and I couldn't believe how delicious they were. I then had the Beef sirloin, frites & eggs. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the friend poached eggs were out of this world, together with the blue cheese sabayon, the dish was one of my favorite brunch dishes I've had in Madison. My partner had the truffled egg gratin and from what I got to try, the flavors in the dish were amazing. We did not have one bad dish! The service and atmosphere were great and we overall had an amazing time!"}
{"text":"I love the Heritage! It's a beautiful restaurant with great ambiance, service and food. Each time I have visited, I am impressed with the staff service. I love the food but it's definitely a bit pricey. I guess I just won't be able to go there as often, but I will still go! I have recommended this place and will continue to."}
{"text":"BEST food I've ever eaten. I live in New Orleans, and I have never had food as flavorful as HT. We had the chicken confit and cauliflower tortellini schnitzel. Both were incredible! The cocktails were delicious! The bacon wrapped cheese curds are the stuff of dreams. And the desserts were just so impressive. I would DEFINITELY go back next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails. Great waitstaff. Amazing food.  I went into Heritage Tavern for the first time right before the new year. I had (if I recall correctly) a \"cold-weather gin and tonic\" and it was literally the best drink I have ever had. I love gin and tonics, but when you can winterize what is typically a summer time beverage, you have my vote. We started the evening off with ordering a half-dozen of the deviled eggs. 3 varieties were included in the half dozen; one made with beets (good, but our least favorite), one made with bacon (better, but not really original), and the Asian inspired one with crispy rice (Yes, yes, and YES). We then ordered a cheese tray to share. Between the deviled eggs and the cheese tray, we knew we wanted to try an entree but figured it wise to share one. We split the pork schnitzel entree. Pig is definitely where Dan Fox shines. The pork was perfect; he managed to make a faux-vegetarian question her beliefs. The staff was attentive and quick to offer a suggestion. Will be back. Soon."}
{"text":"Excellent choice based on a recommendation from a local resident. Excellent service and very good food. Try the fried cheese curds and other delicious appetizers."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times, before writing this review to give this restaurant a chance but each time (4 times) we've been disappointed with our entrees. When you're paying $25+ per entree it should be consistent, and better than average. All 4 dining times this was not the case. The service wasn't particularly attentive or knowledgable either. On the up side, the atmosphere is spectacular and their wines are outstanding. If you go stick to the snack side of the menu."}
{"text":"This meal exceeded all expectations. From the pate with home made pickles to my perfectly cooked copper river salmon it was wonderful. We had a side order of cole slaw and  was full of lovely summer vegetables as well as a mustard dressing. The signature foie gras with tuna was incredibly innovative. I loved every bite. I don't live in Madison but I might be tempted. Service was very caring."}
{"text":"Ok- I'm very conflicted in my review, but overall I gave it 4 stars.  Atmosphere- awesome! Such a cool bar with a open kitchen. Solid 5 stars.  Drinks- very cool drink menu. Tap beer selection was just OK. Very nice whiskey and bourbon menu. Cocktail menu was really good also. Execution- 4 stars   Menu- very very very cool. Love the concept of this menu. We started out with the deviled Egg small plate. Have you ever had a deep fried deviled egg? Me either- until last night. BOMB digity! For my entree I ordered the flank steak. The food was cooked perfectly, but I didn't enjoy the combo of what was on it. Everyone else's entrees were great. That is why I can't give this 5 out of 5.... Yet."}
{"text":"Wow!  The wait staff KNOW the menu.  Tim helped us chose the perfect dishes.  Vet attentive without being intrusive.  My water was filled twice without me noticing who or when it happened.  The food is out of this world.  The flavors, textures and presentation are outstanding!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch , lobster omelet , lamb tartar , Devil eggs, BURGERS , maple ice cream ............ I can only go FOREVER about this  Just GO order anything you will be happy u did  Best place in Madison hands down"}
{"text":"Sometimes you have those meals that make your toes curl in deliciousness. This was one of those experiences!  I am so happy that we tried this for Restaurant Week. We just had the best time, the best food, and cannot wait to go back.  The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable. The staff were friendly, answered our questions, and our water glasses were never empty.  The food ... oh, the food!  My entree will be in my dreams tonight -- grilled beef sirloin and tamarind glazed ox-tail with sweet potato-coconut puree, charred brussels sprouts, tomatillo chimichurri sauce, crushed peanut.  To. Die. For.  The bathrooms are a one person room, so if you push on the door, don't be surprised if it doesn't budge.  I few of the fixtures were unique, but overall it is nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Very impressed with their menu selections for restaurant week, and how efficient their service was! Despite it's restaurant week and we came during peak dinner hour, we were served very timely and the interval between meals are perfect.  The meal as a set tasted amazing (Ordered Sweet Potato & Duck Soup, Pork Trio, and Profiterole, and other appetizers on the table). What elevates this dining experience further is the wine. I know I am not a sommelier, but 4 post-sipping smiles on the table is a solid indicator of how good the wine is  Ghost Pines Merlot (2013): Astringent enough for a dry red wine, but it has a very round body and smooth aftertaste. It is a great wine for a casual dinner with friends.  Their quality and service leaves a positive impression for my first visit to this restaurant. I would definitely come again for their normal menu!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a nice date night!  Secluded little spot right off of Capitol Square that is super close to State Street. The location is great, and the interior is decorated as you'd expect from an upscale restaurant with a unique menu.  I opted for the Black Grilled Sirloin, which did not disappoint! It was the most unique steak I've ever had. The steak is surrounded by corn and salsa verde, with finely sliced potatoes as well. The tastes really complemented each other!  I will definitely be coming back here in the future. The one caveat I have with this place is that the food was a tad on the slower side, given that I was one of the only guests, yet the food took about 25-30 minutes to come. The food was well worth the wait, though, and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow! It's not often that I can't demolish a plate of meat, but the Heritage ham that accompanied my Easter Ham and Eggs was so rich, so flavorful, so absolutely decadent, that I had to take half home with me for a late Easter lunch.   My first visit to Heritage was Easter Sunday for brunch with my mom. Easter brunch can be a formulaic and uninspired affair, but not so here. Service was prompt and friendly-they seated us right away even though we ended up being about 45 min early for our reservation. The cocktail menu had many interesting choices, but I went with the \"French 57\"-sparkling rosé with gin and lemon zest-delightful. My mom loved her bloody Maria-and the home made meat stick in her garnish was the perfect extra touch.   Hazelnut French toast for her, poached eggs with the aforementioned ham and a green salad with garlic and Parmesan for me. Every dish elegantly plated, served quickly-nothing prosaic or commonplace here! Heritage pays attention to every detail, and while it would have been nice to see a sweet, gluten free option amid the savories, the inclusion of Silly Yak bread is a positive step. A+  Half the heritage meat stick from a bloody maria"}
{"text":"Heritage is nothing but impressive. The atmosphere is beautiful - an impressive array of decor, a stunning bar area, and with the option of more intimate booth seating in the back dining area. There's patio seating for summer nights, as well.  The biggest draw is still the food. They offer both individual and group servings. Don't skimp on the appetizers - the tempura bacon-wrapped cheese curds is one of the best foods you've never tasted. We ordered the blackened chicken and the salmon, both of which were exquisite in presentation and taste. Liquor-infused ice cream dominates the dessert menu, and it was fabulous. I have it on good authority the cheese plate appetizer and blackfin tuna are both delicious choices, as well.  The service was equally impressive. Our server, Jasmine, was attentive and knowledgeable. The bartenders were just as efficient and talented. If you stick to their cocktail menu, try the Heisenberg or the Manhattan. They have a beautiful full bar, so stopping in for drinks is likely just as lovely as a dinner date."}
{"text":"We ventured in for the happy hour pork (or veggie) taco special. We had a little time to kill before the show at the Overture. There was plenty of seating at the bar and in the dining room when we arrived. There were a few different groups of customers in the bar area. Some in suits and business attire and some just casually hanging out and socializing. They have a nice selection of wines and tap beers on special. I opted for a stout and it was pretty good. I was surprised that it did not come in a pint glass though. I understand that some of the higher alcohol beers will come in a variety of smaller portion glasses. But, this was a basic stout and still came in a smaller pour. The restaurant was not very busy, but our tacos took quite a while to show up after we ordered. The two corn tortilla tacos came with a salsa verde on the side. The pork left a greasy aftertaste and the taco seemed pretty flavorless without the salsa verde lathered on top. I definitely have had better pork tacos in Madison (and cheaper too!). I would come back to try their veggie tacos or a variety of other items I saw listed on the menu. After seeing quite a few cocktails being made, I will definitely be back to sample a couple of those too."}
{"text":"It's such rare treat to have an adult night out that when we do we are exceptionally choosy in where we go.  So it was a bit of a wildcard to select Heritage Tavern, which we had never been to.  However, I trusted the folks at the James Beard Foundation to know what they're doing when they name a chef to their prestigious lists.  Dined with another couple.  Tonight featured a 4lb., 21-day aged, Bone-one, Tomahawk ribeye so we just had to go for it.  At nearly a $100, it ended up being the star of the show...perfect for the four of us to split.  Perfectly cooked and pre-sliced at serving, it was crazy, crazy tasty.  We shared four small plates as well and would definitely recommend both the mushroom risotto and the pear salad with duck confit.  The others were good but not as exemplary.    Finished off with an apple dessert to share that had the most amazing sour apple flavor that I'd ever experienced aside from a green jolly rancher.  We were told it's what happens when you pickle an apple.  Brilliant!  Cocktails were delish and the service was well paced and insightful.  One of the best meals we've had in town and that's not just the \"free from kids\" enthusiasm talking..."}
{"text":"Haven't been for the food, this review is solely for the late night offerings.   The late night crowd at Heritage is low key and sparse - most likely because of its location a ways down from the Capitol. Of the 15 or so individuals in the establishment, 10 were our friends or friends-of-friends.   This was perfectly fine for our group which was just winding down the night and looking for a quiet place to grab a couple of drinks. I also liked that there was not a lot of background noise or loud music. It made for good conversations and a great time.   Drinks are priced fairly. At $6 a well drink, Heritage is a little pricier than most bars on state, but when I consider the fact that I'm paying for a frat-boy, coed-free environment, I don't really mind. I like that the mixers come from their respective bottles instead of from a soda gun, I don't think I've ever had a rum and Mexican coke before. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food in Madison! The tomato soup will Change your life.  We live across the street and we eat here several times a week. The happy hour, the brunch, the main menu are all fabulous and worth every penny. It's hard to find food that is so well prepared in a small city. Chef Dan clearly knows what he is doing. He takes customer service as well as food preparation  very seriously.  Go see Kevin or Victoria for amazing service. I'm truly going to miss this place when I leave in two weeks."}
{"text":"Yea for pork and cheese!!! Panko crusted bacon wrapped cheese curds and fluffy mushroom gnocchi are a great introduction to local Madison cuisine. If only I could get this back home. The kitchen on a not to crowded Monday night was painfully slow but worth the wait once we got our food."}
{"text":"Brunch. Started with cinnamon roll with ham. Ordered waffle with a side of bacon (which I crunched up with each bite of waffle)."}
{"text":"Great place for a special event, great place for a regular night, great place for late night.  The food is outstanding. I have no other way than that to describe it. The decor is excellent - it feels very 'Chicago'. It's split into two areas, with two different experiences. The bar area has some tables as well as dining directly at the bar. The kitchen is visible from this area. The other area is a bit more formal of a dining area, and because of that is generally a bit quieter, and a more traditional dining experience. I like both areas for different reasons.  The table service is great as well - each time I've been there we've had different waiters and waitresses, but each have been friendly and more than willing to suggest something from the menu if we couldn't decide right away. There were a few hiccups the last night I was there, but it was with a fairly large group celebrating a special event, so I'm sure we were not easy to deal with.  Despite one or two small mix-ups, I absolutely plan to be back here more often. As they say, it's all about how you recover.  And yeah, it's kinda expensive, but if places don't charge what it costs to have nice things, they'll all be gone and we'll be left with the neon sign places by the mall. If you want average food at an average price, go to Applebee's. Maybe you'll see Ricky Bobby there."}
{"text":"From my perfect blue cheese martini, dirty and perfectly done, to dessert (which was generously free because of my birthday) Heritage is amazing.  Hands down, some of the best food in Madison,  I would recommend for a hungry party of 4, get two small plates and everyone get their own main.  The small plates are fairly small for 4 people, but the taste!!  It's so perfectly done.  I tried the lightly pan fried whitefish with sticky rice and curry, melt in your mouth delicious!  The boys tried the Sturgeon, which is a risk, not the most popular item, and they loved it.  Highly recommend for a special night out!"}
{"text":"We have loved Heritage since the beginning. Great staff who see their work as a way of life, and it shows in everything from the atmosphere to how the food is handled and right down to presentation and taste. Waitstaff remember you--last night ours remembered that we brought our daughter in for her 13th birthday last month. He even recalled what she had ordered.   Fine selection of beers, creative mixed drinks, and really more than just a meal. It's a celebration of food from the earth it came from and on up. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Love Heritage, one of my favorites downtown! Chef Dan Fox always has something new and tasty. A must during restaurant week!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. We came here on a Saturday morning as a \"pit stop\" for our Farmer's Market activities. First thing I noticed is a very clean and well put together atmosphere. Second I noticed the unique items on the brunch menu. Items such as the poached egg that gets soaked for 10 minutes then flash fried with a crust that was crisp but still kept the egg soft and runny! Wowzers. Nice touch chefs!   I ordered the savory/sweet french toast with duck sausage and poached eggs benedict. It was really scrumptious and I enjoyed it down to the last bite! Heritage gives a generous portion of food and we all left full. I am most interested in eating dinner here one of these days. With the breakfast passing the test I would enjoy seeing how they do dinner.  The Madison food scene in general is intriguing to me. It's a great place to extend from the Milwaukee food scene!   Also of note was a extremely scrumptious bloody mary! As I'm new to liking Bloody Mary's I've tried more than my share. My tastebuds have finally caught up and I am enjoying the plethora of Bloody Mary's Wisconsin has to offer. This one had great toppings and a nice bit of heat to complement a well tasting and seasoned Bloody! Love that!"}
{"text":"A classier restaurant. A bit pricy, but the food is a bit dressed up for it. Corn soup was very flavorful. There were about for lobster bits inside. The fancy cheese curds were pretty good. Three chicken and sausage was flavorful but felt like it was missing something like a sauce. Pretty pricey. Food took awhile..  like 25 minutes to come out. Otherwise a good nicer place."}
{"text":"The meatballs are amazing. The entrees are great. Interesting, delicious cocktails. Nice atmosphere. The service was good and the staff friendly. It's a great place for a date night or just a satisfying, delicious dinner."}
{"text":"The yummiest restaurant in Madison! Do yourself a favor and go here. Service, food and cocktails are top notch. Lobster scramble at brunch...mmmmm."}
{"text":"Part of the reason I dine out is because I value the service as much as the do the menu. Heritage Tavern is one of the few places where you can tell that the staff is well trained and attuned to the cadence of proper meal service. From the hostess to the waiter to the bar staff, Heritage Tavern's service is above the norm, which in itself is four stars, but the menu kicks up the experience even further thanks to the classic-french-meets-asian-fusion dishes that make you pause to think and then say, \"oh, heck, why not.\"  The assorted deviled egg platter reads banal and \"safe\" until you actually try the trio of flavors and textures brought to the table. Here, they treat eggs as a canvas to apply wonderful touches of surprise and delight. As a fan of mid-century modern, I personally loved the colored glass egg platter that felt like an heirloom \"heritage\" piece.  We decided to be conservative with the small plates in anticipation of the braised pork and tuna, which fortunately was 1) a smart move and 2) worth the wait. When we read the dish's description, we all cocked our heads to the side and made the same inquisitive face wondering why anyone would pair cold sushi-grade tuna with warm, braised pork. It was safe to say that we were intrigued and threw caution to the wind.  The kitchen needs a little extra time to prepare this shared-plate feast and our waiter give us fair warning, which was fine because our table of four enjoyed exploring the short but satisfying wines-by-the-glass list as we waited. Then the moment of truth came where the course was brought out. It looked like a centerpiece from a Hawaiian luau. It was a sight to behold and we all took some time to evaluate the best point of entry and appropriate cutlery.  It's amazing that one plate can offer so many flavors and we were continuously surprised that every forkful was an opportunity to try new combinations of protein, vegetable and sauce. The braised pork fell apart with the right amount of fat and flavor in each bite. The headcheese was actually refined and homey at the same time. The roasted vegetables were smokey and almost sweet. The tuna was cut into larger chunks that felt like the crowning jewels. The bib lettuce and Korean red paste on the periphery offered a chance to make a DIY lettuce wrap which totally changed the the flavor journey with sweet, tangy and spicy notes.  Heritage Tavern certainly delivered on a unique experience--one that was equal parts fun, delicious and accommodating. The holy trinity when it come to dining out."}
{"text":"I had chestnut encrusted sturgeon as well as several cocktails. the fish we perfectly cooked and delicious and the cocktails, while pricey at $11, were exquisite and ell balanced.  Ive been back for appetizers and cocktails many times since and always found the quality to be top notch. I cannot recommend this place enough for people looking for a more upscale but interesting place to eat downtown."}
{"text":"This is an update from my last review.  Immediately after I posted that we'd been disappointed, I received a kind email from the chef offering a re-try.  I really appreciated the responsiveness, but wanted to go back without strings.    And we did go back to Heritage this week and had a fabulous time.   It was how we remembered it and feel like our less than great experience last time was a forgivable one-off.    The bartenders were fabulous.  They are approachable and knowledgeable ...and make great drinks.   The meal was delicious.  Atmosphere upbeat and inviting.   Thank you Heritage for caring about your customers and offering really good food!   We will return and hope you do too."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I found the restaurant to be small and way too loud.  It's trendy, so bring your wallet and expect the menu to follow suit."}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend a lot.   I was really excited to try Heritage after all the hype. We had a group of 6 on a Friday night. Didn't know they took reservations, so we waited in the bar area for about an hour. Tight space, not much waiting room. Only bar area tables are for \"walk-ins\" and most tables in the area seat 2 or 4.   Great cocktails, friendly bar staff. The Angostura Sour was well balanced and the Aviation was delicious. We ordered a cheese plate which was good (nice touch with honey comb), but overpriced. Our waiter was phenomenal! Super friendly and attentive without being annoying.   Similar sentiments with the food once we were finally seated. We ordered some of the more odd selections (trotters and escargot, octopus and fried cocks combs) as well as some not-so-odd (deviled eggs, pork belly and sashimi). All were pretty delicious, but felt like it was a bit overpriced. Few vegetarian options.   I'd try Heritage again. Definitely more of a special occasion kind of place, rather than a standard staple. Looks like they change their menu frequently, which is nice."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Heritage is the inventive menu.  Many restaurants are tasty but predictable.  This one is exciting and always a win!  Who would expect spicy carrot ginger puree would go with bacon-wrapped tempura cheese curds so well? Brian the server was helpful and attentive.  Drink menu is always fantastic and fun (please bring back Lucy in the Sky with Emeralds!)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Started with the deviled eggs. Highly recommend. We had the fried white fish and bouillabaisse fantastic"}
{"text":"Does not live up to the hype or price. I don't get why those food nerds are raving about this place. Perhaps mediocre food at high $ has a psychological effect on most people. It wasn't working on us.  The $28 schnitzel we ordered was very salty. Their cocktails look good on paper, I mean literally with the nice font and \"cute\" names, and ingredients that sound interesting on their own. But wait until you taste it all together.  On top of not-so-great food, the service was mediocre. The least they could do was smile. But a 20% gratuity was automatically charged which usually equates to excellent service. Did they just decide for themselves that their service was excellent? We didn't think so."}
{"text":"Heritage blends a comfortable yet classy interior, great cocktail menu, and solid food. Good for a drink after work or for celebrating a special occasion. Staff are generally friendly, although service can be a little slow - fine if you want to sit and chat, you definitely don't feel rushed. We went for restaurant this last time and enjoyed all of our dishes. The salmon was a surprise break-out: moist and tender over a delicate and delicious broth.  I've also recently been to a wedding catered by Heritage and would recommend them for catering as well."}
{"text":"Top-shelf.  The food was great and the service was everything you would expect.  My wife and I recently visited to celebrate a birthday.   Heritage Tavern is a physically beautiful restaurant, and there is more seating than I expected.  For our meal, we requested the waiter make our selections, and she brought us plate after plate of delicious fare.  The deviled eggs, as others have noted, were very tasty, as was the pork belly and marlin sashimi.  The marlin in particular had a very pleasant consistency.    We also shared entrees, and together enjoyed panko-crusted salmon, and suckling chops in an apple-bacon-truffle reduction.   Incredible.  I've never had anything like the suckling chops.     We had a wonderful night out at Heritage and will certainly be back after my wallet recovers."}
{"text":"My favorite things I've had at Heritage are the roasted beet salad and the \"don't call me Alexander\" ice cream dessert. The salad was seriously amazing. The macadamia nuts and the dark chocolate play off the tart beets very well. The ice cream was boozy and delicious. I'd come back for either of these any day."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Cheese Plate - Alemar Camembert, Satrori Extra Aged Goat Cheese, Hooks Paradise Blue Cheese, Poppyseed Crackers, Fruit Bread, Figs, Mustard, Pickled Radishes Berries, Chocolate, and Cream - Chocolate Cake, Macerated Mixed Berries, Vanilla Cream, Strawberry Ice Cream, Roasted Almond Caramel Profiteroles - Wisconsin Maple Ice Cream, Chantilly Cream, Cardamaro Caramel, Toasted Pecan  Unabashedly willing to dine in excess when visiting a new city it was only as I was setting my GPS back to the hotel after dinner at A Pig in a Fur Coat that I noted the late hours of Heritage Tavern, a quick reroute leading me past the illuminated capital to the understated front door just ten minutes later.  Old-school in ambiance with locally sourced ingredients and craft cocktails at its core it was with options for bar seating that overlooks an open kitchen versus a more subdued dining room that I was presented on entry and eventually opting for the latter as the bar was still bustling my next sixty minutes was an utterly delightful experience, the service matching Chef Fox's whimsical yet refined restaurant.  Having already partaken in several meals that day with more planned for the next it was with eyes focused largely on dessert that I approached the ever changing menu and although tempted mightily by several styles of pork and local produce I (for once) showed some restraint, the Wisconsin cheese plate and a duo of desserts arriving with excellent pacing and presentations on par.  Obviously leaning towards bold flavors with bloomy Camembert, briny goat cheese, and a particularly punchy blue suffice it to say that I'd have liked the cheeses served with larger portions of accoutrements given the $18 tariff, but with each option save for overly-dry fruit bread proving reference standard this is a small quibble - the following $13-$14 desserts each excessively portioned and so rich that either could have easily been shared...though, at least in the case of the caramel-topped maple profiteroles resting in a pool of silky Chantilly, certainly not by me."}
{"text":"We had an amazing night at Heritage Tavern!  We started off with drinks, the Old Money for the men in the group (both of them had 3 over the course of the night, so you know it was good), and a Paramore for me (also tasty).  We shared the assorted deviled eggs (a dozen). All 4 varieties were excellent, but the truffled egg was my favorite.  Next up was the tempura. Obviously the bacon wrapped cheese curds were delicious. As a sauce enthusiast, I was excited that they were served with 3 different dipping sauces. Our only regret about this dish was that it was gone too quickly.  The star of the show was the Grilled Wagyu Burger. Our table was silent as well all savored our burgers. I had no idea that a burger could taste this good - totally blew my mind. It was without a doubt the best burger I've ever eaten (and the others in our party agreed with that assessment!)."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town so I always like to find good restaurants to eat at while I'm visiting. I've eaten here twice now and both times were good experiences. The first time I came here a few years back I ordered the tempura-fried cheese curds and the wagyu burger. Both were very delicious and flavorful. The cheese curds are crispy with the perfect texture. Although their wrapped in bacon they are not overly bacon-y. I did notice the burger is no longer on their menu, which is a bummer! But there are other things on the menu that make up for it. This latest time I went, I ordered the pork belly & tuna dish. Wow I felt glutinous eating it... but I just could not stop! The pork belly is crispy, the tuna is nice and fresh, the seared foie gras however is what puts this dish to the top. Let's just say I love seared Foie gras. The dish is accompanied wish a mango chutney which adds a nice light balance to the fat heavy dish. Great restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"You walk in the door and are immediately greeted with a large bar and tasteful decor. We had an attentive server who gave us tips on how to eat some of the odder selections on the menu,  such as the bone marrow and sold us on the specials.   Disclaimer! The menu and specials are meat focused being a vegetarian is not your best bet here.  Appetizers: We had tempura bacon wrapped cheese curds which while delicious were cumbersome as finger food. Also had the bone marrow which comes resting in a great sauce and crostini to spread the marrow on.   Main Dish: Two of us at the table split the Tempura Red Snapper (one of three specials that night) and frankly this magnificent fish resting on a bed of lobster could feed one or two more people. The schnitzel was also ordered and tasted fine compared to the fish (still a good dish)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Madison, WI.  I went here for restaurant week and had the best meal out of all the four restaurants that I visited. I had the fried pork and beef meatballs for appetizer which were amazing.  The meatballs were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The couple sitting next to me informed me that chef and owner Dan Fox served the appetizer so I really feel special.  For my main course, I had the curry white fish which was heavenly. The crispy fish was perfectly seasoned and complemented the curry sticky rice and bokchoy. The curry was subtle and didn't overpower the fried fish.  For dessert, I had the chocolate flourless cake which was decadently amazing plus the Chef Fox served it to me (again) so now I really feel like I'm a guest of honor. Plus I had a complimentary glass of a 10-year old Spanish port perhaps to make up for the fact that my reservation got messed up. But it's water under the bridge.  Thank you Heritage Tavern for the heavenly meal and if the head chef-owner is reading this, please send me your autograph. Haha."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a wonderful experience at Heritage Tavern.  It could not have been more delightful.  Making a reservation through Yelp was easy.  I received a confirmation message so I knew the request was received.  I also had a confirmation text a day before.  Again, this was appreciated and easy.  We were treated well by every person that interacted with us.  Our server was very thoughtful of our time to get to the play we were attending.  The restaurant space is warm and comfortable.  We started with a Wagu Hanger Steak small plate.  The beef was medium rare and well seasoned.  Served over confit pineapple, rice.  It was a balanced and tasty dish.    All three of us ordered the Family Style Dinner.  It was Heritage Pork and Tuna.  It was a roasted pork shank that we cut off the bone.  It was served with bibb lettuce, sauce, and a reduction.  The pork and tuna was eaten as a lettuce wrap.  On the roast plate, there was also fried head cheese and a root vegetable.  It was a thoughtful, delicious meal.  We were all pleased.  As we were paying the bill and getting ready to leave for our play, our server boxed our remaining dinner and told us we could leave it in their cooler.  That is a nice service.    We came back after the play for our bag of goodness.  We stayed for another drink.  The drink menu is a well curated list of interesting cocktails, delicious wine and beer choices, and smart spirits.  So comfortable in the bar, we had a grest time."}
{"text":"My favorite place in town. When we have guests in from out of state, this is always the place we bring them to.   Atmosphere is on point. Giving the class of fine dining with touches (eg Edison bulbs and white washed brick) that make it less stuffy.   Start with a cocktail, you will not be disappointed. The bartenders use unique techniques and ingredients to make sublime drinks.   The menu rotates. I haven't had a single bad meal and their dessert profiteroles are divine. We've even done the pig shoulder family style as a birthday dinner and were blown away.   Cannot brag on this place enough."}
{"text":"Kevin at Heritage Tavern was so great! Along with the amazing food and drinks his personality made the entire experience so enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The charcuterie tray was amazing! They had some really great meat spreads and cheeses! My favorite was probably the ham wrapped figs. They also have some really great coppa on there too. And  the price was really good.   The milkshake American IPA beer in tap is such a great, different beer! Wish I could get it again!   The service and atmosphere is also great here. I really enjoyed my time eating charcuterie and drinking beer here, and I'd bet you would too."}
{"text":"This place is slow, overpriced and generally shitty.  No lemon in the lemonade.  Are you supposed to need a steak knife for eggs benedict?"}
{"text":"Absolutely a great place in Madison. Very nice presentation of dishes and the staff are very attentive. I has the salmon and the octopus salad. They both were delicious  The wine list is also great and they have a band playing on certain week nights."}
{"text":"Our favorite go-to restaurant. Make a reservation on the weekends - otherwise can usually walk in and get seated. The food is adventurous and good. Specialty drinks are fun. We ordered a red snapper special for two which was amazing."}
{"text":"This is your place for an expensive (do NOT come here on a budget), American food option in the heart of Madison.Yet again I wish Yelp would add the option to do a star and a half because I'd give this between a 3.5-4 for the service and very specific menu (as someone who likes extensive options), but I'll round up since I liked the food enough.   Starting off with the con: service was probably the worst part of the experience. We got there at 7:15pm and left at 9:50 - each dish (we ordered a variety of small and large plates) took so long to come that we got hungry in between every order, and the waitress showed little care or remorse every time we asked about the status of the food. It seems like they are always busy, so plan to be there for a long time if you choose to go. We did get a basket of bread halfway through the meal - it was a nice touch, but probably should have come at the beginning...  Drinks: we got 2 bottles of the Tempranillo red wine at $66 a piece. Pretty great wine and enough for 4-5 people. They have a variety of wine, bubbles, beer, and craft cocktail options.   Little plates:  -Dover sole with whitefish mousse: LOVE. One of the special plates of the day - the fish had a great taste and the mousse was creamy and paired well.  -Cheese board with meats: fun to share with a group. You get to pick a mixture of cheeses and meats. (various prices b/w $6-$35) -Roasted beet salad: Didn't love this but it was a decent salad- just wasn't a great dressing/taste to it. Salad consisted of beets, poached figs, goat cheese, macadamia nut butter, pickled rhubarb, dark chocolate, strawberries. ($13) -Tempura bacon wrapped cheese curds: SO GOOD! Comes with sweet potato and a trio of dipping sauces. ($12) -Asparagus and pig's head bacon salad: Very little asparagus to be found...not a fan. Salad doesn't seem like their strong suit! ($16) -Lamb tartare with mustard green whipped cream: For someone who has never had tartare and was hesitant to try it, this was ridiculously good. The lamb was so creamy and had great flavor, olive oil fried potato chips and the cream were a great add. ($16)  Large plates: -Bouillabaisse: SO GOOD! Loved the combination of shrimp, clams, mussels, crab and fish marinated in the broth. ($29) -Pan Seared Scallops: Also great - soft and tender scallops with good flavor. ($32) -Roasted Beef Sirloin: Didn't try this, but the people at my table loved it. ($34)  Dessert: -Pear Crisp: AMAZING! The honey ice cream was unreal, the pear was super hot and tasty, almost like a pie. One of my favorite parts of this meal.  -Chocolate/Espresso cake: Not a huge cake person but this was also great, tasted like a tiramisu but heavier on the chocolate and coffee taste.   Overall: decent food, expensive prices, could have better service."}
{"text":"Of the expensivish (yes I just invented a word there) restaurants I've dined at, this is one of the few where I would return. Frequently the food is blah and the portions are ridiculously small. Not true here.  My friend and I ate brunch here this morning - I had the market vegetable benedict and he had something with lamb, french toast, fried poached eggs, salad and potatoes. I asked him what his favorite food item was and he said they were all good. My fried poached eggs were amazing and the potatoes were yummy as well.   Service was great - didn't have to wait too long for our food or drink refills.   The atmosphere is wonderful - with dark wood and brick, feels kind of like a library with the bookshelves behind the bar.   It would be good for larger groups since they have a long bench in the bar area with chairs on the other side - maybe seats 25 people.  I will be taking friends/family here."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential - I like the atmosphere and they have some amazing cocktails.  There are some interesting things on the menu.  We tried the leb of lamb - it was really good but a ton of food - I felt very wasteful for just 4 people.  I'd like to go again as just a couple and try it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Came for dinner and was not disappointed.  For appetizers we tried the crispy pork belly with black fin tuna and the grilled octopus.  The pork belly was spectacular.  The pork and tuna made a great combination.  The octopus was good but the pieces were very small.  I struggled to taste the octopus.    For my entree, I got the grilled beef striploin.  It was cooked perfectly and very tender.  The corn and pepper vegetable medley was a great addition to the dish.  Finish it off with that smokey sauce and you have a great entree.  The service was on point.  Fast and thorough.  I always enjoy coming here!  I can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"I went for restaurant week and sat at the bar since I was just one person dining. The bar was only staffed with one person (at 6:15p on a Monday) while I was here, so there was a bit of a wait for me to get menus when I first sat down. Other guests experienced this as well as they arrived at the bar. The bartender was nice, just (truly) very busy.   For my starter I ordered the fried beef & pork meatballs. They were really good. I liked the heirloom tomato olive sauce poured over them. They were set onto a small salad, but since the meatballs were hot the salad got a bit wilted. The few veggies on the plate though were good.  For my main I got the tilapia dish. It was served in a curry sauce which in and of itself was fascinating - somehow it was served bubbly/foamy. I didn't particularly care for the taste of the curry, perhaps a bit of orange flavor existed.... The dish also fell between a soup and a dry dish and in-between is never a good place for anything to be. Instead of there being a broth, the ingredients, especially the rice, took on more of a soggy texture.    Dessert was Rhubarb Sorbet & Lavender Champagne. The champagne was served in a shot glass for you to self-pour on the sorbet. The flavor was fine to me without the champagne. All the champagne did in my opinion was add a bit of carbonation texture to the dessert, which didn't add or subtract to the value for me.   All in all the bartender being so busy took away a bit from the experience I expect to have when I sit alone at a bar. Also, being a bit rushed, he was making mistakes. He almost served me the wrong dessert. As he cleared my main he told me some other dessert would be right out - I corrected him and he had to go back into the kitchen to change it. A really cool atmosphere, but between the main and the bartender I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Updating my review as this is my 4th time here. Chef Dan , thank you for the great food and hospitality. You did me wrong!! Everything was delicious as always and service by Laura was impeccable. Truly enjoyed the food, especially the grouper and tomahawk special.  Th foie gras that night was spectacular, both with the pork belly as our appetizer and with the tomahawk special. My guests truly enjoyed their experience. Thank you also for the comp dish as well. That was a nice surprise and we truly appreciate and enjoyed it. I will definitely be a regular here now as I come every month to Madison for business and I stay at AC hotel which is located conveniently from your resto. Thank you again and see you very soon. Trust!!!!"}
{"text":"Venture a few beats off Capitol Square and you'll encounter Heritage Tavern--a rustic yet classy gastropub known for its daring flavor combinations and its bold assemblage of locally-sourced ingredients. With an atmosphere that so radiantly captures both rusticism and class, Heritage not only fits itself into a category of its own in terms of its cuisine but it also does so with respect to its marked level of aesthetic refinement that comes to characterize the space. Yet, unbeknownst to many is the fact that Heritage Tavern opened its doors to the city of Madison but a month ago in early September. Given how flourishing and decidedly distinguished the new restaurant has become, Heritage Tavern's true state of infancy is quite impossible to discern.  Decorously furnished, Heritage flaunts booths adorned with untried leather, alongside tables of an amalgam of woods, all atop minimalistic deco tiles that contribute a veritable sense of 1920s nostalgia to the otherwise modern trends of the establishment. Yet, in terms of atmosphere, Heritage in large part allows the buoyancy of its patrons and the culinary mastery of its dishes speak for themselves. Glancing from table to table, it is rather easy to note the enthusiasm with which dishes are being savored and the vivacity with which boisterous laughter is being spread. Both sensations are doubtlessly contagious, seeing as all inhabitants bear genuine grins of ease, signifying the level of comfort that such delineated surroundings incite.   In some ways allowing for such a heightened measure of relaxation in dining here is the fact that Heritage is rather dimly lit. Individual spotlights of sorts gleam down upon the restaurant's wooden tables, illuminating the contents of each as if to highlight and microspocially expose the depths of flavor concealed behind the façade of each dish. Regardless of the consequential exposition, the menu items at Heritage are so lavishingly bounding with flavor that catching sight of the entrée is by no means a requirement to the satisfactory enjoyment of the meal. Tastebuds will be busy at work, decoding the exemplary flavor profiles of ingredients both  foreign and familiar.   Notably melding these two classes was the wagyu beef & crispy shrimp dish that we sampled. The beef was deliciously prepared with a charentais melon glaze, and the tempura-style shrimp was ever so succulent and perfectly tender. The roast chicken & truffled spinach tortellini that I had ordered was similarly phenomenal. I welcomed the fact that the horseradish cream sauce of the dish was more reminiscient of an alfredo, and the chicken was incredibly like butter as far as texture and nowhere near being dry. The tortellini component of the entrée and the gaufrette potatoes both added to the overall heartiness of the meal and were beautifully paired with pancetta, wilted spinach, and cardoon, making for a satiating entrée that's not slack on flavor.   Despite the wild flavor variations within and between each dish, each meal at Heritage encapsulates the overall farm-to-table theme of the menu that is very much so Madison's inherent specialty in terms of its culinary scene. Similar to nearby eateries, Heritage Tavern reaps the benefits of its sorrounding local farming communities and their inevitable plethora of sustainable produce and ingredients. While the concept may not be incalcuably original, I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast and Cocktail - a little disappointed they were out of the Croissant we wanted to try, but we will come back!"}
{"text":"I came to the Heritage late at night and the atmosphere came off a little pretentious but I can't deny how good the drinks were. Definitely have to keep it to one or two drinks as it is an expensive place.  I also had the tempura fried cheese curds, bacon, and vegetables.  It was pretty good, but I've had better appetizers.  The quality of the drinks was definitely the best part of this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Every clean, well organized restaurant. Very very recommended"}
{"text":"It was as good as expected. All staff was attentive, friendly and efficient. Food was excellent, at the same level of other good restaurants in Madison such as L'Etoile or Harvest but with a younger atmosphere.   Dishes are perfect size and provide good options for those interested in meat or fish as well as vegetarians. Might need more coordination but I guess is a matter of time (we got our wine 5-7 minutes after the meal, the waiting time between the starters and main course was on the long side but nothing outrageous). It is on the loud edge but bearable. Value was very good. Will come back."}
{"text":"Top 3 high/lowlights   1) unique menu 2) intimate atmosphere 3) great wine selection  Had dinner with some co-workers on Tuesday night at Heritage Tavern. We made a reservation and were seated right away. They have a coat check which is really nice in the winter. There is enough room for you to move around here while still keeping the atmosphere really intimate. Heritage has a  unique drink and dinner menu (with a lot of ingredients I have never heard of!). I got a cider (they have one on tap!). We also got a bunch of appetizers including a meat and cheese plate, lamb tartare, and the shrimp tempura. The meat and cheese plate included pickled watermelon rinds which I had never had before, I thought they were good but definitely not for everyone I was with. The lamb tartare was served with potato chips and the combination was great. I didn't eat the tempura (as you can expect it's not gluten free) but everyone at the table really liked it, especially since it came with deep fried, bacon wrapped cheese curds. The menu has vegetarian and gluten free options clearly labeled. I had the chicken with crawfish cream sauce (gluten free!) for my entree and really enjoyed it. We were really impressed with the wine list as well. Only downside of Heritage Tavern is that the service is kind of slow. Our server kept leaving before anyone could ask her a question/order another drink, and it took a long time for our credit card to picked up."}
{"text":"Visited last night and it was fantastic!  I'm an avid Chef Dan Fox fan from his days at the Madison Club and was excited to check out his new venture.  This is a cozy welcoming and chic farm to table restaurant that met all of my expectations.  We arrived without reservations (oops) but were able to snag a table in the bar area.  Fun bustling activity and attentive wait staff made the bar table not feel bar-ish!     Our server Priscilla was fantastic as we perused the menu and ordered a string of snacks and appetizers.  The deviled egg sampler was phenomenally fun and original, without being too off the beaten path...see the pictures I posted (the beet pickled egg was my favorite!).  We also loved the soup on the menu that was a squash base with an essence of coconut, poblano peppers, and a reisling cream....yum (I posted a picture of this too)!  Their complimentary relish and bread tray was equally fantastic with divine bread and butter and a sampler of pickled vegetables.  We are already planning a dinner back with reservations to sit in the dining room with friends!  Way to go Dan!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's very attractive, the service and food is excellent. It's quite pricey, so I don't go as often as I do to other downtown restaurants."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Service was slow and mistakes made with order. The food was not great considering all the hype I had read about it. I did like the decor but not enough to return for ho hum food and bad service."}
{"text":"We are here for our anniversary.  We drove in from Chicago and were not disappointed.    We started with the deviled eggs - a very unique not what you expect experience.    My wife got the pork schnitzel and it was great.   I got a steak and it was above average but in hindsight I would have gotten something else.    For dessert we got the pecan profiteroles and they were WONDERFUL !  They have a maple ice cream in the middle instead of some whipped filling like I have had other times and it was great.    There were plenty of wait staff so we felt very taken care of.    It was a great night."}
{"text":"Went to Heritage for my birthday dinner with a group of 5 last night. While the service was good and the ambiance pretty neat, the food just didn't live up to my lofty expectations.  Highlights: 1.) Great appetizers and desert plates 2.) innovative ingredients and dishes 3.) Phenomenal service (our waiter, Paul, was very attentive) 3.) underwhelming quality of the entree  Starters: We had the deviled egg plate, which came with one dozen eggs, 3 of 4 different kinds. On the menu for us was a sake egg (tasted like sushi!), a fried egg, an egg with a beef tartar and garnished with who knows what else, and an egg made with truffle oil (easily my favorite). It's evident that the chef knows what he's doing, as the innovation and the presentation of the dish was wonderful.  Although the eggs looked nice, they were ultimately just an OK tasting dish. In addition, we had some pickled whitefish livers. Now THESE were absolutely amazing, and probably my favorite dish of the night.  For main entrees, my sister and I both got the bouillabaisse, and my parents got the lake sturgeon and octopus, and the pork skank, respectively. While they both enjoyed the presentation and taste of their dishes, mine left me a bit underwhelmed. Unfortunately, the broth was SO salty, it was hard to appreciate all the other flavors that were present in the dish.   We finished dinner with a cognac served with ice cream, which was also absolutely astounding. Unfortunately, the strengths of the individual appetizers and dessert was overshadowed (at least for me) by the lack of execution in the main dish. When I go to a restaurant which is going to charge me ~$30/ entree, I expect an amazing product. Heritage didn't deliver in this regard, which put a cloud over the rest of the meal.   Given the bevy of other fine dining restaurants in Madison, I will be trying a few other establishments before heading back here. Heritage has a lot of potential, but the execution just wasn't there this time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer. White fish delicious followed by stonefruit tartlet. Service excellent"}
{"text":"Pork arrived frozen in the center. My husband asked for it to be cooked more and the waiter was highly offended by the request. We were not being unreasonable especially considering the food borne illnesses transmitted via undercooked pork. The waiter was so rude in response to my husband's request that we ended up leaving without finishing our meal. We did not receive any apology for the poor treatment. If you are looking for a nice meal, there are plenty of other high quality restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We went with friends to try this place. The food was absolutely astounding!   This is definitely a \"special occasion\" restaurant tho.  Really expensive.  BUT, don't let that stop you from trying it!  You will NOT be sorry!! Like everyone else has said, be sure to order the 12 deviled eggs.  Each one a taste experience!"}
{"text":"Dined at Heritage Tavern Friday night for the first time. I have to say that this restaurant is by far the best restaurant in Madison. The menu at \"Heritage\" is simply to die for...\" So many excellent choices, I had a very difficult time choosing what to eat! We started with the Steak tartare and the candied nut appetizer. Both are wonderful, but the steak tartare was divine! Roasted beet salad one of the best salads ever...now for the entree's; my son ordered the canard duck, he is a chef and he thought this was fantastic, the preparation and the plating were superb. I ordered the flounder, this was also prepared perfectly. The whole experience at Heritage was professional and the timing between dishes perfect! Loved our waiter Kevin, he is helpful with suggestions without being intrusive. This was one of the best meals I have had the pleasure to enjoy in Madison. If I didn't know better, I would think that I was in Brooklyn NY."}
