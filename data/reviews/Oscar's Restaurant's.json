{"text":"Always great service; always great food. I've been coming here and sharing meals with colleagues and business partners for years: never a disappointment."}
{"text":"First time trying here. Wow! The service was amazing. Our server went above and beyond. Even cleaned off my babies special placemat bowl I brought along! The food was really good. Hubby had the smoked meat sandwich (I tried it too yum) I had the pepper steak (yum) the steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it. The food came out sooooo fast which Is nice when you have a 13 month old who doesn't sit still. Will definitely go back. Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad and brother, our first time there. As Lynn said for kids there was a cup of crayons, a colouring page and the kids  menu on it. Kids have three choices chicken fingers with fries, penne with tomato sauce, or grilled cheese and fries. I had the beef dip which comes with au jus or gravy, i had gravy. And a side of fries, salad, ot sweet potato fries for $2 more. I had sweet potato fries which came with a tartar sauce but i dipped them in gravy instead. My dad who couldn't decide, got the daily special  of chicken stuffed with spinach and baby shrimp with a side of rice and veggies. My brother got the chicken fingers and fries with kids size pepsi.m the service was great, waitress was friendly. We went on a wednesday afternoon so not busy at all. Plus they have chocolate mints candy you can grab on your  way out. Price was reasonable about $20 per person."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch over the holidays. We all had sandwiches, which were great. I also had the french onion soup, which was the best I've ever had. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Only thing good about this place was the service. Had the smoked meat sandwich which was very small, served on dry rye bread with absolutely nothing on the 2 slices of bread only the smoked meat. Brought out a small bottle of how mustard. The meal was very over priced. I will not be returning too this place."}
{"text":"I really love coming here for lunch. The ladies are so pleasant and love catering to the kids. There is a kid's menu printed on a coloring sheet and they give them a cup of crayons. Everything on the menu is done well from chicken finger and fries to a Philly cheese steak sandwich and chicken quesadilla! If you're into more fancier food you're also able to order from the Wellington's menu since they share the same kitchen. And as for dessert... OMG is it ever good! The chocolate cake with raspberry coulis is something out of heaven! The prices are reasonable. It's a diner more than a fancy restaurant for sure, but it's much better than any diner I've tried."}
{"text":"This was my wife's favourite restaurant when she was younger, but she had not been in years. It was not as she remembered. Service was disinterested at best and our steak, supposed to be medium-rare was over cooked on the outside and raw in the middle.

We would have sent it back, but we were with some older folks. Most of the clientele was older...perhaps remembering better days at Oscars!"}
