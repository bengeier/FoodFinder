{"text":"Really amazing place...food is delicious and produce used was of very good quality and so fresh ...staff is so warm and welcoming ...will definitely be visiting again"}
{"text":"True Mexican food and this coming from a native. Pupusa is the best I've tried outside of Mexico. Homemade sauce, yummy chips, and fresh & delicious guacamole. True hidden gem! A little hard to find (maybe a bigger sign would help) but so worth it."}
{"text":"Friendly owner, very helpful describing the menu. Tacos are great, a little on the small side though. Chips and guacamole are great as well and given complimentary when you dine in.   All in all probably the best Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great little taco spot! It's located right at the back of the plaza, was a little hard for us to find at first. The owner was really friendly and explained everything on the menu to us. We tried the fish, chicken and beef tacos and they were delicious! Highly recommend the fish, it was the best one. They also have Mexican coke, which is made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, so it's worth a try if you're a soda fan. Would definitely come here again to try the other menu items!"}
{"text":"Very nice little place. The owner greeted us when we walked in and explained the concept and menu to us. The focus is on homemade mexican tacos, with other options such as burritos and quesadillas. The tacos were simple but each meat was very flavorful. And you can mix and match tacos to sample different types. They are working on creating a taco al pastor variety for the menu, which I'm sure will be very good! They also have various traditional mexican drinks available."}
{"text":"The owner is polite, friendly, helpful and from Acapulco, Mexico. Why is it important that I mention he's Mexican? It means authentic and delicious Mexican food!  After ordering my meal, the owner brought nachos with a red and green salsa on the side to the table, for free!   I got the chicken taquitos which came with 4 small crispy chicken tacos, topped with lettuce, tomato, authentic Latin cream and cheese. It came with a side of guacamole and salsa. That only cost $4.99.  It was delicious, a nice cozy place and positive vibes. Will definitely be recommending this little gem to family and friends. Already planning my next family outing there :)"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service was great.  This is a family run place and they're all very nice.  I went with my family and they made us feel very comfortable.  Definitely recommend and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been living with the pain of not having authentic Mexican food in the city. With all honesty Canadians are terrible at criticizing foreign food. However my woe's have vanquished when I came across this restaurant Yesterday. The food is 100% authentic with the owner and workers being Mexican. Apart from the food being spectacular the hospitality that they provide is that of people who genuinely care  about there craft.   Si Eres una persona que extrana la comida y hospitalidad Mexicana este restaurante es para ustedes. Yo a provado comida en todo la cuidad de Toronto incluindo el mercado latino pero este restaurante es unico. Cuando comes la comida te das cuenta que tiene algo especial, como si la comida ha sido hecho con mucho amor y detalle."}
{"text":"First time here, the place is small but not crowded or messy. Very clean, bright and airy.   I had the four taquitos - very good and surprisingly filling. The guac had visible chunks of avocado and other goodies in it, each taquito had a wicked crunch and the filling was very good.  The other party had 3 tacos: fish, brisket and pulled pork. The fish was AMAZING, very light and fresh that was very nicely complemented by the toppings.   Definitely going to make this one of my regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"First off the moment we walked in the staff greeted us and explained the menu. You could sense that they cared about the business and wanted to provide a good experience. My bf ordered the original with 3 tacos (chicken, carnitas and chorizo) and a generous portion of meat was given and he liked all 3. I had the tierra picante (i'm a vegetarian) which is portobello and cremini mushrooms in a burrito. There was a very generous amount of mushrooms inside the burrito. As I worked my way through the burrito there was a different mix of flavours in each section...creamy avocado, buttery mushrooms, tangy salsa, crispy lettuce and hearty rice with black beans. There was so much I wasn't able to finish the entire thing. We ordered a side of guac and chips ($4.25) which the staff gave to us complimentary. The food and service garners this place a second visit."}
{"text":"This place has a very inviting familial feel, and the food is amazing. They have some choice in meat for the different dishes, and also a nice selection of unique imported sodas. Had the soft tacos and they were delicious, fresh, and a perfect amount of spicy (not too much not too little). Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This is the best taco spot hands down! The service is phenomenal and their tacos are absolutely amazing. We got the fish tacos (A MUST TRY!) and the veggie, chicken and pulled pork tacos. We also got the taquitos which as the tacos, were amazing.  A must try and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food was delicious (got the fish, beef and pork tacos) and the owner/manager was so friendly and upbeat will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Mexican food in the past and I would recommend this place.  We got from sh tacos, steak tacos, and chicken quesadillas. The fish tacos were some of the best I've ever had.  They can improve on the guacamole- it needs a kick.  The service was great and I would come back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and a great atmosphere! This is gonna be my night joint whenever I'm in the area.   Recommendations:  carnita tacos and carnita nachos"}
{"text":"Hey Yelp! I don't write many reviews... 1) Just wanted to share that their nachos are the real type of nachos that I've tasted in Central America (Guatemala).  2) Their two drinks - some purpley one and HORCHATA (spelling?) (is the rice cinnamony drink) were sooooooooooooo authentic. They need to market their two drinks because they were made by themselves! I saw one dude make the purple drink when I was on my way to the washroom.  The person who served us was the best.   Thanks again. Keep up the great work.  Jenny"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after reading great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint! The service was excellent - very friendly and welcoming staff. Food tasted fresh and authentic. Plus you get a healthy serving of chips and delicious salsa while you wait. Best Mexican restaurant around! Beef brisket, carnitas, and fish tacos are a must try."}
{"text":"This has been the best Mexican restaurant I have been to by far.  The food was delicious and the service was very accommodating, thoughtful and the staff were very friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"5 stars! Really good and authentic tasting. The owners are super friendly, food came out fast! Differently coming back"}
{"text":"Who would have thought... A delicious family run authentic Mexican gem in Woodbridge??? Small menu, big flavors and great prices! The fish tacos were delicious and the staff super friendly and attentive. A MUST TRY for yourself."}
{"text":"Taquitos, quesadillas, pork, beef and chicken tacos very good.  Excellent service! Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent Food. Everything is made in house. One of the best places for tacos etc outside of the city."}
{"text":"I went here after a friend recommended this place and I have to say, this is quite a hidden gem.   We came here on Friday night and vibe was casual. You wouldn't really have to call in to book a table because it's a order then find your own seats kinda place. When we went in, we were greeted by a guy who works there and he was super enthusiastic about food, taking his time to explain to us everything on the menu.   We ended up ordering 9 tacos and two drinks, the store gives you free chips on the side for you to enjoy while you wait for the order. The food was very delicious, the flavours were good and the combinations were perfect in each taco. I would personally recommend the Mexican sausage taco ( I forgot the actual name but if you ask, he'll know which one )!!!   Overall the experience was superb - staff were friendly, and the food was good!! Definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly spot for some fresh authentic Mexican food. A straightforward, uncomplicated menu. Had burritos with some nice cold Modelo. Would certainly recommend for those who enjoy real Mexican food."}
{"text":"The tacos far exceeded my expectations! The fish taco is absolutely wonderful.  Overall ambience was enjoyable and the server was very friendly with menu options.  The only downside was the pricey home made juice which didn't really fit my taste."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican.  Super fresh hand made tacos, nachos and quesadillas. We WILL be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I'm a very tough critic when it comes to Mexican food, especially tacos. I've eaten alot of them in Toronto, Mexico, and alot of places inbetween. This place has very good authentic  proper Mexican tacos. Lots of varieties to choose from, I tried them all, all were great. No complaints. 5star food, service, easy parking, overall experience. Can't wait to go back, maybe tomorrow."}
{"text":"I went to Ay Caramba, Eh on Cinco De Mayo. Luckily we called ahead because the restaurant's kitchen was backed up with called in orders.   We started off with nachos that had the works and shredded beef. It was sooooooo good! I also had the carnita, fish and beef tacos which were good as well. A little smaller than expected though. Customer service was also great!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to. My family and friends are all on an Ay Caramba diet because of me! The owner genuinely wants you to enjoy the food and will go above and beyond to ensure you do.  I personally am in love with their pupusas, which happen to be the best I've ever tasted. A bit different in a very good way compared to your regular pupusa. Keep in mind the these are available on Friday's and Saturday's only. On other days my go-to's are the fish tacos as well as the burritos. Everything is fresh and delicious so no matter what you try here you will love it!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Mexican place outside of downtown Toronto and I think I've found my place.   Came here for lunch and was greeted by the owner who was super friendly and told us about his menu. We decided to try the tacos (3 for 10.99) and tortas and ordered some chips with guac.   Everything was super delicious. The chips were nice and very crispy. I ordered the chorizo, chicken, and carnita tacos. All were garnished and flavoured very well. The carnita torta was quite large but it was so good we were able to finish it all.   The only regret I have is not trying the fish tacos. But that means ill be going back for them next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!!! I am definitely coming back. I would recommend the tacos, quesadilla, but not the sandwich. The food here is very authentic, it's a small cute intimate place and even though it's not exactly a restaurant - their service is still amazing. They give complimentary home made chips with hot sauce. It is a bit pricey but worth it. All I can say is I was very happy and I am definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"We had a great time. The owner is really nice and guided us as first timers through the menu and told us about their in-house drinks and hot sauces. Fantastic tacos, we really enjoyed the fish taco. Great taco place in an unexpected location!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and it was absolutely amazing! We had the nachos and the tacos and it was by far one of the best Mexican food spots I have ever been to. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming to us. If I didn't live in the USA, I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, and the staff are so friendly and accommodating. My favourite tacos are el poyito, fish, and chori cheese. So yummy!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in the staff was great! I was asked if I've been there before and the menu was explained to me. The place is kind of like a fast food joint where you order your food and you seat and they bring out the food. I think it wasn't very busy, so we were actually serviced our food. It was very nice of them to do so.  I love tacos and I've been to many taco joints in Toronto. Decided to try this one since I was in Vaughn already. I ordered the 3 tacos for $10.99 choice of any 3 tacos out of 6 different ones. I had 2 fish tacos and a braised beef. The fish tacos were the better one. The tacos were on corn tortilla and served with a hand full of chips. It was overall good. I would say 6/10 on the tacos. It's very good for a local joint, but in terms of comparison to Toronto I've had better. I also ordered the nachos on the side for $7.99. I wouldn't really recommend getting these as it's a bit pricey and it's not the best. It taste like something you could make at home. I would save the $7.99 and they also give you a free side of chips and salsa already so with the tacos it was actually a bit too much food anyway.   Overall, this location is a good local Vaughn restaurant, but if you want better tacos and nachos I suggest driving down to Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had in a long time.  Food is delicious and service friendly.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food was extremely bland (I got the vegetarian tacos) and they give you really small amounts of salsas and guac to eat with the giant basket of chips. But the service was really nice, not too many people were and the food came out fairly quick. I'll give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent! Get there and try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed. Many thanks for the warm welcome and delicious tacos!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times service was excellent. Very friendly people who happily explained the menu to my group. The restaurant is relatively small and can get very busy around lunch. They give complementary chips as we wait for our food to come out. Menu is also not too pricy."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is excellent and the staff is great. They always provide a snack while you wait for your food. I recommend to anyone who wants great Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever had. A must try if your in the area! If your not, worth a little trip."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! We were in town visiting just 1 night and ate here twice with our kids...it was that good! Not only is the food amazing, the owner and workers provide excellent service. These people really know how to run a business!"}
{"text":"Chiming in with what others have said, the customer service here is phenomenal.   The tacos served here are very similar to those offered downtown and they're just as tasty!   I came here at night and after ordering our food and sitting down, I realized they were gonna close in 10 minutes.. I so did not want to be that guy that stays past closing lol.   I preceded to scarf down my food as fast as possible and despite almost closing, the guy who worked there took some time and made small talk with us. Greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"Great little fast food/take-out style restaurant hidden in a plaza in Vaughan that serves up delicious Mexican cuisine!  We ordered the nachos with chorizo, fish haddock tacos, carnitas, beef brisket and taquitos. Everything was fresh and made to order. The taquitos was fried a bit too long so was very difficult to eat through. The staff was incredibly nice and entertained my extremely poor Spanish skills.   I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Vaughan does not have a lot of variety in restaurants so this is a hidden gem that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. It tastes really fresh and extremely authentic. The staff is super friendly and quite knowledgeable as well."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow wow wow wow wow! Do you know how to spell Mexican food when you're in Vaughan? Simple - Ay Caramba, Eh! So why am I so emphatic about this remarkable hidden gem located in the back of a plaza which most restaurants would fail in? Because they do authentic street-style Mexican food... simply and do it well. No frill, no weird fusion like Korean beef tacos. NOPE! Just simple true ingredients that real Mexican people would use to feed their families! Muy Bueno!  It's a small shop, with limited seating but don't let that turn you off, these tacos are so easy to eat you really don't need a seat... eat them-them the REAL way, standing up with your head tilted to the side! Then as you mow through your first 3, point at the staff and toss up 3 fingers to signal you want another 3 - you totally will.  I've had every taco on the menu and I can't pick a fave. The beef, the pork, the chicken, even the fish. Light, flavourful, and always hit the spot.   Other menu spotlights are they make their own hibiscus juice and other authentic Mexican beverages in-house AND even make their own tortilla chips with matching guac and salsa.   It's a 5-star Mexican experience that will have you exclaiming AY, CARAMBA by the end!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Have been craving authentic Mexican food since my trip to Seattle and this place hit the spot. The owner was very friendly and explained the menu thoroughly. They have an interesting variety of Mexican sodas. On the menu are burritos, tacos, mexicana style sandwiches, and nachos. Out of those my favorites are the mushroom and pulled pork tacos. The guacamole is also the best I've had in a long time. Hoping they get enough demand so they can add grilled fish tacos to the menu. Great food, excellent service. I'm going to be back many times I'm sure."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Woodbridge! I first came across this place by fluke while searching on Yelp for new places that have opened in the area. My first experience there was great! Had the chorizo burrito and it was delicious. The owner was very friendly and helpful. He explained the menu to me and made some recommendations. I have been back many times and never been disappointed! New favorite is the fish tacos with a side of guacamole!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Food is slightly overpriced but they give you free chips and salsa so that makes up for it. Location is a little small and fills up fast."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday around noon and it wasn't to busy.  Pros: - Authentic feel - Nice ambiance - Good tasting food - Good service   Cons: - Pricey for the quantity offered (tacos are small) - Washroom is in the back past the kitchen"}
{"text":"Non-descript place in the back of a suburban strip mall offering perhaps the best assortment of tacos I've ever had. Portions are a bit small, and the price is a bit high; however, quality is outstanding! Highly recommend. Helpful staff."}
{"text":"Yelp is right again.  This is a small place in the back of the shopping center, but it has good food and good service. I tried the fish, chicken and pork tacos.  The pork was amazing!! The guacamole is also excellent."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food tucked in a plaza in Woodbridge. The owner is extremely friendly and helpful. Tried the tacos and nachos with my daughter and we both loved the food. Portions are just right for the tacos but the nachos can be shared by 3-4 people at the very least. Place is small with like a few tables to dine in. It encourages the meal to be taken out. This place is the perfect place for cheap eats but food quality is well above average. The only downside is as I mentioned earlier that it encourages take-out is that they do not have a washroom in the restaurant. Luckily I always carry wipes in the car with me. Food can be messy especially the type of food they serve so please be prepared. I surely will be returning soon. Love their tacos."}
{"text":"Today was my first time coming here on a friend's recommendation. What I found was friendly and knowledgeable service who truly seemed excited about the quality of the food they produce. Let me tell you, the food did not disappoint. Yummy gluten free authentic tacos were delicious as were their chips and quacamole and their homemade sauces. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yesterday night was my first time at Ay Caramba, Eh! It was amazing! Firstly, the atmosphere was very welcoming and the vibes were great. The food was so good! I tried the chicken, fish and beef brisket tacos and all three were wonderful! My favourite was the fish! The guac was fresh and chips were good as well. The service was great and quick. Will definitely return again!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos.  Very nice staff.  This place is great.  The tacos are all amazing.  My favorite is chorizo.  Super nice staff too.  Too bad they close so early."}
{"text":"Rating: 4 1/2* for the food and the extra 1/2* for the service.   After reading the review of a fellow Yelper, I needed to visit this place to see if the rave reviews were deserved. I love tacos and I find that in Toronto/GTA, it's hard to find a place that does tacos well.   We went to Vaughan Mills and decided to come here for lunch. It's located by Rutherford and the 400, deep inside a plaza. The place is small with approximately 20 people. You order and pay in the front, grab a table and they'll bring you the food.   The Good: The fish taco, the beef brisket taco and the beef brisket burrito are solid choices. Also the Chorizo is really good. The hot sauces are not \"hot\" but gives a nice kick to the food. Get it from the counter.   The Average: The Carnitas are just okay. That's the only downside from the dishes we ordered. Prices are not cheap.   It was nice for the workers to ask us how our meal was and see if we were okay.   It was one of the better tacos in the GTA but I still think the Nahual tacos are better.   #49 of 2018"}
{"text":"Very simple setting. Best Mexican in the area. The menu has a good range of choices. The nachos are a mountain of a feast. The taquitos were perfect for a small meal. The taco trio was delicious with fish, carnita and beef options we had. Service is quick and personable. Not a surprise it is so highly rated."}
{"text":"Quick, casual, affordable and impeccable service. Food was packed with flavour and portions were decently sized. I was genuinely surprised as it's hard to find Mexican (good Mexican) food in the area. It definitely is a notch above the rest. The spacing inside is rather small, it seems to be more of a takeout location then a sit down restaurant. As we were leaving the owner sincerely thanked us for helping out small businesses which left a great impression with us.   Highly recommend, would be coming again soon."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos! Got the brisket, carnitas and fish. They are tiny but good!! We also got the taquitos as my son was still hungry. Chips were complimentary but I always get a bag to go. Salsa was tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! The food totally justifies the ratings. Fish tacos are dynamite and the horchata is a must try. Keep up the good work - can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good service. Food was good but needed a little more taste. The nachos seems a bit bland. The nice surprise is that they have pupusa's on the weekends. I would definitely come back again. Except they need some forks:)  you can take out or to go."}
{"text":"First off, let me start off by saying that I absolutely love Mexican food. That being said, I was super happy when I found out this new place opened up right near my house. I went in on a Saturday morning, and was greeted by the super friendly owner. He told us all about the menu and even gave us chips on the house! It was a really good vibe from the get-go.  For tacos, we ordered the fish, el poyito, chori-cheese, and the tierra picante. All of them were really tasty but my favourite was the fish taco. Oh my goodness. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this fish taco was. It just melted in my mouth and I finished it in about 10 seconds. We also ordered the el poyito burrito which was also good (although the tacos were better).   Overall, it was an amazing experience and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh tacos at a decent price. It's still a bit pricy as three tacos usually isn't enough to fill you up if that's all you're eating. they have a great selection of Mexican drinks. I love the pineapple Fanta in the glass bottle. My favourite is the shredded pulled chicken taco"}
{"text":"Once i walked in the guy/owner was really awesome, asked me if it was my first time then explained everything on the menu to me. The nachos were on the house as for the tacos i got Fish,beef brisket and carnita all of it was real good but i wish the fish came in 1 full piece and not 2 pieces cause it fell apart for me. Awesome place i would recommend it and will be back."}
{"text":"Went to this little restaurant for lunch. The food was delicious. Very authentic Mexican cuisine. The restaurant was quaint and had great decor. The tacos were tasty, $11.99 for three. Homemade salsa. The chips were tasty too. Definitely would go back. The meal was a little pricey to spend on lunch. $21.00 for three small tacos, chips and salsa and a bottle of fanta orange. I'd still go back but pass on the $3 bottle of pop. My dentist and doctor both tell me to stay away from pop anyways. Try the restaurant out, little hard to find though, it's tucked in the back."}
{"text":"After a long day at Wonderland we decided to grab a bite to eat, outside of the park. I pulled pulled up yelp and saw this place had great reviews, and that they have pupusas. I was SO EXCITED. I haven't had a pupusa since I left Austin. I tried to temper my expectations since the majority of the mexican food I've had since moving to Canada has been depressing to say the least. I was so pleasantly surprised. He took the time to explain the ingredients, which was funny to me since obviously I'm familiar, but I didn't want to be rude and interrupt, lol. Food was fast, he gave us complimentary chips, and everything tasted great. It will be our go to in the future for when we're at the park.  The only thing I'd change is having fountain drinks or at least the availability of non bottled water."}
{"text":"We were in search of some good food after a long morning of service and we noticed the name of this place.  We stopped into this little shop and they were just opening up for business. They were super friendly and we ordered a variety of things from pupusas (off menu specialty at the time), to burritos and tacos. Between the group of us, we ordered most of the things on the menu. A few of us having lived in southern California for a while, we have grown a taste for Mexican foods, and we know what's good. This place really hit the spot for us. All the food came out fast, fresh and super tasty. Chips were great, all varieties of tacos were amazing, and the service from the staff just put it over the top from us. If you come at the right time it'll be crowded as there isn't a lot of seating available. But if you manage to get a seat you'll enjoy the decor along with the food. Seriously, their food is amazing. I recommend the fish tacos. and their tortas are to die for! You really can't go wrong with anything you order here!"}
{"text":"Simple, delicious, authentic Mexican food. I had the trio of tacos while my wife had the fish burrito. Great flavours in every dish. Don't expect to see or eat anything drowning in cheese or heavy sauces. Just good plain ingredients served extraordinarily well!  I'll be back...very soon."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for almost a year and I'm so glad I was finally in the area last week to check it out!   A small shop tucked away in one of the plazas across from Vaughan Mills, this place was fully seated at around 7pm. Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long because the turnover of tables was relatively quick.   My boyfriend and I weren't that hungry so we shared 3 tacos (brisket, fish, and beef) and an order of tacquitos. The food was delicious!! Our collective favourite was the brisket, it was so tender and juicy. They were generous with portions and the prices are fair. I love Mexican food and I honestly haven't found any place that's comparable to here in the GTA.  Noteworthy, the lady (who presumably is the owner) handled her restaurant services very professionally and gained my respect that night. Our order had somehow been lost in the kitchen and we hadn't received our tacos for about 30-45 minutes while 3 other tables had arrived AFTER us, ordered, eaten, and left already. We waited patiently but and the lady noticed we were in a bit of dismay so she apologized, followed up on our order, and offered to refund us the price of the tacos. She recognized the fault of her business and immediately took action to remedy it. Great customer service!  I would 100% come back in the future for my taco fix and I'd definitely recommend friends to come check it out when they're in the area."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Cashier explained the entire menu, how it works and was very friendly!  Sadly the tacos weren't the same.. Got one of each taco, they looked good but looks aren't everything. Flavour wise nothing tasted fresh. The pulled chicken, pork, beef was like straight from the freezer you could still taste the condensation even though it was warmed up. Chorizo was the best one I tried and it was just alright. The reviews brought us here but were I don't know if we'll be back. The fish was cooked in old oil, the batter on the fish was almost black. Maybe it was just today but I'm not sure. I love tacos though"}
{"text":"This was a great find! Nestled at the very corner of the plaza is Ay Caramba, Eh. Sign was a little bit hard to see, its a green sign that doesn't look like a mexican restaurant sign.  The place was small but cozy, 7-8 tables? And about 2-3 of those tables are for 2 people. Has very nice decorations and incredible friendly and helpful staff. Felt very comfortable and well attended.  We ordered Burrito with Carnitas, Quesadilla(chicken?) and they give you free chips, we ordered a side of guacamole.  Starting from the starters we enjoyed the guacamole a lot! We ordered seconds! Guacamole tasted fresh and authentic. We would definitely come back for the guacamole alone(said my girlfriend).  I had the quesadillas, i was expecting them be okay. But my god, when I began eating they were delightful! Chicken was well cooked, tortillas we well toasted and the cheese tasted great! Pair that with their side of guacamole that's included with it, i enjoyed it immensely! Probably one of the best quesadillas that I have eaten.  My girlfriend had the burrito, same as me she wasn't expecting to like it. She's not a very heavy eater, nor does she like densely packed stuff. But this burrito changed her mind, it was evenly proportioned and well balanced. Everything inside was great! The rice, beans and carnitas were cooked perfectly and everything in that burrito clicked. It wasn't densely packed, over stuffed with rice and droopy from all the stuff inside. I enjoyed it and she enjoyed it as well!  Over-All, i was always on the look out for a mexican place to go to. And behold! The best one that i've been to. I haven't enjoyed a meal like that in a while, we were both smiling and talking about the food even after we left. We will definitely be coming back! And I hope people will try this awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love the tacos here . Typically go to Kensington market for tacos but This is the next best thing sign out the drive back and from toronto saving 1.5 hours . The service is excellent , the food is superb and the restaurant is nice and clean . I eat there once every two weeks . It's worth trying ."}
{"text":"I wanted to know what the hype was all about, so my friend and I decided to stop by and have a few bites.   When we got in we realized the place is actually so small, there isn't much space to sit if we were bringing more than 5 people. As we made our way to the front, we told the gentlemen it was our first time here and he basically went over the menu with us and told us the most popular dish.   We decided to get the El Poyito Tacos. As we waited for our order, he brought over some tortilla chips on the house. The chips were really good, but the two sauces he provided weren't that great. It came with chipotle and jalapeño sauce but it wasn't even spicy.   We got our food in a decent time, about 2-4 minute wait. As we got our food it looked so good. As we had the first bite, it was bad. I felt like they were bland and didn't have any taste, even though it was chicken.  The guy came around asking if everything is good and encouraged us to come back. I would definitely go back, but like to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"4.5 super friendly staff at this small taco joint.   I tried 3 tacos for $11.99: fish taco (my fave!) beef brisket tierra picante (mushrooms/vegetarian)   all very flavourful, not very spicy (but there's lots of hot sauce available). Probably need 6 tacos to be filling since they're on the smaller side. Nevertheless, I enjoyed all 3 tacos.  Great taco place, wonderful atmosphere. The place is small which makes it more of a take-out joint. Will come back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were good. The nachos and guacamole weren't that good. The chips were stale and the guacamole had no flavour. The quesadilla was alright. The owner wasn't he nicest. He had greeted many people in the restaurant and checked on them but hadn't acknowledged us. We had a nice young girl serve us though.  Still, really not the greatest place."}
{"text":"So good words are not enough Best taco I've ever had   Make sure to order the fish taco and the mushroom   The guacamole never disappoints me"}
{"text":"My favourite Mexican place in the area. The staffs are very friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. Also provides chips at no extra cost.  I think the portion is too small for the price though.  Maybe because of the free chips?"}
{"text":"First time here. I asked what's vegan and they recommended Tierra Picante tacos.  Tierra Picante = portobello and cremini mushroom. Very delicious! I also tried Tierra Picante burrito and that was delicious too. Safe to say this is the best and most authentic tacos I have ever tasted. I will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"By far the cleanest restaurant I've been to (including kitchen). The owner is a fantastic guy and always very attentive to the needs of the customers. Food is quite good and consistent."}
{"text":"Insanely friendly.  They even stayed open for us past closing. Small seating area, very cool style and extremely clean.  We had the Carnitas and the Fish tacos... both were superb.  It's pretty tucked away... we called them and they happily guided us in. Do not give up looking for it because it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing little tacos. Very well prepared with choice of three tasty salsas. The owner was very friendly and hospitable, recommending the Horchata drink which is made with coconut... outstanding. We each had fish, carnitas and beef... they were all very delicious especially with the added heat. I love the tortillas they were yellow corn and very thin.. We'll be regulars."}
{"text":"Was good tasting and very fresh, little but expensive. Messed up my buddies order. Probably the best authentic tacos you could find in the area."}
{"text":"Ay Caramba !....these folks really know how to treat a guy. These tacos might look small but they are packed with some fresh authentic flavour. Hard to find a good taco/ Mexican place nowadays. I love that they are also not stingy with there hot sauces , chips or guacamole which was a big plus for me. I will be making this one of my regular places to revisit when in the area. If you don't know what anything is don't hesitate to ask!...they're very inviting and they've  got some impressive knowledge and that great hospitality to make you feel right at home. Kudos to the lady at the register you made my day .  So much Option and variety of authentic dishes to try. Truly the authentic Mexican experience (if you've ever been to Mexico you know what I mean)   BTW they make the meanest fish taco. I had to get more on my way out"}
{"text":"Stumbled here exhausted post wonderland and it was PERFECT! Casual, friendly atmosphere and yummy, well priced food. Wished I lived closer.got the trio tacos and they were all delicious! A bit small but authentic"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place (recommended by someone) and finally had the chance tonight. The fish tacos were great, and so were the nachos and sauces. The service was amazing. They were so friendly and even though we stayed past closing they told us we could take our time since they still had cleaning to do. I love small businesses that go the extra mile and put dedication into their work. I would come here again to try other stuff on the menu and refer others as well."}
{"text":"I keep wondering to myself why I haven't tried this place out sooner. It's a family owned business and everyone is so friendly here.   I've visited twice prior to writing this review. The first time was for take out, I went with the chicken, mushroom, and pork tacos. The food didn't take long to prepare and I was in and out within 10mins. I was also given complimentary chips and with salsa as well.   Ay Caramba Eh is a two minute drive to my house and as soon as I got home I dug in immediately. Everything was perfectly moist, had the right amount of seasoning and the toppings complimented the meat perfectly. The only downside was that the taco broke apart very easily. Most likely due to the take out container trapping heat and making the tacos soggy.   The second time I visited was for dine in. My friends and I got tacos and nachos to share. This time I tried the fish and beef. While my friends really enjoyed the fish taco, I preferred the beef. It was moist, perfectly seasoned and this time the taco didn't break apart. The nachos had generous amounts of topping on them, I just wish there were more cheese lol.   Overall I'd recommend this place but more for dining in than take out."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Portions a bit small but the food is great and fresh tasting. Free chips is appreciated and the smokey salsa dip was awesome."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying the people working at the restaurant are super nice! But I must say I got the three amigos and they weren't filling. The flavours were nice, I like the chicken taco better than the beef brisket. They were good though and I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a simple and casual meal. The place is take-out style but has a few tables to sit at. Mexican beverages and beers are available. Very clean and spacious. While we were there, we had a lovely conversation with Karen, who works at/owns the place. We talked about Latin American travels, languages, foods etc. She was so warm and friendly and walked us through the menu. We had 7 tacos in total along with their house made tamarind juice. Flavours of the meat were fantastic. Only con is the tacos are pretty small for its price ($5 for 1; $12 for 3) but they do deliver."}
{"text":"Not bad, friendly owner and food seemed decent enough to try a second time.  Tried the pork and chicken tacos.  Chicken was shredded and not Mexican street style; pork was good but nothing to compare it to as I never had a pork taco before.   Fish tacos are battered but I'd still like to try one day.  Nachos with guac served with meal were great."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo good so fresh!!! Best Mexican food I've had in Canada. I wish he was open later though, only open til 8pm. But overall so great. Clean. Friendly friendly service and amazing food. Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Finally! Authentic Mexican food here in GTA! We moved from Chicago 8 years ago and have been on the hunt for authentic Mexican food... No Fusion, no Tex-Mex...real Mexican! Ran across Ay caramba Eh from a Google search of the neighborhood... It is located in Woodbridge, conveniently located on Rutherford Rd by Hwy 400. Was hoping that it would at least be okay but Carlos and his staff exceeded our expectations! Customer service was above and beyond, the food was extraordinary! The flavors were amazing within the tacos. Seasoning was perfectly matched for each meat, they had fish tacos in addition to a portobello mushroom Taco...Again extraordinary! Been open for 3 weeks and it has already gained a huge following with good reason. Muchas gracias to Ay caramba Eh! and Great Fortune to you and yours!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and this place is great! Really reminds me of the awesome Mexican food I used to get in San Diego, right across from the Tijuana border.  Small and cozy place with only a handful of tables. It's towards the end of a strip mall so a little hard to find. You order at the front, go have a seat, and they bring the food to your table. The staff are very friendly and are patient explaining the different types of meat options.  The food is excellent here. When the nachos are home-made, freshly fried, and come with the red and green salsa, you know it's authentic (no, they don't serve Tostitos tortilla chips with Old El Paso Thick'n Chunky salsa here)! I've tried tacos with various meats, burrito, quesadilla, nachos, and they are all delicious.  The burritos, quesadilla, and nachos are quite reasonably priced. However, the tacos are quite pricey at $13 for three small pieces. I could easily eat 6 of these tacos and still be hungry, so best to order a burrito or torta as well, as those are more filling.  Overall, the food quality is great, most items are reasonably priced, and service is super friendly. Will continue to come back whenever passing through the area."}
{"text":"A refreshingly great tacos joint in the neighborhood.  Ay Caramba, Eh! is authentic fair in a clean and good vibes cozy spot.  Gluten free options are easy to choose.  An the staff are genuinely kind and capable.  Also love their house made drinks."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. The food is so so good. I have been trying to look for an authentic Mexican restaurant and his is the place. My boyfriend and I ordered nachos, tacos and quesadillas and they all taste amazing. Price points are very reasonable given how big the portions are! Not to mention the owner is very nice and friendly as well:). Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and tasty tortillas. Very nice would come again to try something different. Just think the amount paid for the quantity, the price is a bit more. Otherwise nice place."}
{"text":"Located at the very end of the plaza at Hwy 400 and Rutherford, Ay Caramba, Eh is a great place to find tacos, burritos, and nachos! Recently visited this restaurant for an event and decided to order 3 different tacos ($11.99). The employee recommended the Fish, beef, and carnitas. Each of them had a unique flavour, but my favourite was the fish taco! It was fried very nicely and the fish itself was still moist and flaky. Some of my tacos were on the small side, but I still enjoyed my experience and I recommend adding their dipping sauces for an extra kick!  The restaurant is quite small, but the employee told me the correct way of eating tacos is actually standing and that is how every mexican does it which explains the limited seating inside.   Overall, I would definitely come back to try the other tacos on the menu when I am in the area and hopefully there will be more mexican restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"***Please note that this establishment is, at the time this review was written, revamping the menu based on guest feedback. Please try it out and let them know what you'd want.***  It's sad that this place is almost hidden away in a corner because it's the first and maybe only example of solid mexican food anywhere in the area. Fresh chips and salsas greet you as you await your order.  Grabbed a beef burrito and a trio of chicken tacos. Very agreeable but lacking spice options. I hear their beer-battered haddock tacos are a crowd-pleaser.  I'll certainly go back, and if they could land a liqour license and a patio, I'd probably go every week."}
{"text":"Great very casual restaurant!!!!!! Tacos are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Really like this place, casual, quick, good food, friendly service, authentic and owned by a mexican family. exactly what I was looking for.  I popped in for dinner at about 6pm on a weeknight. I was travelling for work and was beat from the day, I just wanted to grab something quick and head back to the hotel to pass out. found this place based off of other yelp reviews. I drove here using Google maps... which gets you close but not to the actual restaurant. was a little hard to find in the back of a strip mall, but definitely worth it. I was the only one in there and I got the feeling I was the first customer in a little while. The guy who took my order was super friendly and told me about the restaurant while I waited for my order.  I order 3 tacos to go and a spiced hibiscus tea. I was also offered chips and salsa while I waited. nice touch! the tea and salsa were great, the salsas are made fresh in house, not from a jar. I wish I ate the tacos in the restaurant because they cooled off by the time I got home, but they were still stellar. I wasn't expecting to find an Authentic Mexican food option in the outskirts of Toronto!  all in all, I plan to come back the next time I'm in the area. they are off the beaten path and there wasn't a lot of trqffic, but it's effects worth seeking out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The whole family enjoyed everything we ordered. We we're in Toronto for the weekend and found this place on the app, read the reviews and gave it a shit. Absolutely no regrets. Hope they expand to Ottawa one day. We can use a great Mexican restaurant like this."}
{"text":"What a great little family run business in Vaughan. Our first visit will definitely not be our last. I plan to try everything on the menu.   We visited on our regular Friday night date night. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. I chose the three tacos which allow you to mix tacos. I decided to get two fish and one carnitas. The fish is amazing, lightly coated and crisp, absolutely delicious. The carnitas has to be one of the best I have tasted. My wife decides on a carnitas burrito and agrees this is the best carnitas she has every had. Don't come looking for the 5 lb burrito, this burrito is a sane size, a perfect meal. They have some very good sauces as well of varying heat.  The staff, members of the family, are friendly and welcoming, inviting you in as if you are part of the family. Making sure all their guests are well taken care of, bringing more chips, more salsa.   A wonderful Friday night date night!"}
{"text":"My new fav Mexican place.. if I'm in the area. The location is a bit far for me and they close pretty early on weekdays so it's hard for me to make it there after work. But workers there are so nice and the food is amazing so when I have the craving it's worth making the effort. We tried a bit of everything - taquitos, burrito,tacos, nachos and their special drinks.  This place is small and casual, and the prices are reasonable. You order and pay at the counter then they bring the food to your table.   The have bottled Coca-Cola made in Mexico where the sugar used is different. It's not a lot sweeter but a Coke lover would instantly taste the difference. We also tried the Mexican Street drink Horchata and the server patiently opened it up and mixed it for us before handing it over. It was a sweet coconut drink that was really refreshing. The taquitos were also loaded with toppings like salad and comes with small guacamole for dipping. All of their tacos were delicious but our favorite was the fish burrito. The burrito wrap was thin and nicely grilled packed with lots of fish, rice and filling. Our first bite into it was a speechless moment."}
{"text":"Had a craving for fish tacos and we went here to try it out based on pretty good Yelp reviews. Delicious tacos and tortilla chips!!! Friendly staff there too. Good portions, the nachos plate was huge and super filling! Only lost one star because...there is no washroom there. Better come in with clean hands since you are eating with your hands!"}
{"text":"An awesome, awesome Mexican restaurant! The space is energetic and the menu has photos and the owner kindly explains each item so it's easy to decide. We got the 3 tacos, chorizo quesadilla and the el poyito(pollito) burrito. The food comes with complimentary chips and salsa/salsa verde which is made in-house. Salsa verde is hot and spicy yet super creamy and refreshing and you can ask for more free of charge! They also have MEXICAN COKE! I have looked everywhere for it and this is the only place that I've seen that carries it. They also got Jarritos and Modelo so the whole family can enjoy whichever drink they prefer.   The food is so spot on and the love and care that goes into running this restaurant truly shines through. The ingredients are so fresh and the flavours just tie in together perfectly without being too salty or greasy (like many other joints). We came here after a full day in wonderland (just 1.5km away) and I'll be coming here whenever I'm in the area for either wonderland, vaughan mill mall or whenever!  I recommend the fish taco, tierra picante (vegetarian), el poyito(chicken) burrito! Try the salsa verde if you loveee a spicy kick! + Mexican coke"}
{"text":"If you're in Vaughan and craving Mexican food then this is probably one of the best, if not, the best option for you. Got the beef brisket in a quesadilla, but I'm pretty sure it'll taste just as good in a burrito or taco. Awesome, friendly service. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"For some reason every time I come here it's closed, lol. The tacos are very tasty and it's hard to find a good taco place in the area for sure. My only complaint is the price which is overpriced. I get almost tempted to head to Taco Bell and save me some $$! This is definitely a healthier option though."}
{"text":"Being from the united States I felt I had tasted some of the best tacos, I was wrong this place is amazing and the price is reasonable. Also while you wait your get free chips and salsa! Would be here regularly if I lived here"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. if you like real authentic Mexican tacos you must hit this place up. $11.99 for 3 tacos that are super filling. got the fish, Carnita, and brisket taco. all AMAZING. free chips when ur seated and was given guac on the house. ice cold corona to wash it all down. nice unique decor too. love local restaurants like this, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fish Tacos definitely the best ones!  But all others are also flavorful - even the mushroom one. Complimentary chips - delish!"}
{"text":"Came here for first time today. Despite some glitches with their payment system, really enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Cheap, tasty tacos were on today's agenda and I got just that. 2 pork and 1 chicken, both were great but the chicken needed a tiny pinch of seasoning but the hot sauce they provides did just that.  Can't wait to go back to try again."}
{"text":"Small, quaint restaurant with explosive, authentic and flavourful Mexican food. The personalized service and conversation was amazing with the entire staff. I highly recommend sampling the tacos, along with the guacamole. Also request some of the secret super spicy fresh jalapeño salsa (the owner made it special for us!). Very wonderful experience, and we managed to fit a party of 9 in their restaurant!"}
{"text":"The owner (from Acapulco) and his bother-in-law were both dolls! Indeed top notch service with a side of warm hospitality. Service, price point and location (not in Downtown) are definitely better here than Seven Lives. Loved the vibe of the place with beautiful artwork, Lucha Libre masks and lively Hispanic music playing in the background. I would definitely come here for the chorizo and the smoky chipotle sauce; but for more exotic offerings, I would go to Seven Lives."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Decor & Cleanliness: 5/5 Food: 4.5/5  Tried their 3 Tacos (Carnita, El Poyito,  Beef) and quesadillas (cheese & chicken) followed by complimentary nachos and dips.   Will probably try out their burritos next time. Loved the decor!"}
{"text":"The tacos were pretty authentic.  The staff was really friendly but he tacos were lacking a bit of flavour.  We tried majority of their flavours and all were lacking something.  The chips and salsa was really good though.  We tried it because it was closer to home then the other taco place we go to."}
{"text":"Great food! Not very authentic and more fusion as styled but good tacos. Their fish taco is the best! They also serve Corona and Modello so that's always a positive. I've been here twice already and will likely to visit again soon to have some more of their fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Ok it's seriously good. That is all you need to know.  Small, one person cooking, worth the wait (usually isn't one).   We are regulars."}
{"text":"Recently ventured upon this gem last weekend, a nice and cozy environment. However a bit difficult to locate, don't hesitate to give them a call to help you find the exact location. The owner was nice and helpful, gave us a complimentary side of chips. Ultimately I decided to order the '3 amigos tacos'. Overall the food was pretty good, service was relatively quick. I'd recommend the beef and fish tacos. It was nice to find an authentic Mexican restaurant in the heart of Woodbridge, beats having to venture all the way downtown."}
{"text":"Exquisite Mexican food at a reasonable price. The staff are friendly and very helpful with the menu, there is definitely a \"Home-made\" vibe to Ay Caramba Eh! My go-to is the carnita burrito or the taquitos! Whether it's Ernie, Carlos or Michael you're sure to be greeted with a smile (and complimentary chips make waiting for the food an absolute joy!)"}
{"text":"I got the carnita, chicken, and chorizo.  All three were really good, chorizo is a bit more flavorful   Service was amazing, we got complimentary chips with three different sauces. Very clean environment and food came within 5-10 mins   I'd 100% come back, convenient location if you're craving tacos and live around the area"}
{"text":"Totally legit street tacos.  And after eating great Mexican I'm Arizona for the past 7 years, these are the best I've had in Canada. Totally casual place."}
{"text":"Very good food, awesome tortilla chips, and a nice selection of salsas. Really friendly staff as well.  We will return!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had very high expectations to come here. Hidden gem? More so just hidden. Customer service was great, very welcoming and informative. Although, the taquitos were very bland and the nachos had too much salsa (the chips were cold and soggy, we expected them to be fresh). Fish tacos were flavourful although it was mostly batter and there was no lettuce included. Not as impressed as we had hoped to be. Hopefully a second time around will be better. Definitely will try the carnita and chori cheese."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, Used CORN tortillas! My only issue was it's a bit pricey BUT I felt it was worth it. No washroom on site but if you ask nicely they will let you use the staff washroom."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the Vaughan area. They have the most delicious fish tacos, chips and guacamole, chicken quesadillas, and salsas. The staff are incredible Ernie and Carlos you are both truly amazing and we will be bringing you continued business for months to come. Everything is home made and tastes delicious. Try this place you won't regret it. Thank you for your hospitality!   Asya"}
{"text":"The Nachos were delicious. Lots of meat(extra) it wasnt as cheesy but it was well packed with the other goodness.  the tacos were delicious. honestlt the carne (beef) at this place if juicy and full of flavour. I got one chicken one fish and one beef taco.  the fish was battered and was really tasty. The chicken was simply delicious. The beef was yummy!!! you can mix meats in your tacos. i really enjoyes it.  we got to try on a \"secret\" menu (it wasnt on the menu) pupusas. Ive been to other places to try the pupusas. basically tortillia with cheese or beans and/or beef filling. they were skinnier than most places and not as oily. So i feel lile if u want a pupusa that is a bit healthier than the other places where they pack it with \"masa\" this is the place to go.   with the tacos 11.49 and 2 pupusas i ordered. and 2 drinks. we paid roughly $20 and gave a $5 tip. The server was quick and kind to help. small place to dine but got busy on and off. I went with a couple of friends (group of 8) and they quickly accomodated us. I really enjoyed it and would come back. I had no complaints at all."}
{"text":"Very authentic mexican food. I had the tortas, burrito, chips and the tamarind drink. Everything was so flavourful and cooked to perfection. The owner was very welcoming. Took the time out to explain the menu to us. The passion he has for mexican cuisine is very evident in each dish, every little detail.  Had they been in downtown toronto, They would have been much more popular. I would definitely visit again even though i live very far."}
{"text":"Great taco place near Weston and Rutherford / Vaughan Mills area. Tried the pullpork and beef burrito and these guys are not joking around. Great price and yummy authentic tortilla chips with dip. Give there guys a try!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in GTA so far, and possibly the best tortillas in Toronto.  Tacos at Ay Caramba, Eh are simple and good.  Simple as in not having too much toppings, or attempting to use garnishments and secret sauces to differentiate their tacos from the competitors'.  Good as in using the freshest ingredients that are properly marinated, not too salty or spicy or bland.  Shredded beef, shredded chicken, shredded pork.  Corn tortillas taste good.  They are pedestals on which the flavours of the meat dance and shine.  The flavours are well balanced.  To abbreviate: think simple - a single soft tortilla wraps around your choice of meat or mushroom, garnished with a few slices of onion and cilantro.    So delicious.  So courageously naked.  So much pride and faith in the authenticity and quality of the food.    Just go and enjoy and feel."}
{"text":"Okay, this place is seriously the real deal. I've tried many Mexican restaurants all over Toronto and even attended taco fest this summer.. this place seriously compares to any popular Mexican joint like El Cantrin in the distillery district without using the gas to drive from Vaughan to Toronto.   That being said, the food was spectacular. I had ordered multiple tacos including the fish, beef, chicken and carnitas. All were 5*, if I could rate it more I would. Everything tastes fresh and considering the tacos were made so simply with minimal toppings, the flavours of each one were delicious and flavourful. Not to mention the customer service is amazing, so friendly and accommodating.   Save yourself the drive to Toronto if you're from the GTA and try this place out! Seriously!"}
{"text":"These people are actually amazing! From the moment we walked into the door the gentleman was making conversation and giving us information about the food, owners, and quality of food. The place is smaller and you could maybe come with a group or 4 or 5 at maximum. But i'll forgive that. I'm sure in due time they'll be expanding because of their amazing food. 1st, they start you off with some complimentary chips with some amazing salsas. We ordered the fish tacos, carnita and two more I can't remember. But EVERY SINGLE ONE was great. I especially loved the fish taco. I'm not usually a fan of fish tacos but trust me just try it. We also ordered a torta. Think burrito inside a banh mi bun and on a panini press. Again, amazingggggg. Then we had the horchata (it's a sweet milk drink). Really sweet so be warned but amazing as well. I would suggest sharing one with your significant other because it is a lot for one person in my opinion. I would 100 percent go back."}
{"text":"Great place, cute little resto with awesome decor and good food! We walked in when they were supposed to close in about 15 min ! This didn't change anything service was great, very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"A group of 4 met here last night for dinner...2 of our group have been frequent and loyal customers, the other two of us we were newbies (I being one of them). I've heard of this place, as its in my neighbourhood, but I've always hit other Mexican places....well that's now changed. The food is fresh and has a deeper layer of flavours than other places. The interior is warm barn wood with pallets used as wall shelving. Thankfully there's nary a trace of tacky Mexican decor. Male staff member working cash (I think the owner) was fantastic...he explained the types of dishes, what they contained and their heat levels. 2 in our group ordered tacos. 2 of us ordered chicken burritos. I didn't sample the tacos but they were scarfed down by those that ordered them.  My burrito was fantastic....shredded chicken (ample amounts of it), seasoned perfectly ( a great medley of flavours) served in a warm flour tortilla. It is one of the best burritos I've ever had....and I've had plenty. While we were seated and waiting for our food to come out, the cashier brought over nacho chips with two sauces. The nacho chips are worth going alone. Obviously home made, they are delicious. Two burritos, 1 Diet Coke and 1 water was just over $22....well worth it. I'll definitely be returning....I'm hungry just thinking about it......"}
{"text":"Very interesting restaurant.   A colleague suggested that this place offers true Mexico taco, so we went for lunch.  Small store, more like a fast food restaurant.   I had the 3-set tacos with beef, chicken and pork  Taste-wise.. I don't know. I loved the pulled pork. but there were just too much cilantro and it overwhelmed the meat. My colleague had to pick out all cilantro.   I'd say, if interested in different style of taco, give it a try. I'd prefer this place over Taco Bell for sure.."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious (period). Tried three, each with a great distinct flavor profile. The food actually looks like the pictures.   Staff was very nice. Let me try a few of their hot sauces."}
{"text":"When I first saw the Yelp reviews for this place, I thought we definitely needed to try this place. We were finally in the area and had the time to give it a try. I must admit, I was a bit dissapointed - Possibly due to all the stellar Yelp reviews my expectations were quite high. Upon entering, there is very limited seating for about 15 ish people. It was spacious enough and did not feel over crowded but please note there is no washroom on site. The decor was modern, rustic and quaint. We were very plesantly greeted and attended to, although this place felt a bit more of a order, sit down to eat quick and go style place rather then a full restaurant. Also the menu was not very extensive as a full sit down restaurant, so keep your expectations in check.  But having said that, for what it is and what was offered this place is quite quite tasty. We ordered the original trio (carnita, el poyito and chori cheese) along with the Tortas. The corn tortitllas tasted great, and was quite similar to what we had tried in Mexico. Everything was again, quite tasty. But quantity wise, it was not filling and if your a big eater you may want to look elsewhere. For what we ordered it came out to a little under $20. So it was quite fair, but again its definitely not a bang for your buck type of place. If your into quality, this place may be for you as again it is tasty. All the meats tasted flavourful and juicy. A nice little thing too is that the chips offered while eating in tasted awesome. Not overly salty or processed.   If we are in the area again, I wouldnt mind coming back to see if they had anything else that was more fulfilling. But I cant help but feel I may have missed something on this visit."}
{"text":"Delicious and nutritious!  The tacos are really good, but the order of 3 isn't big enough to fill me up.  If they were sold by the 5 I'd definitely order that.  Instead I topped up with 2 fish tacos which were even better than the others, so all's well that ends well."}
{"text":"Exceeding my expectations!  I was thrilled to find an authentic Mexican restaurant close by that was both easy on the wallet and satisfying to the stomach!  Highly recommended.  It's a small location so if busy might want to place tour order ahead of time for pickup."}
{"text":"Great Tacos! Authentic taste like the ones I've eaten in Mexico. Tried the chicken, fish and chorizo. Delicious ! The chips and guacamole were amazing too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here about 2 weeks ago with a couple of friends, before we were heading out for a late-night movies My boyfriend and I have wanted to try this place, since we love to eat authentic Mexican food, and had yet to find one in my area.   The location is easy to find. We got there just 15 minutes before they closed and was planning on doing take-out, but the owner was kind enough to let us order and eat-in.   We ordered the carnitas nachos, taquitos (chicken), and tacos (carnitas, el poyito and chorizo). There was complimentary chips as we waited for our food.The wait for food here is not long, we got all of our food within 5-10 minutes of ordering.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some authentic Mexican food, both the food and the service here are AMAZING. I will definitely be coming back here when I have the chance."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to get here for ages and today was close by. Wandered in with my hungry teenager for early dinner.  This is such a friendly little shop. Quick service rather than table service. We were walked through the menu, ordered, and the food was brought over to our table. They even checked in at our table to make sure everything was good.  Everything we had was ready fast and was delicious: Three tacos, two chicken and one steak Chips and guacamole Fanta Orange (in bottles!) Jarrito Mandarito  A clean and cozy spot. We will definitely return. All in I give it five stars because if the decent price point, attentive service at a quick service and tasty food."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Ay Caramba, eh.  I never would have noticed this restaurant without Yelp.  It's quaint and in a nice area near the 400 and Rutherford road.  It's actually a very well hidden plaza, so you may want to use a GPS to find it.  It's a nice looking restaurant.  Nothing fancy, but clean and the staff is very welcoming and friendly.  Today I had two orders of three tacos.  The tacos are smaller, but he price was fair.  There was a lot of flavour and thinking that went in to these tacos.  They had a bean one, shredded chicken, refried beans, chorizo, mushroom, beef pineapple and a fish taco, and others as well.  I did not try the fish taco.  I must maintain a gluten free diet and the fish is breaded and deep fried.  It is cooked in the deep fryer.  If you must strictly adhere to a gluten free diet, you will want to avoid the taquitos as well.  There was a great selection of different cold teas and pops.  I had the cold hibiscus tea with cinnamon.  They had sweetened and unsweetened.  Delicious.  Nice place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people are giving this place 4+ stars, the tacos r small and unappetizing. Obviously these people haven't ventured out into toronto to taste better or even decent tasting tacos... but these tacos here that they \"specialize\" in are definitely  not worth the hype or money. Portions r TINY, no sauces, no veggies, just a dragged clump of shredded meat and chopped green onions on top to garnish. The fish taco is the only appetizing thing on their menu even then the fish taco isn't that great."}
{"text":"This is a neat little joint tucked away in a plaza behind a residential housing. I had their taco trios and nachos. I also had their Jamaica drink. Let me tell you. The tacos were amazing! Nachos weren't bad and their Jamaica drink reminded me of starbucks passion tea lemonade. Only reason why I gave them 4 stars was because their tacos are pretty tiny. At the end of each taco I was wanting more. Staff were friendly and very informative. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch after seein pics of their food show up in my facebook feed.. Half decent tacos not the easiest to find up in these neck of the woods.. Nestled away in the back of a plaza.. I realized how i never even noticed it was there...  Wife and I both had a trio of chorizo, chicken, carnita and shared a pupusa.. The fresh complimentary chips as we waited was a pleasant touch.. Friendly staff.. Clean n nice decor.. Chorizo n carnita seemed the tastier choices...  All the food was good but not as good as compared to downtown joints.. But considering its only a few minutes from home.. I'll definitely return again to give fish tacos and burritos a try..  Bumped to a five because of the proximity to home and considerin the scarce options in the area..."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Highly recommend this place ! The staff were very nice and genuine. The atmosphere is very clean and very lively. The fish tacos were my favorite! Also, try the home made drinks , they are very refreshing. I only had the chance to try the Tamarindo, it was sweet and tasted like ice tea. And I didn't find the tacos on their own spicy, but you can add the hot sauce to them if you do like spicy! Overall very good and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was fresh and delicious. Well-priced. Their mild salsa is delicious and smokey. We ordered taquitos and three tacos. The fish, alambre, carnitas, and the chori-cheese tacos were all excellent. Will definitely be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner and had a very good experience. Showed up 5 minutes before close with my girlfriend and the staff were more than welcoming, encouraging us to stay and explaining the menu thoroughly. You can tell that they really take pride in the food that they serve. Complimentary nachos were hot and fresh and the salsas were great. Definitely the best thing I tried was the beef brisket quessadilla, hands down the best quesadilla I've ever had, served with a side of very fresh guac. With pricing similar to franchises like Chipotle and Fat Bastards, it's a no brainier to stop by Ay Caramba."}
{"text":"Their chicken quesadillas and nachos were great, but I wasn't a fan of their tacos. The soft taco wrapping was really thin so it broke and the inside of the tacos kept falling out. The fish taco was probably the best one but it wasnt the best fish taco I've had, the chicken and the steak were very bland."}
{"text":"Great place. Burrito was amazing, chips were amazing (and free). Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"WOOOOW. Just WOOOOW. I've been wanting to check this place out for months after seeing these raving Yelp reviews. I first proposed coming here months ago to my friend who opted to try another Mexican food establishment in the same plaza instead. Let me tell you what a huge mistake that was...  We finally visited Ay Caramba, Eh! today and were instantly greeted by staff (and an empty restaurant). One staff member/the cashier asked us if it was our first time at Ay Caramba, Eh! and we told him that it was. He explained to us what was included in their tacos since the food names were not in english. He noted that fish tacos were their specialty.  My friend ordered first, opting for \"The Original Trio\" for $10.99. You get to choose 3 out of 4 choices for this. She chose the Carnita, El Poyito, and Chori-Cheese tacos, as well as a side order of Taquitos for $4.99.  For myself, I also ordered \"The Original Trio\": El Poyito, Tierra Picante (cremini mushrooms!), and Chori-Cheese. Their credit machine tap option didn't end up working for me, but the option is there for other patrons to try.   After payment, the cashier asked us to sit down and that he would bring us the order when it was ready. Within 2 minutes of sitting down, he walked over and handed us some complimentary chips/plain nachos. I don't know what the dip was. One was brownish and the other had a jalapeno base. The sauces were tasty. The nachos were also very crunchy and lightly salted. I'm almost certain they make it themselves and I will definitely come back to try the nachos that you actually have to pay for which include a handful of other toppings. This COMPLIMENTARY dish was better than all the ordered items at the other place that we actually had to pay for.   I digress. My friend's Taquitos came about 4 minutes later. They were like Taco Bell's Nacho Supreme served with chicken in a much less soggy, and much more eloquent manner. Another 5 minutes passed and we weren't even halfway through our plain nachos or Taquitos. This is when our tacos were brought to our table. I was a bit surprised by how thin they were. They came with a few pieces of plain nachos. I finished the Taquito hanging in my mouth and took a bite out of the El Poyito and I was just... AMAZED. The flavours worked out so perfectly! I do think it was lacking salsa, which was tucked away at a wall fixture right next to me. With the added Valentina \"hot sauce\", it was even better. I normally don't even normally like hot sauce?! Tooooo good.   I had the Tierra Picante next, the only vegetarian taco option. And again! I was amazed. The same with the third taco. They were all a wonderful blend of flavours. You had sweet, some saltiness, and the textured red onions all at once. I was sad when my time with the tacos came to an end. They weren't filling at all, but they all, in their own right, had an explosion of flavour. I definitely recommend a try.   On my way out, I noticed they had complimentary plain nachos at the front with some cheese. I took one last nacho as a reminder of the good times at Ay Caramba, Eh!  Excellent service and excellent food. 5/5 would recommend.   Note: I didn't see any washrooms :("}
{"text":"Amazing service and consistently delicious food every time. Order the fish tacos and nachos, and you won't be disappointed.  The staff even recognized my boyfriend and I as regulars, and gave us guacamole (with a lit candle) and a sugar-free hibiscus tea on the house on my birthday. They're always friendly and you get free chips before your meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Good: Delicious food - I had the chicken burrito and it was magnificent. The owner provided chips and salsa during the wait. The atmosphere was comfortable, open and relaxing . The owners brother-in-law served us and he was awesome ! Nice guy who cares a great deal about the service and experience. Top shelf service and food all the way.  The Bad: A little tucked out of the way, but some of the best spots are a gem to find.   The Ugly: No ugly to report on here. This was an excellent experience all the way.  Will go again and absolutely recommended to others !"}
{"text":"Good food, good people, an amazing place if you're interested in genuine Mexican people and real people."}
{"text":"Located at the plaza in the NW corner of Hwy 400 and Rutherford via Vellore Woods Blvd, you will find the newest hot spot in Vaughan where Carlos and team take high pride in their food quality and services. They are the sweetest and the most considerate people you will ever meet :) I felt most welcomed while I was there.  Ay Caramba, Eh! serves fresh, hearty and delicious Mexican/Latin American foods with a Canadian twist. (Love the 'Eh!' in their name lol). They offer specialty products and beverages too. Try their frizzy Yoli drink! But just to warn you... it is a 1/2L bottle, so be sure to share with a friend! I really enjoyed the food and I am really thankful that the food is not greasy nor sloppy nor saucey (unlike other Mexican restaurants I have been to). The 12 foot long carnita (pulled pork) burrito was packed with fresh ingredients... and with their mild dipping sauce... I'm in heaven.  So far, they are carrying a simple menu with tacos, tortas, burritos, nachos and extras on the side. Weekend features items not on the menu including the fish tacos - the flavours are incredible! The fish was on the small side but Ay Caramba! (it mean \"OMG\" in a good way!) it was delicious ^^ Their tortilla chips are especially good. Freshly made and you have 3 choices of dipping sauces - spicy, mild and guacamole! Had to get a side order to take home with me! They normally season it with salt... you can opt out the salt because it taste great even without IMO.  I like it a lot ;) Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Honest and simple. To begin, they have a really bad location in the plaza, was very hard to find, and doesn't stand out well. The interior, was clean, simple, and nice. The staff was welcoming and very nice!! The owner, I think, explained the menu to us. We ordered the 3 amigos with 2 chicken and 1 fish tacos! While we were waiting we were brought tortilla chips and some salsas! The red one had a weird/spicy taste, and the green salsa (no it's not guac!) tasted like chutney! When we got our food, it looked and smelled delicious! But it failed to have a spicy flavour- and the soft tortilla that they are using, is in between a hard and a soft shell.. not my favourite!   Overall: food was not anything special..."}
{"text":"My favourite mexican taco restaurant! Food is freshly made, tacos are tiny but delicious, they provide free corn chips to fill you up."}
{"text":"Cute mexican restaraunt. Excellent food, great service and upbeat atmosphere. The shredded beef tacos were excellent."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their tacos! I had the 3 amigos (you get to select any 3 from a choice of 6). I chose the fish, beef brisket and carnita (pulled pork). They gave us complimentary corn chips and bottled water while we waited for our food. Service was exceptional. The decor is also very unique with 7 tables that sit 2-4 people. I'll definitely come back again to try their beef alambre taco."}
{"text":"This was not amazing like the review's said. Had high expectations going in after reading reviews on yelp. Do yourself a favour and drive 30 mins to Playa Cabana for a proper Mexican experience in Toronto. The tacos were nothing special, very small portions and overpriced. They messed up on the order the first time and had to remake the items. The brisket, carnitas and chorizo were dry. A Dos Equis bottle was $7. Home made sauces were okay."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch. Initially, it was just us but within 15mins, the place was crowded with people waiting to be seated.  This isn't a full service restaurant so when it gets busy, wait time is even longer because there's only 1 person working the counter and the same person delivering the food. You order and pay at the counter and seat yourself to any available table.  The place is bright and has decors that would make you automatically think: Mexico!   The food was good but the taco size is a bit small for my liking. I ordered the any 3 tacos for 11.99 - 2 fish and a beef alambre tacos. Fish was crunchy and fresh. The beer was flavourful and came in chunks. As well, there's a complimentary nachos with dips and hot sauce. We also got the taquitos (4 for 4.99) which was my favourite! Crunchy and you can definitely taste the chicken filling - very homemade! The drink I got was good as well: hibiscus with cinnamon - very different but refreshing  Good place to grab a snack or for lunch. The owner/manager was very friendly and very helpful if you've never been before"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos served by very friendly staff. I had the fish and beef brisket and they did not disappoint. Also had the side chips and guac. The chips were thick and crispy and paired well with the hot sauces and guac. Will definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Food: This small little Mexican joint is definitely a great place to go if you're looking to eat tacos. They have about 4 different types of tacos (chicken, vegetable, pork I believe and another one I quite can't remember) + fish tacos which are a little bit extra. They charge 10.99 for any 3 tacos of your selection or 11.99 if you want one to be fish tacos. What can I say.. fresh and authentic ingredients. I loved their fish tacos, it was really great and crispy, with light mayo based spread and lettuce. The next best one I liked was the vegetable taco (mushroom filled) and last but not least chicken tacos. A little bit filling and less flavourful than the other 2 but still really good. Would definitely come back if I'm craving tacos.   They also serve complimentary nachos while you wait. Crispy and perfectly salted. Also, they have Mexican selection of drinks. Highly recommend the sangria.  Service: Fantastic. Excellent authentic server and very friendly. Ran us through the menu from top to bottom.  Verdict- must try Mexican joint for tacos! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"If you haven't checked this place out, it is a must! Not only is the food amazing, the service is so friendly and welcoming. They really take care of there customers. I've honestly been a few times now and I love coming back.   Tacos are bomb, can never go wrong with the fish or chicken. But if you have a bigger appetite I'd get a fish burrito.   It is a small place so I'd recommend ordering in advance or taking it to go. But if you end up eating there, the guys really take care of you. They usually give you chips and salsa when you wait; but the thing that sticks out to me the most is they let you know how much longer it'll take.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So before anyone jumps on me on the rating, hear me out.  This is a 5 star TORONTO taco place.  I know my heart beats for San Diego and Chicago tacos and there are phenomenal 5 star places there.  For Canada, this ranks easily as one of the better places.  Not only because it tastes good (4 star ranking Internationally) but also the service.  The family that runs this place deserves 6 stars if I could give it to them.    I love finding family run places that are TRULY passionate about the experience and feeding the soul of their customers.  Ay Caramba does that and more.  Not only did we have great service at the point of ordering... we had a wonderful and enjoyable conversation at our table with them too!  Its not often we get an owner coming to the table and asking how everything went.  I must be on a streak cause this is the 3rd place I've seen this (Ay Caramba, Pow Wow, Little Pebbles).    So this is a fast casual spot so you order & pay at the counter and you can choose a spot to sit down anywhere.  They'll bring out the tacos to you shortly afterwards.  The place is SUPER clean and decorated with a variety of wooden accents.    As mention, service is so good here.  I honestly felt like I was welcomed into someone's kitchen.  The genuine warmth and friendliness makes this spot great.  The nice thing is that they're clearly from Mexico and happy to bring their culture to Canada.  They're sharing the tastes of their homeland and the flavours are so good.  I dont think you can come here and stay cold hearted... it's just a wonderful friendly place.  Quick note about ordering... tacos are it here!  They do give you complimentary nachos with several salsas.  Some have serious heat but all are different and delicious.  You can taste the different herbs and vegetables that gone into it.  The jalapeno (green) was my favourite but the super hot pepper with sesame seeds is a close 2nd (fiery orange).  The tacos are normal sized and you get to order 3 for only $10.99 or $11.99 for the premium tacos.  I ate 2 myself and felt quite content.  I can easily try 3 and be satisfied.  Tacos are meant to be snack sized so if you want 5 or 6.. no one would side eye you for it!  Carnitas - Ohhh this is a good one.  Juicy, tender, highly flavourful, and packed into a nice taco bite. The bits of cilantro and cheese gives it a  vegetal bright boost and creamy tanginess. 4.5/5  Fish - This is their famed taco.  Batter cod with vinagered vegetables, cilantro, lettuce, and a tangy cream sauce.  This was a nice bite as it had tender fish and the vibrant vinagered veg gave a nice bite.  I would say that it could have been crispier as not all batter was hot and crispy.  Overall, a solid taco still.   4/5  Beef Brisket - Very similar to the carnitas, beef is tender and flavourful.  Not dry at all.  With addition of the cilantro and onions, it adds a perk of bright flavour.   4/5  Tierra picante - Ok so don't do what I did... I underestimated this.  The tierra picante is juicy sauteed mushrooms and slices of jalapeno.  It's really good and tasty till the heat of the pepper seeds hit your tongue as you're chewing.  Make sure you have something to drink nearby or you'll going to look like a panting puppy in the summer (aka. ME).  4/5  Chori Cheese - Another solid taco that has a lot of chorizo ground up with a bit of cheese thrown in.  I would say that the paprika spice adds to it overall.  I personally like the Carnitas the best but this one is a nice complimentary one.  4/5  Horchata - The only thing tried that wasn't amazing... I think the rice they used had an interesting herbally note to it.  It wasn't prominent till the end.  I do appreciate how it wasn't too sugary and the cinnamon was light.  Still I can tell it was homemade and appreciated it.  3/5  Much love to the owners of Ay Caramba.  Your passion and care won us over.  Your tacos are equally as good as the warmth you bring to Vaughn.  Im glad to have found this place and hopefully others will find it too."}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican food in Vaughan!!! No Tex Mex here, just the real thing! Went here on a date night with my wife before the movies and it was was a great experience! The quality of food was excellent, the place was very clean, cozy atmosphere and the service was super friendly! We will definitely return to this hidden Mexican gem, \"eh\"!!!"}
{"text":"Just came for an early lunch and noticed a new taco on the board, Cochinita (spicy smoked carnita). It's great! So flavourful and packs a little bit of a spicy punch. Can't wait to come back and try more along with my typical fish taco order. Keep up the good work guys! Each new taco seems to be a hit!"}
{"text":"This place has great authentic Mexican tacos. Extremely friendly staff and owner. Nachos and salsa all home made and tasty...and on the house. I got two fish tacos and a carnita (3 amigos: you get to pick any 3 from their tacos). The fish tacos were topped with perfect ingredients to pair with the fried fish. Definitely a must get, the carnita was great as well but was lacking a little in seasoning. My friend had the fish burrito, their dough for the Tortia and burrito is all made in house = UNREAL.   Great to have a place like this uptown since most of my favourite ones are in the city. Hopefully they expand, check them out!"}
{"text":"Have known about this place for ages but never stopped by. Finally I came by with some friends and had a wonderful experience.  It's a small little place, doesn't hold that many people. But what this place lacks in space, it more than makes up for it with flavor. We ordered the taco trio and I found each of them fantastic! I also got a side of taquitos which I highly recommend as well. To top it off, it seems like every table gets a complimentary plate of tortilla chips which was a surprise to be sure but a welcome one. Will definitely be back some day soon"}
{"text":"i love tacos, and i am on the hunt for the best tacos. The fish was good, not the best. The chorizo was dry and do was the chicken. The chicken was seasoned perfectly but needed a crunch and some pico de galo SOMETHING! but just shredded chicken in a corn tortilla... i also tried a chorizo burrito also dry, especially since i had to eat half of ite before getting to the meat and at that point there was only meat. I like to eat everything together get all the flavors at once. My bf loved it though, also got the fish burrito which he said was great. I will have to try just the fish items next time. We will come back but because he liked it. On the place, it is very small, I've been to smaller joints; they at least have tables and actual chairs."}
{"text":"The nachos are homemade and come with 2 sauces which are amazing. The tacos we had were filled with flavour and the Spanish Christmas music made was the cherry on the top."}
{"text":"Popped by this hole in the wall when a taco craving hit - we got a combination of chicken, carnita, chorizo and mushroom tacos (3/$10.99). Although they looked small, they were quite filling and delicious! A complimentary plate of fresh tortilla chips were also served alongside the tacos, bonus!  The employee taking our order was super helpful by recommending his favourites after mentioning it was our first time and the owner followed up with our experience at the end of the meal.  It's always amazing to see local businesses that truely care for their customers. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Since there are not too many authentic Mexican food in Vaughan, Ay Caramba, Eh might be the best choice if you don't want to venture down to Downtown Toronto.  Love the deco! Fun and playful! Those Wrestler masks really put a smile on my face!  Menu is simple but has all the Mexican's favourite: tacos, tortas and burritos. I ended up ordering the Any 3 Tacos for $11.99 as I really want a fish one!  Fish Haddock Beef Brisket Tierra Picante  The Mushroom taco was surprisingly tasty! I love their fresh made in house soft shells, so soft and with a good bite!  The portion size though a little small for a full meal. Luckily there was a basket of complimentary tortilla chips. +0.5 star  Make sure to check out their fridge for some unique imported Mexican beverages! They even have Mexican beers to go with your meals too.  Staff is super friendly and helpful +0.5 Star."}
{"text":"Was feeling super-mexican today so decided to enjoy some amazing tacos with the mother.  Location: Tucked in a tiny corner in a plaza so was difficult to find at first, but was cozy! Decent amount of sleep, and since the food was small enough to takeout, there was plenty enough space for people in the restaurant.  Food: Food was delicious! Ordered the 3 amigos tacos (3 flavours of your choice: I chose Pulled Pork, Beef and Fish). Decent sized tacos, great price and nice flavours! We got some nacho chips while waiting for our order with SUPER SPICY but oh so delicious dips. Compared to other taco places I have been to, this was probably the most flavourful. Added cabbage and sauce wasn't over powering, and it complemented the meat very well.  Other: Service was fantastic! Employees constantly checked up on us to see if we needed anything, talked to us and even helped us with the bagging and cleaning of our food. Nicest service i have ever had in a 'quick-service' style restaurant.  PLEASE GO HERE!  5 burps out of 5."}
{"text":"My dad did not like the size but he probably should have ordered the buritto or more food lol."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Great atmosphere and most importantly...real good food! The people are very friendly and want you to stay and enjoy yourself. Took my parents here for some Mexican tacos and burritos and they were happy with how friendly the owner was and how great the food tasted. We sat and talked after we were done eating and didn't feel rushed. Very cool place! Definitely going back, and taking some friends too!"}
{"text":"I heard of this place from Yelp and remembered that it had a high rating. Hoped by after shopping at Ikea since it was close enough to check it out to see if it was worth it.   The place had more seating area than I expected but still a small space. The walls/ceiling was decorated with wooden crates. There was a tv with an image of waterfalls which I thought was out of place.   The man who took our order was friendly and explained us the different types of meat. It was nice that it came with chips and salsa. However there wasn't enough salsa for the amount of chips given.   My burrito was filling, had a spicy kick to it since he didn't ask me of the spice level I wanted. However it didn't have all the toppings I like from Burrito Boyz. It also felt smaller in size.   The three tacos looked small and I felt it didn't have enough veggies on top.   The downside is that there's no washroom. And I had to go!!   Verdict: I would only go back if I'm in the area to support local businesses. Other than that, I'll rather go somewhere else. No clue why it has high ratings."}
{"text":"First off, the service at this location is amazing. They really make you feel welcomed when you come into their restaurants. They even went the extra step and explained how their menu worked!  They worked hard to try to use your name during your stay there so definitely a plus.  Got the chicken burrito, three tacos and nachos. Definitely no regrets here as they all tasted awesome. If I can make a recommendation, the Haddock taco was perfect! Surprise, surprise, they also sell alcohol (Corona and Modleo) which is a totally cool plus to have in a Mexican restaurant.    Overall, the food is awesome, service was amazing, and once again the service is amazing. Must recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish taco! I would give this place 5 stars if the portions were larger. Food overall was fantastic and the staff were very nice and friendly. Will visit again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Yum! Ay Caramba Eh is one of the few Mexican restaurants in Vaughan that serves up some seriously delicious food. When I walked in, I was asked if this was my first visit. They brought over menus and complimentary nachos. I decided to order the carnita burritos and the 3 amigos (3 tacos): the haddock, beef brisket, and poyito.  The burrito was soft on the outside with a slight crunch from the grill. All of the ingredients inside the burrito were fresh, flavorful, and soft. There was definitely a lovely note of lime in there as well. The three tacos were tasty. The soft corn tacos were perfect, not dry nor overly wet. Similarly the chicken in the poyito taco was perfectly cooked and not dry. It was the sweetest of the three. The haddock had a nice crunchy outside, tasty, with a little sweetness to it, likely from the aioli. The beef brisket taco was was tender and flavorful.  Overall, the food was great. Service was excellent. Prices are slightly high."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Great service, they greeted us and explained the menu. All the tacos were awsome."}
{"text":"What a gem! 2 yrs old, mainly takeout restaurant but they do have a few tables to dine in. Everything is made fresh. Service is so friendly. The food was fantastic! They give you complementary chips and homemade salsa to start. All the salsas were so good! We ordered the nachos with beef brisket. The nachos was crispy and not greasy. The guacamole was delicious. The beef brisket was so tasty! The 3 amigos taco: ordered the fish, beef brisket and carnitas. The fish is the star of the menu and most popular item. It's halibut, lightly battered, so amazingly crispy! The beef brisket is the same as the nachos, still good on a taco! The carnita was good but compared to the fish and beef was less exciting. So close to wonderland and Vaughan mills. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Most delicious Mexican food I ever had! The place is kind of hidden but worth the find. The flavours are so good and thestaff is friendly too! #foreversatisfied"}
{"text":"Talk freshness to me. Ay Caramba Eh might be compact in size but it packs a lot of freshness and flavour in each bite. Service here is outstanding and the food is superb. They bring you a basket of fresh chips to munch on while you're waiting for your meal. The place is decked out in décor that momentarily transports you to Mexico.   Each bite of food you take is better than the last and you're almost always sad when it's over. The lunch rush can be a bit nuts, but they're always super apologetic for the inconvenience.   Whether you just want to drop in for a quick bite, order take out, or want to enjoy a few cervezas over a couple of fresh fish tacos, Ay Caramba Eh offers something for everyone."}
{"text":"Pulled pork taco are the key to success haha. Nice, light, and savoury seasoning on the meat and wonderful garnishes on the entire taco, making to a delicious meal. The environment of this joint is great; the theme of the restaurant is nicely designed and the staff is amazing. If you have room for more food, grab the chicken Taquitos; small yet it packs quite a \"crunch\"...literally! Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this place for the first time and it was really welcoming and cute. Great place for casual small groups. Not very many tables but we got there at 6:30pm and managed to get a table. There was a line around 7:30pm on a Friday.  They also give free chips while you're waiting with salsa. The salsas didn't have a very strong flavour but just different levels of spicy. We ordered 3 tacos: carnitas, beef brisket, and haddock. All were delicious  The haddock was very light, beef was very soft and carnitas was very well flavoured. It was a little small though so would suggest ordering something else. We also got a carnitas burrito. It tasted good but it was difficult to taste everything in it. It would have also been nice if water was complimentary - water only came in bottles   Overall great experience, very reasonably priced and would come back again."}
{"text":"Coming from Southern California, I know something about good Mexican food. So I have high expectations. Ay caramba was excellent. Friendly employees, good ambiance, good service, and more importantly--good food. If/when I'm back in this area I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The taco fish, carnita and chori-cheese are the best.   Vengan a probar los tacos, están buenísimos, la gente es muy amable y el servicio es rápido."}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly and welcoming and did a great job by describing the menu, because coming in I had no clue what I wanted to order. I ended up getting the chicken tacos, 3 for $10.99, though you could mix any 3 taco choices. It was delicious by the way. It also came with complimentary nachos!!   I am never disappointed when I come by here and the customer service is always 100%!!! I've recommended this place to many people as the BEST Mexican spot around!  Thanks for the hospitality! You'll have our business again."}
