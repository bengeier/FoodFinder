{"text":"A cozy feel-good restaurant. Their food presentation is great and their portions are just right and even generous for the price. Having tasted Egyptian food on numerous occasions, I can attest to the fact that their food is delicious and authentic. The seating area itself is relatively small, so good only for small gatherings, otherwise take-out. I've been waiting forever for a tasty Egyptian restaurant to make its way to this side of the GTA and will be going back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've never had Egyptian food before so I've been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile now and finally made it there this evening.  Now I wish I had gone sooner. I had the Anora's Exclusive Sandwich. It was delicious and fresh, and the proprietors were very friendly. I'm definitely going to go back often and try all signatures which sound amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! Such great food.  We had Koshary, Falafel plate, moussaka, shish tawouk, baba ganoush and the vegetarian samosa. The flavours were perfectly balanced. Very reasonably priced too.  Its a small restaurant with about 12 seats. The atmosphere is very casual. We had take out. The ladies who run this place are lovely. Try this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."}

{"text":"This place is family run and they are sweet, and the food is fresh and seems authentic. Many things I have never seen before but will try. Reliably tasty and inexpensive, not much more can be asked of a neighborhood cafe."}
