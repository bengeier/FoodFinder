{"text":"Their special combo is SOOOO good. A perfect mix of savoury (grape leaves), tangy (vinaigrette, feta, hummus), and sweet (mashed sweet potatoes). And how can I forget the deliciously fishy slices of smoked salmon stacked on top? Of course it doesn't hurt that the portions are massive, especially considering the price and convenient location!  There are no doubt a few kinks. Ordering (and even picking up orders...) can get pretty disorganized. The staff, while super sweet, can also be slow and seem a bit confused at times. Some of the food is unfortunately a miss - the harira soup, for example, did not taste the best given that it was served cold. But I mean, the important thing is that they do at least one thing really, really, really well, right? :P  So happy for this new spot! They're on Ritual so don't get frightened by the never-ending lines during lunch time."}
{"text":"Im usually downtown for school so ive passed by this place for a while and today I felt like being a bit more healthy and was curious of this chain salad place. They serve soup, salad, wraps and have specials that look appetizing. So I walked up towards the counter and I asked the girl how it worked to order a greek salad with chicken. She immediatly starts putting together my salad and when I got towards the counter she asks how I am going to pay and doesn't tell me the price. I pick up the card machine and it was $9.00. For just a salad!!!!!!! All of their other prices were around $5-6.00. I was and am a bit mad that she did not tell me how the process was going to be when ordering. The salad was pretty good except they truly do pack the container until its full. Next time, I am going to speak to a manager or associate who can tell me the price before they start filling my order."}
{"text":"Guess I caught this place on a bad day, waiting over an hour for a salad, yes a freaken salad.  Was it worth the wait?  God no!  Slop in a styrofoam container, looked like a doggie bag from a family restaurant and not a salad at all.   Why do people go here?!    Guess I caught it on a bad day."}
{"text":"Amazing salad at an amazing price!  Their large salads are less than $8 before tax (depending on what you choose so it could be less) and its packed! Its like double the size of what you could get at McEwan at a lesser price.  I got the cobb salad (forgot to take picture) and it took me two days to finish it.  I was surprised that they gave me half an avocado and one full egg.  More surprisingly they gave me a big spoon of corn.  Delicious! The only drawback is the free iceberg/romaine option for the cobb salad and just romaine for the wrap.  Spinach cost $0.95 extra.  There's always a long line up, so you should go before 11:30am or after 1:30pm.  However, they do have a lot of staff for such a tiny space so it's not that bad.  It's right beside Tim Hortons with a big and bright green sign."}
{"text":"Can you get a big salad? Yes. But can you get a big big salad? Yes. Salad Day's large-size salad is humongous. And delicious.  I just found out about this chain, I think it's a chain, last week and I've gone back three times. It's always awkward to review salad dishes because let's face it, a lettuce is a lettuce is a lettuce. Your favourite King Street restaurant's lettuce may taste very alike with the one you can find in the boonies, say Broadview and Gerrard (what's in there by the way?). We can rate the salads, however, based on the freshness of the ingredients and their portion. On both counts, Salad Days delivered.   It is really a to-go place; there are no seats to hog, no wifi for your coffice nor waiter to serve you. What they have, however, is a musician during some lunch hours. Yo, I'm not kidding - a legit musician serenading hungry Bay Street crowd at lunch. Bonus point for uniqueness. Given the very long line up here at lunch, this musician may have saved many fist fights. Patience is key for a great tasting salad.   I tried the Cobbs Salad and Ceasar's Salad with Baby Kale. Baby, it's delish. My orders came with a generous portion of avocado, corn, black beans... you know... the goodies.   I will be back, and I highly recommend it."}
