{"text":"Found this little gem of a Food Truck at the Windsor Home Tour. The Hummus and Chips were out of this world but the Mac and Cheese Balls with the Pomegranate Gastrique were to DIE FOR !!!! Wish I could get this truck to park in front of my house. Guess I will have to hunt its location down every month. This is a MUST TRY !!!!"}
{"text":"The steak sandwich with Swiss cheese was amazing! This place is a must try & don't forget the barbecue chips!"}
{"text":"Ok the food truck came to the Kierland and it was amazing. I ordered the Ruben and I just loved it. So so so good, I did NOT love the chips, they tasted very plain, but the Ruben was so good it made up for it. A few of my coworkers had the Cuban and said that was amazing as well"}
{"text":"This place was so good! and super fast! ordered on my lunch break and food was fresh and ready in about 5 minutes! the mac and cheese balls are TO DIE FOR! Highly recommend their steak salad with muenster cheese! Can't wait to try this food truck again"}
{"text":"Very tasty Cuban sandwich. And I love those mac and cheese balls. Yum!"}
