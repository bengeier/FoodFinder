{"text":"It's my first time in here, passed it many times but never gave it a second look. 
The place is simple with a huge menu, noodles rice and variety of dishes. I decided to go with the wonton soup, regular size which is more than enough to anyone really. 
The soup was really good, authentic and full of yummy stuff that I don't have any idea what it's called but it's good nevertheless. 
I am sure to return and check out some other menu items.
Btw, price is more than reasonable."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. The business is family run and they are so friendly and caring every time I go. 

I usually get the R5 which is  chicken and rice with a fried egg. words can not express how delicious this dish is. portion is great and price is better.

I 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went there twice in one day.  Lunch and dinner.  The prices are excellent and very affordable.  The staff are friendly and the quality was the same for me.

I do recommend it for take out as well there is no loss in quality having it at home! This will be a regular for me."}
{"text":"Straight up, I'm not an expert or anything but this place makes some good Fukin Pho!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always good. Always cheap! Friendly staff. Book early or get there before noon or you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho place that I have ever tried! The service is superb, the prices are great. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place because i was in the area,  and because i already tried all the other pho restaurants around vaghan mills area already. ..Decor isn't the best ....but the pho ... amazing.  If u love pho. U know its all about the soup.  The soup here is delicious,  rich in flavor,  and has lots of depth. I ordered the Pho dac biet (the special) was $8 for XL. Finished it to the last drop! Owners also gave some fresh Orange slices to finish the meal, which is perfect after the richness of the soup.  Will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Surrounded by Manufacturing, Industrial area within the block this Pho is probably a QUICK convenient Lunch for most that are within walking distance from their work.  I even noticed the Utensil Holders typically having Chopsticks and Spoons here they have Silver Spoons and Forks not typical of other Pho restaurants.   2.5 *Star*

At this night I only see a table or two of guest then I realize even one of them weren't guest but Family & Friends just dropping off Kids.  This T&T was already decorated in Christmas Decor and while a LCD displays CP24, the second one shows scenes from Vietnam sights.  The space seems PINKish because of the walls.  Service was nice and friendly.

Shrimp Spring Roll came in 3 huge rolls cut into half each.  Served with Hoisin Sauce topped with Peanuts.

House Special Pho arrived to my table and I instantly got the Pho aroma.  The garnishes were limited in variety even the guest at the next table immediately noticed.  Broth was nice and the Beef Brisket is the thicker ones rather than Deli-thin.  Rare Beef was almost fully cooked therefore less tender than it would have been."}
{"text":"Another pho location...sigh...the pho is not bad in terms of the taste of the broth but the portion of noodles and meat are ridiculously small. I ordered large pho twice at two different visits and at first I thought it was just a mishap of that one time but they really are skimpy on the portion. My bf ordered the bowl of bun cha and it was the same as every other pho restaurant, nothig special. On the second visit, I ordered the sinh to mit which is the jackfruit milkshake. The daughter of the owner who was not happy to be working there came to tell us they don't have it and I ask if they had the mango available and she just giving me attitude for whatever reason. The service is just not attentive at this location..like at all. When you come in, they don't acknowledge you and when you seat yourself down . They tend to tell you that the table is dirty so move over somewhere else. The only time you see waitress or waiter is when they take the order to the kitchen and when they bring out the food. I could understand if it was busy but both visits were just us and two people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for lunch. Have a big variety of dishes like pho soup, rice and noodle etc. 
Fresh and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"LOVE t&t pho! I always get the XL S7 beef ball with half done beef filet. I have never ever tried anything else on the menu. I've been to about 4 other pho joints in the gta and this place takes the cake. I Don't mind the drive because it's worth it! I love the environment, you can just chow down and watch cp24. Its not a restaurant restaurant its more like a drop in drop out kind of place it's kind of a dive but I love it I love it"}
{"text":"Pho T&T is an A-OK Pho Joint! The location is a little out of the way nestled in between commercial and industrial area. 

Pho here is surprisingly good starting at $6! The broth has a lot of flavour and not too salty. The noodle though not fresh, was cooked well without take of staleness that is really common with dried noodle. The beef flank was tender and soft, more like a tiny sliced beef brisket! 

Don't order Iced Vietnamese Coffee... I don't think anyone ever ordered it or something.. because the waitress was really confused and she does not even know how the coffee dripper works. Ended up I have a faulted ones and sitting there for 20 min staring at it.. only ended up with 1/8 cup of coffee.. I finally gave up and told the waitress please take that off my bill, I cannot wait for another hour for my coffee! 

Service here is nice and friendly. First time at a Vietnamese restaurant served by a Caucasian waitress..... 

Good place if you are in the area and want a Pho fix... but does not worth going out of your way to come here!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible!!!! The service was horrible (owner). Never going back. I got the runs immediately"}
{"text":"I work in the area and have eaten here a few times for lunch. I typically order some sort of Thai noodles from their menu. Reasonable prices; decent meal. Acceptable service. 

Their ceiling mounted TV's are always on CP24 if you want to catch up on news...by reading the on-screen Captions.

It may not be worth going out of your way to get here but as an \"around the corner\" lunch spot, it's perfect."}
{"text":"Great food ...beef ball pho. Broth is authentic from scratch with hints of the right fragrance.  Crispy spring rolls, fresh rice rolls with grilled chicken.   Grilled chicken is also juicy.  
Great attention to service. 
Pricing is very reasonable for portions"}
