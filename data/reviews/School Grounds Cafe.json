{"text":"I love this coffee house. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Their coffee is fantastic! I like to buy the dark roast coffee, it is absolutely delicious. Their isnt a whole lot of food menu choices, but the food and bakery is yummy."}
{"text":"The building and atmosphere is cozy and interesting with all the artwork on the walls that are available to purchase. Now to the important things, the staff and the Coffee.  I must say that the staff have me feeling better about the day the second I walk in. Good looking group of baristas. Courteous and always service with a smile. The coffee and Lattes are the best. I recommend the Shockwave if you need that morning  \"up and atom start\".  Good stuff.  The sandwiches are tasty and made to perfection.   I can't say enough about how happy I am to have them close to my home.  Great coffee , outstanding staff , tasty treats.    That's five stars in my book."}
{"text":"Great place! It's in a restored schoolhouse, really cool space, great coffee and friendly, well run business."}
{"text":"Coffee, scones, atmosphere and service are all top notch. Multiple visits and never less than a great experience."}
{"text":"Very cute little coffeehouse with a nice selection of cafe items. Also check out all the art while your visiting. Love that it's in an old school house."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and charming environment. Coffee to order just how you like and great breakfast lunch items. I live just a few miles away and wish I knew about this place sooner. Would help if the signage had a picture of a coffee mug to get passerbys coming off the exit. People have a difficult time trying to make out what a sign reads while driving. I would like to see this small business continue to succeed! Better signage that didn't look like a historical museum would help get people driving by in this cute place versus picking up and mediocre coffee at kwik trip."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick breakfast bite on our way from Madison to Milwaukee. The place is great. It's right off of 94, just take highway N south. Took maybe 2 minutes to get there from the highway.  The cafe looks pretty newly renovated and is also an art gallery and has tasty crepes. I got a savory crepe with bacon, mushroom, cheddar, and spinach that was delicious. My partner got a chai latte. The owner and the barista were super friendly. They even asked how spicy my partner wanted their chai latte and told us a little bit about the place. Apparently they are going to be opening up the porch for mimosa and crepe brunches. So I'm hoping to go back for that. They also mentioned live music, which would be cool.   Price was right around $12 for a savory crepe and the latte, which seems very reasonable and less than I would expect to pay in Madison.  Only sad thing was it seems like it might be tough to run a cafe in cottage grove. There weren't a ton of people there. It's only 20 minutes from downtown Madison (closer from the east side) so definitely worth a stop and even more so if you are already heading for Milwaukee or making your way towards the u pick strawberry spots in between Madison and Milwaukee."}
{"text":"Spectacular cappuccino, phenomenal baked goods and a such warm, inviting, and genuine atmosphere. A+"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly - coffee was really bitter. Very cute little cafe, but I just couldn't get past how bitter my latte.  and i wasn't alone because we ordered 3 different drinks (coconut milk latte, regular milk vanilla latte, and an americano) and all were veerrrryyy bitter.  disappointing."}
{"text":"Pulled off 94 for gas and saw this while heading there. Convinced the fella to stop and I'm glad I did! Good coffee, a few gluten free treats (along with a ton of straight ones)and awesome energy. I told him we need to stop there every time we come through. Love the building, colorful nostalgia all in one."}
{"text":"Our household frequents School Grounds, especially in the winter for their daily homemade soups (I have never been disappointed) and warm sandwiches.  Be sure to grab a cup of their tea (which is beyond exceptional) and check out all of the artwork on display throughout the schoolhouse. It is an intimate and eccentric atmosphere, and in the warmer months there is a patio to enjoy."}
{"text":"Sweet little cafe outside Madison. Great views and art all around! I love the old building and the service is just sweet. The bakery is impressive and they've got an expansive menu. Would pick this over many Madison coffee shops."}
{"text":"It's a great location, cute shop, and had friendly service, but unfortunately I can't recommend it. Everything was overpriced, especially considering none of the food was made fresh. We ordered pot pies and were given reheated stew with biscuits. For more than $8 each, I was expecting better. The coffee was good, but also overpriced considering the size. Starbucks would be a better value for price versus size. I was hoping for better, but I won't be returning based on this experience."}
{"text":"Awesome. This is such a cool place. The coffee is great and the scones are the best around. Owner came and talked to us. Seems like a really nice guy"}
{"text":"There is something about Wisconsinites that makes you feel welcome. The cafe is a place to relax and enjoy a hot coffee in a cold day. I love the teddy bear paintings mounted on the wall. The staff are friendly and helpful with the menu. I tried the coffee cake and it was a great complement with my coffee. If you're tired of the same mega chain coffee shop, try School Grounds Cafe to support a small business."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop. I usually get a Caff√® Americano which is always good. Perfect atmosphere, I'm looking forward to using the patio when the weather gets better!"}
{"text":"Love to stop in and get a delicious sandwich, scone, or tea. Always friendly service."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this place a couple of weeks ago. Excellent atmosphere! It's an art gallery with a coffee shop embedded in it. The bakery is awesome, and I had a great soup and sandwich lunch, too. Super easy access to and from I-94 Eastbound. What really sets this place apart is the friendly staff - they really make you feel welcome and important, without being over the top perky. I'll be back - A LOT!"}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite at 930am that was not quite a full-blown brunch, and came upon this super cute place. Friendly staff, great selection of pastries and breakfast items! I had a hard time choosing between the carrot cake, coffee cake, and ham sandwich (\"What do you recommend? \"Ooh, that's tough\") so I ended up with the coffee cake and it was amazing. A huge square of buttery fluffy cake topped with salty-sweet-cinnamony streusel. Delicious. They heated it up for me, gave me a bag with napkins and forks, and I gobbled it down in no time flat on the go."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is friendly. Coffee is great with good selection and good selection of food. I really like the atmosphere and the deck and outdoor seating. Wish they had longer hours."}
{"text":"As a recent Cottage Grove resident, I can tell you this is the best place in town for coffee! The cafe is cute and welcoming, coffee tastes great - I've had people tell me their smoothies and lattes are good too."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and scones and great service :) and very very cool atmosphere with artwork"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! In the summers, my husband and I will bike down here for a lunch. It's small, but very quaint. I love browsing the gallery section. The sandwiches are always amazing. All the baked goods we have tried have been baked from scratch and have been delicious. It's not a far detour from I-94, so I highly recommend stopping here if looking for a place to eat."}
{"text":"Beautiful little semi-hidden coffeeshop in Cottage Grove! I love coming here to work because it's quiet (not too quiet), staff is super nice, coffee is good, and the cozy interior space is welcoming and features rotating art. Apparently the bakery is great as well, but I've successfully avoided the temptation :)"}
{"text":"The School Grounds cafe was a fun last stop last Saturday after a day of exploring all that Cottage Grove has to offer. We stopped on a Saturday afternoon around 2 pm. Unfortunately, there was a car show in town earlier that day and all their bakery sold out that day. And, unfortunately we had our children with us (not School Grounds Cafe fault) so, due to the great art in the building, we stayed outside.   While we loved the location, the building, and the art gallery my husband and I both agreed both of our coffee drinks were lacking oomph. The espresso definitely needed to be stronger. I had ordered a frappacino, my husband a caramel latte.   However, the staff were super friendly and helped us find a drink for our kids. We went with the homemade lemonade, which was fantastic."}
{"text":"We go to the mid-west at least once a year and always stop here on our way from Milwaukee to Madison. It's become a tradition for a reason- the food rocks, the decor and design are super cute and the service is outstanding. As far as drinks go, I have only had the chai. It was delicious. The panini's are very good but I usually just grab one of the bakery items to eat in the car.  They have an outside area where you can sit and relax and they really have made that space look very nice. You almost forget how close it is to the highway. It is gorgeous in the summer. The inside is adorable, styled in the fashion of an old school house as reflected by their name. I will continue to make this a regular stop on our mid-west trips!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is cute, unique and incredibly friendly. Not the cheapest or quickest  cafe around, but I never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome find on our drive from Milwaukee to Madison. Great strong coffee. Excellent scones and breakfast sandwiches. A great alternative to the chain breakfast spots."}
{"text":"What a cute place!  My girlfriends took me here for a bridal shower brunch. I ordered the Tuscan ham and cheese melt with a caramel frappe. Delicious! We all enjoyed our meals and the ladies working there were very sweet.   The place itself has interesting artifacts. A lot of them I would love to have for my home, especially some wood bowls and wall art. There was a couple $15 salt and pepper shakers, which were a bit overkill, but to each their own.  Overall, nice place in a location I very rarely go to. Definitely a good place for a get together with some girls."}
{"text":"Friendly but slow to service.  Cool looking space. Items sampled good - but I hate when places heat up something without asking! Coffee brewed choices were limited but good  WHERE IS THE DARN REG SUGAR HIDING?!  First time here not impressed overall."}
{"text":"Great  sandwiches, coffee, and desserts. Super friendly staff. Plus fun local art throughout the place. Definitely my go-to place for lunch when I'm at our office in Cottage Grove."}
{"text":"A cute, unique cafe for breakfast and lunch! In an old school house, School Grounds is so cute and different. The cherry strudel is beyond delish. I'm serious. Get one. Coffee is good. I had the leafy beefy melt; it was flavorful but the bread got soggy quickly so I wouldn't have it again. But overall a cute cafe with good food!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and beautiful atmosphere in an old school house displaying unique works of art by local Artists. Try the Sugar Bush Latte!!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in their new hours.  They now close at 3:30 pm every week day which is not convenient to me and when normally frequented the place.  I'm hoping they will reconsider and extend their hours until 4:30 or 5 PM. I'm dropping the rating from 5 stars to 4 only because of this.  The coffee and food is still fantastic."}
{"text":"Great coffee and excellent service. The patio is s great work spot (wi-fi) on nice weather days. They have a pretty good lineup for local music on the weekends as well."}
{"text":"Visited for Sunday breakfast. When we arrived (1/2 hour after opening), several of their dishes weren't yet available to order. What we did get (the spinach fritatta) was over-cooked and seemed pre-bought. Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Came in for coffee and breakfast before driving to Milwaukee, food was great, coffee was wonderful, but the service was the best part. Also loved the design inside the cafe. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 10  stars. Incredible coffee. Attention to detail and the best ingredients. They have imported coffee syrups from France. The sandwiches are better than what's available at nice restaurants. Their baked goods are phenomenal. Great macarons and scones."}
{"text":"Oh baby.  We've wanted to checkout School Grounds Cafe for many years.  I'm glad we finally took the opportunity.    Solid coffee and nice selection of baked goods.  Comfortable seating and nice selection of artwork.    They did a great job on the remodeling of the building.  High quality and it's a nice place to hang out.  Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent prices and most of all so conveniently located right off the highway.  We were on a road trip and me being me, had drank too water and had to pee. So I frantically yelped and found schoolhouse!  So cute - had it been warmer, we'd had stuck around and eaten on their patio. But we grabbed two breakfast sandwiches and a coffee inside.   Original artwork on the walls, clean space. The breakfast sandwiches will run you about $6 a piece but are decently sized - no frills but filling. Great place to stop!"}
{"text":"Wonderful espresso, Eric has it perfected.  The ham sandwich was @ cucumber salad were very tasty.  This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Unique cute stop - father, son owned. Wonderful service by son and staff. Had the sugar bush latte and spinach friatta and my husband had the porridge. Quick easy off the interstate will definitely be a stop to make in the future again."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee shop coming up on the Madison area, right off the Interstate.  It's an old school house complete with antique school furniture and trappings as decorations.  Two stories, the upstairs is reached by a tight little spiral staircase, so that's where you go to get some isolated privacy if you're concentrating on some work.  Good coffee, skilled baristas, tasty selection of baked goods, the Chief of Staff raved about her warm chocolate chip cookie.  They have an interesting selection of artistic jewelry and art by local talent displayed all over the cafe.  The way it's set up, the place can be pretty full but you don't really feel like there are a lot of people there, it feels cozy and private.  Their parking lot has just the right amount of spaces."}
{"text":"They do everything right.  The beefy leafy sandwich was most excellent.   Great coffee, great service while listening to live music.  My wife enjoyed her Cuban sandwich too."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Madison with our clown car full of children. The thing I loved best is when we walked in the first thing I heard was \"welcome to school grounds\". It's rare to be greeted anymore I feel when coming into a restaurant. My 6 year old was very thirsty and the gent who was working got him a glass of water right away and chatted with him which was also nice. The coffee was delicious-- I had the sugar bush latte with maple Syrup. The breakfast sandwiches were devoured within a couple of minutes by my family as well as the coffee cake and scones. Fed our family of 6 breakfast for under $40 and this included 4 \"fancy\" coffee drinks. Overall, wonderful customer service which was refreshing. The atmosphere is cool with a loft upstairs with lots of artwork to look at. Price, Service, quality, good with kids. We will stop again on our way through!!"}
{"text":"School Grounds Cafe is a cute little coffee shop / cafe / gallery offering a variety of coffee and espresso options, teas, baked goods, breakfast options, and sandwiches.  Good food, excellent coffee, & friendly staff. Just what I needed from a pit stop in our road trip earlier this month.  I grabbed a ham breakfast sandwich and a large coffee for the road. Sandwich was tasty and filling and their brewed coffee was a delight in terms of flavor. None of this burnt & biter taste you'll find from a chain coffee shop, but instead a clean and savory cup of joe. Wish I had stuck around long enough to ask where their coffee beans come from.   I'm sure this place is quite the hang out on weekend morning in the summer with the huge wooden deck they have. The cafe is situated right off the 94 freeway. Definitely worth a stop if you find yourself in need of a driving break and a nice cup of coffee.  'Til next time, cheers!"}
{"text":"This adorable cafe, full of beautiful pieces of art and tasty food, is also super convenient to the highway and has more seating, inside and out, than you'd expect.   My husband and 2 kids (ages 4 yrs and 15 mo) stopped in for lunch.  The soup and scones were particularly good, and my older daughter liked the pb&j and the chips. You'd expect to find an arts cafe like this in a resort town or down town in a city, but here it is right off the highway. We'll be here again I'm sure when we drive between Madison and Chicago."}
{"text":"Charming little place, run by staff who are all happy to be there. Different pastries daily and outstanding coffee. The lunch offerings - mostly sandwiches - are also well worth exploring. The objets d'art prominently displayed (and for sale) add to the charm. There's even live music on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. It really is unfortunate that SchoolGrounds is on my way to my horse. Well, sometimes, when I feel like I have self-control, I take the other way to my horse. That rarely happens on weekends.   I love the coffee here. Granted, I get the soy latte or soy mocha every time, but I've never been disappointed!   Also, I love the carrot cake. I usually do not love carrot cake, but this carrot cake has won me over. I will never love another carrot cake.   So yeah, I'm the type of person to find what I like at a place and always get that. I'm too risk adverse to try anything else. I've heard great things about the other things on their menu, so maybe one day I'll try something new.  The owner is super nice and all the servers/baristas are super nice as well. It's nice that they remember their customers, and that makes me happy."}
