{"text":"I love this place!  It opened last year and the food was wonderful but menu was small.... This year they have added quite a bit and the salads are huge and very good!  They have great Italian coffee and I could go on and on. I think what I like best is the fact that the owners will do anything to make you comfortable and happy. Give it a try... Well worth it."}
{"text":"Wife stopped in after visit to the post office, staff was welcoming, ordered the Marguerite Pizza. It was amazing, everyone loved it. Reasonable prices and fantastic flavors. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"When you are looking for that little fabulous place that only the locals know about and call their own, this should be one of your first stops. It's totally cute, great food, awesome prices, and very friendly service by folks who make you feel like family. The food is fresh and Italian in nature including pizza, panini, salad, pasta, yummy Italian deserts and of course coffee, espresso, cappuccino and ice cream. The menu isn't huge, but there's plenty to choose from and the pizza is made fresh with nice crisp veggies and tasty meats and cheeses. They are adding new items all the time. I highly recommend this as your new regular haunt."}
{"text":"I came for the first time to check this little gem in town! So far I have to say such nice people!"}
{"text":"This is a delightful and surpringly great little gem in the hrsrt of Youngtown. We had 2 Paninis, 1 was beef the other chicken. They both were outstanding! We enjoyed the hummus which wss homemade ...outstanding!  The owners especially the chef was absolutely terrific!  Will tell all my friends about this little jewel in the desert."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. Ordered for delivery and it arrived semi warm and still a bit uncooked. No flavor whatsoever. Will not be back. 26 dollars later and I still wish I had dinner. Ugh. I rarely have any negative reviews to share but I just felt a buyer beware was necessary on this one."}
{"text":"It is wonderful algerian  Mediterranean pizza owner with cool looking wall colors  inside and convenient to a family ,and birthday party...I am amazed how this young owner with co workers like to be amongst the retirement and elderly people"}
{"text":"Stopped on for a quick meal. Got the hummus with meat for $7.99 and it was really good. Small little gem that I'll be returning to. They have a pizza special, buy two get one free!!!"}
{"text":"My family loves coming here. The staff are always cheerful and great us with a smile. We've had the gyros and pizza and loved the flavor. We love to support small local businesses and this one has our business for many years to come!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner there because we were using an entertainment voucher. It was a little out of the way for us and somewhat hidden in a small strip mall. It did not look inviting, as there were no cars in the lot., But don't judge Italia by its first impression. Or even the second one. We were the only patrons inside the small shop. But a younger girl pleasantly invited us in and let us know we could sit at the table of our choice. She was very friendly and courteous all during our visit. We later found out she was the owner's (and chef's) daughter. It was not until we were served our food that all of the apprehension left. I had the Italian beef sandwich w/fries, my wife the personal pizza. It was the best Italian beef sandwich I have tasted in quite a while. It was served with extra au jus which enhanced the flavor. Even the fries were cooked to perfection. Even my wife, who is not a big French fry eater, commented on how good they tasted. We are planning on returning after they get their shipment (from a great lake state) in. Hopefully they will have my favorite flavor of Thrifty ice cream in also. I try to patronize mom & pops as much as possible, You won't be disappointed at Italia."}
{"text":"My 70 year old father went in here last night and ordered a plain meatball sandwich. He explained that he couldn't handle a lot of extra stuff and was a \"plain guy\". He also shared that he would be sharing the meatballs with his dog and didn't even want cheese on it and asked for very light sauce. Long story short and $9 later. His sandwich was smothered in onions etc.... he went back and asked for them to correct it and the owner was very rude and told my dad \"I heard what you ordered\" refused to fix it, took the sandwich back and basically kicked my dad out of his store. This is Uncalled for! Horrible customer service. I'm angry that my dad was treated this way. Shame on you Italia cafe! My dad always raised us to spend our money with the small business owner but I hope this business closes down! Unreal!"}
{"text":"Cute little bistro tuckwd in a strip mall area near ace hardware in Youngtown. They have pizza, and a few other pasta dishea. Their surpreme 18 in pizza is loaded with toppings. Nothing skimy and it is delicious. Their dessert cakes are heavenly. I work nearby and they are very accommodating know lunchs can be a hurried time limit.  They also serve Thriftys ice cream which has always been my favorite. A friendly family owned place."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem out here in the Sun city area. They mainly do a limited menu of things such as Chicken Alfredo, pastas and pizzas. They have Thrifty brand ice cream. And excellent Italian style coffee. it's a small little independent place. We need more of this out here in Sun City. Not many people know there here, hardly any advertising. Nice place for a little lunch or a coffee, maybe a little after church get together place."}
