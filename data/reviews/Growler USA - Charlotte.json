{"text":"My favorite place to go for a flight of beer or ciders. Have not been disappointed by selection. Staff is friendly. Bathrooms are clean. Atmosphere is inciting and not loud so holding a conversation is doable."}
{"text":"Used to serve a nice $7 burger.  Now it's $12, very small, bacon looks like it was just taken out of package and put on my sandwich."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out. Went there on a Saturday. They do have a great selection of beers. I attempted to order a chicken sandwich that came out wrong twice and tasted terrible. My wife ordered the pimento cheese and lobster bruscetta. This was also very bland and poorly prepared. It's almost like the cook staff did not care about how the food came out. The waitress was very nice however. Also this place had absolutley zero atmosphere! I would suggest playing your music a bit louder. Probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place just opened and it is obvious they are still working out the kinks. The beer selection is amazing. Lots of local options, and everyone can find something they like. My sister especially appreciated the soda and cider selections as she is not a beer drinker. 

The food needs some work. We got an app, but it was not good. 

I will definitely come back for a beer, but I am not sure I would have dinner here again."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. New place in a great location. Good beer selection and atmosphere; however, food quality/value was well below average (hot dogs, sliders). Server was friendly but food was very slow to come out. I have a severe seafood allergy and when asked which menu items had seafood in it, no one was sure. Doubt they will be around long if big changes arent made. Focus on the drinks but avoid the food. Wife's tater tots were cold too. Not coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"I live in Sacramento, but was in the area for business. I didn't know the area at all and found the place because it was close to my hotel. I loved the electronic menus on the wall that provided a good detailed amount of information for each beer. They were all categorized with different stats per beer. Coming from Sacramento, I love Sierra Nevada's beer and this place had multiple varieties. The employee pouring the beer seemed to be able to explain the different beers well enough and I felt confident that had I wanted to ask for something new, he would have been able to gauge my preferences and selected for me a beer that I would have enjoyed. 

For food, I had the seared ahi tuna. It's my personal policy that when ahi tuna is on the menu, I order it. It was good. It had a great dipping sauce. It wasn't sweet but rather was more of a subtle, savory light flavor. I wasn't in love with the blackened seasoning on it, but the fish seemed fresh and it went well with my beer. I'd order it again in a heart beat.

The house had a gentleman playing guitar and singing the night that I was there (8/5/2016) and I thoroughly enjoyed this artist. He had a very good repertoire of some very well known songs that people like to hear. 

Good beer, good food, good entertainment. I look forward to coming back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We came here last night and had a great time!  I was not sure what to expect with the mixed reviews, but it was an awesome experience!  We did not have food, but had 5 beers between the 2 of us up at the bar.  The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable.  I cannot remember his name, but the one was so nice to chat with and really knew his stuff.  I know others have commented on here about the prices, but they really were not any higher than anywhere else around for craft beer.  As I said above, we had 5 and our bill was $24.  I don't think that is unreasonable at all.  We will definitely be coming back and I was so glad we gave this place a try!"}
{"text":"Growler USA has a great selection of beer and is constantly rotating its taps. The staff is great and manager is so accommodating. Like others have stated it is bar food, not a gourmet meal. Prices are on average and you pay what you get for. Tuesdays $3 for NC beers is a slam dunk deal. Sundays have discounted growler prices...win!win!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is great. Try the ahi tuna, wings, or hot dogs! You can't go wrong. The staff knows a lot about beer. They are also on Taphunter, which is a free app you can download to keep up with all their beer. Very helpful! Will definitely be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Almost an endless amount of beers on tap... I'm typically not a huge beer drinker however able to find something to my liking. Also the seared tuna app is not too bad."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The beer selection was fantastic and the staff was really friendly. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Found this place after leaving my dentist. What a wonderful place. Beer selection is awesome and staff is very knowledgable about their beer. Highly recommend."}
{"text":".50 cent wings on Mondays! My husband, nephew & I were actually walking into Bahn Thai next door when we saw the chalk board sandwich board sign out front that said the Wings were half price tonight and decided to check it out. The wings were definitely small but we had a great time playing Music Trivia and winning a $5 pub card. The beer selection is nice also. I think if I had to compare it to somewhere it's very similar to Duckworth's and Flying Saucer. They have various pour sizes for each beer so you can try a 2oz, 10oz, 16oz or a Growler size."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer. Food and service , however, were simply bad..  It took them 45+ min to bring our order of wings and tacos, both tasted like something you heat up in your microwave.. soggy... flavorless..  
Verdict - go for the beers, but do not go if you are planning to eat here... There is a reason for their big \"outside food is not allowed\" door sign , I am sure there were multiple attempts to bring in something you can actually eat..."}
{"text":"I'd give 4.5 stars if it were possible. I've been here various times, and the staff has always been knowledgeable and very helpful with beer  suggestions. This is the only place where I'd consider ordering tater tots -- not oily here, unlike other places. Good burger, said my dining mate. My chicken sandwich was good overall, but I happened to get piece with a few bites of gristle that I couldn't bite through, so that was not a good surprise...  Good salad!"}
{"text":"First visit tonight. Great beer list.  Decent if limited menu. Buffalo Chicken wrap for me. It was good but over sauced so it got soggy before I finished it. Wife had Asian chicken salad. Liked it. Live entertainment. Decent voice but painfully loud. We were seated in the back and the people around us had to shout to converse. We just gave up."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!!!!! And here is why. 
Stellar beer selection.  104 on tap with four nitro taps as well. Whatever you may like - IPAS, Pilsners, Stouts, Porters, Ales, Saison, high octane AND, they have ciders! THEY HAVE IT ALL! Wow what a selection.  Matt, managing partner,  is phenomenal. He knows his beer and tastes all beers featured here. Tough job =)

Walking in,  I was taken aback by the taps alone. They have several tables and bar stools so one can cozy up and talk beer with the certified beer servers. Aly immediately greeted us with a cheerful smile.  She was helpful in assisting with finding a perfect brew.  We ordered several.  How could you not as there are so many awesome choices. 

This is a perfect place for those new to the craft beer world. Although most taps are from the Carolinas, they do have a fair amount of other great ones from the West Coast. Their menu is organized by type of beer so it's much easier to find what you are looking for along with ABVs and IBUs as well.

Before we left, we ordered the tater tots with blue cheese and artichoke dip to go. These were tasty delights when we got home. They have a full menu so stop in, grab a beer and enjoy a meal with family and friends."}
{"text":"this place fills a void for Ballantyne.  I've been saying for years we need a local hangout with good beer. lots of beer choices including local brews. we enjoyed a few beers and tried some new ones with a flight. thankful that this place is so close to home.  added bonus, they will fill your growlers! looking forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"First timer, didn't know what expect. 2 adults and son (14 yrs) on a Saturday @ 6:00pm.  Final 4 game was on S. Carolina vs Gonzaga. Good crowd. Establishment is not oversized but can seat enough people inside. Outside seating is limited to 4-5 tables. Waitress was quick to acknowledge us and provided great service. We ordered one flight of different beers ($2 per 4 oz each X 6) all of which were good. We also ate. Menu is sparse. Food was good but sizes are small. Prices aren't too bad. We started with 2 appitizers. Mahi Mahi tacos were not worth $12. Each adult had another full size beer. Live music started which was a guy on an acoustic guitar,  but he was too loud (we were right in front of him). End of it all, $81with tip. OUCH! Luckily I had a $40 Groupon voucher. I'd go back, no kid next time. Not that he was bored, just extra $$ on bill. Would have liked to have sat outside."}
{"text":"Visited last night around 6pm. Had the Mediterranean plate \"app\". Watch out this is a plate to be shared!!! Pretzel bites were good. Needed napkins though.  Choice of beer was daunting. Do your homework!!"}
{"text":"We came to Growlwr USA for a snack and brew after doing some shopping.  I was extremely impressed with the very large beer selection.  It is normally difficult to find a smoked beer, but this place carries one! We orderd the pretzel bites for a snack and they were great!! Seems like this place also runs pretty good beer specials, we will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal selection of local craft beers.  Loved the kombucha and ahi tuna.  (Yes... I'm a woman.  Also appreciated the purse hooks!)"}
{"text":"The beer was good, and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and provided great service. I had the beer brat gyro and my girlfriend had the veggie burgers. Both were just OK. We also ordered pretzel bites and french fries, which reminded us of the Ore Ida frozen french fries that you can get in the grocery store."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer. Definitely come here if you are really into it. The service is great and the interior fits the craft beer mood. 

If you are not into beer, this is not the place to eat. They have decent selection of food, but it pales in comparison to other restaurants. I would say just standard bar food that goes pretty well with beer. 

Overall, come here on a night for a drink and bite; as long as you don't do it just for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food! Great customer service! Buffalo chicken dip is awesome! Amazing food and the beer selection is amazing!
If you love ciders, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with 104 beers on tap? I mean wow, the choices! I stopped in last night and they offered $3 NC beers! This made the overall experience a little less intimidating. 

Just to touch on a few points... The place is small, smaller than I expected since they do offer so many beers. The thought crossed my mind, \"how often do these beers go bad?\" 

My company and I tried food. He got beer brat sliders with a side salad. I got chicken fingers with tator tots. I found it a bit strange that my chicken fingers were tossed in the sauce because it read like they would be. The chicken fingers came with 3 fingers which tasted very bland without the sauce. I tried the honey sriracha sauce which I actually really liked. I think they should expand the menu a little bit more if they are looking to serve food. It was limited in my opinion.  

GPS also took me to the wrong side of the shopping center. The sign on the outside of the building is small and hard to read. 

Our server was helpful and offered us tastes of beers before we committed to a whole pint. Overall I did enjoy my experience and would suggest this place to any friend that is looking for a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Cool place. The brat sliders are delicious! Sooo many beers to choose from. Also you can fill growlers"}
{"text":"Great watering hole! 100 taps with tons of beer and cider choices. Try a sample, order a flight and try something new. 

The food is delicious. No fryer in house, so the food is healthier than typical bar food. Buffalo dip is made in-house daily. 

There are always events. 50 cent wing nights, board games on Wednesday, live music on some Thursdays and every Saturday. Run club meets up after running every other Thursday. Growler USA is all about community and conversation. Love the standing table in the center, and the low top and high top tables that you can push together for bigger parties. 

Amber, director of operations, shared that 85% of staff have been here since day one, which is a testament to them doing something right. 

She and Matt are very involved in the community as well. They have supported local charities like The Isabella Santos Foundation (come out Sept 16), the 24 Foundation. They are open to new partnerships too."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. Have visited on a couple of occasions, & love the variety of their Stouts. Low key & comfortable with a few tv screens. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the food. Tried a few things & was very unimpressed (even for bar fare). If you're looking to catch a beer, I recommend. Also like the fact that you can buy as many \"samples\" as you want. (Doesn't have to be a certain increment)"}
{"text":"What a fun, fab place to open here in Ballantyne! Growler USA has an amazing selection of craft beers on tap and bottled as well. Where does one begin? The small menu offers something for everyone and the \"bar bites\" and main dishes are better than traditional pub fare (and some healthy choices, too!). The prices are right as well. This was not a \"pub crawl\" kind of place like you'd find in uptown. There were a couple of families with well behaved kids there when we visited. We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Beer, beer and more beer...did I mention beer!?

This is one of the best, most diverse beer selections around.  Staff is top notch and really very helpful and knowledgeable.

Food is solid...try the buffalo wings.  A little small but the sauce was amazing!

I love the way they do beer flights, in a \"clock\" type rack so you know what you're drinking.  Something here for everyone!"}
{"text":"Funny the \"owner\" says I came in intoxicated again, as I have other times. The only other time I came to drink was one time prior, and was welcomed by patrons with open arms and hung out with two gentleman at the end of the bar that we exchanged contact info with since they enjoyed my presence. I was even invited into your kitchen and took a tour of your walk-in cooler. 

The prior times I frequented your establishment was when I paid money for your over priced food while I drank a single beer and had not had any alcohol before coming in. Those occasions I mostly kept to myself and shared some small talk with your employees. 

This occasion you are referring to try to berate me with is the day of the SuperBowl and I came in after having a few drinks completely coherent and not slurring my speech. It is the, SUPER BOWL, it is supposed to be enjoyed together. 

I asked the ladies if they minded if I joined them, sitting in the seat further away from them with no intentions set besides enjoying the game, and meeting some people in the neighborhood. They said they had no problem with me sitting there. And then you stomped in.. 

Telling me I had to sit at the bar, and at this point I was on my way out, and instead get bombarded with additional terrible service. 

After the way you confronted me about the situation I had already decided to leave, but instead get forced out. 

I have a large circle of friends, and you can believe, I have spread the word, and will continue to do soo. 

I urge others to steer clear of this business, if they think they can continue to employ these business practices and retain a customer base. They shall see the proof is in the pudding."}
{"text":"Yes. I would like to update this review. For one food item. 

THAT BUFFALO CHICKEN DIP.

*dramatic pause*

Yes. It's that good. I'm not kidding. Its such a big portion, that I even had leftovers - something that does not usually happen in my life. You should know that I have strong opinions and like to tell people what to do. haha. If you know me, you know this for sure - but in the nice and friendly, \"I just want what's best for you\" way. Please ignore all of the bad reviews on this page - and listen to this one. Order a beer (or a few), and the buffalo chicken dip. And maybe the Ahi Tuna.

Update complete. :)"}
{"text":"Packed on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30! The fella and I managed to get seats along the window, and there are about 13 seats at the main bar with a long community table (for standing) and some tables. 

Even though they haven't been open long, their service seemed to be on point with 5 bartenders working. They have enough TVs to watch the game, but not so many that you feel like you're in a sports bar. We didn't order food, but the fella is a beer nerd, and he was impressed with their list. He got a Bell's Hopslam, Troegs Nugget Nectar, and Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout on tap (I don't think they have any bottles). He said the beers all tasted really good like the tap lines were really clean, and he hopes they keep it up. I'm iffy on beer, so I was glad to see they had some sours, ciders, and wine. Their tap list is pretty extensive, and we were glad to see it wasn't just quantity - it was quality, too.

This is a great addition to not only Toringdon, but also Ballantyne. Duckworth's is usually our go-to, and it's nice to have an option."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today after hearing about the grand opening. First off, as a millennial Ballantyne local, I'm so excited to have something like this in the area. We met up with another couple around 6:15 and were very lucky to get a table, it was packed! The waitress was very nice and attentive. The beer menu is huge. We ordered food and in my opinion the food is subpar and the prices are outrageous. I will be back for drinks but will not be ordering a meal again. The spinach artichoke dip was very good but they charged us for extra pita when they sent it out with not nearly enough."}
{"text":"Really neat bar off of Johnston Road in Charlotte. Possibly know for the dozens of beers they have on tap. The actual pub is narrow, but hey, they have to make room for all of that beer right? The wait staff is really friendly, and knowledgable about the beer, taking the time to help you pick something you may like. The appetizers are also very tasty. Check their website for activity and live music calendars."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a coupon for dining there so  we  decided to have lunch at Growlers not beer even though Growlers is famous for the extensive amount of microbrewery beers . And I didn't know that the word growlers  means the vessel that beer is stored in.
 So at lunch time there were a few people sitting at the bar.  The place itself has a kind of boring atmosphere for sit down dining although the staff is very friendly and accommodating.
The menu limited but the food was good. My dining mates and I ordered the buffalo chicken dip appetizer, ahi tuna wrap, bacon and blue cheese burger, and chicken Cobb salad. All very tasty, good portions, plated nicely and prices reasonable. Sides choices for  some of our orders : fries , coleslaw, salad or tater tots.
The beer menu extremely extensive for those interested beer connesouers. Beers listed on a paper menu as well as display board by bar.
Probably would not return  since I am not a beer drinker but  I am glad I did go there."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for new varieties and styles of craft beer, we headed over to the Toringdon Circle Shopping Center in Ballantyne to visit with Matt Cohen about Growler USA and to get the scoop on one of the Queen City's newest hot spots. 

With over 100 craft beers available at any given time, the taproom / restaurant opened in January and has already secured its place as a must visit attraction for craft beer adventurers and novices alike.

A steady flow of kegs from the Carolina's and beyond keeps their state of the art fridge packed; their draft beer chilled at 37°; and the taps constantly flowing.

In fact, so much beer is flowing through their lines, the digital menu board is frequently updating.  Fortunately each keg change immediately updates on the TapHunter App, so their menu is always up-to-the-second and just a notification away.

With so many new craft breweries opening  throughout the U.S., Matt, who is also the Managing partner of the Ballantyne location, says the menu and varieties their Cicerone trained servers are introducing to Charlotte is encyclopedic.  They are arguably pouring some of the most unique brews from sea to shining sea.

If you're new to the craft beer phenomenon, don't fret. The Growler USA menu may seem overwhelming, but beer is about individual taste preferences. Their offerings are there to ensure that they have something for everyone. 

P.S. Don't forget to download the TapHunter, soon to be followed by Untapped, for the latest and greatest Growler USA in Ballantyne has on tap."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Saturday and was extremely disappointed.
Pros: The beer selection is impressive and our waitress was very nice.
Cons: The food was terrible. We waited almost an hour for our lunch and it came to us cold and bland. It was as if the chef either didn't care or didn't know what he was doing. It was also very over priced for simple bar food (hot dogs, quesadillas, tater tots etc). Seemed like everything was made previously and then heated up for us. Surprisingly when we first sat down, a woman who was an investor was sitting next to us. She proceeded to tell us how great she thought it was and she hoped we enjoyed our lunch. It was a shame that she left a few minutes after we arrived because I would have loved to inform her that perhaps she did not invest her money wisely."}
{"text":"Well.  You have to try everywhere once, and that's all I will be trying this.  
 
1) Service was pretty bad (nice...Just ungodly Slow)

2) Food was incredibly bland (its not hard to make a decent burger), but they haven't figured that out yet. 

3) beer prices where a bit above average"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer!! They have like 150 kinds of beer, and also have a small but delicious food menu. Great little place with indoor and outdoor seating. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I thought the beer selection was outstanding.. the prices were in line with any other bar in the area for craft beer. I did not eat... one member of my group did and said the food was fantastic. It was pricey, but he said it tasted great. He's a foodie, so his standards to me are quite high. All I can say is take some of the one star reviews down below with a grain of salt.. because several of them are the ONLY review from the \"reviewer\".. sounds to me like people who work at the competition attempting to bring the rating down. One is by a \"woman\" yet they call themselves a \"microbrew guy\"... so again.. grain of salt.

I am only giving four stars because the service was a bit weak. We never could figure out who our waitress was... although towards the end of the night, one lady pretty much took over."}
{"text":"My husband & I love this place. Great and huge selection of beers, mostly from the east coast and especially the carolinas. Very chill atmosphere with 30s & 40s age crowd. Only wish it was open a littler later than midnight!"}
{"text":"It has been so long that I have been to a restaurant that uses frozen patties that it is painfully obvious.  Don't come here for the food, but for the beer."}
{"text":"Great assortment of beers! Ashley, the bartender was fun. Atmosphere is great! Live music was a surprise on a Monday night, and the night was good!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of the 90++ beers on tap! Wide selection to choose from! After two visits, I am not a fan of the food. I guess the only exception would be the buffalo chicken dip. It was pretty good.

Cool lil spot that and they seem to be opening a bunch of these around the Carolina's, so that will be cool to see. Hopefully the food only continues to improve!"}
{"text":"We had a good experience here! We got a table right away. They had live music. Service was excellent. Our server was attentive and sweet. We came for the New Belgium day. Everyone at our party really enjoyed their beer and it was great that part of the proceeds went to charity. The decor is really nice. More seating than when it used to be a wine bar. Bathrooms were clean too. We didn't get to try any food but a table next to us had a dip and it looked really good."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late Saturday afternoon lunch and were pleased overall. The Charlotte Dog was a tasty chili and cheese foot long hot dog. We also had the Mac and Cheese with chicken and were happy with our choices. We both chose the tater tots, as a side, which were ok but nothing special. My wife found that dipping the tots in the cheese, from the Mac and Cheese, gave great life to the tater tots. 

The beer menu was huge and impressive as as you might imagine. We enjoyed several local selections that were spot on for a fun Saturday afternoon. 

The bartenders were attentive and helpful. 

The pricing still needs a little work. In speaking with our  friends, that was the first thing that was asked about. The talk on the street was they were a little pricey.

They have only been open a short time and should continue to get better. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fabulous selection of draft beers, ahi tun was spectacular ! The bar tenders knew their stuff, was able to help us easily navigate through the extensive beer list."}
{"text":"Oh hey beer heaven, I like you!

100 Taps!? Is that a challenge?

The food is pricey, but delicious and a good size portion.

The spinach & artichoke dip was bomb.
I had the mahi tacos, which were real good.

Wish they had more side options. The service wasn't very quick, but she was knowledgeable.

Sour beers rock my socks!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there for beers, my friend ordered one, and was told the keg has been kicked. I proceeded to pick out not just one, but three beers that all have been kicked...come on, out of the 100+beers on the menu, we pick 4 beers that are no longer on the menu? I ended up drinking wine at a beer place!! Mark them out before giving them to your customers. Then the service is lacking. Our drinks were empty twice and we had to flag someone down, not to mention that we had to go up to bar to get our tab to leave. I didn't even think they were that busy to be ignored. It's just ok, maybe next time go to Duckworths."}
{"text":"Growler is one of the best beer spots in Ballantyne I've visited so far! They have SO many taps (they also have wine) and some beers I hadn't seen anywhere else. Most recently for the first time I actually ate, I had the beer tenders tossed in honey sriracha sauce - AMAZE - and the chicken parm sandwich which was also good! The service there has always been spot on and I enjoy their occasional live music."}
{"text":"Eh.  I came out on Tuesday, which is evidently \"kill the keg\" night.  Tried to get the Braves game on TV, but they didn't have it.  Great beer selection and nice people, but it was dead at 8:00pm."}
{"text":"The drink selection here is great, we really enjoyed the variety and suggestions from the waiter. The food was just ok. We got the Ahi Poke, the Beer Brat Gyro, and the Growler Dog. The Ahi Poke was the best, but none of it was all that memorable."}
{"text":"Great beer selection BUT menus were printed on paper. They are stained, torn and covered in handwriting - it can't be that hard to laminate or reprint them. The food was terrible. The crab salad was a joke comprising of some mixed greens, two grape tomatoes, half an avocado and at best 2 tablespoons of watery processed crab meat. It might get better with time .... But it certainly can't get any worse."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work shortly after they opened. They had very good beers on tap and food was good. Will return."}
{"text":"Loved the service and the beers! Food was pretty good, but they need a little more on the menu. And a microbrewery that doesn't have beer cheese ?! What ?!"}
{"text":"I have stopped here a few times, and have always had a good time.  I have only had food during a club meeting, and it was pretty good bar appetizers.  They have friendly staff that will chat up with you or your group about beer, weather, or something clumsy you just did - like spilling your beer on yourself!

The flights are nice since the selection is overwhelming.  You don't have to get a set number as they are charged per sample, and they are generous sized tasters.  

The tap the keg special is nice - just ask about it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend Alex convinced me to come here. Slow service and the fact that they stopped supplying the D9 sour beer, I don't know that I will ever be back. The food was just OK, and it closed way too early. The spinach and artichoke dip is the only thing worth mentioning."}
{"text":"The place has a great beer selection, and some decent food. My wife and I stopped in for just those 2 reasons, and it met our needs. Sometimes you go into a place and instantly feel that it has a great vibe to it, or has its own personality. I didn't get that here. It seemed like just a bar in a strip mall (to borrow another yelpers phrase). That's exactly it. No real personality. If I was in this very specific area, and wanted a craft beer, I would stop back in, because it was a decent place. However, if I was going to drive 15 minutes to go somewhere to eat, I would probably never actually make a trip here."}
{"text":"So I had this weird feeling of de ja vu when I walked into this place, only because I think I've been to this location before (when it was something else) GASP!  Either way, I think Growler USA is definitely a cool spot - it is a little more convenient if you live in the Ballantyne/Pineville area, but the shopping center is right off of 485 and worth driving to.

So this shopping center has gotten WAY more busy since the last time I visited... there are plenty of spaces, it just felt like there was a lot of traffic going in and out.  Once you do find a space, it's a short walk and you are in beer heaven.  Taps on the right side behind a long bar, tables and high-tops on the left side.  A couple of lower tables can seat larger groups (6) or so, but I think the tables can also get pushed together.

Rotating beer list (of course).... our server was good about telling you which ones they were out of, but there's got to be a more efficient system than paper copy menus... it is fun playing a little \"beer roulette\" only it's not as fun when the beer you wanted is actually gone (sad face).

We actually had dinner here.. there's a good amount of pub food on the menu.  I ended up getting the mini corn dogs and the chicken parm sammich with tots.  Everything came out solid.. nothing too memorable, but food is good while having all the kinds of beers they offer here.  They do offer flights, that come in this wireframe flight holder - I just wanted a big glass of beer instead of 6 tiny ones and having to decide on 6 beers is a little more time consuming that just throwing one dart at the menu.

Our server was super accommodating and also very interactive as far as just making the whole experienced a little less formal/robot:  \"I am here to serve you\" and more \"come in, have a drink, and I'll be your friend\" type vibe - which I totally like."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here on a Sunday after a movie to check out the latest beer joint.  It's an ok place. It's a bar in a strip mall. There's no real soul to it so that's why the 3 star rating.

There's a long bench along the left wall with table seating and 6 pub style tables in the back. The bar is to the right. There's a pub table behind the bar seating for standing room only and there's a couple of seats in the front against the window. And a small patio out front. 

They have a good beer selection and many of the locals are represented.  But like others have said, I'm not impressed with the pricing. Our bill was $35 for two flights and a 10oz beer.  But this is Ballantyne so you're probably paying for the location.  

I don't live in Ballantyne and I don't get down in this area to drink much so I can't say I'll be back here often, especially since I find their environment quite sterile for a craft beer bar."}
