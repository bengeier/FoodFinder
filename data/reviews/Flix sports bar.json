{"text":"Came back to give it a second chance.  The same person who took my order, gave me a bill for $94 and tried to tell me it was correct.  Finally got it resolved, but how ridiculous can you be to forget who I am what what I ordered within an hour's time?!  Avoid if you want to have a good time."}
{"text":"Service at bar is absolutely terrible. I say this as a bartender! Standing around on their phones while I wait for a drink for over 5 minutes. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I could spend an entire day inside this place.  Not kidding.  I have no idea why I never heard about this giant entertainment complex before.  I knew  that the Phoenix movie theater was located here (18 screens) but I did not know about the sports bar, the giant indoor trampoline, the wall climbing, pool tables, air hockey table, dart games, pinball machines, private party rooms and much more.
It's a great place to catch a game, plenty of space upstairs at the Flix sports bar.  
Food, however could be better as far as  selections and quality.  Basic bar menu that fits the need at the time. Drink and food prices were higher than expected for the location.         
 
All in all it is a great place for families and friends to meet and have some fun!"}
{"text":"Terrible bar service!!   Here right now - stood at bar for 17 mins with 4 female bartenders/servers - they waited on several customers and never bothered to ask for my order.    Clearly they don't like tips!"}
