{"text":"i regretted my decision to eat here after a few bites. the food at brisket was just okay - i got the poutine sampler (4 different types including with brisket and pulled pork), but the cheese was barely melted and the gravy was completely over salted. the only saving grace was the brisket which was well prepared."}
{"text":"Tourist trap.  Menu is extremely simple, which would be fine if the food was done well.  Unfortunately the sandwiches are meh.  Rye bread is generic, smoked meat is dry and too lean.  Based on the appearance, doesn't even look like freshly sliced meat... Where is the love?!

Poutine was another let down.  Their classic 'Québécoise' poutine on the menu was served with generic and flavourless brown sauce, a bland and soulless puddle of disappointment...

Beer menu is St Ambroise on tap, nothing interesting.  No love there as well alas.

Prices are a bit high, but not surprising for Old Montreal.  

Not worth visiting IMO, plenty of better options within 20 mins walk."}
{"text":"Great presentation fast service and amazing sites around the restaurant. It is definitely up there with the other montreal big boys of smoked meat."}
