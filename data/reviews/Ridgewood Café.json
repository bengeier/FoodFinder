{"text":"What a delightful surpise! We live on Ridgewood avenue and my wife kept bugging me to go have a look at this place. It took us 1 year to give the Ridgewood café a try, but this might be our best surprise as far as bistro/restaurants go. We had a solo burger with a poutine both were delicious. The sauce in the burger is something I had not tasted before and I really like it. The poutine was just equally good. Our sever was very friendly and helpful. We went with our 13 month old and he went out of his way to help and accommodate: removing tables,  moving chairs, bringing a straw and water for her, etc. without us asking.

We went on a Monday, there were specials on both the burger and the poutine. $5/burger and $5/poutine. This is great value for the money and you would certainly pay more anywhere else. Make sure to ask for coupons.

As a downside I'd say the location is convenjent for us since it's close, but the patio gives on Côte-des-Neiges... lots of noise and pollution. Not horrible, but not great. Everything is very small too, not a whole lot of space between tables. Feels a little crowded.

Next step for us is to try their delivery service. It's the only place around that delivers burger. A welcome change from chicken and pizza..."}
{"text":"Super bon resto très mignon ! 

I live in the area and just tried this place for a first time and it is my FAVORITE cafe in the area. The Louisiana Burger and the poutine are TO DIE FOR! The staff is very friendly and are passionate about their food. A must try when in the Cote des Neiges area. So happy we have this resto around the corner :)"}
{"text":"Sweet place with good coffee and inexpensive breakfasts. I went some time in the middle of December and got two eggs, one piece of bread, one sausage and some fruit for 3.45$ (including taxes) Another plus is that it's conveniently located right next to many apartment complexes and it's really great just being able to walk to your local café."}
{"text":"Bien situé mais deux chocolat chaud nesquik à 8$ c'est unpeu trop cher pour que je revienne."}
{"text":"Bien situé lorsqu'on habite le quartier, cependant le service a été médiocre, je m'explique : trop long pour se faire servir un café avant de commander à déjeuner, très très long avant d'avoir son assiette. N'attendez pas de recevoir la facture, vous ne la recevrez jamais, vaut mieux vous rendre à la caisse pour payer. La qualité des aliments étaient au rendez-vous deux des trois fois où j'y suis allé."}
{"text":"Great small café, albeit with plenty of seating. Had a great breakfast/brunch: very good chicken omelette and great eggs benedict platter."}
{"text":"We stayed in Montreal just around the corner from this place so we tried it out of convenience. Good food, reasonably priced, very cozy and quaint decor. The quiche Lorraine and the soup of the day were both delicious - we would definitely go back if we return to Montreal! Very good value."}
{"text":"Chanced upon this gem of a restaurant and I'm so glad I did. The service from all the staff was amazing. The owner, Yves, is a really nice and warm person. Believe him when he says they serve the best lemonade in Montreal -- I was a skeptic who was quickly won over. I also had the salmon pasta (with white wine and shallots), which was delightfully light and tasty. If I'm ever in Montreal again I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Un petit joyau caché entre ridgewood et côte des neiges, excellents brunch, bons lunchs, des viennoiseries et une très belle décoration. Vraiment content d avoir trouvé un endroit comme ça à côté de chez moi!"}
