{"text":"M and my husband have been here multiple times because of my allergies .
Every time I come for dinner we are always welcomed by the friendly faces that work there . The food is just amazing I'm never disappointed. The Mac and cheese sings to my soul . It's my favourite dish. I also take my friends who don't have an allergy there . They all rave about the Mac and cheese . I just really enjoy going into a restaurant where I can relax and know that I'm not going to get sick and my allergy Is no problem here . Also try the cakes!"}
{"text":"Lunch with our niece, Nicole, for her birthday. We had arepas (corn meal pita) filled with chicken guacamole (Nicole) & smoked salmon (Robin). Claire had a rice cannelloni filled with chicken prosciutto & beef. 3 item chocolate dessert for Nicole & Robin & blackberry creme brûlée for Claire. Everything gluten free & totally yummy. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"For any of us who are celiac, this is an amazing find.  I am also a vegetarian and this suited both.  Anyone who cooks GF and vegetarian knows that meals take time, and fresh is key to great taste.  The food was custom made and absolutely delicious.  If you want a great GF experience I highly recommend, but don't expect \"instant\" food, expect exceptional flavors and quality.  Finally."}
{"text":"The BEST food! It is also 100% Gluten free which is perfect for me!  Portion size is great and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Heaven........ is just fantastic!!!!!!

I would like to say that the food is just AMAZING!!!!, Pulled Pork Arepa is really Heaven!!!!!.......Lasana, Waffles OMG!!!!!!!, Kale mojito YUMI!!!!!!, carrot soup wowww!!! my favourites.
I'm really thankful to the owner, and  her the family  (do you know that any of them  is celiac, or dairy free or vegan??)  they just open this restaurant to help other people and give them  some delicious options with flavour!!!!.
I know the service  is probably not the best , the orders take some time,  yes!!......is a family business , its been open only 6 months...... i have my own business and i know and understand how difficult is to get there, and their doing their best !!! good job !!!

I can tell some people had just a bad experience in there, but common guys..........everywhere you go you have to wait too!!! and the service in other places suck!!! here,  the owner is friendly and talk to you and  she  is also  willing to teach you how to prepare some food, stay longer in her place and offer you dessert and more food...........Nobody is perfect!!!! and everybody deserves always a second chance!!!

My experience was fantastic!!!!!

Thank you for open a restaurant 100 %  Gluten Free!!!!! All the best !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was alright and concept was interesting. Wouldn't go back though."}
{"text":"We lucked out going on a Saturday night during Calgary Stampede. It wasn't as busy as usual and service was really good. Food tasted wholesome and homemade. The best part of the experience was not having to worry if the food was safe to eat; if it was going to make me ill for days to come. It's all gluten-free, which is awesome for those with a gluten allergy! Everything on the menu is safe and we got a taste of Venezuelan food! Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Came here for poutine week. Really good. Will come again. Quaint little place. Friendly atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Speaking as a Venezuelan born and raised, this place is absolutely fantastic. We ordered the empanadas which are delicious and done to perfection. And then the Arepa de Pabellon, I can honestly say it's one of the best arepas I've eaten. This is after 37 yesrs of eating them! The only thing missing was the Polar beer (not because it's great but just because it's Venezuelan beer). Patricia (the owner) is super sweet and will recommend the best dishes. I will definitely return when back in Calgary. I wish continued success for this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! Will return again - Had Chicken and avocado or pretty girl Arepas, Godly :) Very nice Staff as well!"}
{"text":"Exquisite presentation, delicious flavors, and gluten free. I thought gluten fee would be boring, but the caramelized pears, and the shrimp and avocado, and Venezuelan  dishes were amazing. Service was exceptional."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews but I was shocked at my dinner from night and I want to share with everyone with my experience with this restaurant. 
 

I really wanted to like this place as this is the only all gluten free restaurant but after last nights disappointed dinner, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anybody. Not even with a voucher!

First off, I tried calling the restaurant around 5pm to 6pm to order take out. For the entire hour I called at least 7 times and it was busy all 7times. I believe the restaurant pulled the cord on the phone because they were really busy.  

We could not find a menu online except for pictures taken on urbanspoon, which is BTW is outdated and the prices increased for some dishes. 

So my boyfriend and I went to restaurant to order take out. The restaurant is clean cute. The lady, which I believe is the owner was very nice but also looked stressed out.  She took our order and told us several dishes are out of order because they have been really busy and have not been able to restock. Which is ok - we ordered - and she told us to come back in 20minutes to 25minutes to pick up the food.  We  went back there in 30 minutes and our food was not ready. There was only one cook at the back and the lady who is also the host and the only server. Two people running a restaurant on a Saturday night... doesn't work.
 
Long story short, our food took more than an hour and we only ordered 2 dishes, the Paella  ($35) and the Eggplant Parmesan ($15). The lady did apologize though.

When we got home and opened the box,... we were SHOCKED at the dishes. The Paella looked like a fast food Chinese take out and the eggplant parm looked like it came out from a frozen dinner box. You can refer to my picture. DEFINITELY not worth $35 for a plate of rice, 5 mussels WHICH BTW were inedible and not cleaned. WE found one mussel which looked like there was grass or something coming out of the shell. The eggplant parm was overly salty and nothing special. 

Conclusion: We paid a total of $35 (we had a $20 for $40 voucher) for the food and it was not worth it.  The wait for the food killed our dinner mood and $50 for the two mediocre dishes was a total rip off. If Heavens want to survive on 17th ave, I suggest they hire people and step up on the food."}
{"text":"Really tasty but I can't get around their prices, $15.50 for an arepa with cheese is too much because it isn't filling enough for a full meal. Would go back if it wasn't $3.00 to add cheese."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were told we needed a reservation even though there were empty tables.  They did let us eat there though.  We put enough money in the parking meter for an hour and half that wasn't enough time.  Make sure you have a least 2 hours to eat there.  It took an hour to get our drinks and appetizers. Also, they only offer brunch on Sundays.  Why not Saturday????"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out as it bills itself as completely gluten free, which meant I was free to order anything off the menu without worry.  I am aware that most gluten free foods do comes at a premium, so the prices are fairly moderate if you are cost-conscious.  Although my friend and I were walk-in customers, the place is cozy and small, so I would suggest making a reservation if possible.

My friend ordered the mac and cheese and I ordered the lasagna bolognese.  It took about 25-30 minutes for our food to arrive, so we were a little anxious as we had somewhere else to be within an hour.  If you go here, plan to allow for extra time for a more relaxing dining experience.

The food presentation is cute and elegant, however the mac and cheese dish seemed small for $12 in my opinion.  The lasagna was drenched in bechamel and cheese-- I'm not complaining here because I love cheese, but I think it would have been nice to taste some of the bolognese sauce in the dish.

I'll definitely visit again, but probably not for a little while."}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to have a group dinner here after a good friend's glowing recommendation. 

We ordered the yuca fries and assorted empanadas for the table, and a girlfriend and I shared the Pabellón Arepa which came with mechada (shredded beef), tajadas (fried plantains), avocado, black beans, rice, cheese and arepa. If that sounded like a lot of food, it was! I'd never had Venezuelan food before and I'm so glad my first experience was here. Everything was so flavorful and fresh! 

I have a few friends who live a gluten-free lifestyle and I thought it would be really limiting, but seeing how much variety is available I was really surprised.

The biggest surprise was dessert - a flourless and dairy free chocolate cake. I must admit, I was skeptical on how good a bean based cake would taste but OMG! So rich and moist, almost Heaven-ly :)

I can't wait to venture back, I would order everything we had again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Great job really good pricing and great gluten free menu....gluten free should only be eaten in a place like this 100% great Job Marco"}
{"text":"Don't need to be GF to enjoy the food here! 

The food- I am amazed at what turned out from this small restaurant. Everything exceeded our expectations. We ordered the poutine as an appie- yuca fries were light and crispy, generous cheese curds, and a vegetable based \"gravy\" with a bit of a kick. I like the yuca fries better than potato fries. One of my favourite dishes of the night and one of my favourite poutine so far of the places we visited for poutine week.

Our first main course was an arepa- the corn based house made bun was light but hearty, it  complimented the beef, avocado, cheese and plantain filling well. Only wish was a bit more plantain to give it some sweetness to balance out the savoury filling.

Second main was the Patacones- fried plantain with avocado and shrimp. Beautiful and colour presentation. Shrimp was huge and fresh tasting. The plantain base was a little salty, however on the whole the dish was a feast for the eyes and stomach.

Awesome family run restaurant with attentive servers/owners. We would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We started off with their sampler platter. Great Venezuela choices and the sauces/dips that came with it were interesting. Amazing flavours. Watch the little one it takes a few seconds for the hotness to kick in, but loved it. I had the bean burger and my friend the pulled pork sandwich. I enjoyed the \"bun\", not your typical. The sides healthy. We were pleasantly surprised how yummy gluten free is. Service was friendly with no long delays. We loved our dinner and definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Would recommend this place. Food was good, especially for gluten free lol. Here on a Friday evening and there was one other table on the restaurant (likely due to the weather). Cute small place with a diner feel. We shared the empanadas (we chose beef, chicken and fish) and those were the best part of the meal. They came with two delicious sauces for dipping. Yuca poutine was not bad, could have used something else in it to pump up the flavour... maybe some meat haha! The owner recommended the beef arepa (pabellon) and it had solid flavour, came with fried plantains, avocados, beans, and cheese and small side of coleslaw. Red sangria special was pretty good to top it up. Service was a bit awkward with a new waitress in training but I will ignore that in this rating... Would try again and maybe have the tacos next time! Don't need to be gluten free to enjoy the food here :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! The Arepas are always delicious, the fish tacos to die for and the Paella is Out Of This World!
Great staff, Patricia has put together a team that seem to have a permanent genuine smile. 
And the prices are very affordable for a fully gluten free kitchen. 
My absolute favourite restaurant in Calgary. Truly lives up to it's name - Heaven!"}
{"text":"Nice setting, super friendly staff, fair prices.....yummi food. Had the platter with empanadas, plantains, yucca and assorted sauces. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went back here to give it another chance and the food was still great, we had the meat filled cannelloni and black bean arepa...both were very well done. 

Service was much quicker this time around as well, and I have no complaints, looks like they've found their groove.  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the quality of the food, especially considering the price. The vibe in the place was also cold. Would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food gets a four but the service gets a two.

Amazingly tasty GF creations are well worth a trip and I will be back BUT the service was absolutely awful. It shouldn't take this long to serve food or get me my bill. Pay attention to your customers, you are there for them."}
{"text":"Gluten free menu all the way through in this little shop in Calgary. Don't think I've ever enjoyed black beans as much as I did when I had it here. The arepa is wonderful. Small should be big enough for most of us out here. Their guacamole is GREAT."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, love their food! The first time I took my co-workers for lunch, about 15 people. We ordered prior to arriving. The service was great. They were well organized (for a big group ordering ahead of time, this is a deal breaker). Everyone enjoyed their food. Although most ordered the arepa rellena, their were surprised at how filling this dish is. The patron that I had was also yummy! Thanks Heaven!!"}
{"text":"YAY! A completely gluten free restaurant. I'm in love. Super cute little place on 17th ave. Pretty decor of green, white and purple and all healthy. 

Being a new place, they do have some things to work out, it was very slow, but worth the wait. They have lots of yummy smoothies, I went for the kale mojito (no booze) it was super yummy. Then I went for the granola with yogurt and fresh fruit. It was super really good and a big portion. 

Little pricey, but that is to be expected, but for good, healthy, gluten free food I don't mind. I can't wait to go back and try many more things."}
{"text":"Tasty gluten free meals, reasonably priced and the owner treats her customers like friends. Bright and tasteful decor as well."}
{"text":"I was curious about the place because it was a gluten free restaurant. We purchased a voucher for it so we decided to visit this place for lunch.

The location is good because it's on 17th.. But I think the sign for the restaurant is not very eye catching. They should rethink of their logo/sign for the restaurant. 

The inside of the restaurant is okay, it is more like a small coffee shop or fast food restaurant kind of feel rather than a real restaurant. For the prices they charge though, I think that they need to upgrade their interior somehow.

It was a big hassle trying to sit down and order because the groupons' fine prints state that you need to make a reservation in order to have your voucher honoured. I had made a reservation but the name under the reservation did not match the name on the groupon and they made a really big fuss about it before finally letting us order. We later saw another table that came in to use their groupon and I thought the owner was very rude, she kept saying that you were supposed to make a reservation before you could use the groupon.. But she said she would let the customer use the groupon this time, as if she was doing the customer a huge favour. I saw the customer roll her eyes after the owner went away.. Talk about \"great\" customer service. I think if you are going to treat people badly because they purchased a groupon, they will likely never return. If you can't handle the business from selling vouchers, then you shouldn't sell them at all.

Anyway, when they finally got around to giving us the menus, our server came and told us that basically half of the stuff on the menu was not available because they were out of ingredients.. I don't know about anyone else, but I don't think this is very professional or acceptable for a restaurant. I don't mind if they are missing one or two items on the menu.. but literally HALF? 

We ordered an appetizer, two mains and a dessert. The appetizer was a chicken tostada (I can't remember the exact name and cannot find a menu online). It was delicious, I highly recommend this, if you ever visit them.

We also ordered the mac and cheese and the pork for our mains. The mac and cheese was decent but was pretty small in size and the pork was dry.. the sauce was too sweet for me and I did not enjoy the pork overall. 

We were still feeling hungry after the meal so we ordered a dessert, it was waffles with ice cream. I thought it was pretty good, and if you are celiac and wanting some good waffles, this is probably a good place to go.

I think the bill came to a total of $60+ so I basically paid about $40+ (as my voucher was $20 for $40 worth of food) which is a really really expensive lunch if you ask me!

I think that the only big selling point of this restaurant is the gluten free factor. Seeing that I do not have any dietary restrictions, I do not feel I would return as there are lots of other places to eat on 17 avenue."}
{"text":"Had the best lunch today it was heaven no pun intended. I totally enjoyed the homemade dips and chips a long with other appies. The lady that served us was very nice and I would definitely go back to this restaurant. Being a celiac it was so nice to find somewhere to eat that I didn't have to worry about getting sick or cross contamination. It's a big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I had the appetizer plate as an entree, and my husband had the chicken and avocado arepa (sandwich). He has celiac, so we were both excited to find a place like this! The reason for my lukewarm review has nothing to do with the food, which was extremely flavorful and well priced. My complaint is with the owner, who happened to serve us. Her first faux-pas was loudly asking if my husband and I were brothers. If you're in a gay relationship, I don't need to tell you how annoying and insulting this is. After we politely said no, she continued to linger by our table. Totally unprofessional and uncalled for. We wanted to be left alone for a romantic dinner and instead had to spend several minutes reassuring this woman that the food was good, despite her foible."}
{"text":"Still working out the kinks, service was a bit slow, but it's a super cute space with AWESOME food! The smoothie bar is perfection, I had the Mocha Almond and it was fabulous. They have an extensive menu, it was difficult to decide, but I went with the Roast Beef panini and seafood soup, WOW it was delicious. A little bit more expensive than average, but that's most healthy food in Calgary. They mentioned that they will also be doing take out soon. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful owners. Gluten free heaven and taste wise you would never know. This is a must eat place."}
{"text":"Wow and WOW!!!
Best fish tacos I've ever had by a long shot!
This little restaurant is a hidden treasure and 100% gluten free; I can't believe it's taken me so long to try it out but I'll be back... probably tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Five friends had dinner on a Tuesday at 5:30pm. It was -27C so we were happy to all order hot coffee. Not as hot as I like it but it was a good medium roast . We ordered some appies and took our time. Service was great and she was helpful in recommending things to try. 

The 4 dip tray was tasty with guacamole, red pepper hummus, olive tapenade and regular hummus. Nothing memorable but good for sharing. The chips, however, were fantastic! A mixture of lightly salted plantains and corn chips.

One of us ordered the Journey- a trio of tacos which my friend thoroughly enjoyed. The rest of us ordered arepas- traditional pocket filled with meat of your choice. They have vegetarian options too. 

I had the mechada and it was a nice toasty gluten free pocket with shredded beef and lettuce with a side of diced tomatoes. It was extremely filling. I'd recommend the yucca fries to share as they were part of one of our appie plates and they were yummy. 

The meal ended with tres leches cake. I didn't try it but the table said it was fantastic!  Overall a good solid meal for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, home cooked taste, and healthy choices.  
We had the mango salad and the eggplant parmigiana.   Both were delicious and we are looking forward to going back to try other things.  The only downfall was that they were out of about 5 dishes.  It may have been due to deliveries missed during the flood as I know many other businesses experienced this on 17th ave.
Nonetheless we will be back."}
{"text":"This is the place for an \"Arepa Fix\" ... if you don't know what that is , I suggest that you go to heaven ( The restaurant ). While you are up there ... try the fried Yuca, and empanadas as well."}
{"text":"While in Calgary for a week conference, I couldn't find food options that were ok for my long list of allergies at the hotel I was staying at. I googled and found a listing to heaven artisan and did the half hour walk both ways to check it out and boy was it worth it! The food and service were phenomenal and I had no issues with my allergies. Will visit again if I'm in the Calgary area."}
{"text":"My wife and I popped in last weekend for brunch, and we had a hard time not going back the same day for dinner, we enjoyed it so much.

She had the huevos rancheros and I had the oatmeal pancakes.  It was three nice-sized pancakes, with sliced banana and strawberries and whipped cream and sprigs of mint and excuse me while I drool over the memory of that meal.

I got about halfway through the pancakes, and was starting to feel, not full, but getting towards satisfied, when the owner, who was serving at the time, told me that the kitchen had forgotten the eggs and sausage that come with the pancakes, but they were making them right away.

I had to laugh because I had been enjoying the pancakes so much that I had forgotten the description in the menu had mentioned the eggs and sausage.

I'm a big guy, and I was completely full after finishing my meal.

It's more than likely that you'll be able to find us there this Saturday, and maybe the next, and possibly the one after that...

And for a small restaurant, it feels very bright and airy.  Between the large windows at the front of the seating area, the bright colors, and the mirrors on the ceiling, it felt cozy without feeling tight or crowded.  I could totally see going there with four or five people and still feeling comfortable."}
{"text":"We went here on a Wednesday night and it was pretty much dead.  I couldn't understand why because the food here is amazing. The staff here is friendly. There was a little bit of a Lost in Translation moment but nothing too concerning.

We had the empanadas which were excellent. Nice and crispy on the outside, flavorful and moist on the inside. I tried the poutine with Yucatan fries and could hardly finish the meal. My wife tried the apreas which made me jealous because it looked so good.

We'll have to make another visit and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Great for brunch !!! They offer very good breakfast and some things that are good for lunch or brunch... My favorite thing was the passion fruit mimosas!!.. OMG!!... They were just amazing!!... I'm thinking the best mimosas in town.. Just delicious... I would like to go back there soon, only for a drink!!.. But in general the place is more like a deli... Great for breakfast and brunch!!.."}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING restaurant. The wonderful, warm vibe combined with no need to worry for someone with any type of dietary restrictions is a warm welcome. The food is flavourful and delicious. The arepas are a MUST try, I had the guacamole and black bean one and the guacamole is hands down the best I've ever tasted. Hearty portions and fresh ingredients make for one of my favourite new spots. Thanks Patricia!"}
{"text":"Spotless, fresh and filling.  Yucca hash browns are crisp deep fried cubes better than any potatoes.  The pulled pork was absolutely delicious - not spiced or BBQ-flavoured so common at other restaurants.  Arepas are the only sandwich I will seek out for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place as it is rare to find a restaurant that is completely gluten free. The food was fine but the service was absolutely awful. When we arrived at the nearly empty restaurant we informed the server that we had a TeamBuy (a gift from a friend) and it all went down hill from there. The cook/owner(?) and server became augmentative and demanded multiple copies of the valid coupon (email, paper copy, and viewing my smart phone). When they finally got around to taking our order the food took forever to arrive and when it did they only brought one serving (one sandwich for both of us, we had ordered two and an appetizer)! The whole experience was agonizing. I would suggest that the management refrain from participating in TeamBuy or Groupon promotions if you are just going to treat your customers like trash."}
