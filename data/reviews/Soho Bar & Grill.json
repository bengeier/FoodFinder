{"text":"I used to work in the building above Soho and it was my go-to lunch spot for a few years. Usually, it's great - service is good and quick. The food is also very consistent.  I've worked my way through the menu over the years, but what keeps me coming back (again and again...and again) is the Thai chicken wrap. It's easily my favourite lunch fare. I think the peanut sauce is the secret - I don't know if they sprinkle it with crack, but it's addictive. I literally crave it.   The wine list is decent, and there is usually a good crowd for after-work drinks, although I haven't ever stayed long enough to sample the \"club\" side. Overall, I would definitely recommend as a great downtown lunch option."}
{"text":"I always saw Soho and it's diverse crowd after I left from a night of sketchy Karaoke and watching my friend's play Verns. I never thought to check this place out until my training caBROne Orin told me to drop by and check this place out.  After a night of gallivanting I decided to finally drop by on a night I wasn't sure if I wanted to be out or wanted to be by myself (*cough* forever alone *cough*). So I gave Orin a call told him I'm stopping by.  The place, even for a long weekend night, was happening. I was told the place gets even more packed but the amount of people was enough for me to be ok and the crowd wasn't obnoxious and were conversationally friendly.   The drink prices are up there on avg with most clubs and lounges, but I do believe they have specials on certain nights. The music is also pretty cool. The DJ that night mixed hip hop, latin pop, and rock which was pretty cool  Underdog challenge 15/30"}
{"text":"Soho Bar & Grill is a pretty unassuming downtown restaurant, with contemporary decor and an American menu.    I go to this restaurant a few times a year with work, and have never had a bad meal here, but typically in the past, the meals also haven't been memorable.  However, yesterday I went to SOHO for a coworker's birthday, and I tried the Carne Ensalada based on her recommendation, and WOW.  That was one of the better salads I have had in awhile.  The salad was topped with Blackened Beef Tenderloin.  I couldn't tell if it was deep fried or pan fried.  All i know is that it was hot and spicy, a tiny bit crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.  The salad was mostly greens (they ran out of Avocado), but the dressing was delicious.  It was an orange honey salad dressing, which was a nice contrast with the blackened tenderloin.  The service was really good. The waitress checked in on us often, but not \"too\" often.  Every 10 minutes or so, she was checking our drinks and making sure we didn't need anything.  I keep forgetting about SOHO,but now that I have found something on the menu that is more memorable than soem of the other meals I have had (wraps, burgers, etc), I will definately be going there specifically to kill the Carne Ensalada craving.  28/30"}
{"text":"Soho stands for South Houston, a bustling and vibrant area of New York City where artists and designers hang out.  With that said Soho or the concept of Soho is trying to be brought to Calgary.  This was my first time at Soho's and I really appreciated the shorter line up.  Tonight was Salsa and Reggaeton night with DJ Chico and it brought out a really nice diverse ethnic cliental.  Tons of Latinos, and I love this because not only are they spicy... man can they dance.  The bouncers were really nice and you have to go upstairs to get to the club, I like this because there is a bar in the upper level where you can initially get drinks and it overlooks the dance floor downstairs that was really bumpin.  The groove was really on tonight and as soon as you enter, I found my body already gyrating to the sounds of Latino Hip Hop and Salsa.  I absolutely loved it.    There are ample places on the sides of the dance floor that you can just sit and hang out if your 8 inch heels are hurting your feet or you simply want to have a conversation.  The cliental at this bar seemed very nice, a couple offered their table to a group of 8 of us to sit, which was really gracious.  I would return to this bar in a flash and am so glad I discovered it last night."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  The food takes forever to come out and the staff let your glass sit empty for ages before checking up on you.  Convenient enough if you're in the area though."}
{"text":"How did I not know this place existed? Leave it to meeting my cousin downtown for lunch, our first pick being closed, our second pick being closed and the next one being far too crowded for our liking to lead us in the end to Soho.  We headed upstairs to the grill part (apparently there's a whole other section downstairs). When you walk in, it initially curves around to reveal one dining area, and then another further back. The curvy part has a few lounge tables and chairs by the windows that look like they'd make a rather comfy perch for the afternoon. We were seated at a two person table against the back wall of the first section.  I found myself sitting sideways at the table in order to comfortable cross my legs while I chatted with my cousin, a bit of a longer table could've helped. At any rate, Sarah was our server and, what can I say? No complaints there! She kept our waters refilled throughout the meal, was sure to check back with us and once she had checked that we didn't want any coffee or dessert, she was back with the bill in a reasonable amount of time.  Foodwise, I didn't really look much at the rest of the menu. See, I'm on this no grains, dairy, processed sugar, legumes or beans diet thing and the first thing that my eye fell upon was the crab and avocado salad. Granted, I have no food allergies driving this diet, so I didn't enquire as to what the crab was mixed with. Anyway, salad. Good! And just the right size, not ridiculously huge, but enough to fill me up. If you've got a larger appetite, I'd recommend getting something else instead of or as well as the salad. With a $15 price tag, its not something I'd be eating every day.  So now that I know Soho exists, I think it's time to put those lounge chairs by the window on my list of ways to wile away an afternoon!"}
{"text":"Went to Soho again today.  Ordered the Crab Cake Burger - it was quite good and it was real crab!  It was served on a kaiser bun with some mixed greens, the crab cake, a couple slices of red onion and a dollop of tartar sauce.  I decided to have soup with my delicious burger.  It was a seafood/vege pureed soup.  It was really good!  Friends ordered the Soho Burger and the Veggie Wrap - it was great for them, too!  The restaurant was quite full.  Good thing we had reservations."}
