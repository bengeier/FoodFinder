{"text":"We went here for a belated Valentine's dinner. It was fantastic. Parking was a pain, but we eventually found a spot. They seated us immediately (we had reservations) and our server was very attentive. They immediately brought out bread (delish) and water. Not long after, our wine arrived. Speaking of wine, don't be scared when you see the wine list...I didn't see any wines by the glass, only bottles, so I simply told the server what I wanted, and there it was!   I had the tagliatelle (sp?) pasta with wild mushrooms. SO good. I'm a big fan of earthy tasty yumminess, and this hit the spot. Why can't I do this at home?? Oh, and the soup... divine! The special was potato and leek soup. Perfectly smooth, must have been strained several times to get it this smooth. Very comforting. Hubby had the mac & cheese for an ap...YUM! That Vermont cheddar is just too good! He had the pork chop for his entree, and I will never be able to make pork chops at home again. Oh well! He thoroughly enjoyed it. For dessert we had the Iron Chef apples, which were perfect. We were pretty full by this point, but these three adorable little tasty apples were just the right finishing touch.  The second best part of our night (the food was first, of course) was meeting Mark Tarbell! I tried not to act like a fool, but I watched him on Iron Chef, so it was cool to meet him! He was very friendly, very down to earth, and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience. He was walking around to all the tables...great chef!   So for a nice night out, you can't beat this place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  The atmosphere is wonderful, very casual yet professional.  Nice bar.  But above all, the salmon is fabulous.  The best salmon in town.  Maple lime sauce but so delicate. MMMMMM   Nice use of local organic foods."}
{"text":"Don't come here for restaurant week, overpriced menu for the food you get. Tried all 3 main dishes and they were all bland, needed to add lots of salt. Service was excellent on the plus side."}
{"text":"We were invited to have dinner at Tarbell's by some friends who were in town for a weekend getaway. The restaurant was highly recommended to them by Geoffrey (The Concierge at the Biltmore where they were staying!).  Pre-dinner drinks at the bar (we were early) were nice with a very generous pour of Crown Royal from the bartender for me and a wonderful glass of Pinot Grigio for my wife! The atmosphere is relaxed and casual but leave your t-shirts and tennis shoes at home!   Once at our table, our waitress Wednesday was very helpful in making suggestions about food choices. The Butternut Squash Soup was excellent. Our food choices included; Scallops (excellent), Salmon (good), Chicken(Excellent) and the Fresh Mozzarella plate. In addition, Wednesday brought us over a few other dishes (on the house) for us to sample. Mac and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts. Now I love Brussels Sprouts anyway but these were to die for and while Mac/Cheese has never been one my favorites - YUM. Oh and the yellow beet salad was very pleasant departure from the typical salad.  Desserts here are for sharing and while the Crème Brûlée was OK, the Southern Bread Pudding with Bourbon Sauce was excellent!  While we were eating Mark Tarbell did wander in and he made a point to visit every table and have a quick chat with all the diners that evening. An added bonus was meeting Geoffrey (who was picking up dinner to take home) and he insisted (that even though we were eating sweet stuff now) we try one of the meatballs that Tarbell's makes for their spaghetti and meatballs dish. Wow, that was excellent! I now know what I will be ordering next time we come here for an evening out.  I wouldn't say that this is a romantic place to dine at as the noise level did increase as more people arrived but, it is a great place to come for a meal. All in all this was a really nice dinner out and we'll have to treat ourselves to another visit in the future."}
{"text":"Perfect evening at Tarbells--celebrating my niece's 22nd birthday--fantastic food, wonderful ambiance and fabulous service! And, Mark Tarbell was fantastic! so much fun...so delicious...so memorable!"}
{"text":"Exceptional flavors, attentive service, great atmosphere.  Took a group of 7 here on a weeknight for a business dinner, and everyone thought it was a treat."}
{"text":"I go to Tarbell's about once a month, and the thing that impresses me is that I always get a great meal.  The appetizers are inventive and delicious, and the entrees, are always spot on.  If you are a person that likes great food, but does not like to try new things, order items from the \"Things that do not change with the seasons\" portion of the menu.  This features great dishes always served with seasonal organic vegetables.    If you like something new and sometimes different, order from the \"Things that change with the seasons\" portion of the menu.  Here you can find fresh and new menu items (although not changed that often).    Also, if you like fresh organic vegetables, Tarbell's has an organic vegetable plate served as an entree which is outstanding and always a little different.  Also good for an appetizer for two or three people."}
{"text":"My friend highly recommended the Cheesecake with Rosemary-Caramel sauce, so tonight because I was working late, I decided on a whim to call ahead and order some to take back to the office.  Over the phone they seemed to enjoy hearing that their cheesecake came so highly recommended (I don't think they are used to getting orders for just dessert). When I showed up to pick it up, the manager walked up and greeted me himself. He told me he was very happy that I came all the way there just for the cheesecake. He then discounted my order as an \"Early Christmas Present\". I was taken aback.  The cheesecake itself was amazing. They left the sauce on the side so it didn't get messy during travel. Consequently, I was to drizzle a little bit over each bite. The combination of the creamy cheesecake and the rich sauce was perfect. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I'll definitely be eating at Tarbell's for more than just dessert in the future. And although I can't tell you much about the atmosphere or the dining experience (yet) since I ordered to go, I can tell you that the manager there was extremely nice and everyone else I interacted with over the phone and in person was also wonderful."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tarbell's for years and have never been disappointed.  They have an excellent wine list.  The food selection is diverse and uniformly excellent.  Whenever I go to Tarbell's I cannot help but remember the time I ordered an Australian Shiraz.  I think the food server got confused when he heard me remark to my companion that the Penfolds Grange was one of my all time favorite wines.  By mistake he brought the Grange, which was selling for $450 a bottle. After I told him he brought the wrong bottle, he started to walk back to the wine cellar and dropped the bottle of Grange, which shattered, spilling all that great shiraz over the restaurant's floor.  I hope he did not have to pay for his accident."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give them five stars because I really do like this restaurant. Our first visit was excellent and we decided to visit a second time. On our second visit, our server, who was very nice, was rarely at our table. I think he must have had tables on the opposite side of the restaurant as he only showed up to take orders, drop off drinks and food, and close with desserts. It took almost 10 minutes for our drinks- one Old Fashioned and a beer.   I was so looking forward to the Scotch Beef but when it came it was extremely dry with barely any sauce to be found. As our server was constantly absent, I ate what I could with water and gave up halfway through. Bummer.   Other than that- it was a decent evening. We ended dinner with the salted chocolate volcano cake which I thought was absolutely horrid but my husband loved it.   I think we will consider returning at another time- but I might give other restaurants a try until the memory of choking on dry pot roast fades. :)"}
{"text":"What an amazing culinary experience. Our server allowed us ample time to explore the menu while sampling a delicious Cabernet. To snack we enjoyed roasted chick peas in Parmesan cheese. Afterwards, we decided on the scallops and sword fish. Fresh, fresh and fresh. Also tender and buttery. Fantastic and full of so many flavors."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. I wasn't really all that impressed.   I mean, it was good, but I have heard people ranting and raving about this place for a long time so perhaps the expectations were a lot higher than they should have been.  I got the scotch beef and it was delicious for the first few bites, and then I realized it tasted like the barbacoa from Chipotle.   Service was good, but not anything outstanding."}
{"text":"First time at Tarbell's but definitely not the last. Our server, Eric said the scotch beef was like a hug on a plate and I have to say it was a fabulous hug! The gnocchi also knocked our socks off! And the peach crumble - unbelievable. Thanks to Eric and the entire team at Tarbell's for a fantastic evening."}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start on this but definitely made our first exploration of Phoenix worth the trip. The staff is great. We got seated on Valentine's day last minute. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful picking dishes and drinks. Drinks were great all around and the barkeep even wrote up his recipes for the Hive drink he makes. The food is outstanding. We had rock shrimp and candy bacon to start. Entrees were salmon and New York strip. They paired well with the Hive and Silver Oak cabernet respectively. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"Our first time at Tarbells was great! We happened upon the restaurant by luck after we were dismayed from the crowds/long wait at postino and LGO. Without reading a review,  we chose this place out of sheer hunger.   Our menu: Fish of the day - flute. A nice white fish dish,  good flavor,  just not quite enough flavor for the price.  House made ribbon pasta with sausage - delicious! Amazing flavor in the sauce,  perfect pasta,  tasty sausage.  Creme brulee - delicious!  Great portion to split between two or three. The hive (cocktail) - wonderful!  High end bourbon with rosemary and honey,  great combination.   Service: Our server was Martin - he was awesome.  Very attentive and showed up at all the right moments,  but not overbearing.    Cherry on the top - as we were leaving,  we were given little bags of popcorn!!! What!? Only because I'm a popcorn lover was this so impactful, but this little treat just tipped the experience from great to awesome!   Obviously if you're researching the restaurant you know it is on the pricey side. (Since we hungrily stumbled in,  we had no idea). But we were quite pleased with our experience and will be back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had reservations there last night.  Poor choice! Not a bad place to eat, but a terrible dining experience.   Parking was an issue. Despite our early reservations, the only parking available was in the next lot over. One had to traverse an earthen embankment and a grubby alley to get to the place. Tell your companion to wear something other than high heels!  I dislike places that serve olive oil in place of butter with one's bread. I know it's fashionable, but it gives an impression of economy. That's fine for Macaroni's Italian Grill, but detracts from the tone of a place with Tarbell's pretensions. I'd prefer it if they'd serve both, or at least give one a choice.   The soup of the day, potato and leek, was of delicate flavor but redolent of Potato Buds. Could it be possible that they're making this stuff out of a dehydrated product? The Caesar salad starter was a nonentity, and might have been improved by a little ground pepper, which wasn't offered.   My bride was mightily impressed by the grilled salmon....some of the best she'd ever had, she said. The effect was somewhat dissipated by the peculiar potato product offered as a side. If you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edges of a pan just used to bake scalloped potatoes au gratin, you'll like this stuff.   I had the pork chop, which was very good without being memorable. It's served with a side of what they claim to be 'wild boar bacon' and unidentified greens. The pork, independently, was bland and without much character; but spear a bit of pork, add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon, and then a green or two, and the dish is much improved.   Dessert was uninteresting. The sorbet was of the store bought variety....and not top shelf stuff, either....and the apple tart was bland and as dry as if it been left in the oven overlong.   The ambiance of the place leaves a lot to be desired for a celebratory experience. It might work for a business meeting, but it ain't no place I'd care to take a date, ever again. The dining room is crowded and noisy, making conversation difficult and at times impossible. The tables are too close together and I had to endure a face full of server's butt whenever he waited on, or cleared the dishes of, the folks at the table neighboring ours.   I suppose I've saved the best....or the worst....for last. I haven't been as rushed by the waitstaff at a meal since my experience in an Army mess hall at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. The place is being run as a money making machine and that means that they are trying to turn over tables as many times as possible in an evening. Services is overly rapid and one feels pressured to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next course on the table. The object, of course, is to get you fed and out the door, freeing up a table for another party. My wife resorted to the tactic of picking up her fork when she saw the bus-guy approaching....otherwise he'd be on us to clear the plates containing food over which we were tarrying, in his opinion, overlong.  The check was presented to us the moment it was ascertained that we had completed dessert but before the plates had been cleared. I returned it asking that she bring it on AFTER we'd finished our coffee. Which, by the way, hadn't been offered, either.   To his credit, the dining room manager did come over to apologize for rushing us, and comp'ed our coffee. He explained that \"the standard in America is to present the bill when dessert had been finished\". I beg your pardon? Not in any place I've ever dined, and I was born in Ohio.  This place seems popular enough on a Saturday night, but I certainly won't be gracing its dining room any time soon. At this price point ($175 including wine and tip for the two of us) I expect more than what was offered.   Sorry, folks, I know this sounds like a rant, and to some extent it is. It was an important evening for us....after all, twenty years only comes once in a marriage (well, most marriages, anyway)... and we had hoped for a gentler experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful . . . but pricey Had heard wonderful things about Tarbell's and went for dinner on a Saturday night.  Light, contemporary vibe.  Plenty of room at the bar and superb service throughout the evening.  The bartender suggested a cucumber collins (made mine with Vodka) and it was perfect--light, refreshing and interesting.  For dinner, I started with the mozzarella salad (my weakness), which was absolutely perfect.  My date had the beet salad and was equally impressed.  For the main course, I went with the chicken sausage pasta.  I really, really liked it, but would try something else next time.  My date had the scotch beef, which is really a high end version of pot roast.  That's what I'll have next time.  We shared a bread pudding for dessert, the portion was huge so plenty to share.   Would like to have dinner at the bar sometime, maybe just share a few apps instead of big entrees.  No complaints and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I don't know, I feel like throwing 5 stars on something is sorta silly, I mean what is perfection, hmmmm just kidding this place is perfect, if you love food (and ain't that what its all about) then tarbells is the cats meow for you. Its a tad pricey but your taste buds will be thanking you for days to come. Mark really cares about his product and pushes his dishes to new levels. Try the cheese cake with the rosemary caramel sauce, its not of this earth and it will ruin any other dessert exp you'll ever have.  If you take a date there and don't get laid then you officially have no game and need to find cheaper places to go sucker."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never reviewed Tarbells! This is one of my favorites as the food/service is consistently awesome. Jillian (not sure if she works there anymore) is the best server! This establishment has it goin on!"}
{"text":"Tarbell's is amazing. I've been here several times over the years and have never been disappointed. The rock shrimp with salsa appetizer is delicious.  I also like the steaks, but you can't really go wrong with anything from here.  If you're looking for a great restaurant to eat at, this is it."}
{"text":"A chef that can do great things with brussels sprouts always get major points with me, second only to one that can make creamy soups not laden with cream. Mark Tarbell does both exceptionally.   On our last visit, I broke tradition of ordering the special of the night and opted for the chicken. Yes, big deal one thinks ... think again. There is something magical in that bird, a perfect balance of salt and crispiness. When available, I go ga-ga for the lamb with brussels sprouts and french lentils. Another must is the duck confit appetizer. Heaven.   I typically don't bother with the pizza -- it is good, but not really an attraction. The by-the-glass list has several good selections, including a very well priced sparkling. The waitstaff is efficient, professional and friendly, something of a rarity even among many \"upper echelon\" establishments in the Valley. Yes, parking can be a bitch at that plaza, and yes, parts of the menu are a tad bit weather worn ... but sometimes there is nothing wrong with a little comfort food."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The Chicken sausage pasta definitely works!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this restaurant has become so popular.  Regrettablly, I have to eat there a few times a year as my boyfriend's father likes this place because of their round table in a semi-private room.   Last night was hopefully the last time I will eat there until the Holiday season.  I ordered the Fire-roasted Seafood Chowder.  It was bland and lukewarm.  It tasted like someone opened a can of ro-tel tomatoes and added chuncks of overcooked Salmon.  A chef should be ashamed to serve such a dish.  If it would have been just my boyfriend and myself dining - I would have sent it back without hesitation.  Did I mention that this \"chowder\" was $18 - ridiculous.  I gave it two stars because the server was nice - but the food alone is one star."}
{"text":"Excellent service, even better food. The seafood risotto is to die for, and my husband loved his pasta and sausage dish. It's a VERY expensive place to eat, but hey let's face it, you get what you pay for and here, you're paying for perfection."}
{"text":"First of all, we are regulars who love this place. Excellent wine list with servers who are knowledgable about all of the wines. Fantastic service and great food! Lives up to the hype every time we go!   Keep up the good work Mark!!!  Doug and Noelle"}
{"text":"I've been hearing the buzz about Tarbell's for the past six years. I finally tried it out. It was restaurant week - fixed menu. The soup course was borscht, followed by Cornish game hen with root veggies and for desert a lemon tart with raspberry sorbet.   Alright, I have to vent...I come from a family of skilled borscht chiefs!!! ;) While the dish Tarbell's called borscht was pretty good it was by no means borscht. Does that make sense? Well, if you're Ukrainian, Russian, Polish or some sort of Slavic it will. The Cornish game hen was really delicious, seemed like the perfect meal for a cool fall day. Crap, this is Phoenix and it doesn't cool off until December!! Sorry, got a little carried away with my fantasy. Back to the meal - the desert was amazing! Lemony goodness + a flavorful scoop of raspberry sorbet = happiness!!!  All in all Tarbell's scores 4 stars by me but don't take my word for it just eat it."}
{"text":"Mark Tarbell and his team orchestrated an amazing winemaker dinner featuring the wines of Maison Joseph Drouhin, hosted by Laurent Drouhin. The wines were paired perfectly with creative cuisine artfully plated, thus enhancing the experience of both the food and the elegant wines.   Each course was served with precision and impeccable timing.  Each wine pored into correct stemware, highly polished.  No detail was overlooked. Tarbell's recently celebrated their twentieth anniversary.  Dinners like we experienced last night bode well for many more wonderful years of exquisite dining at Tarbell's.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have been to Tarbell's numerous times and it is always an excellent dining experience. Most recently we went for dinner on Valentines Day, 2012.  We were promptly seated then water and bread with EVOO were served moments after we arrived. Our server was very informative, extremely pleasant and non-intrusive. Chef Tarbell came by our table and chatted for a few minutes then each course came out as the previous plate was lifted.   The food is always fresh and delicious. My wife had the beet salad and I started with the potato and celery soup.  We both chose the fish of the day which was red snapper flown in from Maine. The bean medley that accompanied the fish was just as good as the entree itself.  Chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream polished of a wonderful Valentine's dining experience.  Bravo Chef Tarbell  PS We love this place so much because it is a place for foodies that is not pretentious. It is a business casual affair and the decor and layout are very appealing.  The windows always catch our attention because they remain impecibally clean.  You'll SEE what I mean."}
{"text":"Tarbells reminds me of some highly-rated restaurants that i visited when I lived near Malibu that were highly rated. They were ok, but not worthy of their rating. Their location near the ' disposable income ' Capital of the Western World-gave them better ratings than they actually deserved. Tarbells has some good, solid food, but there are dozen better restaurants within a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"Off the charts good.  I had Tarbell's Bolognese Pasta.  Here is the description on their menu: organic tomatoes, four days of love.  I couldn't say it any better- the best pasta dish I've ever had!  My other 3 guests were raving about their meals as well.  I'm sorry, we ate there 4 weeks ago and I can't remember what they had....just go!"}
{"text":"Got a steak which was over cooked with the demi being too cold so it was stick, gummy. Got the \"poutine\" fries which were not poutine at all. The demi again was too cold so it was sticky and the fries were thin cut and frozen. If you're going to put a special item on the menu at least use hand cut fries."}
{"text":"First of all, i dont mind spending a little more for good food, but this place is a rip, way to expensive, and the portions rhey give you are pathetic to say the least, the desert i had tasted like they microwaved it, the taste of the food can use some spices or salt,the iced tea was the worst! It tasted like water, will never go there again"}
{"text":"Let me just say it really takes an experience to move me to write a review for a business.  Tarbell's was so incredible on so many levels. Not only was the food incredible but the service was outstanding as well.  My husband and I had never been here and were just wanting to try it out.  We ordered wine ( which was divine) the mac and cheese and salmon dish to share, and the kale salad.  We simply asked our server questions about the mixed vegetable dish , we decided to pass since the salmon was coming out on a bed of greens.  Much to our surprise she showed up with a complimentary plate of mixed veggies to try since it was our first time there .... and no surprise at this point but the vegetables were incredible as well.  Now usually I skip dessert (spare myself the added calories) but after learning that the owner studied culinary in Paris , i was inclined to try the \"wife salted popcorn creme brûlée \" .  My husband and I just got back from our first trip to Paris and I have been searching for ANYTHING that even comes close to authentic french creme brûlée ..... and THIS WAS IT !!!!!  Out of this world !! Worth every calorie lol !  Not to mention when looking at the dessert menu my husband was asking how the bread pudding compared to the brûlée.... and low and behold they brought some complimentary bread pudding for us .... which was also mouth watering .  We most definetley will be back and often.  This is one of our new favorites !!! If you are on the fence about trying this place out ... please do! You won't be disappointed in the least !!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is always top-notch, the ingredients are fresh and there's always a nice ambiance in the place.  Come for the food, stay for the wine list and return to have a drink with the professional cougar who gave you her number at the bar.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and service."}
{"text":"Marks moms Mac & cheese must have! The scotch beef is my fav entree. Great comfort food!"}
{"text":"So I had the pepper steak. The meal consisted of, crusted cracked pepper corn hand cut new york steak, pan creamed spinach with augratin potatos. The steak was prepared over done closer to medium well rather than medium, was rather tough but had good flavor. The spinach was actually sauteed no cream used. The potatoes were perfect. Service was good but not great, the server was unable to answer questions about the wine selections but did offer a suggestion from a winery a friend of his runs in Oregon. The Fox Family Farms red wine was a good compliment to the meal. The mojito I had as well was tasty and potent."}
{"text":"Our meal was really wonderful but the service put this over the top for me. I was curious about the scotch beef and asked the server his thoughts. He encouraged me to try it and said if I didn't enjoy it they would be happy to make me something else. A few minutes later he brought over a plate of sliders made with the beef so we could sample it. It was delicious!  I ordered that as my entree and was very in love with it. My husband had the Scottish Salmon and asked to pair it with asparagus risotto and the were happy to accommodate. After our food was gone they brought us an amazing serving of cheesecake with rosemary Carmel sauce because he heard us mention it was our anniversary. The buttermilk mashed potatoes are to die for. We had a wonderful night out thank and greatly appreciated the thoughtfulness of our server."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and the food was on point; the food was on the safe side for the price though. The overwhelming hospitality is what made the experience for me tonight. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My kids took me to Tarbells for my birthday.     It was not my first time...in fact I am a regular.     One might assume menu fatigue or something like that.    One would be wrong.  Each dish we tried was phenomenal.   Fish of the day...lobster basil risotto...scotch beef.        I think Tarbells is better than ever under Chef Steven's culinary leadership.     The service is friendly and competent.      Every experience there is wonderful.  Tarbell's is my favorite restaurant.     It should be yours."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about Tarbell's. I've eaten here more than a dozen times and have never been disappointed. I met the owner Mark Tarbell, which made me fall in love with this place even more. They use as much local organic produce as as they possibly can and rather than throwing away all the used vegetable oil, they re-use it for the owner's car which has been converted to run on veggie oil rather than gasoline. Fantastic for our local economy and the environment.   The service is fantastic, food is orgasmic, very lovely atmosphere, great wine list. I've ordered so many items off the menu that going into luscious details on any one and not the other would be an injustice. Every time I eat here I catch myself saying \"this is the best ______ I've ever had\"."}
{"text":"Be still my beating heart!  When I moved here almost four years ago...I was looking for a restaurant to host a very special occasion for 7 guests.  I went around and checked out several highly recommended establishments and Tarbell's was my last stop of the day.  It was actually closed on the day that I arrived to check it out so I just looked through the windows into the restaurant and when I saw their semi-private partial glass enclosed dining room, I knew this was the place.  On the day of the event, we had two vegetarians in our party and that was not a problem at all (I think their food was actually the best).  Instead of getting an entree, my son ordered three sides and he was completely happy w/his meal.  I recall having the raspberry mojitos and chocolate martini and both were sensational.  Dessert was also top notched and to make the experience even sweeter, Mark Tarbell came by to congratulate us and thanked us for choosing his restaurant to host our special event.  From beginning to end, our meals felt like it was taking us on a culinary adventure.  Service was also excellent and everyone in the party agreed that we'd come to a very special place indeed.  I've been back to Tarbell's on a couple more occasions since then (always w/guests in tow) and the experience has always been the same...everyone leaves completely happy.  This is a very memorable place and I would come here more frequently if it wasn't so far from my house."}
{"text":"I have to say that overall I was disappointed with my first visit to Tarbell's. When we made our reservation we made sure to let them know it was our anniversary and to please accommodate us with an out of the way table. When we arrived we were informed that they were running late and it would be 20 minutes until they could seat us. We sat at the bar and the bar staff was great. They were super busy but we got quick service and good cocktails. After about 20 minutes the hostess came to seat us but they didn't have any tables in the dinner room and she sat us in the bar and right next to the door.   It was super packed and loud, which would have been fine for hanging out at happy hour but not so much for what was supposed to be a romantic anniversary dinner.  We ordered muscles and oddly some tasted very minerally and others very creamy and mushy.  There was nothing wrong with the scallops but also nothing very memorable. We also had the Bolognese which sounded like it was going to be amazing but the spice they put in it really drowns out the other flavors. The pasta with it was cooked perfectly.   The support staff was great. Every person who delivered food to us was able to knowledgeably answer questions about the dishes and wine pairings  I might consider coming back here for a drink at the bar but I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good....it has to be one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. The pizza has a flavorful thin crust and is perfect. There is no reason to not always order the giant meatball on the side. I've been going here for years and am constantly impressed. Everything they do is perfect."}
{"text":"Every item our table of four ordered was an exceptional taste treat, our waiter was very helpful and accommodating as well. Freshly inventive cuisine at it's best, a great experience and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Heard excellent things about this place. We were seated against the back wall of tables. Could not sit on the bench seating because of wood beam under the cushion. Moved over a table a same issue. Then realized it's because of how crammed in the tables are that if you slide over the slightest amount you might as well join your neighbors table. The dining room is excessively cramped, and LOUD. I hate hearing every detail of the neighbors table! Zero privacy whatsoever. Otherwise, the ambiance is nice enough. The bar area is nice. The food was good, but I'm really getting tired of seeing restaurants serve such oversized portions. It's offensive. And and a waste of food. Just stop it! I'll come back another time and give this place a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  The Olive oil they used was really flavorfull.  Felt the prices were higher than the quality and quantity of food given or would have gave a 5."}
{"text":"I'm sure this is a great place however my first experience was unfortunately not that good. I can tell that this place is better than 2 stars however our food took 1:45min. By the time we received our food, we had to ask for it in to go containers as we were already late for a 7pm appt. elsewhere. When we arrived we mentioned we were in a hurry however there was a mis-understanding therefore why our food was delayed. I will try Tarbell's again in hopes it will live up to the referral ratings I received from those who suggested Tarbell's"}
{"text":"A restaurant for special occasions. Mark Tarbell came by our table and asked how our meal was and we told him the truth - it was fantastic. Marvelous melt-in-your-mouth Scotch beef in a savory red wine reduction and grilled wild salmon were our choices and they were wonderful, preceded by superb crispy calamari. Great bread putting and homemade cheesecake topped the meal off nicely. Not cheap but well worth it."}
{"text":"I have been a fan for years! The last 5 times I  am sad to say have been terrible?the drinks R over sweet. Tho Nicole is a master ! The soups R heavy and sour! The tuna tartar is fishy and soy sauced,,, there is a sad downward fall here?"}
{"text":"Rather disappointed, I was fooled by the reviews. Ambience is good but food fell way short of the expectation. Ordered medium fillet but got it well done and very dry. I would say this place is way overrated and mediocre at best, with high end prices."}
{"text":"One word- AMAZING!  Everything from the drink to the desert was great.  The veggie dish they says is made with love- they are not kidding! Best veggie dish I have ever eaten. Everything that my friends had was great too. Except for the meatball which they said they did not like very much.   But hey- that's why i stick to veggies!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, no longer my favorite. Seriously, they could not have gotten us out of there any faster: we sat and were handed a drink menu then within 5 seconds, approached for a drink order-wow, let me look... no martinis? So I had water :( for Valentine's Day (boo). Next,  The waitress was nice but not friendly... when she was facing us, she spoke kindly but fled before we finished speaking.... Boo. I ordered Scotch Beef Sliders without horseradish and crispy fries and you know,  they came with horseradish:(. Very difficult to get the waitress' attention because she was asking for feedback before I took my first bite (again feeling rushed) and I said the fries were good. I got her attention and told her there was horseradish on them, she grabbed the plate and was gone before I could say that I wanted them to go so that I could save room for dessert. I finally flagged down the busser who told her for me. She came to the table to let me know they are ready but I explained that I will be too full for dessert and I want dessert - she stepped away and several minutes later, brought the bag of food and apologized and scurried away. I really wanted the coconut cream pie I saw on the menu earlier so I waited and waited, watching her flit from here to there and finally caught her attention to get a dessert menu. To my dismay, no coconut cream pie. When she came back I explained that I had my heart set on coconut cream pie that I must have read on the Tavern's menu. She said ok, scooped up the menus, walked away. She completed our billing and transaction very briskly and we were on our way. They did comp the to-go sliders which was nice but that wasn't the problem-it was the experience. My husband had a great meal by himself. When the waitress did come to our table, she was unsure of the menu and unfriendly. She asked me if the horseradish was mixed in with the beef and I said, no, it's on the bun. And she spoke nicely and in a sweet voice but it seemed like she couldn't get away any faster - mid sentence. Anyway, if we go again, it will be to-go"}
{"text":"As a foodie, traveling through Phoenix, I was excited to be able to dine at Tarbells. Sadly, my experience did not live up to the billing. As a solo diner, it was obvious I was pegged as a \"turn and burn\". I was quickly served  a tasty olive oil and bread for dipping, however the bread tasted very much like frozen par  baked bread, that had been reheated. I would have expected something a little more refined in such a restaurant. The server, who when I asked about the menu, what she liked, did not tell me about the specials I heard her recite at other tables around me. I ordered the carpaccio which came out in less than 3 minutes. Obviously plated ahead and kept in the fridge with which I have no problem per se, but the chilled meat subtle taste was masked by the very cold what was beautifully marbled beef. Add to that, the overpowering amount of vinaigrette dressing on what looked like pretty arugula and the carpaccio was almost indiscernible.  On the server's recommendation I ordered housemade ribbon noodles with homemade chicken fennel sausage, tomato, spinach in a rich buttery broth for my entree. What arrived was a very full bowl of broth that was very very rich with butter and for the first three spoonfuls was luxurious, but way too rich to be able to enjoy it in the quantity served. The fresh noodles that I had to search through the broth were stuck together in one mass under a small pile of canned tomatoes, the accompanying spinach also lost somewhere in the broth. The sausage looked like a breakfast pattie that had been browned on one side and then broken into pieces. Not what I was expecting. The fennel seed was so overpowering I could not eat it all. Because of the reputation and rave on line reviews I will tell myself, maybe I made lesser menu selections and will, when I am in Phoenix later in the year go back and try again. Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"We've been before.  Last visit on 12/17 a disappointment.  A meager portion of over cooked calamari.   The shishito peppers didn't have the expected char and if they used any seasoning you wouldn't know it.  First two selections from wine list list were out of stock.  Maybe it is Scottsdale but a shockingly small selection of wine under $100 and most from the Cabernets were not well known.   Pardon me but a wedge salad is a wedge of iceberg not other lettuce  piled  up which this was. The candied bacon was so hard as to be inedible.    There two paper thin slices of tomato.  All in all not just overpriced but a poor value with mediocre food at best"}
{"text":"Everything that I have ever ordered (or eaten off of my partner's plate) has been superb.  We usually can't resist getting appetizers and dessert along with our meal because everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Tarbell's has a great chef, good food, and irresistible desserts.  The decor is very modern, with a big splashy painting on the wall I was looking at.  I had a terrific bib lettuce salad, followed by... can't remember what it was called (tarbell cut?), but  it was very much like pot roast.  Delicious and fork tender.  They had other very good cuts of beef, as well a fresh seafood.  For dessert, the four of us split an order of profiteroles and an order of their chocolate mousse.  Yummy.  The atmosphere was fairly quiet.  The only thing that surprised me was the price of a glass of Irish whiskey - we did not ask, but at $18, was the most expensive glass of Bushmill's we have had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"We had our anniversary dinner at Tarbell.  The service and food was wonderful. I plan to return with my family very soon."}
{"text":"My go-to restaraunt for celebrations, taking guests or just a beautiful night out with my hubby. I love this place, the food is wonderful, cozy atmosphere & Mark always gives his personal touch by stopping by tables, sending a little something extra to those of us who frequent this place.  It has that comfortable, neighborhood vibe, and a menu ranging from comfort foods like spaghetti & meatballs to steak and seafoods, that makes you want to keep coming back.  The addition of the Tavern & Wine bar is nice for even more casual dining and an added bonus of choosing & purchasing a bottle of wine that you can pair with dinner. I've been here many, many times over the years and am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place for an anniversary!  Perfect for an upscale, but laid back night with excellent  food!  My wife and I went there for our 5 year anniversary and like other reviewers here  the owner came out and had a nice conversation with us.  All of the staff responded quickly to request, but didn't make you feel rushed.  Very nice place to spoil yourself with great food and be treated excellent!  You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations from zagat   Nice decor.  Good service  but the food underwhelmed.   Carpaccio bland except from the lemon squeezed on it. Calamari greasy dipping sauces boring. Cioppino very southwest like chile with seafood."}
{"text":"Our meal tonight was outstanding from the appetizers to the entrees to the desserts!  The Customer Service also exceeded our expectations. My co-workers were extremely impressed and I will definitely come back. Thank you, Ty Crandall for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Tarbell's for some years now.  It first started with \"the place\" the hubs & I would come to celebrate an event....anniversary, birthday, mother's day, etc.  Now it's the place we go for a wonderful night together or to bring out of town guests or even those who've never experienced this gem!  Not once in all the years we've dined here, did we ever leave disappointed.  Mark & his staff knows how to treat people here, like they are part of his family.  They are always willing to  customize your entree by giving you a sampler of something if you can't decide between two items or change a side if you don't like what's offered.  They always aim to please!  Mark comes around personally to visit each table & has a friendly, top notch staff to support him that seems to genuinely like being there.    Being a creature of habit, I usually get the Ribbon Pasta with Chicken sausage and it's perfection, has me dreaming of my next visit!  A light, but complex broth with wide egg noodles, campari tomatoes, spinach & a fennel chicken sausage that's just amazing. The warm bacon candy salad is a party in your mouth!  Really, it's that good!!  I've also had the salmon & sea bass (a special that night), both worthy of a repeat visit!  The atmosphere has a comfortable, non-pretentious, neighborhood vibe that welcomes you whether your in jeans or a dress.  Hubs loves Marks Famous Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Grilled NY strip, I mean really, how can you go wrong!  Warm Chocolate cake, Profiteroles & Creme Brulee are just what the doctor ordered to put this one on the top of anyone's list!!"}
{"text":"We went last night for a birthday dinner. I e-mailed the restaurant night before asking that I knew Mark is busy but if he could sign Happy Birthday on anything for my babe that would be awesome. Not only did he sign a menu, but he personalized it with what we ate (warm bacon candy). Of course the food was excellent, The Meatball & Spaghetti, NY strip. Such a great night on this special occasion!"}
{"text":"Where to begin...? Everything here is amazing, and anything you order off the menu is perfect. The bar services is very nice. Desserts are delightful. Quick as well. Wait staff does not bother. Always there for special occasions."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  We had a fun evening. Highly recommend the cheesecake dessert!  Will definitely stop there again when we are back in town."}
{"text":"Anybody who gives this place less than 5 stars is crazy! They never disappoint here. Every visit is just as good as the last if not better.  I will love Tarbell's  for life!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, great flavors, deftly made, impeccable service. @Tarbells I accidentally wandered into this restaurant when it first opened in December of 1994 and have been a customer ever since.  The atmosphere is \"cool\" and allows one to feel comfortable arriving in a suite and tie or in jeans and a tee shirt.  The staff is welcoming and attentive to detail. There are seasonal dishes that are interesting, amazing and rare - and standby dishes that we love to order.  Things to try: House pulled Mozzarella with tomatoes - yes, it is a standard in many restaurants until you try this one, and this will become your new standard. The chicken fennel sausage with broth is one of the most incredibly complex broths that tastes like it was made with incredible care and precision. Pan roasted chicken is never dry, perfectly crispy skin. The vegetable plate is amazing, almost enough to inspire me to become a vegetarian. Fish of the moment - always fresh, flown in daily, prepared well - my wife loves the halibut. My son has gone there since he was born - he is welcome there, fussed over, and they always have noodles ready for him (home made). I cannot recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the negativity on the other reviews. The decor is not dated, it just doesnt follow the same industrial hipster look almost everywhere else has these days. As for the food, the carpaccio was good (although would benefit from some pecorino added to the Parmesan for a nice salty kick) the scotch beef was great, and the seasonal scallop dish was absolutely fantastic. The mushroom risotto was probably the best of the dishes. I also appreciated that the wine list gave some love to non-pinot/cab reds and was not overpriced any more  than expected. I also popped for the Chateau d'Yquem Sauternes, which I cannot recommend strongly enough, despite the absurd price."}
{"text":"My mistake for eating 2 hours before going out to dinner here. I was meeting our wineries distrubutors sales reps and this is the restaurant they choose. Again, another restaurant in a strip mall. However, tarbells unlike michaels does a year round business. I though this was a good restaurant, and I liked the over the top whisky bread pudding. Though, I only ordered chicken which is hard to do great since, I knew that it was one of the few entrees I could finish.  The place has a great atmosphere. They also picked up our wineries the next day which was nice of the wine buyer."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in Phoenix!  Mark Tarbell always goes the extra mile to make his customers feel special and appreciated.  The food is always fabulous.  He always puts a unique touch on basic dishes, again making you feel special.  Love love love this place and it's a MUST for anyone dining in Phoenix.  The wait staff was extremely attentive never even allowing our glasses of water to get half empty.  We were never rushed to leave even long after out meal was paid for.  Always an enjoyable experience.  Thanks Mark!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a date following Food Network recommendations, and we were so impressed, we decided to post a review for the very first time ! We were truly delighted by every dish we tried, from the complimentary roasted parmesan chickpeas, the candied bacon and chicken fennel sausage pizza as appetizers, to the pan roasted chicken and NY peppered strip for mains. Dessert was amazing too, a salted caramel cheesecake! On top of the excellent food, the customer service was top notch, we had two amazing waiters who were so attentative, and truly went above and beyond to make our evening a pleasurable one. By far, THE BEST restaurant we've been to so far in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here four or five times.  We always get the mussels to start, and they are always delicious and cooked just right.  The broth is great for dipping the bread in, although I could probably just use a straw.  The fish of the day was halibut.  It was very flavorful, but maybe just a tad overcooked.  The scallops were wonderful.  Great wine selection.  This place a lively atmosphere.  Not too noisy to hear across the table, but a good vibe.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I've had in a while.  Drinks, apps, entrees, and desserts were all exceptional.  Service was as good as you can get.  Went wife and two daughters.  No complaints, only compliments from everybody.  Seated in the dining area but the bar area looked like the place to be, even on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Other than the sold out specials at our 7:30pm seating at Tarbell's I was pleased with the restaurants' favorable aesthetic and crowd. I love an open kitchen where patrons can play audience to rising cooking flames and hot dishes ready to be served.  Cubed ahi tuna and chick peas to start (sounded interesting.) And for my main, the vegetarian dish \"made with love\" as the menu stated - was indeed.    Not to be forgotten, a beautifully assorted dessert platter on the house as a birthday present and dinner topper boasting a rich array of decadent sweets including my favorite the mascarpone cheesecake with warm rosemary caramel sauce.  Mark Tarbell, I'm hooked and I'll be back for more next time I'm visiting Phoenix's camelback area."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday.  I had the cast iron-seared pepper steak.  My wife had the Swordfish special.  I also had  1/2 order of the Tuna Tartare and she had  1/2 order of Mussels and we split a Cesar salad.  The Tuna was tasty as were the Mussels.  There was nothing special about the Cesar.  Both main courses were TERRIBLE.  The Steak had no flavor.  Neither my wife or I can figure out how anyone can take a piece of meat like that and prepare it to the point where it is completely without taste.  I almost asked for steak sauce, or ketchup or anything to give it \"something\".  Fortunately, Salt fixes everything.  The creamed spinach is still a mystery.  Usually creamed spinach is chopped and has a cream sauce.  Spinach that is simply Boiled or Steamed spinach IS NOT creamed spinach.  The au gratin potatoes were dry as if they had been sitting, for hours, just waiting for a victim.  The Swordfish was equally as bad.  It had absolutely  no flavor and the consistency of a cardboard.  Her bustle sprouts did have some flavor since they were burned and tasted like charcoal.  We are still AMAZED that anyone had the skills necessary to turn two pieces of meat into completely flavorless ... I don't believe words exists to describe these bland \"creations\".  She was really excited about going to Tarbells, as was I and because of that, we were really let down.  Again, it wasn't just bad, it was TERRIBLE.   That was Saturday and we are still talking about how awful the food was at Teribells.  Now only was the food is Awful!!!!, Teribels is located in a terrible location, and we were lucky to get a parking spot.   We were so looking forward to a night of fine dining, instead, we got a bill for $103.00 for the worst tasting food either of us has ever endured."}
{"text":"Found Tarbell's on Yelp - we really didn't know any restaurants near where we were staying and liked what I saw in reviews and pictures.  Made reservations for same day - within an hour and because it was Thurs night, we were able to get it.  Probably wouldn't work on a Fri/Sat!  The food was delicious, the service impeccable.  And Mark Tarbell was such a gracious host, came to our table a couple of times - it was our anniversary and he wanted us to have dessert on the house.  The Summer bouillabaisse my husband had was wonderful, and my ribbon pasta with fennel chicken sausage was superb!  We had their new menu item as a  starter:  grilled peaches, bacon, balsamic, etc.  A WONDERFUL summer starter, light but what a great flavor combo!  All in all couldn't have asked for a better dinner with a great staff!  Only downside was when we actually ordered 2 desserts, that was 1 too much for 2 people - other portions were perfect, desserts are LARGE!  But we couldn't decide between the classic chocolate mousse (YUMMY!) and the Bread pudding with Kentucky Bourbon sauce -so we ordered both.  And both were outstanding - but TOOO BIG!!!  OK so that's not really a bad thing!!!!"}
{"text":"Service, wine and food is outstanding. Great, relaxed ambience. This is a go to place for a wind down after a long day."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and I have to say the manager did an excellent job, they were not able to seat us for our reservation so they gave us some free appetizers when we finally sat down.   Also had a champagne toast which was so nice. Didn't receive a birthday dessert but... Loved coming here with my family. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I dined here with friends visiting from out of town. We all really loved if!!! Local ingredients, personable server and scallops that were simpy amazing! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!! In an environment where corporate chain establishments are taking over, Tarbell's stands on its on!"}
{"text":"Tarbells has been a favorite for years.  Last night was not a good night. It was crowded as it always is on a Friday night.  We were seated promptly in an average location. Sort of felt like we were in our neighbors table the way the table was angled. The service was very slow.  We were well into our cocktails before we ordered our apps.    We ordered the carpaccio and the roasted  brussel sprouts.  The carpaccio was delicious.  We really enjoyed it.  The roasted brussel sprouts were equally good.  I had the fish special of the night and my dh had the ribbon pasta which he has had many times before.  My fish was just ok. The description sounded great but there was something seriously bitter on the plate.  On top of that, the dish was incredibly under seasoned.   I love the wine list and usually love the the food. Last night it was just meh."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and some delicious plates! The ribbon pasta is by far one of my favorite ever!!! So simple yet delightful. Had the left overs this morning with bacon since I finished the chicken sausage last night... Still perfect :) fiancé enjoyed his grilled steak-cooked to temperature (medium rare). We ordered shrimp rocks as appetizer and we were impressed! The waiter bought out some cheesy Mac and cheese on the house when our main course came out- which was a nice surprise. Can't forget about the grilled asparagus...gorgeous side to the steak! One of the best restaurant in PHX, should be everyone's next stop :)"}
{"text":"If you want the most amazing pasta, chicken, cheesecake, etc...it is incomparable!  We will be back for sure the next time we visit Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Tarbell's has good food, good service and a comfortable ambiance. I had the beet salad and it was amazing! The halibut had a nice broth and the pea leaves were a nice touch! My only complaint is that the stringy part of the pea leaves (the shoot) should've been removed (not edible). In Chinese cooking, a lot of labor goes into removing this stringy portion of the shoot. The beef dish with the buttermilk mashed potatoes were melt in your mouth delish! The ice cream cream puff dessert was good, but not to die for. My friend and I stopped by after going to a kids soccer game and we were a bit underdressed. The wait staff was friendly and it wasn't  problem."}
{"text":"In my business I'm fortunate that insurance company people come out every quarter to wine and dine me, and I always get to pick the restaurant! I've been hearing fabulous things about Tarbell's for years, and have been making my way to dine there for awhile. Last night was THE night!  As I walked in the door, the hostess was smiling and the owner/chef Mark Tarbell was standing right there to welcome the guests - and since I'm a huge fan of Iron Chef America, I was incredibly excited to meet him.   The waiter was soft spoken and really pleasant, and the bread they bring to your table was delicious. Upon perusing the menu, there were several things that caught my eye - the Crispy Chickpeas, the Calamari and the House-Pulled Mozzarella. I'm a huge fan of the last two (and they were really good), but the first one had me a little skeptical. The Crispy Chickpeas were DELICIOUS! Crispy, a little cheesy, and just perfect.  The Tuscan Kale also had all of us a little skeptical, since kale is generally bitter. Not so with this delightful salad, I could eat it every day! For the main course we ordered the Mr. Fish of the Moment (halibut), Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna and the Cast Iron-Seared Pepper Steak - ALL of these were absolutely perfect in temperature and flavor!   Dessert is a must, especially here! We split several desserts -  Mascarpone Cheesecake  with Rosemary Caramel Sauce (TO DIE FOR) Profiteroles with Vanilla Bean Gelato & Chocolate Sauce (AMAZING) Southern Bread Pudding with Kentucky Bourbon Sauce The \"Beloved\" Chocolate Mousse Featuring Guittard Chocolate (MY FAVORITE)  I tried and loved them all!  Bottom line - this is now at the top of my favorites list. I would eat here every day if I could afford it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding atmosphere, food, desserts and drinks.  Great place for dinner with that special someone."}
{"text":"Add this spot to your bucket list. I'm a totally spoiled food snob and LOVE Tarbell's. The food is AMAZING as is the service with lovely ambiance. They really know how to balance flavors, cook everything to perfection, and use the freshest ingredients. Don't even get me started on the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Officially, the best place to eat in Phoenix.  My mom has been living there for years, and we were desperately looking for something special among the chain restaurants and fast food places.  We will look no further... Had the special - some snapper dish, as did my friend.  We went for my mom's birthday and will definitely returning before her next one.  Service was exceptional... I've never had a restaurant call me the next day asking how everything was.  Someone called me the next day and actually remembered we were celebrating my mom's birthday.  The only disappointment was the fried bean app - skip it!  Waiter had fantastic wine pairings for each course.  Love, love, love.  Made me feel like I was in a great restaurant in NYC, except that the service was way better."}
{"text":"My first time here. The best steak I have ever had. (Peppered flank steak ) The au gratin potatoes were the best we have ever tasted . This place moves to my top five in Phoenix. The JD and soda was perfectly mixed btw."}
{"text":"WOW, Tarbell's is unforgettable and will definitely be a GO-TO for special occasion dinners. (and maybe even to treat myself at the bar :) ...)  Walked in on a Thursday night around 8 pm and were seated at a nice 4-top table right in the center of the dining area, I'm difficult to please, and just by where they placed us, good vibes had already been given off. Our server, Nathan, knew just when to stop by, was able to answer all our questions, and was not pushy at all. The dinner was perfectly timed out, and he never made me feel rushed to finish a course. ....Seriously, what an experience, while we weren't celebrating anything special, Tarbell's truly provided us with a remarkable experience.  After ordering wine, Nathan offered to pick our starters for us since we were unfamiliar with the menu. He selected the Warm \"Bacon Candy\" Salad, and the Farmers Market Plate. Just a few bites in, my expectations for the rest of the meal were very high.   After our plates were cleared, our entrees arrived. The seafood risotto was good, but a little too overwhelmed with the taste of salmon; but the Tar's Scotch Beef, and the house made Ribbon Pasta with Chicken Fennel Sausage were phenomenal; you can taste quality in every bite... yum!  And lastly, of course I always save room for dessert, I was stuck between the Vanilla Cheesecake with Rosemary Carmel, and the Warm Chocolate Cake, BOTH WERE WONDERFUL!   A genuine thank you to Tarbell's, and Nathan, for making this dinner such a fantastic experience. Dining is one of my favorite ways to explore the city, and I'm so glad to have made a last minute decision to enjoy my Thursday night at your restaurant. 5 stars.. without question!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant to go to when visiting Phoenix. The \"Scotch Beef\" (pot roast) is absolutely the best I've ever had anywhere. They pile it on a bed of mashed potatoes with carrots, green beans, and onions. Then they cover it with the most delicious red-wine reduction gravy. I've eaten it two nights in a row its so good. The drinks are good too. Others I've gone with say the fresh fish dishes are excellent as well."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 with the hopes of returning and giving it a 4 or 5.   My wife and i had the spinach dip, bolognese, and a 35 day aged peppercorn steak.  In addition to our order, our server presented us with a complimentary burrata appetizer, as it was our first time to the restaurant. Whole tomatoes are my least favorite vegetable (or fruit, whatever, shut up) I appreciated the gesture and the cheese mixture was quite good.   Spinach dip: not actually a dip, like chips and dip, but I probably would have realized that if I actually read the menu. Its a puff filled with spinach and though unexpected was very good.   Bolognese: I only had a bite but it had good flavor, so I can't comment much more than that.   Steak: they offer steaks either grilled or peppered. Should have gone with my gut and just gotten the grilled steak, but went on a limb for the peppered. I ordered medium rare; in my opinion it was slightly overcooked but I do like steaks quite rare so I didn't complain. The steak itself had great flavor, but delite what the server said it had a much stronger pepper flavor than I was expecting.   In addition to the entrees we had pomme frites (fries) and Brussels sprouts.  The fries were nothing special. They were fried potatoes, as expected. But you can get better fries at any fast food restaurant.   Sprouts: definitely overcooked. They looked almost completely black, basically no green left, little flavor left besides the charring. But, mixed with the sprouts were caramelized white onions which basically saved the dish. Cook them a few minutes less and they would be absolutely terrific.   Overall, I give service 4 stars. Server was knowledgeable but could have been just a tad quicker with drink refills. The ambiance is great, and it may have just been timing but when we pulled up there were 2 Bentley's and a Rolls parked in front (good thing we borrowed the in laws' car so we fit in).   I would return to try the non-peppered grilled steak or the lamb, but for my current visit I would have to give 3 out of 5.  Definitely give it a shot. It was not a bad experience at all"}
{"text":"Last month, while at a conference in Phoenix, a group of about 16 of us made reservations and went to Tarbell's. I had heard great things about this place and being a bit of a foodie, I was excited about it. I began to worry because... well, you know when you build something up in your head and it doesn't live up to what you are expecting? Two months is a lot of anticipation!  I was lucky enough to be seated with four other people that were big foodies too, which was perfect. We all loved food and, even better, we liked to share. Score! Still... would it live up to the hubbub? I've only watched Iron Chef a few times, but had no idea the chef had won it, quite honestly. Had I, I probably would have skipped the restaurant, honestly. I'm glad I didn't because this was one of those meals that I will remember for a good long time. One of the ladies at my table was also from Austin (where I'm from) and we are still working out how we can get Mr. Tarbell to move here (hey, if you're reading this, Mark, Austin is a super cool city... just sayin').  We tried many of the things on the menu, I'll share my favorites...   For the table we ordered the Brussels Sprouts as well as the Shisitho Peppers. I'm not a pepper fan, but those that liked them said they were well done. The sprouts were perfectly cooked and we managed to convert one person in our group that claimed they did NOT like them. Heh, apparently she loves them now. For salads, I tried a few, but my favorite was the beet salad. Absolutely must get this. It was amazing, the goat cheese was mild and the flavors blended beautifully. The house pulled mozzarella was also very good.  For the main course, I had the Pan-Seared Ahi Tuna (rare). OMG. I have had quite a bit of ahi in my life, but this was, easily, the best. It simply melted in your mouth. The nicoise on the side was a perfect compliment to bring out the flavor for the fish as well as the potatoes that were served on the side. I also got to enjoy some of the salmon (divine) and house-made ribbon pasta (absolutely wonderful). The stand out for me was definitely the ahi, but really adore tuna, if done correctly.  We also skipped dessert. Until we saw the menu. None of the four of us could decide on any one thing, so we each ordered something and then passed them around in circles. We got a few laughs, but hey, you only live once, right? I must say that the desserts were all simply amazing (and huge!). The stand out was the mascarpone cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce (Oh my, I wonder if my spouse would think it odd if I booked a trip back there JUST to get a slice of this cake - Psssst, the recipe is on their website though!). We also had the bread pudding, which I was leery of, but it was, again, absolutely amazingly well done. We had the apples (which I didn't get to try, I'm allergic, but everyone said they were so very good) and the profiteroles (which one of my table mates had a bit of a When Harry Met Sally moment over). *laugh*  The staff were attentive, answering our many questions. We never felt rushed and spent a good time talking and enjoying the company. The restaurant itself seems very unassuming in a small strip mall type of area. Parking looks like it could be a bit of a problem (we took a hotel shuttle). The place is a bit on the loud side, but nothing we needed to scream over. I would not hesitate to bring my husband or business folks here again. Though, definitely not a place for kids.  Thank you, Tarbell's, for a memorable evening of good food, good atmosphere and good fun."}
{"text":"Had high expectations due to the celebrated chef. Pizza crust awful, honestly, frozen is better. Bolognese that is apparently made over days  is nothing close to Bolognese. Two poor dishes, we will not go back. The server was great however. I am sad to write this, maybe the amercian dishes are better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!.  They do everything right.  The food is amazing the service is amazing and the overall customer service can't be touched.  This establishment is the whole package.  A few of my favorite dishes are the scotch beef and the chicken sausage pasta.  The cheese pizza is divine as well.  No wonder Mark beat Cat Cora on Iron Chef America.  Try this place you will not be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service great...but the portions left us hungry :( we ate a pizza after. Wasn't as good but definitely more filling."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner at Tarbell. Wonderful service and a nice setting.   We started with house made mozzarella and tomato with was the highlight of the night. The mozzarella was soft, creamy and very flavorful. We than had the rock shrimp ravioli.  The ravioli dough was a little heavy and the shrimp lacked flavor.  Next I had the meatball piazza and my wife had the roast chicken.  The chicken was wonderful, the skin crisp and the meat moist and burgeoning with flavor. My piazza was good but am a piazza fanatic and had a few issues with the pie.  The pie was good as were the meatballs but the sauce was a stew/barbecue gravy rather than pure tomato base. It ruined the pie for me!  The biggest issue was the price, for the quality and location it is OVERPRICED.  Appetizer were $15 to $20 and main courses averaged $30!  The piazza was $14.  Overall it gets 3 stars, I would go back but be careful least I ordered!"}
{"text":"Wednesday evening we made the trek from Mesa to enjoy Tarbell's! We wanted to celebrate a special woman's birthday! A Mesa native and world traveler, who had Tarbell's on her bucket list! All diners were pleased with this venue! As it was not our first encounter, we made some recommendations! The pan roasted chicken was delicious! Two ladies raved about the salmon! Wine selection is abundant; hence, no one had difficulty making a choice to accompany their meal! The grand finale was the decadent cheesecake topped with rosemary glaze... Split by the four of us! Our waiter, Nathan, was delightful all evening long! Our VIP birthday diner was more than impressed with this gem of a dining venue!"}
{"text":"We have visited Tarbell's numerous times over the years. We really want to love it as much as we used to, but sadly no... Too salty and inconsistent."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with customers on a fairly quiet Wednesday night.  Knew right away it was going to be pretty good when Larry Fitzgerald was dinning there.  Anyway, the nice thing about dinner with a larger group is that you can try a lot of dishes.  We had good calamari, great bacon candy and an excellent himachi crudo.  I would recommend the bacon and himachi.    For dinner I got the homemade ribbon pasta, which was exceptional.  My coworker also got this and was impressed.  The other winner of the night was the NY Strip, which I tried and it was an excellent steak.  Though seriously... Get the ribbon pasta.  There's a lot of places in Phoenix for great steak.  We also shared a couple of desserts.  Our favorite was the cheesecake.  Very unique.  The bread pudding was ok."}
{"text":"Really good food but my only complaint would be the service. The beef carpaccio appetizer was fantastic - all fresh ingredients and a large portion. My father and I loved the swordfish special with yellow tomato broth, fig compote ad rice  Issues with service: It took a while to get the wine we ordered. My father and asked to sub the rice for roasted brussel sprouts on the swordfish and our waitress brought us the swordfish with just brussel sprouts. It took us a while to be able to flag our waitress down and get the other parts added to the dish. Those parts were pretty critical to the dish (pretty bland without them) and she really should've clarified in case she misunderstood (which she did)."}
{"text":"Went to Tarbell's for our first anniversary dinner. We had a reservation at 8, showed up 10 minutes early and were seated immediately. The wine list is extensive and they carry several unique beers, which is always a bonus. We started with mac and cheese - divine. The cheese was sharp and the noodles were firm. We had oysters as well, extremely fresh and cold, perfect. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I really wanted a NY strip, but it's served with creamed spinach, which I don't care for. Our waiter suggested subbing the sides from the chicken dish. I know that seems simple but some places don't substitute - I guess some chefs know better than the guests. Husband had scallops and said they were fabulous. We ordered dessert, which came out with Happy Anniversary written on the plate, which I thought was ultra cool since I only made a reference to that on the online reservation - we never told anyone personally. How thoughtful! Husband said the cheesecake was creamy and thick, exactly right (not a cheesecake fan so I'll trust him). I am, however, a bread pudding fan. Their bread pudding was ok. I found it to be too dry, not enough custard. The flavor was quite nice though. Overall, this was a romantic and delicious dinner, thank you to everyone at Tarbell's!"}
{"text":"Came here with several friends for a celebration. Audrey, our server, made the celebration great! She provided probably the best service I have ever experienced. The food and desert was great! 5 's all the way..."}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary and it was perfect.   They always make you feel important even as you look around and see everyone from rock stars to people like us.  The place is perfect for a romantic dinner or a celebratory meal.   I had the Peppered Steak and my wife had the Pan Roasted Chicken.  Her salad was exactly how she enjoys it, and the deserts were delicious. I appreciate that the impressive wine list isn't overpriced at all but quite reasonable compared to other places of this caliber.   I can assure you we will be back to Tarbell's for another special occasion soon.   (we might just have to create one, so we can go again sooner rather than later)"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for Tarbell's. We'd heard (and read) really good things. We went on a Saturday night, and the restaurant was full.   The positives---the staff was really exceptional. They were super friendly and attentive. I also loved the roasted (deep fried?) chick peas that were on the table as a starter. They were super delicious. Also, our main proteins (husband had steak, I had the scallops) were cooked technically well and the presentation was very nice. My scallop plate was probably the prettiest plate of food I've been served.   However, the flavors were just not that great. My entree lacked salt/savory flavors, and the root vegetables on my plate were not cooked long enough, so they were quite tough. My husband said his steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, but the flavor just wasn't special or memorable. He ordered a side of brussels sprouts, which was actually his favorite part of the dinner. Overall, the food was just OK. I had expected the food to be 5 stars, but in reality, I've eaten at many many better restaurants.  Nothing about Tarbell's was memorable. The decor and the vibe was not cool or unique. The majority of the patrons were elderly. We definitely would not go back there.  P.S. I ate at Tarbell's Tavern (next door, more of a bar menu) a couple weeks ago, and I liked their food and atmosphere better than Tarbell's."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. The food and drinks are very well made and delicious.  Be prepare for the high prices."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of how fresh and yummy the food is and was completely caught off guard by the spectacular scotch (and whiskey) offering.    Yes the food is fantastic; I can't believe I ordered beets... Wait! I can't believe I devoured every morsel of beets.  The daily catch and lobster gnocci were quite nice as well.    BTW, Tessie made my experience all the more special.  She provided superb menu recommendations and even though I don't think we'd ever met before, she made me feel like family.  Thanks Tessie!  Also, I'd like to thank Stephen for coming over and chatting with me about whiskeys"}
{"text":"We ended up at Tarbell's for our anniversary dinner after reading poor Yelp reviews of the resort restaurant we were going to try. I'm so happy we were able to get in!! We had a wonderful meal and the service was excellent!   I would recommend Tarbell's to anyone looking for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a food run around the Biltmore to share a couple dishes.  The beef carpaccio was paper thin and melted.  The mussels in white wine and butter was so good.  We tried to get the bread to soak up as much of the broth as possible so we didn't lift the bowl up to our faces to drink it.  Another table got the Duck Confit Poutine w/ Cheese Curds.. and I need to try that next time.  This stop was right after Tommy V's so we knew not to order more, but I want to come back and explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Yeah... I did it. I was in the Phoenix area and could not resist checking out the Iron Chef competitor and toppled Cat Cora. So with taste buds set for battle and stomach ready to receive I ventured in.  The restaurant is quaint. The waitress was incredibly helpful. I am one of those \"tapas\" eaters...yup I enjoy a little bite of everything and especially if it comes in the form of outside my comfort zone. Granted, the items on the menue here are fairly standard fair, but done exceptionally well.   I had the swordfish and beef carpaccio. Both were absolutely excellent. The service was top notch, it did get a bit noises (but the noise was fun energetic chatter...which was nice). Visually the food was average...but probably better than most restaurants. What I apprecaited was visually it was still manageable and you didn't feel as you didn't know what your next step was...take a picture, poke it, smell it...stare at it.   Anyways, good stuff, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've sat at the bar multiple times and just ordered little bites and wine. Every time I have been in, the staff has been attentive and courteous. I recommend this place to all people I meet that are looking for a great place to have a wonderful food going experience.   I'm looking forward to taking my parents here and out of town guests as well!"}
{"text":"Every March my brother, father and I go out to Arizona for Spring Training and my father's bday. This year my brother, who's a vegan, was not able to make it.  Therefore, I was looking for a place we could get a hearty cut of meat. I found Tarbell's on Yelp and saw the photos of that huge pork chop.  The photo, along with the favorable reviews led me to my decision to make reservations.  However, I was very disappointed that they no longer have the pork chop on the menu.  We had reservations at 8:30, but got there around 7:45 to have a drink and watch the Cal Poly basketball game. The bartender was very nice and knowledgeable on their wines. He provided us with a sample of a Cab, which my dad later got with his meal.  While having a drink, the couple next to us was brought a beautiful dish of 5 huge diver scallops. My father and I decided that we would get an order of the scallops and a meat dish to split. We started with a salad that had uncooked butternut squash and fried parsnips. The butternut squash was surprisingly good. It was cut thin so it was not overly crunchy, as I had assumed uncooked butternut would be. The salad had a homemade parsnip vinagerette that was light refreshing and wonderful. The scallops were to die for, by far the best I have ever had. They came on top of mushroom risotto that was also excellent. Unfortunately though the Tar's Scotch Beef was pretty bland. The meat was under seasoned and not very good unless mixed with the mashed potatoes and red wine gravy to make it flavorful. All in all a very good meal...I still wish I could've had the pork chop though."}
{"text":"A great place for amazing food! Right when we walked in, the place was filled with people and a great view of the kitchen. I knew right away that it was going to be tasty with how many people were seated instead and even at the bar eating their dinner.  To start, we started off with the mozzarella, tomato and basil plate. So fresh and all the ingredients just melted in my mouth. I got the chicken and my boyfriend got the steak. Absolutely loved every bite of it. The service was a little slow towards the end and it took us a while to get ahold of our server, but more talking time for us."}
{"text":"Have not been back here in a long time. Was just marvelous. I had the swordfish special with all kinds of delicious surprises. My husband had the salmon. Not only beautifully presented but great flavors. We had started out with the calamari appetizer which our wonderful waiter split for us without being asked to. Impressive! Allan our waiter was just wonderful and saw to all our needs. The calamari was tender and not over breaded or fried. Just perfect and melted in your mouth. Will return soon even though for us it's a 30-40 minute drive."}
{"text":"Tarbell's is one off the best restaurants in the Phoenix area. Yes, it's a little pricey but I was impressed when our waiter could tell us all the ingredients in a particular menu item when asked... and there were quite a few! I had the scotch beef and my wife had the scallops. Our friends had the trout and spaghetti. The garbanzo bean appetizer is a wonderful. The wine list is spectacular.  Our real treat was the bing cherry desert. I'm not usually a big fan of cherries but this was marvelous. Our overall experience was one of the better fine dining experiences we have had in a long time. Too bad they are not open for lunch. If you know of a better place than this for fine dining please advise"}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner with six other people. We were seated promptly and started with a glass of Cabernet, delicious, and full bodied. Appetizers consisted of a bacon salad, rich in taste and presentation. Carpaccio delicately sliced and melted in your mouth. Shrimp nicely seasoned. For staters some ordered a salad which was plated with care was crispy and the dressing not overpowering. Most of us ordered their special cauliflower soup. It was served hot and so creamy, it just exploded with taste once it hit your taste buds.  For dinner entrées consisted of the scallops, skate fish and a chief made  vegetarian dish. All who ordered the shrimp was satisfied and said their dish was cooked just right. The skate fish dish on the other hand was not as well liked. The vegetarian dish was out of this world. The different ingredients blended but also complimented each other. Desert was brought on the table no questions asked. If you eat it you pay for it. All deserts were with the money. Rich in taste and calories. All in all this place is worth it. Just know it is on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Possibly the best kept secret of Phoenix! With a somewhat smaller dining area as opposed to chain restaurants, this unique, upscale, fine dining establishment earns its keep on quality service to customers, not quantity of throughput.  It is a higher end restaurant, so if you expect that, then you won't get sticker shock.  Compared to other higher end fine dining, it's actually very reasonable with appetizers in the $20s and main courses in the $30s. We had a reservation through Yelp, so my table was ready when I arrived, which is always nice.  Also, there is valet parking service since the parking lot can be crowded, but I found a spot without a problem before I saw the valets.  We started our meal with the hamachi crudo appetizer, which was delicious! I don't know how they get such fresh fish in Arizona, but whatever they're doing is working! The service staff was very attentive and on their game, pulling plates as soon as we finished and bringing out the huge Diver Scallops next.  Again, it was absolutely scrumptious! My mouth is now watering just remembering how perfectly prepared it was. For the main course I enjoyed the delectable AZ honey glazed Scottish salmon with curried potato cake and a side of kale greens.  The salmon was perfectly prepared, and went very well with the sides and glaze.  The potato cake was delicious as well, but the kale really surprised me by how well prepared it was.  I wish I could get the chef's recipe because I've never been able to get kale to taste so good!  Finally, I finished the night with the apple puff pastry, which has flavors reminiscent of a country apple pie your grandma might have baked, but completely inside of a flaky pastry.  If you're looking for a classy, quiet restaurant with an amazing menu perfectly prepared and served to entertain an important client, take that special someone out, or just treat yourself, then look no further! I highly recommend this place, and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What took us so long to find this place?    The food is wonderful, the service is top drawer, and the atmosphere hits the exact right tone of hip.    We eat in restaurants frequently, and this is as thoroughly fine a dining experience as I have had in a very very long time.  Can not wait to return."}
{"text":"Delish!  This is an upscale, top notch restaurant - excellent service, high quality food, beautiful menu. I had the Scotch Beef, which is one of their house specialities. Not only was it gluten free, but the beef melted in my mouth and the portion was very generous.  As an appetizer, we tried the tuna tartar and beef carpaccio. The tuna was cool and refreshing. The beef was a little hard to pry off the plate, which would have been fine if it was just my hubby and I, but I felt a little awkward picking at it with another couple there. I'm not sure if anything can be done about that.   The server was knowledgeable and professional. He was there when we needed him but never lurked (in that creepy way that sometimes happens elsewhere). I told him upfront that I was GF and he steered me away from a few dishes that had hidden gluten. He also works in The Wine Store by day and was able to recommend a beautiful pinot noir for us out of Napa (St. Joseph's).  We enjoyed the mixed berries with lemon meringue as a shared desert. This portion was on the small side, but absolutely mouth-watering. We each enjoyed a bite or two with our post-dinner port or coffee drink. It was wonderful ending to a delicious dinner.  Tip: every meal (except the pizzas) may be ordered as half orders. This is great if you can't decide between two entrees!"}
{"text":"My first time at Tarbell's was with a dinner for 2 certificate. Since neither one of us had been there, our waiter suggested letting us trust him to bring out dishes for us to enjoy as all but alcohol & gratuity was covered. SO glad we went with this option as our waiter spoiled us. Being able to try different appetizers, entrées and dessert felt like we were on a cruise in that the food, presentation and service were immaculate! I don't think there was a dish I tried that fell short of amazing but I do highly recommend the apple crisp. It will change your life. Keep on keeping on Tarbell's"}
{"text":"Went in because I heard it had a nice bourbon selection.  We were not disappointed.   I politely greeted by the hosted who answered all our questions then got a seat at the bar.    The bartender was very good, attentive and made a fantastic Old Fashioned.     After a drink we were asked to be seated at a table for dinner.  Our waiter (Drew) was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and did a good job making the specials sound very appetizing.   My wife enjoyed the Halibut (Special of the day) it was large portion, beautifully presented and perfectly cooked.  I had the Scotch Steak which was an upscale Pot Roast but it was excellent.   The Manager, Seth, stopped by to see how everything was and we talked bourbon for a bit.   I was very impressed with the Tarbell's Elijah Craig private barrel.   Desserts of Chocolate Cake with Pistachio Gelato and Ganache and The Beloved Chocolate Mousse with Fair-Trade Chocolate were well presented and topped off a wonderful night.   Overall we were impressed with the staff and food and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"From greeting to goodbye, this was a superb dining experience.  I was able to make a reservation using Open Table.  A friendly Tarbell's caller confirmed the reservation on the day we were scheduled.  I told them we were celebrating a wedding anniversary, though we did not want a fuss and we rarely eat dessert, so I wasn't asking for anything.  We were greeted with a sincere \"Happy Anniversary\".  Our server was relaxed and well informed.  I told her that I avoid gluten, and she immediately knew how to advise me with the menu.  We started with wine by the glass.  I had a light pinot Grigio and my husband had the Malbec.  Both were just fine.  We then ordered, sharing a Caesar salad for a starter.  It was romaine and kale, an interesting variation of the traditional Caesar.  We didn't have to ask for no croutons.  I ordered the mussels and my husband ordered a steak and buttermilk mashed potatoes.  After we finished the plated shared salad, our server surprised us with two magnificent appetizers.  She took it upon herself to choose appetizers for us because I told the confirmer that we don't eat many desserts.  The mozzarella and tomato salad and the sweet bacon with cabbage were outstanding!  Our main dishes were perfectly prepared.  Servings were huge.  The potatoes were exceptionally good.  I finished with an illy espresso, as good as I have ever had.  This was one of the best, most unique dining experiences we have had.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"After reading yelp reviews for over an hour, I  found this restaurant whose chef happened to beat Cat Cora in Iron Chef, I had to try it.  We passed by it earlier when driving and the strip mall is nothing to write home about.  In fact, it looks very 1970's.    I never thought there would be such a good restaurant in this mall.  The service is absolutely OUTSTANDING!  The water glasses never were more than half empty, food came out quickly (not pushy quickly), and the waitress did an AWESOME job describing the dishes.  She clearly is a foodie.  Being a foodie myself, I like hearing people describe food very expressively.    Wine - fantastic wine list!  We were looking at wines and the waitress recommended one which was fantastic.- Carpaccio - good and alot of it.  (it was a bit heavy on the salt and I love salt).  Mussels - you get a ton of them but the flavor wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected. The chicken sausage w/tomatoes, fresh pasta ribbons in a parmesean broth - EXCELLENT!   Bread - excellent.    My expectations were that of a 5 star restaurant, the experience was 5 stars, food 4 (only because of being an Iron Chef winner).    Menu is well rounded and offers many differen options - all farm fresh."}
{"text":"Its really sad to hear John S. factor parking while rating the food at Tarbell's. Perhaps he should have spent an additional couple dollars to valet; and olive oil served w/ bread instead of butter isn't really as \"fashionable\" as it is traditional, esp at Italian restaurants.   One of my all-time favorites there are the spaghetti and meatballs. One of their signature dishes and probably some of the best I've had in town!  Our service last night was outstanding....as usual! The place is indeed small. Reservations on the weekend are necessary well in advance. So its easy to imagine that they try to turn tables quickly. No excuse, however, for a customer feeling rushed.   Otherwise, the pasta dishes are especially fantastic and worth a small inconvenience.   Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here the other night.  Wonderful, very good service, great suggestions, they gave us a really good seat.  The mozzarella is amazing and the chicken sausage pasta was done perfectly... enough for two to share.  A great experience with very good prices, you are paying for the high quality food and not the location.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"We still love this place. Great vibe, excellent meal always. Would love to see new menu items from this great chef."}
{"text":"The only bad thing here, the acoustics...and waiting for a table even though we made reservations a week ahead of time for my birthday. (Waiting when you have a reservation and then having he staff expect you to spend money at the bar is just a pet peeve of mine) The food isn't overly fancy. Its just very fresh, made well with great ingredients. The scotch beef was fab as was the chocolate cake. The service was decent even though they were busy. It was hard because the tables are so close to each other, but it worked out ok. Def worth a try, but I would warn them that there are a few things they could work on, food isn't one of them. The portions are perfect and everything is cooked perfectly. AND my mom is a chef and she was with us and agreed:)"}
{"text":"Nice bar and bartender. Had a drink and waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Had a Palma Fizz- like a vodka tonic w/ ginger which added a unique flavor. Wife had a Mai-Tai. Calamari for appetizer and Kale salad. Both were excellent. Our table got the Pepper Steak, House ribbon pasta, scallops and the Scotch Beef. All were excellent/ very good. I ate a combo of the scallops and steak. Both were cooked perfectly. Dessert we got 4 to sample. Caramel Cheesecake, Creme Brulee, Choc cake, and Bread pudding- all good. So many great desert choices. I will have to go back to try the Choc Mousse. Overall a very enjoyable evening. Server was great. Wait staff attentive. Will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good. However our dishes were very inconsistent in quality. We actually had to send one back. It was sooooo over salted. I haven't sent a dish back in years. We all agreed we could just barely test lemon in the lemon curd dessert. The candied bacon appetizer was great. The strozzapreti was great. The olive oil cake as delicious. One weird thing was the serving size of the desserts was so much larger than the entrees. I think it's good, but overpriced."}
{"text":"Tarbell's is the restaurant I go to whenever I'm in Phoenix because the staff is always gracious and a pleasure to be around.  The food is not on par with the finer restaurants but I am rarely disappointed with my selections.  The Scotch beef is an old standby and the home made pasta never fails to disappoint.  Jim Galen gives some excellent wine recommendations so be sure to get his advice on pairings."}
{"text":"Was taken here for my birthday. I didn't pick it, had never been here and will never return.  Service was abysmal and slow. Other tables were served before us and my water glass or those of my dining companions were not refilled once during our time here.  Food was ok but for the price and reputation, we expected much better. There was sand and grit on my scallops. Risotto was salty and gummy.   We skipped dessert.  Words can't begin to describe how horrible this experience was."}
{"text":"Good wine at good prices. Pork tenderloin was excellent. Ribbon pasta w/ sausage was spicy but great if you're into that. Definitely worth a visit. Good mix of people, from 20s to 60s....casually laid back."}
{"text":"I have tried to love this place many times over.  As far as food goes, not on my list but the service is great!!"}
{"text":"Great service an even better staff very knowledgeable.  The setting was very nice along with the decor my food was good an wish I had gotten what my lady ordered but next time.  The only thing I would change is the parking lot is set up ass backwards."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time celebrating my mother's birthday at Tarbells! The food was absolutely delicious and the drinks are just perfection! This will definitely become a tradition for all of us. Thanks to the wait staff, they were lovely!"}
{"text":"I have been there many times, including business dinners. We always seem to get the same waiter with the pony tail. He never disappoints. The food is always consistent, and the restaurant is always packed. I really enjoy going here for good italian food."}
{"text":"Very good service, the staff were very helpful and there for your needs. Great selection of meals prepared by the chef. Good range of scrotch whisky. I would definitely would love to come back. Put this on your list to visit."}
{"text":"Ok, to be fair, I am that rarest of breeds: a vegetarian foodie.   I realize that gives me a lot more challenges at many restaurants, but I have to say I was really disappointed with the food at Tarbell's. I had read all the reviews about how he was an Iron Chef competitor, etc, so perhaps I was expecting too much.  We dined very early, so there was no issue with parking or crowding in the restaurant as many other reviewers had mentioned. We were seated immediately. Server was pleasant and informative as well as prompt. I have no issue at all with the service. In fact it was quite exceptional. It was the food which disappointed.  I asked the server about vegetarian options. There was a seasonal vegetable mixture on the menu and the server convinced me that was the way to go. We discussed a few other options, but I went with his recommendation. When it came to the table the presentation was \"interesting\" but not especially appetizing.   The flavor wasn't disgusting but certainly not great. I ate about a quarter of it. The server asked if I disliked it. I told him it was edible but not great. He instantly offered to replace it with something else. Points to him. I declined a replacement because there really wasn't anything else vegetarian-without-alteration on the menu that evening. I declined having him take the item off the bill as I did eat part of it. Without being asked the server informed me later that he had taken my entree off the bill.   I forget what we had for dessert. That's a bad thing. Dessert should be memorable.   All in all the bread was really good, the rest of the food was only ok, the service was great, ambiance was ok and the price was WAY too high for what we received, even with my $22 veggie-pile entree removed from the bill. I'm not a cheapskate and I am no stranger to a $200 dinner, but it better be a darn good experience for that. Sadly it wasn't. Dinner companion and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food.....FIVE stars Service..FIVE STARS Ambiance..FIVE STARS VALUE.....Five stars  All in all...one of the BEST restaurants in the area...and in my world of dining out.  A double great evening.  Thank you, Keith (Stanley Tucci), for the superlative service.  You rock."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious!!! Great food, great service, great wine. Loved the innovative choices loved every minute we spent at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My meal was ok.  JUST KIDDING. My meal made me wonder what the hell I'd been doing with my life? It also made me miss my grandparents, but that's another story.  This story is about my love of scallops and cheesecake ... and rosemary. If you want to impress me, feed me these things. Seriously, that's all you have to do. Basically, anything with rosemary will make me like you.    Unfortunately (and fortunately), I was on a date during this dining experience. When the cheesecake arrived, I wanted to devour the whole thing, but I had to pretend to be a lady. Apparently, ladies don't shovel dessert into their mouth like a hungry animal ... at least, according to that etiquette school I attended as a child.  I can only eat desserts on dates, otherwise I have no self-control. Oh, little ol' me? Just a bite. Yeah, that's all I want. Just a taste. No, no, I couldn't possibly. Okay, maybe one more. Okay, this is the last bite. What's that? You're looking away for a second? Boom, okay, one more bite won't hurt. Just don't go to the bathroom, okay? I can't be trusted."}
{"text":"We missed what the fuss is all about.  Had heard about the place forever, finally went and had just ok experience.  Wedge salad for $11 bucks?  Sorry, you lost me there...esp when I ordered it without the famous blue cheese and got charged the same anyway.   Nothing fatal about this place, but with all the other great restaurants around Scottsdale, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have to whole heartedly disagree with the other diners here. I think this place is fantastic! We had reservations and did not have to wait at all. The service was prompt and our waiter was attentive, although he could have been a bit friendlier.   We had the spaghetti and meatballs, the pork chop, and the scotch beef. The meatballs were some of the best I've ever tasted and the pork chop was definitely in the top three pork chops I've ever had. The scotch beef was very good too, although it could have been seasoned a bit more. We had the bourbon bread pudding for dessert. Heaven! Absolute heaven!   We will definitely be back every time we are in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"An illusion that somehow falls under the radar posing as quality but in reality falling short of even mediocrity.  I was looking for the perfect spot for us to check out while we were in Phoenix and figured yelp can't be wrong! Almost 5 stars - I was sure this would not disappoint! After all how can 300 reviews be off.  --The AMBIENCE Really nice and appreciated the lighting. Unfortunately there was a table of 4 men near us who were so loud that I could barely hear the person across from my very own table! The crowd skews a lot older - 60+   --The FOOD  Hamachi crudo I saw beautiful pictures of this and instead got mediocrity at best - soggy and sad looking. I would never ever order this again. Least the presentation was semi pleasant to look at.   Warm \"Bacon Candy\" with Frisée, Radicchio, Soft Poached Egg I'm not really sure why you need to sous vide an egg... the dish didn't make much sense to me because you have a lot of salad and just one eggs... it should have been a smaller portion salad, the bacon should have been chopped up and mixed with the salad. Instead you get one bite of egg, spending 5 minutes trying to grapple with cutting the bacon. The flavors make sense just not the final dish! Least there was an attempt here sort of...  Housemade Burrata with McClendon's Farm Tomatoes This is the saddest excuse for a buratta I have ever tried anywhere!! The inside of a buratta is supposed to be creamy and open to up as you cut it! This... was cold and as you open it you get farmers cheese! What the heck is this... we didn't send this back but I stopped eating after one bite - this was a sad excuse for trying to cook!    Octopus ravioli So this came out cold. The dough of the ravioli was disgusting - too thick and cold! I have never sent a dish back in all my years of dining but I was not going to pay almost $40 for cold ravioli!! What a disgrace! It's almost as if someone left them out sitting and the waiter was too busy to get them and like 10 min went by before they were served. They gave us 2 apps to apologize but even the apps were terrible. Also the 2 apps they gave us were shishito peppers that were not charred enough and greasy while the cauliflower app was so dry it was like crackers with random pieces of carrot on top... why??     --ChaChing I cannot believe how pricy this place is and that people actually pay this!! Like why? Is it location? This place is a complete rip off!!  --The LETdown I wouldn't send my worst enemy here! The food was pitiful, the price a joke and it just made no sense. I will never go here again and hope the food gets better. I should have known it was a red flag when they have so many types of cuisine on the menu! Why the heck do you have hummus as a starter? What does that have to do with anything? Get your stuff together! This restaurant has an identity crisis and I hope people start realizing this. I bet this place has regulars that come here often but how can they be so blind to the quality and price they are paying. Please please proceed with caution!  --The SERVICE Our waiter was pretty attentive even though it seemed like he had a lot of people to cover tonight. He was considerate when we had to send a dish back and very flexible. I was a little annoyed that the waiter kept pushing the most expensive dishes repeatedly - don't appreciate that!"}
{"text":"I love how many great restaurants in the Phoenix area are in strip malls. It always makes me giggle.  Atmosphere is nice - it's contemporary and has good energy.  We shared the calamari appetizer, it was great.  Nothing highly unusual, just good calamari.  I had the chicken sausage pasta dish.  It was yummy, but not as good as the scotch beef my parents ordered.  GIven the chef won \"Iron Chef America\" (only challenger that season to beat an Iron Chef) - I expected the food to be a bit more adventurous. It's pretty straightforward - almost comfort food.  Our service was great - the server had been there a long time. She was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is great!!  Im kinda paranoid though about the frequency they touch your food.   im not sure how clean their hands are.  Some organic options, really good tuna."}
{"text":"My man's birthday was Tuesday June 5 of this year. Tarbell's is a favorite for anniversaries and birthdays. On the way in, Mark Tarbell was going in as well. It was great to see his demeanor with guests like us and his happy face.  We ordered the Carpaccio which was amazing as always with the arugula, just enough vinaigrette and that lovely cheese.  For our main course, my man ordered the Lobster Gnocchi, and the Fettucini with Morrell Mushrooms ( Our server Nathan graciously offered to serve half and half)  I ordered the Peppered New York Strip with Au Gratin Potatoes and creamed spinach. I requested Med Rare and MORE on the rare side than medium.  My husbands was delivered and was delicious. My first bite of steak was disappointing as it was overcooked and not so flavorful ( we noted also our plates had sat under the lights awhile before being served) . I poked around and Benjamin the busboy notice. He came over and discreetly asked if something was wrong. I described my overdone steak. Action was taken immediately and a new steak delivered. It was good but not melt in your mouth.....our server after this became surly with us. I really applaud Tarbell's as they did not charge for my meal. We tipped our server on the ENTIRE amount anyway.  It was a good dinner but not what we usually are used to at our wonderful Tarbell restaurant.  We will go back but we expect it to be a lot more top of the line!"}
{"text":"We went to Tarbell's for our anniversary. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we will definitely go back. For the negatives, which are few, I would say it didn't feel as cozy and private as I would like to celebrate an anniversary. Although the restaurant was pretty empty, we were seated in the center of the room close to other diners. I also really appreciate it when dining in a nice restaurant for a special occasion if the restaurant asks when making a reservation and if they at least mention it. Tarbells did not do that. We had the Artichoke Leaves for a starter and I would say they were ok. Nothing special, I probably would not order those again. For the positives, the service was great. The menu was creative and everything seemed appealing on the menu. We ordered the Hand Pulled Mozzarella Salad and Himachi Crudo for starters also. Both were great, the Himachi was amazing! For entrees we ordered the Halibut and the Tars Scotch Beef. That was also amazing. For dessert we had the profiteroles. Definitely would order the Himachi Crudo, both entrees, and the profiteroles again.  We will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm really good at picking out Scottsdale restaurants, I've decided.  Tarbell's uses locally grown organic produce & I like the statement on their menu \"Eat well and often\" -- my sentiments exactly.  Hmm, previous poster found menu uninspired or food bland.  Me, not so much.  I loved the \"organic field greens with wood oven-roasted apples,...goat cheese and golden beets\" for a starter.  I opted to go with a fairly traditional entree of butternut squash ravioli with roasted chestnuts, spinach and brown butter and it was exquisite.  Three of us shared entrees, actually, so I also tasted a wonderful \"Scotch beef with buttermilk mashed and organic broccolini\" and \"barbecue chicken pizza with house-pulled mozzarella and grilled green onions\".  Other menu options included big eye tuna tartare with taro chips and ginger cucumber relish or cornmeal crusted calamari with salsa verde and whole grain mustard sauces for starters.  And a double-cut pork chop with butternut squash-thyme bread pudding...grilled Scottish salmon on a crispy potato cake with molasses lime glaze.. several pizzas...for entrees.  And our sublime dessert was a chocolate cake with house-made ice cream.  Sides included \"maple glazed carrots & cranberries\" and \"Mark's mom's mac & cheese\".  Something for everyone.  Excellent service (they also had a wonderful Reisling by the glass -- hard to come by), streamlined, upscale surroundings -- all in all, a terrific dining experience.  We'd go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I understand the love for this place.  Even though the website is dated I went by the 4.5 yelp average thinking it would knock it out of the park but really everything about this restaurant is dated.  The decor is 20 years out of date, the menu and flavor profiles are out of date.    The food is good but not great, the wine list is a great value.  Service is pretty good as well, but really not much special going on here.    3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a really long time and I came with my mom. Service was really great but they base it on when you finish each course. I had the mussels and calamari for an app. It was really tasty. I had the bolognese which was really meaty. My mom had the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatball is about a size of a huge fist. She cleared the plate and so did I. Cool spot, kinda on the pricy side but overall very good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and certainly worthy of the Iron Chef.  The decor is kool, without trying too hard - and the food is absolutely fabulous.   If you're looking for a full-flavored dish, try the spaghetti and meatballs - they are to die for good.  Made with organic tomatoes and hefty, beefy orbs...delicious."}
{"text":"Just a great local restaurant  -- great food (with nice twists) and exceptionally service"}
{"text":"Tarbell's is ok. The food isn't that good. And the wait staff is fantastic. Tonight, we ordered the best escargot I've ever had. Then our waiter misheard my girlfriend when taking our orders. She and I are both servers, so we were alright with it. I know I've misheard my customers before. The waiter came back with the correct dish. But sadly, it wasn't very good. My halibut was fairly average, but I finished it with no complaints. When we were done we had the brussel sprouts boxed, but not my girlfriend's plate. Seeing this, the server had our ENTIRE meal comped! I never asked for that gesture! Their customer service goes above and beyond!!!"}
{"text":"Tarbell's is an elegant New American restaurant. Attached to a tavern and wine shop, Tarbell's is fun and worth visiting again.  The menu offered almost every protein out there. It also stated that dishes can be made vegetarian or vegan on request. I asked, and the server told me the vegetarian dish of the day was a lentil plate with peas and corn. He used more adjectives than that.  Tarbell's is the kind of restaurant that grills corn and then shaves it onto the plate. The lentil dish was excellent - it felt balanced and healthy.  The mushroom risotto had a strange aftertaste, probably due to the wine used to make it. That didn't stop me from eating every bite. The house-made burrata was out of this world. It made me wonder why I'm not sitting around making burrata and growing tomatoes at home all day. That would be paradise.   I was in and out of there in under an hour. Tarbell's kitchen was quick, and the service was attentive, but that didn't mean they pushed me out. I really appreciated that - there was a great pace that other restaurants lack.   The company was great too - I laughed so hard at one point that I caught hiccups.   The first time I actually left my Bose earbuds on the table because I tend to form small rock piles of personal belongings on white tablecloths. Fortunately, when I called the next day, they had already scooped them and were ready for pickup.   I'm looking forward to the next time I come back, and hopefully it's not because I left personal belongings."}
{"text":"I'm so glad after going to so many terrible restaurants recently that Tarbell is not just hype!  The portions are pretty tiny.. but every bite I tried of every dish was pretty much Italian as good as it gets.  I had the ribbon pasta with sausage and spinach.  Also tried the bolognese.  Also tried the chicken.  The bread pudding I wasn't a huge fan of.    I can't wait to come back - definitely a special occasion restaurant of choice for people who appreciate good food!"}
{"text":"I have been here a half dozen times but realized I hadn't written a review after my last visit. I love Tarbell's, plain and simple. The food here is always spot-on and they have some of the best comfort food selections. The spaghetti and meatballs are so good I have had day dreams about them!  Their mac and cheese is smashing as well, we usually get an order of it for the table to share. I recently got the scottish salmon and it was top-notch. For dessert, their creme brulee is amazing- wow!  It is definitely a treat to eat here!!"}
{"text":"We are totally impressed with this restaurant!  The service is amazing...I look for great service since we eat out often. Every waiter that we have had has been exceptional. The food was prepared perfectly, unique and unusual....a total treat."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I've been to this restaurant probably five times in the past four years, and it has never disappointed. Excellent service (the waiters even helped accommodate (move) me when a lady came in with overly strong perfume -- seriously folks, go easy on the chemical smells).   The food is delicious, and they have been able and willing to meet my dietary restrictions with delicious fare.   And, although the place is great, I've never come dressed better than semi-nice and that is perfectly acceptable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"In our family, we have two birthdays around the holidays, so I had the chance to review two restaurants in two days, both for fine meals. On my son's birthday, the three of us went to Southern Rail, and the next night, to celebrate my wife's birthday we went to Tarbell's. Both were good in the food department. I'm giving Tarbell's a lower rating because of the terrible service we had that night -- and because it compared so terribly with the service we had at Southern Rail the night before. The food was not bad -- in fact, when the owner came by we were enjoying a terrific appetizer of roasted beets and it seemed to indicate a great meal was coming up. But then, things began to deteriorate as the night went on. We had an early reservation (6:30) and things were fine till our waiter had larger tables on either side of us. While this guy was taking care of his larger checks, we were neglected to the point that we never received a birthday treat for my wife (which was absolutely huge at Southern Rail), and to the point where we actually had to get up and flag the guy down to get our bill. Really, just quite poor service. It appears after our Tarbell's experience that any restaurant, even one with good fare, needs to review how the wait staff deals with smaller tables when those guests are sandwiched in between larger groups. [Hey, Mark -- I spent $150, aren't I entitled to a waiter when I need one?] For my money, I'll take Southern Rail. While the environment is not as sophisticated, the large plates of delicious food were simply outstanding and our waiter cared a great deal about ensuring our satisfaction. We hope that on our next visit to Tarbell's we'll receive a bit more attention."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never reviewed Tarbell's, but then realized it has been over 10 years since we last dined here...what were we thinking being gone so long?  We made a reservation for dinner last Saturday night and were coincidentally seated at the same table from 10 years ago (not sure how I remember this trivial detail, but I do).  We started off with a nice glass of wine - mine was an amazing French rose - and an order of the mac 'n cheese (so creamy and delicious)!  For my meal, I thoroughly enjoyed the scottish salmon with a molasses lime glaze over a potato cake and greens and my hubby enjoyed his peppercorn NY strip with a side of brussel sprouts.  I can guarantee we won't wait another 10 years before frequenting Tarbell's again...this place is just so consistently good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely first class!  The service is spectacular. We had Keith as our waiter. He was laid back yet professional. Very friendly and helpful. We started with the homemade burrata, which was amazing. Creamy on the inside and perfect outside. Served with tomatoes and a basil sauce. It all was amazing. Forgot to mention the fried chick peas that they give you when you sit down. I could not get enough of them. Good thing the bowl they came in was small or else I would not have enough room for everything else. Ok for our main dishes we had the homemade ribbon pasta and the bolognese. Both tastey and full of flavor. Be sure to ask for bread so you can absorb the Parmesan broth the pasta comes in. And to end our meal we had the. Lemon curd with fresh berries. It was light and delicious. It didn't make me feel guilty to have dessert when isn't heavy and so filling. All in all it was a wonderful and absolutely scrumptious night. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I truly thought this would be a follow up review. Then I discovered that I never had reviewed one of my favorite neighborhood eats!  Tarbell's is the perfect restaurant for a special location, or if you simply want a bit of joy in your evening.  Menu is varied with appetizer/ side dishes satisfying for a main course also. The carpaccio is the best in the valley, with an original presentation. The waiters allow you to savor a bottle of wine with small pours & frequent attention to the table.   Last night we tried a bacon candy salad. The bacon and radicchio didn't initially appear to match but Beau and I devoured it. Watching the service was impressive as they hustled with completing orders, interacting with the customers or cleaning every component of their area. ( Never will you see a waiter/ bartender checking a phone or texting away. )  Thus, fantastic flavorful dishes. Acoustics pair the happening hum behind the needed intimacy for a conversation. Service is friendly & professional."}
{"text":"My wife's single favorite restaurant. Anywhere.   This place just never disappoints. High quality everything. The sausage & pappardelle is my favorite. We have tried the scotch beef, many fish dishes, the chicken, most of the appetizers, and always leave happy.   Service is always attentive, and in just the right amounts. Mark Tarbell is likely to be running around greeting customers, which is always a nice touch.   Can't imagine anything less than 5 stars from anyone."}
{"text":"This place is superb. Worth every dollar spent.   Went on Christmas Eve and it was packed. Waited about 10 minutes after our reservation time.   Ordered a bottle of wine which they were out of and the waiter suggests  a CHEAPER wine that he thought was just as good. Who does that? That is to be commended! Well, it was very good and a great way to start the meal.  Apps were mussels and about the best beef carpaccio ever. Sauce for the mussels was perfect and they gave us plenty of bread to mop it all up.  Main courses of Steak with Pepper; Scallops and the winner.....Ribbon pasta with chicken sausage. That dish has great flavor and balance.   Dessert is a must. About the best cheesecake I can remember having. It is not your traditional NY style. It is a tall cylinder of extremely light cheese cake with a caramel sauce.   Hope to get to Scottsdale again so I can return for another meal."}
{"text":"I decided to try this Tarbell's after reading all the great reviews and it didn't hurt to hear about the owner winning on Iron Chef. I have to say this was a wonderful meal. I had the Scotch beef and my wife had the salmon, great flavor and quality. The service was very good, our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations on what to order. Very glad that we chose this place while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing food. Tarbell is the man. The steak I had for my birthday dinner was perfect. The Chicken I had the time before was also incredible. They do a great job with wine pairings. The quality of the ingredients and detail to each dish is noticed and greatly appreciated. This is how a restaurant should be. Tarbell sets the standard for what every great restaurant should strive to be."}
{"text":"First visit to very well known Phoenix  eatery. It was real average IMO. Nice ambiance and EXCELLENT service, but you go to a restaurant for food and ours was nothing special at all. The Hamachi crudo starter was creative and tasty, but my Scottish salmon main was dry and had more greens, and less potato crisp on the plate, than it should have. My wife's NY Steak was cooked well, but had no real flavor profile at all. I could have cooked it as well at home, easily. Some slightly over cooked greens and decent fries accompanied the steak. For $38 bucks I think, I expected way more. One other diner had the Halibut Special and reported it was kinda dry and basically uninteresting. Had the Profiterole's for dessert and they were nice. Excellent wine list BTW, but VERY pricey. This is not a place I would rush back to. Sorry........"}
{"text":"Hands down.. Tarbell's is not just a 5..it's a 10! My husband and I love to celebrate life's little joys. It gives us a reason to be foodies and out do each other with who is gonna pick which place in the valley to try next. On this night, we were celebrating the day we started dating and Valentines Day a tad early due to upcoming travel due to work. We both had made reservations here ! Ha! I had never been here, despite that just a few years ago I lived practically next door. I canceled my reservation , we kept his. We arrived and I immediately loved the decor which is what I thought it would be: upscale; classy clientele; white linen table cloths. This place was busy on a Thursday night! My tip: always make a reservation in advance! Our table was in the corner at the window and our server was Nathan. We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir from home and the Crispy Rock Shrimp. It was a super, generous portion of shrimp and was cut into bite sized morsels. The sauce had a bit of a citrusy asian taste to it. We loved this as a starter. I ordered the Scotch Beef for my entree; and the Caesar with Kale and Romaine to go with and for balance. My husband's first choice of entree was Tar's Beef Stroganoff with Gnocchi. He really wanted this , as he is a gnocchi king! Nathan, advised us that he thought they may be out of this entree and what would his second option be , in case? That was a bummer.. and would have been a nice point made at the beginning when Nathan discussed the menu with us. Scott said he would go with the Fish of the Moment, which was a lightly sautéed sea bass. We didn't know what was showing up until it arrived! The salad was divine and very good. I could have made a meal of that alone. It was a generous portion and the kale wasn't too much as sometimes kale can be in salads. The dressing was just enough and not too heavy. The Scotch Beef... OMG.. to die for. It's like a delectable hunk of beef amassed delicious mashed potatoes, a velvety rich gravy and fresh cut green beans. This dish is rich, gluten free, generous in portion and so delicious. I took half of it home! Because it was our 'anniversary' to a degree and I had also let the restaurant know on MY reservation that my husband was celebrating a major milestone with his company, Nathan brought us the Cheesecake with Rosemary Caramel Sauce. I am not really one for cheesecakes , THIS is like NO other cheesecake I had ever had. It's perfect and round.. topped with this amazing, rich, and different caramel sauce with a hint of rosemary.. paired with the perfect Port.. Voila! Perfecto! I can see why Mark Tarbell was the Iron Chef and why this amazing restaurant has all the accolades it does.. ! I can't wait for another reason to go back! Don't forget to grab your popcorn on the way out :--)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars rounded up to 5.  Excellent restaurant.  Had a great meal at Tarbell's.  Ambiance and service were very nice.   Food was truly wonderful.   We had the famous spaghetti (trust me-its a main course) and the special ravioli. Both were very tasty, cooked to perfection and the ingredients and spices just exploded on the palate. Also, prior to that had the beefsteak/'tomato salad, and the house salad.  All greens, fresh, crispy and tasty.   Nice wine list.    Split the bourbon chocolate bread pudding to finish the evening.   Highly recommended for fine dining in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had an outstanding dinner here tonight. Started off with a delicious ginger mojito and some pretty decent bread. I ordered the pepper steak which came with au gratin potatoes and spinach.  The spinach was very good. The steak was amazing - nice thick cut, with plenty of peppercorn and a perfect sear, cooked to a nice medium rare. But the au gratin potatoes literally brought tears to my eyes, they were so good. Easily the best potatoes I've ever had. I don't know what it was about them, but they were absolutely perfect.  It was a big meal, so I decided to skip dessert. But I know I'll be back again before too long."}
{"text":"Had an early Valentine's Day dinner on Sunday.  This is our favorite place in town and the food was wonderful as always, but soup came room-temperature.  They quickly replaced it with steaming-hot bowls, so no harm no foul.   My only real problem is that the service was rushed.  The waiter was friendly, but not very attentive and food came too quickly. (Yes, that is possible for a romantic dinner out!)  Maybe they have spoiled me, but I expect a bit more from this place."}
{"text":"I loved the Muscle starter, amazingly fresh.  Their fresh masseralla salad was very good as well.  I had the pepper steak and my date had the house pasta, just a note on the side they do have a very vegetarian friendly menu.   For desert we have the creme brulee, im not a big desert fan, but it was soooo goood!!! The servise was excellent as well.   over all it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Went to Tarbell's with some coworkers for a dinner meeting. Sat at the bar and ordered a gray goose dirty martini with extra olives. It was very good.  The service was really good and atmosphere was very nice.  I ordered the New York steak, it came out juicy and tender and melted in your mouth. The sides were pricey and very small.  The waiter told us that the sides are big enough for two people, not in my eyes."}
{"text":"Always reliable excellent food. Most recent Visit had the swordfish special and seafood chowder and side of spinach. Fish perfectly cooked, chowder excellent seasoning."}
{"text":"I'm yelping out Tarbells a few months late beause I forgot to do it right after my first visit!   Hubby took me for Valentine's Day this year.  Great little romantic spot.  He tried the spaghetti and meatballs-didn't like it at all.  Felt that the sauce was a little bland and watered down.  I ordered the filet-which came out perfect and melted in my mouth-so good.  The manager came by and asked how our food was-I encouraged hubby to be honest.  He was.  They apologized profusely.  He then ordered the pan roasted chicken-loved it.  They also offered to make me a new meal since it was Valentine's Day and \"i shouldn't have to eat alone.\"  Hubby didn't mind so I kept eating.  Mark Tarbell came by after the chicken came out to make sure it was to hubby's liking.  What do you say to the owner/Iron Chef?  Hell yeah he liked it!  In the end the wonderful manager at Tarbells comp'd our ENTIRE meal-4 glasses of wine, salads, appetizer and meals!  He said he did this since it was Valentines Day and they wanted the night to be perfect for us.  You don't come across such great service everyday."}
{"text":"First time.   Overall it was very good.  Creative and tasty.  I had the peppered strip and I ordered it rare plus, but it came out medium plus. No worries. They made another rare plus steak without a word.  Lastly, they did not charge for either steak. It was on the house without a word or a request.  That was a great sign and it allowed for a larger tip.  The staff were great."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our 15th Wedding Anniversary dinner. We chose the place specifically because of Mark Tarbell's reputation as a chef.  Everybody makes mistakes. It is how you handle them that shows what kind of a person you are. In the restaurant business, it's that attitude that turns a \"we won't be back\" into \"we'll definitely be back!\"  The story:  We arrived for our reservation and were promptly seated. We started with the Kale Chips as a starter, and both quite liked them.  I ordered the scallops and my wife had the halibut special. My wife's was excellent, she was very happy. My scallops were fairly underdone -- cutting into each of them it was clearly raw in the middle. The garnish of pea tendrils and morels was fantastic.  I informed a passing employee (I thought she was a hostess) as our waiter was busy with a large table,  and she agreed with a quite surprised look that they were definitely undercooked.  When I got the plate back, it had been reheated and not refired...I was a little surprised to have them reheated (at $38 a plate) instead of a refire, but they were well cooked now and quite good.  I informed the waiter after I'd finished that the round small potatoes had also been a bit underdone but edible, probably because the garnish was rushed by the undercooked scallops. To be honest, the waiter kind of ignored us a bit after this.  The employee that I'd returned my dinner to came back and apologized again. It turns out she was a manager, and she informed us that she was comping my dinner, as well as two deserts of our choice.  The deserts, by the way, were outstanding! My wife had the creampuffs and I had vanillabean cheesecake with a very unique and tasty rosemary caramel sauce.  After dinner, the owner and Chef, Mark Tarbell came by. He said that mistakes didn't happen often, but that he wanted to make sure it was properly resolved, and he apologized and specifically thanked me for bringing a mistake to his attention.  I said that it had, and I was happy, and my wife specifically told Chef Tarbell how pleased she was with manager's response and attitude.  We'll definitely be back to Tarbell's both because of the food (which was excellent, and that they fixed the error quickly) and the customer service!"}
{"text":"There are so many great restaurants in Central Phoenix, that I expect good food when I go to a place like Tarbell's!  This was our first time there and we were celebrating our 24th anniversary with another couple. We definitely made the right choice for our celebration.  We had a couple of cocktails before we came to the restaurant, and we were in a festive mood. Our waiter, Nathan, picked up on the vibe right away, and was a great sport, as well as a great server. We were in the mood to try different items, and he was very accommodating. We started with the Candied Bacon, and we all split a Beet salad (they split it and it came out beautifully presented).  Dinner was more of the same. We each had an entree, and it was hard to decide what to order. Nathan actually brought two sample bowls of food we didn't order, just for us to try, since we had struggled in choosing. The mussels and the scallops were crazy good! The mussels were the creamiest I may have ever eaten, and a terrific size! The squid ink pasta and gnocchi were both made in house and were terrific!  The spaghetti and meatballs should be labeled, \"huge delicious meatball (1) and spaghetti.\"  Again, it was awesome. The meatball was made from multiple meats, was fresh from the oven, and had a taste that was terrific.  The wine list is plentiful and provides a great deal of variety, but doesn't feel overwhelming.  We chose a couple of mid priced blends, that they priced at reasonable restaurant rates.  The food, along with Nathan's great service made this a night to remember."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here.  If you order the mussels for a starter, be prepared...  they bring enough to feed 4 people.  The wine sauce with the mussels was the best I've had. My only complaint, there was no bucket.  You have to shell on your appetizer plate.  I had a beef dish that was marinated in brandy or some liquor.  Delicious.  My wife had Mahi and she loved it.  The service is 5-star.  Wine list is insane and they have a lot of wines by glass.  They also have a great selection of rare drinks like buddhahand vodka.  Lastly, I'm always a big fan of complimentary valet parking."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Started with the crudo and sashito peppers, both were great. Had the salmon for my entree. Always good. I'm not even a huge salmon fan and would totally order it,again.  Finished with the bread pudding and a shot of 20 year pappy van winkle (we got the last 2 shots and the bottle). No better way to finish a meal.  Will be back, soon hopefully."}
{"text":"Our son took the family to Tarbell's for his 35th birthday celebration!!!! Wow, were we spoiled by the staff at Tarbell's. Nathan especially is very attentive, courteous and thoughtful without being overbearing!!!! Appetizers: the raised chickpeas are amazing. The Octopus is divine. Tender and perfectly grilled. The burrata is awesome! We were five of us. The cocktails were divine, the wine selection by Nathan was superb! The halibut, gnocchi are out of this world. Oh and the scallops are like none other. The desserts are worth living for!!!! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"TarBlows!!!! I am not sure who is giving rave reviews of this restaurant but either they are friends with with Mark or simply do not know food?? My wife and I had reservations for 8pm and when we arrived, the manager tried to sit us at a bar high top. Are you kidding me?  With a reservation its simply standard to provide a table in the main dining area and not at the bar.  They did clear a table that had left and upon seating provided us with bread.  The bread obviously was store bought (my guess LaBrea) and had been sitting in a basket under the heat lamp.  Wife ordered his \"famous\" spaghetti and meatballs. While the meatballs were very good, the sauce was absolutely deplorable. I believe they use the pan drippings as the marinara sauce as it was extremely greasy, no taste and just simply a mess. I ordered the seafood chowder which at $25 is anything but seafood.  All they do is add a ton of butter and cream, sprinkle 4 mussels, and honestly tiny \"bits\" of seafood of salmon with corn, onion and that's about it.  Pathetic.  I have had much better at whole foods take out than that. Service was satisfactory nothing to write home about but not bad either. In conclusion, this establishment should be ashamed at the food they put out as there is simply \"no care\" about there product.    Keep to wine Mark, that's something you at least know little about!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. I couldn't ask for a better experience. Everything from my Old Fashion to the bread basket, entrees and birthday dessert was excellent. Service was top notch. There is a reason Tarbell's has been around so long and he has a name in Phoenix. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Where in the world do you get purple kale?!! I love kale and having to say that I love love love the purple kale.  It's so good that I didn't even need the dressing.  I wish it would come in a big bowl, because I can eat it all day long.   \"The earth's best\" was AMAZING!!  For people are not vegetarian they would want to be after this plate.   All the different mix of vegetable were perfectly contrast each other."}
{"text":"Tarbell's exceeded my high expectations! ...warm greeting...attention to detail (remembered to greet tha bf Happy Birthday from the phone message I had left for our rsvp the day prior)...our steaks cooked to perfection (I had medium rare, and he had medium)...flavorful and GENEROUS portions of sides THAT CAME ALONG WITH THE MEAL (creamed spinach AND YUMMY potatoes au grautin). All the pinky up restaurants that we've been frequenting make ya order the sides separately, so this was a welcomed, awesome surprise! They even presented tha bf with a complimentary creme brulee bday prez. We shall be back!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here.  It is a cute little restaurant with amazing Martini's!  Service is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Love-hate relationship with this restaurant.  Over the years we stopped going here because of the terrible noise level.  The food has been quite good and that hasn't changed.  The salmon was excellent but the special \"sole\" was not.  Felt like I made a mistake.  We live nearby and had hoped that things had changed but the noise is even worse.  May be a good place to avoid on a Saturday night.  At these prices, it would have been nice for a party of 4 to be able to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"The place exemplifies the casual elegance that Phoenix is renowned for.  This is the type of place you eat at before a night at the symphony.  The food, the service, and the atmosphere are all excellent."}
{"text":"*My 200th Review* Tarbell's, you were a dream come true!  This is what 5 stars is to me- The very best service. Every staff member was professional, personable, well groomed, prompt, and smiled often!  The restaurant itself was simple and elegant. Definitely a place I would recommend for a date or special occasion or anytime you want to be fancy!   The crowd was mostly retirees, but I took that as a sign that I was in the right place.  The other diners were very dapper and able bodied and seemed to clearly enjoy the finer things in life.   The food. Mmmmmm yes!! I had the scallops, and they were the best I've ever had. It came with a potato cake and seasonal vegetables, each bite equally delicious. The salmon was also excellent and grilled to perfection. Even the grill marks were absolutely perfect, which I admire because I can not do that myself! It was accompanied by mixed greens with an amazing honey glaze dressing, and potatoes another way- similar to shoe string pik nik sticks but much fancier and salty and mouth watering. We shared the caramel cheesecake for dessert, and that was probably the low point of the meal. Kidding!! Omg, I rarely eat dessert and this was worth.every.calorie!! Perfection! Not to sweet, not too dense, not too light, so full of flavor! The caramel sauce! My, my! I really can't wait to go back. I am very curious about the spaghetti and meatballs! And the profiteroles! I want to try the whole menu, each time it changes!  Thank you Tarbell's, for making my 30th birthday dinner amazing!  Edit: I received a warm phone call from Ty 2 days after dining to inquire how my experience was. I can't say that has ever happened before even at other fine establishments. Very classy. Thanks Ty!"}
{"text":"What can I say. This place is amazing. The food is consistently good. The service is impeccable. I go there for special occasions and nights out with my husband. We also take out of town guests here. Always a treat."}
{"text":"This is truly one of the best, most consistent high-end restaurants in Phoenix. Reservations can be challenging even though its been around for years, has no view, parking is tight and is located in a strip mall. It's that good. The food is fresh, and perfectly prepared -- every time. Service is attentive. Mr. Tarbell may stop by your table and help with menu suggestions. The ribbon pasta is a signature dish with house made pasta. The strip steak is fabulous. The fish of the moment is always great. The \"beyond prime\" beef carpaccio  is exotic, rich and tasty as an appetizer. The wine list is off the charts with bottles ranging from about $50 to $5,000. I was there once as a guest on an expense account dinner and the $2,500 bottles were poured. It was fun to watch and Tarbell's is a place that knows how to handle big spenders. For dessert, the creme brûlée is my favorite. I probably go there once a month and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"After reading all the fantastic reviews on yelp, my husband and I to go to Tarbells to celebrate our first anniversary. We had made reservations, and were seated right away. The service was as good as it gets. And the food, was amazing. My husband ordered salmon, and I had the pan roasted chicken. Both were amazing. I never knew chicken could taste so good. For dessert, we split a piece of warm chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  When the dessert arrived, \"Happy Anniversay\" had been written across the rim of the plate, in chocolate. It was such a nice touch. Overall it was a fantastic dinner at a reasonable price. We will definitely go back to Tarbells."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I explore a new restaurant every week and this has definitely made the return list. (ASAP). It's hard to beat home cooking. We are quite the \"foodies\" according to our waiter. Props to him for picking up on this within five minutes of serving us. Not only was the service amazing the manager was hands on at every table. (Helping with serving food, seating guests, approaching every table, and greeting guests). Which by the way is how it should be... Food was absolutely cooked to perfection. Mussels were tied for my favorite only compared to another dish of them compared a completely different way. Can't wait to return. Very soon"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Tarbell's for awhile now, since it's such a greatly reviewed local restaurant, and because head chef Mark Tarbell also won Iron Chef America, when he battled Cat Cora with the secret ingredient of apple. (His winning dessert from the show is on the menu.)  I'm disappointed I wasn't completely wowed by the place, but the friendly and knowledgeable staff was definitely appreciated.  The restaurant's decor isn't particularly stunning. The tables do have linens on them, but the atmosphere was pretty plain, save for a few brightly colored paintings. The view outside is of a parking lot, so while the restaurant looks cool from the outside with its window walls, it's not fun to look at cars on cement while you're eating.  The crowd skewed older, middle-age and above. Besides a couple kids with families, I might have been the youngest person dining there, which seemed sort of weird. It's definitely a place I'd rather go when I'm middle-aged and have savings to spend, rather than head there now.  Food-wise, I was impressed with the abundance of locally grown ingredients. That's a really great thing to have in a restaurant, so it was really respectable, but the food just wasn't spectacular like I had hoped.  The salad I started with, Maya's Field Greens ($9), had fennel, carrots and an amazing carrot vinaigrette (I left the beets off my salad.) It was really heavy on the greens (I sort of felt like a rabbit as I ate it), but because they tasted so fresh, it made up for the lack of diversity in the salad. And the dressing was so delicious, I would prefer it over ranch-and that's a big deal for me.  For my entree, I had housemade fettuccine, with a spinach pesto sauce, squash, caramelized onions and goat cheese ($19). While the sauce was great, and I really enjoyed the goat cheese flavor, I wasn't as enthused with the consistency of the pasta. The strips were so thin, it almost melted together. It was difficult to twirl on my fork and a little messy to eat. I did like the combination of so many flavors, though.  We also had crispy chickpeas ($4), which were very interesting. I prefer regular chickpeas to these crispy ones, but they were seasoned well with parmesan, olive oil and parsley and tasted even better when I added them to my pasta. I just wouldn't order them to eat them alone again.  My favorite part of the meal, besides the tasty bottle of red wine we had from the massive wine list, was the dessert. We had chocolate mousse ($9), which was thick and creamy and topped with tasty whipped cream.  The dessert wasn't enough to make me want to come back any time soon. I feel like I could get better farm-to-table food at chicer places for less money (see St. Francis). Maybe I'll try Tarbell's out again, but it probably won't be until I'm way older."}
{"text":"We loved it - busy, loud, not so romantic, but Mark was kind enough to introduce himself and create an entrée tasting of 4 meals for us.  Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sis and b-I-l were passing through town on a short vacation. Searched Yelp for a great place for food and conversation. Tarbell's was the right choice.  We started off sharing a bacon soft boiled egg appetizer which was quickly devoured. Three of our party chose to order scallops and I was the odd person out and ordered Mr Fish of the day. I was served a delicious portion of halibut. All dinners were served with a corn couscous and mixed vegetables. Hubby declared his dish the best scallops he has ever eaten. For a man who thinks \"it was okay\" is high praise saying the best ever is momentous. I expected the heavens to open up or the earth to shake!  We each ordered a different dessert: vanilla cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce, chocolate molten cake with salted caramel sauce, crème brulee, and chocolate mousse. No one shared their dessert. They were that good!  We arrived just as the restaurant opened. Our server, Nathan, greeted us and we knew he was going to be a \"good fit\" with our party. He was as attentive to our table as he was personable. Nathan wasn't afraid to give recommendations and he was spot on. There were two young gentlemen assisting Nathan who were cheery and helpful. A great server is a key part of a great experience and Tarbell's knocked out of the park with these three.  All in all we were the table that enjoyed their food, appreciated their server, and probably laughed a little too often and a little too loud.  Our tab for appetizer, two rounds of drinks, entrees and dessert came to $290 with tax and before tip.   A great dining experience that I recommend you try."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and haven't been in over 3 years. Still as delicious as I remember and classics are still on the menu. Started the night with the Uptown, a great drink if you like Whiskey. I was impressed by how quickly after we ordered that our appetizers came out. The Caesar salad was delicious but typical of what you would expect, which is exactly what I wanted. My husband had the carpaccio which was plated amazingly and tasted delicious.  For the main course I had the pan-roasted chicken, the skin had the perfect crisp yet the chicken was so moist. I would highly recommend ordering it. My husband had the Mr. Fish which last night happened to be halibut, it was served with the best tasting hummus I have ever have. To finish the night we had both the warm chocolate cake and the apple pie. Both these desserts were wonderful. The ambiance is nice and was romantic in a booth. The staff were very attentive and really took great care of us. Tarbell's is a great Arizona restaurant that never changes which is why we love coming back there."}
{"text":"This is the finest restaurant in Arizona!  Mark the Chef and Owner is very personable and friendly.  The food and wine selections are amazing!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I can only give 3 stars. The meal started off great. The mussels were very good! The wine tasted as though it had been open for a bit too long. Either that or they poured cheap wine in place of the menu advertisements. Ordered the Special...Sole. Honestly Sole is not a five star restaurant fish but figured I'd give it a try...bust. The hubby ordered scallops and they were very unimpressive as well."}
{"text":"One of the best date night dinners we have had. The ambiance and attention to detail was truly special. The staff is experienced and well-trained. We always had service when we needed it but it was not over-bearing. The food was great. The steak was perfectly cooked, even for my medium-well taste. The onion strings are a hearty portion and great for sharing as an appetizer. We recommend Tarbell's to our friends and will go back again."}
{"text":"This review is just for dessert only. I was in town checking out Phoenix, we had dinner elsewhere and then we were craving a fancy dessert. Tarbells was the only place I could find that served creme brulee, so that's how we ended up here. The staff was very nice and attentive even though we were only having dessert.   I got the cheesecake with caramel sauce and my husband got the creme brulee served with fresh berries. Both of the desserts were amazingly delicious! The cheesecake was one of the best I have ever had, my husband who just wanted creme brulee was addicted to the cheesecake by the end. It was a very generous portion served in a fun cylinder shape, and it was so rich and smooth I couldn't quite finish all of it which makes me a little sad. The creme brulee was also really good, crispy on top and creamy underneath, lots of delicious berries as well."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just me but the food just didn't do it for me last night.  First the positives--the place is just the right combination of chic and casual at the same time.  Our waiter couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  I remember loving this place a few years ago but I just didn't think the cuisine was very good this time and I know it has an excellent reputation.  My daughter had the popcorn shrimp but the sauce was a tad pasty.  I had the burrata and tomatoes but the burrata was just too runny.  I know burrata is supposed to be a bit runny but this was too mushy as were the tomatoes.  The biggest disappointment for me was the sole and the NY Strip.  The meat was tough and not flavorful and the fish tasted more like sea bass than sole.  I know this is a harsh review but there is no way to I could put this cuisine in the same category as The Mission, Elements, Roka Akor or Cafe Monarch.  This is not a contemptuous restaurant but I just wish I had loved the food more."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time earlier tonight after I did a Google search for romantic restaurants in the Phoenix area and it brought up this Yelp page. Being a 'simple' man, I don't care for most of the high-end restaurants that serve things I can't even pronounce, let alone have any interest in eating. So, a few of the things that attracted me to Tarbell's were that it's centrally located (most fine dining establishments are in Scottsdale) and seeing familiar food on the menu I would enjoy.  I made reservations (to celebrate our anniversary and my wife's birthday.) Upon arriving, there was no available place to self-park, so I used the complimentary valet service. We were seated immediately upon arrival and, for a Saturday night, the place was not as busy as I expected it to be.  I like that there is a TV showing sports over the bar area. Its situated so that those in the dining area don't really see the single TV - but its right there for those at the bar.   They started by serving us four warm mini French breads (each the size of a dinner roll, about the three slices each) with a ramekin of olive oil along with two glasses of ice water.  We ordered the mac and cheese as a starter and my wife got the pan-roasted chicken and I ordered the Margherita pizza. As you could guess, we aren't adventurous eaters and pan-roasted chicken is a simple and 'safe' dish. My wife enjoyed it, and it looked perfectly cooked. My Margherita pizza was amazing. I've eaten at places known for the their pizza and Tarbell's (who I didn't even know offered pizza until today) makes one of the best pizza's I've ever tasted! A flat-bread style crust, hand made mozzarella, fresh, full, un-cut basil leaves (the biggest and most flavorful basil I've ever tasted) and the pizza sauce was too good for words. I find most pizza makers use too much sugar or too much salt in their sauce. I am happy to report that Tarbell's pizza sauce tastes almost bitter by comparison. Its very hard to describe, but being a person who loves pizza, if I opened my own restaurant, this is the pizza I would make and serve! Even the cooking was perfect. A slight singe of burn along just the far edges of the crust!   Mac and cheese was also VERY good!  For dessert, I had the creme brule and my wife had the vanilla cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce. A little bit of rosemary can go a long way, so my wife was concerned that the rosemary may be over-powering and the waiter offered to bring the cheesecake with the sauce on the side. Turns out, the sauce was just fine, but the cheesecake was very, very rich! Just a few bites and took the rest home for a few bites later! The creme brule' is served cold. This is the second restaurant that I've been to that does this. Only the top of the creme brule' is warm and the center is chilled. The best creme brule' I've ever had was on the 93rd floor of the Hancock Building in Chicago. There is a restaurant there (name eludes me at the moment) and I had a vanilla bean creme brule', served HOT, and it blew my mind! The creme brule' at Tarbell's seemed a little basic compared to everything else. It was good, but then I've never really had a *bad* creme brule', either.  It seems a lot of other reviewers were greeted by the owner. We did not see the owner around, but it would have been cool to meet him. Maybe next time...  They seem to employ a lot of people. They all dress in black and a couple of big guys just looked over the dining area, like they were the Secret Service or something! It was odd to feel like bodyguards are watching over you, but then when I got up to view some pictures on the wall of the owner with famous people, I rested my napkin on the table. When I returned, my napkin was neatly folded! When my Coke ran dry, within a minute or two, a waitress arrived with another! Fantastic service! I was concerned at first because the soda glasses are tall and thin, and when filled with ice, doesn't leave much room for soda. That means constantly running out, trying to find the waiter and have anxiety thinking about it. Not here!!! Everything is taken care of for you. I also like that the wait staff are not over-bearing - like when we ate at Fleming's Steakhouse and the darn wait staff would constantly be scraping our table with a crumb-scraper thing. It's just stupid and annoying. They don't do that here!!! Thank goodness!!  My wife had a glass of wine with dinner and I had a Coke. Our total, with tax, was $86 +$15 tip plus $3 tip for the valet when picking up the car. One of the best investments I've ever made in my relationship!"}
{"text":"We always pick somewhere fancy and a little pricey for Christmas Eve dinner, and we picked Tarbell's last year.  As someone else mentioned, it isn't the most cozy place (read: romantic), but it was certainly nice.  The only reason I didn't given it 5 stars is because we have gone other places that were even nicer, with outstanding service (Tarbell's service was great, just not impeccable which is what we were looking for that night). The food was great.  We ordered the mussels and expected a bowl with a dozen in them to share- NOPE!  We EACH had a dozen mussels...almost unable to eat them all and dinner!   The place was busy, mostly an older quieter crowd which was nice, until a trio of young Scottsdale-ians walked in.  Boo. Valet was super easy, food was great.  Would go back for a nice dinner, just not for our nice Christmas Eve dinner."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, I feel that I am transported to a restaurant in a different city.  The meals here are delicious but the quality over the years appears to have diminished somewhat.  My favorite is still the creamed corn, no matter what I order off the menu, I always get a side of creamed corn.  The rest of the menu is solid.  I tend to bring clients and out of town guests here.  For my day to day cravings, the meals are a little too heavy but for an occassional treat its not a bad bet."}
{"text":"Alright, so I went to this place with very high hopes. Yelpers raving about it, the place has all these awards, magazines are talking about it, there's an iron chef challenger/winner here, etc etc. With all the hype, I was a bit cautious, but still expecting to get my socks completely blown off. Was it a disappointment? I wouldn't go that far, the place is good. Service is awesome, food is high quality. But, it just isn't as great as what people will want you to think.   Like most of my foodie adventures with friends, we all had a cocktail. They were all good, and we sampled a large selection. I don't think anything from this bar would disappoint.   For food, we started with the crispy white beans. Very different, and that's why we got them. I still don't have a solid opinion on them, but they're strangely addicting. Salty, oily, cheesy, thyme-y. Give 'em a try, at least you can say you did. We also had the onion straws with Tarbell's \"Secret Sauce.\" These are good, I'd recommend them for a group appetizer, but just nothing that spectacular.  For the entree, obviously I had to try the scotch beef. This was pretty good. The gravy was amazing. The beef itself, though, is just a roast. I've had the same thing a thousand times at home. My mom could rival Mr. Tarbell's famous scotch beef anyday with a slow cooked roast, and she's no iron chef. Still, it was good and I would get it again. Tender, juicy, flavorful. The potatoes it sat on were good, too, but really the special part is the gravy.  Others at the table had salmon and the house ribbon pasta. Salmon was good, nothing out of this world. The pasta was also not super impressive, just nice, good quality food.  We couldn't resist dessert and got the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. This was truly awesome. Creme brulee was also really quite good.   This review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the service and the atmosphere. This place really does a good job taking care of people. The server we had was amazing and all of the staff was super attentive. They know the menu, give good suggestions, and truly make you feel like a guest. This goes a long way nowadays in restaurants and in my opinion this alone gives them an extra star.  Speaking of stars, this place is really good. In no way does it deserve a 5-star review. 4 stars, sure, but they aren't getting it on food alone."}
{"text":"I first experienced Tarbell's back in 2005 and wanted to come back this year to see if it maintained its high quality of food and service. Tarbell's did not disappoint.   Tarbell offered a wide selection of wines and we got what we wanted. I had the iron cast steak which was delicious. I think I'd the pork chops back in 2005 and suggested one of my buddies to order it. I was fortunate enough to had a piece at medium rare and it was great! My two other friends had the ribeye and fish and both were up to par.   Tarbell's is one of my favorite restaurants in the greater Phoenix area. I will definitely come back here. I also thought the prices were fair. The service was also exceptional. No complaints here."}
{"text":"It's a great date place.   The food is good and the chocolate cake is ridiculously good.    I've been twice. Great service everytime.   They have a small room for larger parties and with 8 people it was very, very tight, but I will definitely return!   Parking is a real challenge on a weekend night -- get the valet."}
{"text":"Always solid. Go see Mikey and Nicole at the bar. Great cocktail selections and stellar wine list. Service is always prompt and professional. The Tavern next door is great too for a more casual choice."}
{"text":"Went there with friends the other evening.  They LOVE this place.   He had made reservations for a table next to a window.  For a Wednesday, I was surprised to see it was FULL.   And it was NOISY.   I had a hard time hearing her and vice versa.  He pondered the wine list and selected a fine bottle of chardonnay.   I have no idea what it was, but it was a good choice.   I had the squid ink angel hair with calamari, and she had the Seasonal Chowda, which is advertised to be chock full of fish Tikka Masala, saffron, jasmine rice.     I do not like the flavoring of turmeric; therefore, was glad I did not order it.   I did taste her order, however, and I suppose, if I like turmeric, I'd like it.     My dish, however, was good, albeit the pasta was cooked more than I would have liked.  It was stuck together, and I had to separate it with another utensil, but the flavoring was exquisite.   I liked the calamari.    I was stuffed, but we decided to share a dessert; therefore, we ordered the Profiteroles with Vanilla Gelato and Warm Ganache. YUMMM!!!   When served, it appeared in the shape of two cream puffs with a light covering of chocolate.   The gelato definitely cut any too sweetness there could have been.   It was good.  Well worth it.    This restaurant has been in the valley FOREVER!!   They are regulars.   Mark Tarbell, the owner, came in at the time we were waiting for our table.   A very cordial, friendly man.   Made a point of saying HI to his customers.   Would I return?   Yes, of course.   I liked what I had.    Size:  4 KB"}
{"text":"Fabulously lively ambiance and deliciously satiating cuisine. Love the team of waiters and busboys and that Mark Tarbell is often around, saying hello and checking in with his patrons. Even the hostesses are friendly. Just a wonderful restaurant on so many different levels."}
{"text":"Excellent service and very delicious food!!   I came here with clients while I was in Arizona for business and absolutely loved this restaurant. Our waiter was so kind and accommodating! We had 2 guests that were vegan and gluten free and our waiter did everything he could to make sure there was plenty of food for everyone! Great Italian restaurant and am looking forward to coming back next year!"}
{"text":"Tarbell's is top notch in all areas!  Food quality, service, ambience, amazing!  I recently took ten business associates there for a meeting, and I got nothing but compliments the next day on such an excellent choice of restaurant!    Definitely try the Spaghetti & Meatballs as well as the Mac N Cheese, and even the Pizzas are to die for.  And the burger too!  You really cant go wrong here.  Warning the deserts here are HUGE (yet amazing).  One desert is enough for 2-3 people!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic in terms of food and service. Wait staff is what you would expect of a place like this and the menu, while expensive, is fairly priced in my opinion. The mussels appetizer ($18) was on point and the remaining broth made for great dipping with the bread. I had the halibut special ($36) which including a surprising good portion of fish. My girlfriend had the braised beef dish ($32) which was also very good, but very rich. Next time I would like to try the lobster and gnocchi.  Wine is the most expensive drink on the menu with $12/glass being the floor. Cocktails are between $10 and $13 while the beer selection is strong and fairly priced. I had a $6 Stone IPA."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Tarbell's was fantastic. This most recent time was a disappointment. The wine was good, and so was my meatball pizza. Mom's seafood chowder sounded like it would be full of mussels and there were hardly any. Dad got the spaghetti and meatballs and he compared it to Chef Boyardee. The chocolate mousse was outstanding but the ice cream in the profiteroles was gelatinous. Also, in our reservation, I left a note to the maître d' that obviously wasn't passed along to our server. She did a great job, but it was disappointing that we had to fill her in."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining with two lovely ladies this past Tuesday evening. We were coming here for Restaurant week, but ended up ordering straight off the menu. From start to finish, the service was outstanding. Our hostess greeted us with the biggest smile ever, our waitress was so very knowledgeable and I took her recommendation from my glass of wine ( Ancient Peaks Cab) to dinner (Grilled Organic Salmon on Crispy Potato Cake molasses, lime, McClendon's honey) to dessert (The \"Beloved\" Chocolate Mousse Featuring Guittard Chocolate) OMG! everything was amazing. The table even shared the Mac and Cheese made with Vermont Cheddar. I am telling you, if I was at home by myself, I would have licked the bowl. Same for the Chocolate Mousse. (still shaking my head it was so good)  Will I be back, absolutely! It really was a great experience from start to finish!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant and we had a nice evening here. I had the beef carpaccio for my meal (it's pretty large) and my friends had the salmon and the ribbon pasta. Overall my friends though the meal was just ok and our server wasn't on top of things. He asked if we wanted bread but then forgot to bring it, was slow on drink refills, etc. He also didn't alert my friends who ordered the salmon that it was served on top of a ton of greens so they each ordered salads to start. He ended up bringing us a Vanilla Cheesecake on the house and it was AMAZING! Best part of the night!"}
{"text":"Great food.  We had the chicken and mashed potatoes And the salmon on crisp potato pancake.  Both were excellent. Service and drinks were very good.  The only disappointment was that we asked for extra sauce for the mashed potatoes and found a $4.00 surcharge on the bill.  This was reversed when I complained"}
{"text":"\"Great place for dining solo!\"  \"Incredible food!\"  \"Friendly staff!\"  \"My go-to restaurant on the Camelback corridor.\"  All of these are things that I've heard about Tarbell's time and time again over the years.  So, of course I had high expectations going in.  So when my friends Jared and Jane B suggested we do a double date at Tarbell's during the recent AZ Restaurant Week, I was totally game.  Upon walking into Tarbell's, the hostess was incredibly friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was warm and inviting while still being casual; my kind of place!  Nathan was our waiter and he was awesome.  He was patient with both my husband and our friend Jared as they went back and forth on what they wanted to order quite a few times.  He suggested a great bottle of wine for us also.  I was the only one at the table who didn't order off of the restaurant week menu.  I went with a Caesar salad to start, the Salmon entree, and carrot cake for dessert.  I enjoyed the Caesar salad despite the lack of anchovies (I happen to love anchovies).  The salmon was a huge hit -- I think everyone at the table had order envy over it -- but I did share!  It was grilled to perfection, topped with a local molasses/lime/honey glaze and served on a crispy potato cake.  The carrot cake was good but not amazing.  The restaurant week menu that everyone else ordered from had only one starter option: the pulled mozzarella.  However, I guess they ran out of it the night that we were there, so the manager came over and offered to substitute with other salad options.  This was a huge perk for everyone and much appreciated by our group.  Two people at our table had the Bolognese, but they said it was bland.  They were pleased with the other desserts (donuts and chocolate mousse).  While I wasn't completely enamored with everything, our overall Tarbell's experience was a good one, and I definitely want to return to try more menu items in the future.  Double date or biz dinner, anyone?  Let me know!"}
{"text":"Everything I ate was slightly better than I expected. The pepper-crusted steak was better than steaks I have had at MANY steakhouse in the valley."}
{"text":"Tarbell's is a Phoenix legend on Camelback.  We joined an out of town couple for a friend's dinner.  Friend remarked that it was the best meal she had experienced in Phoenix. As they are annual snowbirds, that's quite some compliment!  Service was extraordinary and attentive without being overbearing.  You can't go wrong with Tarbell's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our Anniversary dinner the other night. The food was delicious! I had the NY Steak with fries. The streak was cooked perfect and the fries were out of this world. I could have eaten a whole plate full of just fries. My husband had the spaghetti and meatball. The meatball was as big as a softball! I got to taste a little bit and it also very good. We would definitely recommend this place. My only complaint is it was a little loud and it was sometimes hard to hear each other."}
{"text":"My favorite Restaurant in Phoenix by far, I keep searching for better, but who knows why!  Dishes that separate Tarbell's from others:   Soups to die for  Caesar the way it was meant to taste  Pommes Frites as heavenly as any in Paris or                                       Brussels  Sliders to crave many days after  Scotch Beef I continue to dream about  Pan Roasted chicken - I NEVER order chicken in a                                       Restaurant, except here  Mac & Cheese good enough for dessert  If this isn't FIVE STAR in Phoenix, I can't imagine what is, but I want to go there!"}
{"text":"After tasting multiple reds, I went with the Pinot Grigio from Italy. It has very nice mineralogy and isn't super sweet. We started out with the beat salad, which was excellent with yellow beats and arugula."}
{"text":"We had never been to Tarbell's before, and decided it was the place to grab an early Mother's Day dinner. The service is impeccable, and you will feel tended to throughout your visit.  I enjoyed my grilled romaine salad, and the roasted chicken was wonderful. I'd read on Yelp that they would let you order half portions, which allowed me to get half a salad, as well as half of the chicken paired with half of the ribbon pasta. Yes, that was far too much food for me, but I was able to try a variety of things, and had leftovers for tomorrow. I appreciate that Tarbell's offers this option for portions. I shared the cheesecake for dessert, and it was wonderful. If the description of rosemary in the caramel sauce freaks you out, don't worry. It really is just a hint of the herb.  **I almost dropped a star off my review because of the owner, but decided that the food and service are what matters. He was making his way to all of the tables, yet pointedly skipped ours. The logical assumption is that he was very busy. But when he first came through, we were one of three occupied tables. As the room filled, he made it to every table  but ours. As we stood up to walk out, he made eye contact with me. No smile, no \"thanks for coming\"- he just  turned away. It was hard not to feel completely slighted."}
{"text":"Great find for us as we were on PHX for the first time.  Best mussels that I have ever had.  Tremendous food.  Candied Bacon Salad was excellent.  Scotch Beef was tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary as it was one of the top 10 Zagat rated spots a few years ago.  While the food quality did meet the price mark, I was sort of disappointed with the Ravioli and Oysters. We got a 1 foot long dish with 3 oysters on it. 3 is not divisible by two. So, they could add one more and make everyone happy.  However, the cocktails and the wine selection were good and the food was definitely savory. Service was great as well. Come well dressed or you will look bad."}
{"text":"This is a new Phoenix favorite for us...from the lively bar area, to the stand-out food, to the attentive service.  I was thoroughly impressed and we'll definitely be back!  There's valet parking but you really don't need to bother.  The plaza lot out front has ample parking and you're just steps from the entrance."}
{"text":"Like many of the reviewers here have noted, I had pretty high expectations before we ever sat down at our table on Friday night.  I had heard of this place as a foodie-favorite and I love supporting a local celeb-worthy chef.  After a great cocktail at the bar (LOVE the atmosphere including the open kitchen -- very warm space with high energy), we sat and enjoyed the mussel app.  The size of this appetizer was disarmingly huge!  When the server brought out two large bowls, I was so confused that I asked if he had put in an order for each of us; the server kindly explained that it was just one order that he split for us (WOW).  I did not finish the app, partially because it was so huge and partially because it wasn't life-altering and I wanted to hold out for better flavors to come.  I ordered the fish special (can't remember the fish name now, but it was a sea-bass like white fish) and my date ordered the peppersteak.  We did some splitting and switching on our entrees, and honestly...they were good -- totally solid.  ....but I felt bad for having such high expectations.  Solid wasn't what I was expecting...I was expecting impressive, surprising, can't-get-enough.  Overall I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was good; I wouldn't hesitate to go here for a business dinner or accept an invitation to go, but I won't be picking it in the near future.  Because I wanted to like it so much, I hope that I do go again in the future to explore the menu a bit more and perhaps better understand the hype -- the potential seems like it should be there."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  The food was prepared very, very well.  But the dishes were really boring.  The scallops were served with a wear array of accompanying sauces; the desserts were uninspired; and the appetizers were unremarkable.  The food is actually 3 stars, but considering the price, it's gotta be 2 stars."}
{"text":"It has been quite a while since some place motivated me to write another review. Lots of OK or mediocre out there. Anyway, this past Saturday I took my lovely bride to Tarbell's for her birthday. Hadn't been there in about 8 months. The food was every bit as good as we remembered (seriously, it is really good) but what set the evening apart was our server, Audrey. She was charming. She was attentive without being bothersome. She was just friggin' delightful. As I mentioned, we both loved our food (the short ribs really stood out) but what will be remembered long after the memory of the tastes have faded away was the overall feeling of the evening. Audrey just made our night!"}
{"text":"What a treat to go to a restaurant like this!!  My mom and I went here on the first night of a week-long trip to AZ, and the food we ate for the rest of the trip just made us yearn to go back.    I think that first and foremost I have to rave about the service, which was stellar.  Our waitress Jillian should open a school for servers.  She was friendly, VERY knowledgeable about the menu (including the cocktails -- get the violet one!), and super attentive.  She was key in making our experience as good as it was.  Thank you, Jillian!  I thought the food was amazing.  Put it this way: there were, not one, but two sauces that my mom and I agreed we would like to bathe in.  The parmesan broth on the home-made ribbon pasta dish was indescribably good, and the rosemary caramel on the (outstanding) cheesecake was truly delicious.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the fried capers on the tartare are extra-special good.  Just go!"}
{"text":"The decor is superb. It definitely has an amazing atmosphere.  However, I do feel the food is overhyped. I had the famous spaghetti and meatball (I love spaghetti), it wasn't bad, just not superb enough to leave a famous impression in my mouth. The wine in the sauce could've definitely used some more reduction.  The rock shrimp app was ok. The house made mozzarella was really the star of the day. It was silky and rich and everything anyone could hope for in a mozzarella.  My partner had the scallops. They were cooked ok, could've used a bit more of a sear, but they were flavorful. The risotto bed they were on was not so flavorful. It was a bit too al dente  and lacked seasoning. To be fair we had just had an amazing sweet corn risotto the week before made by Justin Beckett that may have ruined our risotto experience for every place else from here on out.  The vanilla cheesecake was my favorite part of the meal. It was as creamy as the cheese and was not overwhelmingly sweet.  The service was, as to be expected, very good."}
{"text":"Sweet Pea and I finally got to Tarbell's for dinner the other night.  I've lived here my whole life, but have never gotten there for some reason or another, so it was time.  What a great all around meal.  The food, service, atmosphere, everything was just top-notch.  Sweet Pea started out with the field greens, which he liked, but I had the kale salad which was excellent.  I'm a kale fan, but I've never really eaten it raw.  I'm a convert now, because I loved the salad and ate every bite.  We then had the scotch beef (him) and vegetable plate (me) with a side of the chickpeas.  The ingredients tasted so fresh, and the olive oil with the bread was really spectacular.  I've never tasted olive oil so fruity and delicious, even in Spain.  We would normally have enjoyed their extensive wine list, but we were in the mood for cocktails on that particular night, so we ordered mojitos.  My were they delightful!  Just the right balance of tangy and sweet- we both hate our mojitos too sweet.  Finally, we finished off the meal by splitting the strawberry shortcake.  Again, fresh and delicious.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Always a great meal. Variety on the menu, including seasonal features. Get the Scotch Beef or the Meatball or the fresh fish. Very good targeted wine list. If you're by yourself the bar is a great place to sit and eat.   The beat part is that the profiteroles are back on the menu!  Thanks Mark!"}
{"text":"I always try to go to a different restaurant every weekend so I decided to try Tarbells since I always pass it on my way to work. I was not pleased. The grilled salmon is really fishy and the bed of potato is crispy like a tostado, doesn't even taste like potato. The ribbon pasta is very hard to eat., portion is really small"}
{"text":"We wanted to have a good place to have dinner with my son and his girlfriend. The front desk recommended Tarbell's for their impressive wine list. The ambience in the restaurant was nice and subdued.  The menu was filled with a good mix of fresh veggies and great meat dishes. We all had a hard time choosing what we wanted. The chef was no help; he sent a appetizer of calamari for us to share. It was delicious. My son ordered the salmon and his girlfriend had the pan seared chicken. Both thoroughly enjoyed their entrees. My boyfriend chose small plate of the Carpaccio and I had the Scotch beef. The gravy was so smooth and the mashed potatoes so tasty, I wanted to lick the bowl. Everyone really enjoyed the evening."}
{"text":"Ambience is energetic, hip and upscale. Food was excellent; I had a pizza from their brick oven. Just as good as Cibos, in my opinion.   The menu covers the gamut of tastes: seafood, beef, vegetarian... But doesn't show much creativity as compared to Citizen's Public House.  Service was impeccable and the kitchen was lightning fast. I'd definitely go here again without hesitation.  This isn't your sit and have a long drawn out meal where you're chatting and snaking for an hour or two. This is a quick, fun, energetic place to enjoy dinner before going to your next adventure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice..w/the center stage being the semi circular bar. The lobster risotto was delicious.  They serve these dried out chick peas (management needs to get rid of this item) at the beginning, have them replace it w/some warm bread and olive oil.  Everything is ala cart, so prepare to spend some dollars at this restaurant. But, overall very nice experience with an attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"TRULY a 5 star place! The food, the wine, the staff, the ambiance...all of us from out-of-town (different cosmopolitan areas) and ALL of us agreed, best of best!  'We'll be back!!\""}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant. The candy bacon salad is a must-have! The Chocolate Mousse was like eating a dream. The BEST! Can't decide what to have? They let you order 1/2 orders!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and environment! My wife and I recently met friends there for dinner and we all left very impressed. We overindulged and ordered 4 different starters, all of which were fantastic. My personal favorite was the maple candied bacon served with a softboiled egg, don't leave without trying that one!   For dinner my favorite was the scotched beef, but I'll admit I tried some of everything on the table of which I recommend their scallops as well as the thickly cut New York strip.   For dinner I highly recommend the carmel covered cheesecake which the whole group sampled.  The price may prevent me from eating there every night, but you pay for what you get, and this was completely worth it."}
{"text":"The chicken livers appetizers were fabulous but everything else was unremarkable.  The roast beef sliders bun was soggy and the meat was lacking in flavor and quantity; the pizzas were way to thin and overcooked so that it was like eating a cracker with tough overcooked cheese sticking to it.  The Margherita pizza came without fresh tomatoes top, which were missed because they may have added some moisture to the cracker effect.  The cheapest bottle of wine was $43.00."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here frequently and I never take it for granted. I never know what wonderful dining adventure will await me. Tonight I had the halibut with mussels in a wonderful broth with vegetables. The halibut was cooked to perfection and the broth and vegetables complimented it exquisitely. I have never had anything but the best food here, creatively prepared, and served with excellent service. Yay for Mark Tarbell."}
{"text":"Lovely place.  Service is just about intrusive,  as others have mentioned.  The waitress actually took the bottle of wine out of my hand as I went to pour some more for my wife.  Bacon candy was awesome,  Hamachi crudo was very good but should have been thinner,  ribbon pasta with sausage... pasta way too thick for home made,  but the sausage and broth outstanding.  Fish special on Monday night... I  know better.  It was Saturday's fish. Would definitely go back for something else and just stiff arm the numerous people who felt the need to approach our table every 2.5 minutes."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a treat.  Having just moved from NYC, we are having a hard time finding restaurants that meet our standards.  This place was a delight to our taste buds!  I enjoyed their home made pasta with sausage- the red sauce and peppers were a nice touch and the dish was perfectly spiced. Matt had their scotch beef and it was tender and perfectly cooked- he described it at succulent with a flavorful burgundy sauce. The real winner was their marscapone cheesecake- OMG! It was so amazing that we ordered one to go - to treat our babysitter/friend! A great date spot and the service was tasteful and impeccable."}
{"text":"Hands Down. The best food I have ever eaten. I've always watched the Food Channel and wondering what critics were saying when \"flavors marry each other\" or \"food melts in your mouth\". Well, I'm not a professional critic. But now I know exactly what they  were talking about. I ordered appetizer, salad, main course and dessert and had a food orgasm in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Awesome new tavern. Kale chips, scallop seviche"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to come back here. It was our 3rd anniversary and decided to try something new. We've driven by this place a few times and after reading the Yelp reviews, we decided we had to try it. I am so glad we did! We arrived around 7pm on a Tuesday evening. They asked if we had a reservation and we didn't, but luckily one table was open and we were sat immediately. Our server, Jillian I think, arrived promptly and boy was she energetic! Super friendly and helpful. She gave us some time to ponder the menu and while we did, fresh bread and olive oil arrived. For starters, we ordered the Brussels sprouts. For our main entrees, I ordered the house-made ribbon pasta and my husband ordered Tar's scotch beef. Jillian commented on our 'good choices' and placed the order. It arrived super quickly and OMG. Taste explosion! My pasta's sauce was to die for. I had to use a spoon to scoop every bite up. The chicken sausage and tomatoes were delicious as well. My husband's beef was like a pot roast and tasty as well. For dessert, we split the pecan pie. I'd skip this the next time and definitely try something different. Overall, this place was delicious. Super fast and friendly service and fantastic food. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmospher. Owner pleasant and greeted us for a birthday celebration. Food was good, but over priced for the sizes. The lobster tail is a main dish, but the waiter stated it was appetizer size. We ordered it anyway and he was right. Small size without much flavor. I really wanted to like this place more because I heard many good reviews. May give it a second chance, but would rather try one of his other places with different options and prices."}
{"text":"Great for ambiance and all that but I had to send the first dish back because it was advertised as a \"chowder\" which I assumed would be creamy but when it came to the table it looked like corn succotash with celery and a few hunks of bland fish in it.  GROSS. I HATE sending food back but is was inedible. Just got the scallops hence the 2 stars.  Blehh."}
{"text":"Everything was sub-standard about this restaurant.. especially when you factor in the high price.  First thing I noticed was that we got a bad table, but looking around, all of the tables seemed to be in bad locations - because they are cramped and crowded together.  We ordered the mussel appetizer and it was ok.. the only really good thing about it was the broth.  Also, they serve bread with plain olive oil?  Ew.  Our main entrees were just okay.  Not bad, but not really good either.  And at this price, they should be AMAZING.  Dessert was just like the rest of the food - ok.    Overall, I think this place is just way too hyped and all the while not really based on substance or quality.  It's also way too loud.."}
{"text":"We were given a gift certificate for Christmas from our kids to go here!  We're very excited to try it!  We ordered the mussels as an appetizer---they were raw!  Then tried Scotch beef sliders---they were good!  I ordered the recommended special which was prawns with pasta---prawns were terrible and the pasta was raw!  The server felt bad and brought us the augratin potatoes---they were raw!  My husband ordered the roast chicken for $29---it was roast chicken!  Not going back!  Nathan the server was great!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, highly recommend.  We had the scollops and they were to die for, the scotch beef and mac and cheese were also amazing.  Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Not the place to eat or have an adult beverage.  My vodka on the rocks was WATERED, the wine was weak.  Dinner was mediocre say a C.  Avoid the expense an disappointment go to jack n the  box"}
{"text":"Food was good and the drinks were even better. The Texas Sazerac is very good, though small. Had the signature dishes (scotch beef, meatball, handmade pasta, and scallops) and everyone enjoyed the meal immensely. The service was a bit lackluster for a restaurant at this level. We had to micromanage the staff a bit to take our order and get bread plates (and they weren't even that packed). But overall a good experience. I hope their service improves, as there is good potential here for fine dining."}
{"text":"They do a great job even if sitting at the bar. Solid and stable menu and super consistent. My last meal before death penalty would be pepper steak and bread pudding. Awesome"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm given the option to pick a dinner spot for a romantic, special meal, Tarbell's is my 1st choice.  To start, the service here is absolutely outstanding!  From the host, to the bartenders, to the wait staff...everyone here is friendly, knowledgeable and makes you feel like you are in for a special treat.  Extra bonus goes to the fact that they are attached to a wine shop, so you get some really fun wines at a really decent cost.  Talk to the sommelier, and they will lead you in the right direction.  And then to the star of the restaurant, the FOOD!!!!  Holy mother, it is simply out of this world.  I have tried a few items on the menu (scallops, shrimp, meatloaf...) but there is 1 dish in particular that keeps us coming back.  That dish, is the House-Made Ribbon Pasta.  It's almost hard to think about this dish when I'm not there, because it makes me salivate and crave it through my core, however if I have to describe it, all I can say is it's fresh pasta done perfectly, with a sauce so buttery and warm that it'll make your toes curl in excitement.  Plus, the homemade chicken sausage meatball is unlike anything I've ever eaten anywhere, and I would gladly buy a dozen of them to have on hand at home.  This dish is seriously that good.  If you are looking for a special meal that will leave you satiated and smiling, I highly recommend spending an evening at Tarbell's.  Trust me....you're gonna love it :)"}
{"text":"The environment and service were great, but the food was way too overpriced for how it tasted. It was not that special. We had a large group of about 10 people and nobody really liked what they ordered."}
{"text":"I usually have the roast chicken because it's the best. Wouldn't  be afraid of anything on the menu. We live in cave creek so almost need to stay at a hotel after dinner and drinks. Tarbells is as good as it gets anywhere!"}
{"text":"Perfection! Happy accident! Had a reservation at another place and accidentally ended up here. Fantastic food and service! The chicken fennel and ribbon pasta is to die for!!! Everything we ordered was sublime, start to finish! Will be back! Oh, and they serve Illy coffee, the best!"}
{"text":"My dad came to town for a visit and when he's in town I always take the opportunity to try a restaurant usually out of my price range. For this visit I booked a reservation at Tarbell's and was excited to head there for a nice dinner. We were not disappointed! We arrived and were promptly seated. While perusing the menu we each ordered a gin martini; with a twist for me and dirty for my dad. They were both very good, but not outstanding. A group next to us ordered a variety of things on the appetizer menu and made the task of choosing one quite difficult, but we decided to go with the pommes frites. It's probably blasphemy to say that these reminded me of Steak and Shake fries, but they did, only 10x better. Somehow they are able to keep these thin fries piping hot for more than 2 minutes. We also shared the soup of the day, tomato bisque, and the bacon candy salad, both of which were delightful. For our entrees my Dad went with the Scotch beef and I picked salmon. We thought both were good, but the Scotch beef was the winner. For dessert it was again the table next to us who ordered a variety and made it difficult to pick, but we went with the bread pudding. I like bread pudding and this was good, but not great.   Overall, we enjoyed this dinner very much. It isn't very often that we go all out and indulge ourselves and Tarbell's was a good choice to do so. The service was well-timed and we never felt rushed. The waitress did a good job of checking up, but not being overly attentive. There are quite a few places to spend a nice evening in Phoenix and this is a good choice, but I wouldn't be clamoring to come back, either. I do like that Tarbell's is a nice change of pace from most of the upscale restaurants in town that specialize in steak."}
{"text":"I've had Tarbell's bookmarked for as long as I can remember-- I'd heard and read about local chef celebrity Mark Tarbell's 2007 Iron Chef America victory over Chef Cat Cora, so it's been a wait of ten years!  A friend and I just finished a lovely bottle of white with charcuterie from a wine bar nearby and wanted dessert, so we both checked our Yelp apps for bookmarks and Tarbell's came up.  Turns out he's never been to Tarbell's either, has never even heard of the restaurant, and all it took were photos of a cheesecake and profiteroles and the decision was made-- my wait was over!  I had no idea that it's so lovely indoors!  We walked through the entrance to find a crescent-shaped bar in the middle of the restaurant, with an open kitchen behind it and a few tables lining the walls to the left and right of the bar.  There were colorful abstracts under subdued lighting on the walls, and I appreciated that it wasn't very dark inside.  (I'm not a fan of dark interiors kept dark to induce low inhibitions.  Part of the magic of dining out for me is the plating of the food, as well as the use of colors and textures to create beautiful ambience.)  Tarbell's is intimate and has a lively energy, as well.  And there's no doubt that the bar is center stage and the place to be, at least for dessert and cocktails!  I hadn't planned on having any more to drink besides water, since we already had cocktails elsewhere, but a man sitting to our left offered to buy us a round, but with his choices of alcohol.  (He'd heard me nix the whiskey sauce on one of the desserts we'd chosen, so he instructed bartender Mikey not to give me anything corn-based.)  Turns out he's a liquor supplier of Tarbell's, or something- hey, I was buzzed and busy taking a photos of the orange hippo sitting on top of the coffee machine and our gorgeous desserts! https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=A9-EzvvbpUonfivsDlyEng&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  I didn't enjoy the gin-based mojito drink I was given, but I thank you for your generosity, anyway!  Friend enjoyed his twist on an Old-fashioned and Sazerac.  But what about dessert?  We couldn't decide on profiteroles or bread pudding, so bartender Mikey said he could give us half of each; an order of profiteroles includes two pieces, so we were given one. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=h2lEoTL6fB4NZZWBWuavtg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  The profiterole turned out to be massive!  I've had them before from different places, and the standard sizing is much smaller.  Not here, and it came with vanilla gelato and delicious chocolate ganache.  I didn't get to inspect the gelato or even get the chance to ask for more ganache, because my friend pretty much inhaled most of the dish (and I can't blame him!).  The bread pudding was the complete opposite of the profiterole.  Granted, it's half the size of a normal serving, but was it TINY!  If I weren't allergic to the pecans I didn't know were included, I might've cared, but I enjoyed the two bites I had, and really, it was the salted caramel sauce that made this dessert shine.  https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zCSkzDMeRKTWIrjw-j80hg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  I definitely want to return to try some apps, an entree (or three!), and perhaps the Apple Crisp soon!"}
{"text":"Can tell run by someone in Iron Chef.  Nice atmosphere, food,and wine.  We shared a wide variety of apps and they were all well prepared.  We did like the pizza, was hot though (spice) which was a nice variety.  Wine list was big with lots of choices.  Mains were good.  Pasta was fresh and prepared well.  Maybe next time will make this a 5 vs 4 star, but with all the good, food did not pop this night, so a 4, but still a very nice place to eat and will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Tarbells is that one restaurant that is always consistent.  Every single meal is always perfect no matter what you order.    I love that on sundays they choose another region and bring into the menu a specific food from the region. This past Sunday I was excited for a philly cheesesteak.  Apparently many other people were also super excited and they ran out before I got my order in.  No big deal because there were 15 other things which I was excited to eat.    Needless to say it was a great night out, and this is always a top recommendation while in phoenix."}
{"text":"A regular in our restaurant rotation, just went again and left happy as usual. We love the carpaccio appetizer, always superb.My scallops were done perfectly and my wife's fish of the moment was scrumptious. The sorbet is always a great way to finish without feeling guilty! Never disappointed,Tarbell's is a Phoenix classic."}
{"text":"We've just moved to Phoenix and so are trying many new restaurants. Tarbell's really stands out. We split the calamari tempura, which was very light and delicious with the 2 dipping sauces. I had the local frees salad, and my husband had the red beet salad. Both were very fresh. The crispy sweet potatoes on the field greens were a nice variation on croutons. I had the Mr. Fish special - seared halibut over Parmesan polenta. Ric had the Scotch Beef. Both were excellent. And we finished with the Date Cake with butterscotch sauce - obscenely delicious. Shane our waiter was very gracious, perfectly attentive, and really good at picking up the tone of the table - joined right in with our sarcasm. All in all an excellent evening and dinner. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food 2 stars for the service.  The food was good and the muscles were fantastic; however, our server for such a nice restaurant left a lot to be desired.  We will probably go back again I just hope the service is much improved."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I recommend the Ahi Tuna Crudo App, Bay Scallops entree, and Salted Carmel Apple Crumble dessert. All around a great dining experience and I'd go back for sure next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Woke up pinching myself making sure last night was not just a dream. Nope. It wasn't. Just a magical dinner at Tarbell's with unparalleled service from Eric and Modesto.  We had dinner reservations at Tarbell's and decided to just eat small and save room for some downtown Phoenix bar hopping.  However, Tarbell's made that difficult because everything on the menu looked completely jaw dropping incredible. We ordered the 'Mr.Fish of the moment' *drool* we were also able to try the calamari which was fresh and not overly seasoned so the flavor bursted with the salsa verde.  For dessert I HAD to try the cheesecake with rosemary caramel. The hint of rosemary balanced out the sweet caramel and the delicious heaviness of the BEST cheesecake my tastebuds have ever been gifted of trying. I will dream of that cheesecake for years.  Thank you so kindly to Eric for making my birthday dinner special and overal, memorable!"}
{"text":"So I just came back from Tarbell's.  Underwhelmed and slightly offended would be the summary for my experience there.  The positives, straight-away:  the ambiance, decor and the bartender serving me were all perfectly adequate -- and that's where they end.  So I'll be the first to admit, I'm a male 30-something showing up alone on the Saturday before Mother's day, without a reservation and wearing a tshirt and jeans (nice ones though).  Even if you consider gender and age profiling aside, there is absolutely no excuse for how I was treated when I walked through the door.  I walk in, and the hostess just gives me a blank stare.  I say \"Hi\".  She continues to just stare at me like I'm a two headed alien.  I actually had to initiate spoken language by glibly asking \"This is a restaurant, right?\" -- clearly I'm trying to get noticed -- there isn't a crowd around me.  \"Yes this is a restaurant ...\" followed by more staring and silence.  I say \"well, I'm pretty hungry, can we do something about that\" -- and only then does she bother to explain that the dining room is full but I could find myself a seat at the bar.  Gee thanks.  It was so unbelievably disrespectful and unwelcoming I'm pretty sure the only reason I actually sat down at the bar was because there was a seat open, and I was still trying to process what had just happened.  Trying to put that behind me, the lady barkeep takes my drink order, and my food order:  carpaccio ($17) and the NY steak ($44).  The carpaccio was the most boring carpaccio I have ever had -- not bad, not good: boring.  Insanely, there was too much meat!  Just all meat and parmigiano -- a little more olive oil and some simple dressed greens would have made that dish so much better.  The steak I ordered medium-rare.  It came out medium, it was kinda charred, and really tough for \"35 day aged\" hand-picked angus prime -- more like the consistency of medium London broil from Safeway.  It had a sauce on it (which wasn't mentioned on the menu) that just looked and tasted like the most basic demi-glace sauce you could imagine -- at first I thought it was the steak bleeding off.  I don't eat potatoes, so I just asked for extra spinach.  Pan creamed?  Pfft -- I swear it was simply a pile of salted, wilted spinach -- it had no seasoning I could detect, much less any kind of cream or butter or anything.  It was so plain it was sticking to my teeth.  I skipped dessert.  Final thoughts:  after some consideration, I still gave this place 2 stars.  If you're an older, much more boring person in the world, this place is right up your alley.  With all the Bentleys and Porsches parked out front (I saw some fogey driving a Viper!) this place would probably be perfect for older rich people that have no real palate:  people that go to restaurants to improve their socioeconomic standing among their peers instead of discovering mind-blowing food.  I'm sure Chef Tarbell is an excellent chef, but I'm under the impression he has had to dumb down his food because the well-heeled, stodgy clientele wouldn't be able to appreciate the real thing.  That, or Food Network's ICA is scripted and staged."}
{"text":"All staff was extremely friendly and kind! It was my mom's birthday and my dad and I took her here, it was their first time. Andrew was a wonderful server, extremely attentive and we enjoyed talking with him. Chef Mark was also extremely generous as he provided my mom with complimentary artichoke hearts as a starter and then a cheesecake for dessert. We had a great experience and are looking forward to our next visit. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"I took my mom here for her Birthday, I made a reservation through Open Table and called a day in advance to confirm that they would have a pre selected desert that would come out with my moms name on it after dinner. We arrived ahead of time and were seated immediately, which was great! Unfortunately we were seated next to a very large group of women who were extremely loud. In order to talk we had to yell at each other and even then we couldn't hear the other person. This was not what I was expecting for ambiance. We asked to be moved to a quieter area and were promptly moved. The ability to move us was a huge plus, the noise almost ruined the nice evening I had planned. The food came out and was absolutely delicious. We started with the Burrata, I had the George Bank Scallops (amazing) and my mom had the Scottish Salmon (equally delicious). We ended our meal with the pre selected desert, Vanilla Creme Bruelee with mixed berries. They spelled my moms name incorrectly...that really irritated me because I spelled it out in advance when I called the day before, but overall the experience was redeemed by the food and the really great staff. In my opinion I wouldn't go back to Tarbell's for a special occasion, unless you don't mind the noise. It gave us the feel of an upscale sports bar than a fine restaurant. However, I would dine here again with friends."}
{"text":"I liked the fact that this was a smaller place, so thus a more intimate dining room, although the tables seemed a bit close. The wait staff was very friendly and mostly attentive although I do feel like other tables got a bit more attention (I think it's because I tend to be a younger diner at these types of establishments, which means I won't order as expensive items or won't tip as much - so wrong, but I digress). The house bread that was served was especially good and served warm - mmm.  Our table ordered mac and cheese and onion strings to share. Both were super delicious, the onion strings came with a phenomenal dipping sauce that I loved. For my entree, I ordered one of the homemade pasta dishes which was very rustic and delicious, although the chicken sausage was a bit heavy handed with the fennel seeds. The others at my table ordered the special of the night that was some sort of fish and polenta that looked great. My fiance ordered the scotch beef which he loved as well.   We also all ordered dessert, carrot cake (meh, I've definitely had better), chocolate mousse (pretty good, but standard), bread pudding with a bourbon sauce (super rich, pretty good), and homemade sorbets (the lemon being the best and very refreshing).   I would say definitely check this place out, especially for special occasions."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The food is excellent. Scotch beef with mashed potatoes is my favorite, but everything I have had has been just as good... pepper steak, kale chips, ceasar salad, etc.  The scallops are the best I have ever had. The owner is always in talking with customers, the bartenders are awesome, service is incredible. Very warm and welcoming atmosphere. You can have a half order of anything on the menu, whether you are not very hungry or want to try two different things! One of my favorite places in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.    Had the scotch beef, which was extremely tender and flavorful, but next time I'll ask for more gravy.  The scallops are a must-have.  The beet salad is a great value & super full of beets - very tasty.  The flash-fried white bean appetizer is fun, different, and good.  They'll make anything on the menu as a half-order, which is super convenient.  The mini apple dessert which he used on Iron Chef weren't as amazing as hoped.  The bread pudding w/whiskey sauce was excellent.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this kind of review.  I've been to Tarbells several times over the years. Now that we live closer, I've been twice in the past 4 months. The first time was excellent and last night was a real miss.  First of all, the service is excellent and the wine list is terrific. I have no complaints about either.   However, every member of our party thought the food just average. The dishes worthy of change include: - the salmon. I had it and it was way below average. Essentially, it's a piece of salmon with a nice sweet glaze, with some greens sitting on a bed of over-fried hash browns. The hash brown thing was just odd. - the beet salad - roasted beets in a sauce with arugula. Nothing delicate about this dish - a large quantity of beets chopped in a nondescript sauce.  - The steak - a hunk of beef with some greens/chard and a scallop potato cake. Our guest declared it good.  Overall, quite disappointing. Restaurant was full, service was excellent. I've been when it was better."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, just had another excellent dinner here two nights ago. The chicken is excellent - so are the shishito peppers, burrata salad, burrata/prosciutto pizza, rock shrimp, scotch beef - literally everything!"}
{"text":"Always a top notch dining experience. Nothing short of perfection. I recommend the burratta for an app. Ask for Eric For great service!"}
{"text":"I have four words for this place: Yum, yum, yum and yummy!  I have lived around that restaurant for years and years and finally decided to try it.  The food was to DIE for!  I had the Scotch beef which was amazing.  So tender, juicy, just yummy!  Mashed potatoes were delish and so were the brussel sprouts.  The service was excellent.  Wednesday was our server and she rocked it.  I will be taking my clients/friends there a soon as possible.    P.S.  Did I say that the food was yummy?   That is an understatement!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food OK service, I felt that the waitstaff was less knowledgeable than the support staff. Nice location not good for intimate dining again mediocre food quality. I don't see any reason to go back."}
{"text":"What a restaurant! Absolutely loved my experience at Tarbells. I've been hearing rave reviews for quite sometime and decided to try it out recently. My party and I sat at the bar, which was a great choice because the bar was comfortable, rather large and really social and fun. The bartender (young woman) was fabulous, inviting and very nice! She was very attentive. A guest in my party dines at Tarbells often and she had his drink in front of him by the time we walked to the end of the bar.....Now thats some customer service for ya!  Food = We started with the Calamari. A favorite dish of mine and this one was outstanding. Two very different but delicious dipping sauces. A roasted red pepper and a pesto mix. Not sure which one I liked more :) I enjoyed the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops. TO DIE FOR. I am a huge scallop fan and these were done just right. Caramelized, giving them the right amount a sweet....and it was served over very yummy risotto. Another dish enjoyed by my party was the Fennel Sausage Pasta dish, the fennel sausage was AMAZING.   Overall experience was fantastic, as soon as I get another opportunity I will be dining here again! :)"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Phoenix, I like to try a new upscale restaurant , this time Tarbell's looked really appealing, I wasn't overly impressed, but I did get a decent meal.   First of all, the parking situation here is terrible, the strip mall it's in has another restaurant and a bar, so save some time and sanity, opt for the valet.  The hostess was nice, we had reservations but still had to wait a bit for our table. This place was busy and loud, a lot louder than I would have expected. The tables were way too close together. If you were lucky enough to get one of the stand alone tables, it might be ok, but we were sitting along the wall and it was way too cramped.   We had a couple of appetizers, both good. The caprese salad tasted good, but was not remarkable. The calamari was cooked perfectly and came with two really nice dipping sauces.   We ended up getting the appetizers before we even ordered dinner so we had to hang on to our unwieldy menus while trying to eat our appetizers since there was no room to place them on the table.  Dinner was good, not great. 2 in our group got the pepper steak, (Steak au poivre) it was tasty. The creamed spinach was more of a sautéed than creamed. I had the double cut pork chop. This was really good. It came with a couple of pierogi filled with bacon and cabbage. The last person in the group got the special, which was a NY strip roast. She asked for it medium rare, was told it might be closer to medium, to which she replied, \"nothing well done\". Wouldn't you know it, that piece of meat had no pink what so ever, she sent it back and we shared since we didn't want to wait for an entree to be cooked.   Desert was Creme Brulee and chocolate mousse. The Creme Brulee was huge and the sugar crust was perfect. The chocolate mousse was good, but served in a wine glass, so it was a pain to eat. I'm all for presentation, but functionality needs to be there too.  After seeing this guy on Iron Chef I was expecting a epic meal I would talk about for years to come. I guess I shouldn't have gotten my expectations up."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience.  The food, ambience, and service were A+.  Food was prepared and seasoned perfectly.  I ordered the swordfish - absolutely delicious and the side of risotto was the best I've ever tasted.  My husband ordered the sausage pizza which was excellent - nice thin crust and flavorful.  Dessert was a creme brûlée served in a baked apple with caramel sauce - wow! Our server was great - she was extremely attentive and really knew the menu.  Her recommendations were right on and she was able to explain items we didn't understand on the menu.   Highly recommend this restaurant especially for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good.  I'd say that going on a weeknight you'd see more of the Geriatric crowd there, but who gives a rats ass? This is the guy that smashed Kat Cora's face in on Iron Chef!  His cuisine reigned supreme! :D Anyway I went with my girl, she had the chicken I had the linguine with clams.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  Her chicken was cooked PERFECTLY - they even got the skin ontop nice and crispy.  My pasta was obviosly fresh and the broth/sauce it was served in with clams was soo god damn delish I had to soak it all up with bread before I let the bus boy have my plate.    Desert - very good, I had something made of chocolate, but my dates desert  - the strawberry short cake, on a sweet biscuit was a bit sour and not as sweet as we hoped. NOT bad by any stretch, but not what we were thinking it'd be.  The waitress promptly took it off the bill when we told her we didn't like it, saying she wants us to love our experience and to come back!  RAWK ON! Tarbell's FTW!!"}
{"text":"Excellent birthday dinner!  Spot on service and the food was delicious! You can't go wrong with the Scotch Beef - met in your mouth good!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here. We both visited during restaurant week and had the salad with apples which was a wonderful start. The butternut squash ravioli was delicious. Everything tasted fresh and unlike many restaurants that use butternut squash Tarbell's let the squash shine through rather than ladening it with sugar or other sweeteners. The sauce was a perfect accompaniment and the cheese on top melded delightfully with the ravioli and cream sauce. The sage leaf on top was a wonderful touch as well.  We asked the waiter to suggest a glass of wine and the wine he suggested went very well with the dish and was very enjoyable.  For dessert we had the chocolate cake which was very rich and wonderfully delicious. The ice cream on top helped cut through the richness a bit - finishing it felt guilty. The waiter was great. Overall it was a wonderful dinner. I would definitely go back on a special occasion."}
{"text":"I went to Tarbells with some friends last week and I wasn't disappointed. Tarbells has a very friendly atmosphere and great service! I have the gnocchi which was fantastic, the gnocchi were tender and the gravy was so flavorful! My friend had the fish special, they said the flavor was good, but liked the gnocchi better... I will return to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending a dinner at Tarbell's last evening hosted by winemaker, James Callahan of Rune Wines. From the first course to the last every dish was perfectly paired. I will be spreading the word about Tarbell's, Tarbell's Wine Shop, as well as local Arizona winery, Rune. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Soup and appetizers were amazing (except for the carpaccio, which was just good).  The tartare was buttery and the broiled capers added that something special.  Whatever bleu cheese they used on the bibb salad was one of the better bleus I've had.  Creamy, sweet, with the perfect amount of bite.  The candied bacon took the first round to another level. Wow.  All around, the appetizers had us panting for more.  Which made the main course all the more disappointing.  The scotch beef was dry and just a little bit better than my mom's pot roast.  The ribbon pasta was ok, but didn't have that special pop.  And the bolognese was just boring.  The disappointment with the mains and the fact that we weren't seated until 8:25 (we had an 8pm reservation) docked a star from the overall review.  Much was at stake with dessert.  Fortunately, dessert was delicious.  The mousse, cheesecake, and the profiteroles were all perfect.  Rich, full of flavor, perfectly sweetened.  The four stars were secured.  I will say that the two groups on either side of our table were a bit too rambunctious for me.  Listening to older masters of the universe talk about the size of their penises (literally) and having their very drunk female companions talk about sex all night was at first a little amusing, but after an hour, it got to be a little old.  Hopefully our next visit will be a little more subdued."}
{"text":"Really great food and service, and it worked out just fine for my two kids, ages 7 and 10. (Meatball pizza was a hit for the younger one; the older one shared sausage pizza and mussels.) The food came very quickly. We had all small plates and pizza, not entrees: kale chips, fried chickpeas, peppers, mozzarella salad. Dessert was great. The mousse was first rate, and the parsnip creme brulée was delicious (though we couldn't taste any parsnip; it just tasted like excellent, flavorful creme brulée). One of the best meals we had in Arizona. And we also really liked the decor. Simple, elegant, and also fun/creative. Not sure why anyone would ding them for that. Also, the portion sizes were just fine. We all left full but not feeling gross. We're from MA, and were unaware of the chef's celebrity. I wonder if some of the griping here is just celebrity bashing, or a reaction against some sort of hype? I'm outside that loop, but it just struck us as an excellent and fun place with great food and no pretension. Just thorough competence. Note: It's a nice walk from the Arizona Biltmore Hotel. Under 2 miles."}
{"text":"Amazing decor with a modern and intimate feel. We were in town and decided to try a nice place for wine and dessert, had a glass of red zinfandel (fruitful and easy to drink) and my boyfriend had the vanilla porter (thick body and true to it's name) and a glass of Malbec ( tasty and extremely smooth, definitely suggested).   As we were trying to decide what to have for dessert, the manager came by and introduced himself, very friendly staff, and soon after we had a rosemary caramel cheesecake on the house! The rosemary caramel sauce was thick and tasty but not overwhelmingly sweet at all, the cheesecake itself was thick and creamy, and the crust was perfectly baked, we LOVED it.   since the dessert was so good, we figured why not try out their steak. We shared a steak medium rare which came out split for us without even having to request it to be split. There's a glaze around the steak that we couldn't figure out what it was exactly, but complimented the steak perfectly. Very tender and perfectly cooked. Side of mashed potatoes were well mashed and not runny at all, gravy is by request and has a charred, oak taste to it, delicious.   Overall, we loved it! Will definitely be back next time we pass by Phoenix AZ"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Excellent food, atmosphere and service for any occasion. Consistent create and innovative. I would only hope for a bit more of that in changing up the menu in the creation of the vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Alan is an amazing server, he went above and beyond for us and he has a great sense of humor. Each dish starting with appetizers then two salads that were amazing and all of us ended up eating off eating off each other plates since they all were AMAZING! The wine list was very accommodating to any one's taste.We ended closing the restaurant after our 2 delicious desert we ordered and the extra one that Alan surprised us! 5 star all the way! Thanks Alan!"}
{"text":"Wow, incredible service, fantastic food and great ambiance.  We had Spinach Gnocchi, Carpaccio, Calamari and New York Strip all exceeded expectations.  Desert was Warm Chocolate cake with Pistachio ice cream and Cheesecake.  Highly recommend as a date spot, just a get together or special event.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Once again.. Simply amazing!! Had excellent meals along with delicious desserts! We had the same waiter as we had when we dined here on Monday and it was nothing short of amazing. I sent a few clients to tarbells that are coming to the area this week and will continue to do so. Thanks to the staff  for an amazing meal, you only live once; I appreciate the art of good food and good service. Touché!"}
{"text":"Uhhhmazing!!! What a fabulous meal! Great service, and each dish was another amazing experience.  We had the spaghetti and meatballs  and the Scotch beef...  Both amazing.  Created corn.... Amazing.  Bread ... Amazing.   Dessert..  . Amazing  Wow"}
{"text":"This is a really Cheffy place to go. Tarbell is like one of the Iron Chef masters I see on the Food Network. Oh wait-- he actually is an Iron Chef winner and I really did see him on the Food Network ...  The restaurant is beautiful, from the moment you walk in. It isn't too big so there is generally a lot of intimacy at your table. An amazing wine selection, some affordable and some extremely expensive and high-quality.  Every employee from the manager to the hostess to the server is clean and articulate and knowledgeable about the menu.   They have interesting things on the menu that I just don't see that often. I haven't necessarily liked every single thing I've had (duck sausage) but I have tried a lot of new things by eating here that are not even available elsewhere. I mean... When was last time you saw duck sausage on a menu?  Some of my favorites on the menu include their prime rib, New York strip, risotto, the salmon, the beet salad, and the seasonal vegetable plate. Their menu, at least part of it, changes with the seasons so everything you get is fresh and tasty.  So, it is Cheffy and upscale, and maybe not a place you would go to every week or even every month. But you'll have a great experience and it won't break the bank even if it will be a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Amazing. Fine dining Italian. They let you do half dishes!! Bartender was super friendly and made me a perfect negroni on a big cube. Loved every single thing I tasted. The scallops were so rich I wanted to get up and dance on the spot. They served us well after close as we got there about 15 minutes prior and they were super cool. Loved everything not one thing was off. Well rounded. Great place. Already getting cravings to go back..."}
{"text":"So Tarbell's is a nice place to eat, with friendly people, and a good neighborhood crowd. The servers, the bussers, the hostesses, everyone is nice. I can't stress that enough.  We were ridiculously excited to try the food, after hearing so much about it for so long. It was like the excitement you get when someone tells you they are taking you on vacation to the most beautiful place on earth but you don't know where. You know, when you just are awaiting something spectacular but you don't really know how spectacular?  The mussel appetizer was outrageous. There was a bowl of probably 50 of the biggest meatiest suckers I'd ever seen. Served with a garlic butter broth that I ordered more and more bread just to sop up... it was amazing. We went straight to the main courses afterward, which were much less appetizing to look at, and even more so to eat. I ordered the Ahi Tuna, which was served in three cubes, very similar to a tuna tartare appetizer. Served dusted in smokey paprika, it was almost as if I were eating paprika rather than fish. Needless to say, it was a huge disappointment. The girlfriend's spaghetti and meatballs, something Tarbell's is known for we hear, were nothing more really than spaghetti and meatballs. Then again, what all can you do with spaghetti and meatballs that nobody else has done? The side of mac n' cheese was well, mac n' cheese.   Desserts were somewhat a saving grace, but only moderately. I had the bread pudding and enjoyed it well enough. It was sitting in a very bourbony sauce and carried a great aroma and texture.   All in all, I'd say Tarbell's is serving two things... standard fare with higher quality ingredients (mac n' cheese, spaghetti and meatballs, bread pudding) along with experimental dishes that are hit or miss (ahi tuna, mussels) to overall garner a good but not great review from me. I'm sorry, but I just don't see it. If I order a piece of fish, I want it to taste like fish, not a paprika lick."}
{"text":"could be one of the top 5 meals ive ever eaten. started with the octopus appetizer...90% of the time you get octopus its over cooked and rubbery...this place cooked it perfectly..melt in your mouth and the sauces were awesome. i had the pan roasted chicken and it was tremendous..normally i wont eat the skin but it was so perfectly golden brown and crispy i ate it all..wife had the salmon and it was one of the best sauces ive had on seafood...desert we split the sticky date cake with butterscotch sauce...you could put the sauce on a shoe and id eat it...the waiter was great...i couldn't find a flaw with this restaurant...so worth the price"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic evening at Tarbell's. The atmosphere is lovely, the service terrific and friendly. The beet salad and Caesar salads were excellent. The Mr. Fish of the Day was a Skate and was interesting and unusual and well presented. Their Bolognese (that takes 4 days to make) was the best I have ever had. It is served with fresh homemade flat noodles and was delicious. There is an extensive wine cellar to complete the meal. Prices range from $16-39 per entree and the evening for 2 with a beverage was $90. We highly recommend it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I recently had the best dinner at Tarbell's.  My boyfriend and I had dinner here to celebrate my birthday.  We had reservations and we immediately were greeted and seated.  Our server was very attentive and answered any questions. We started out with the Tuna tartar and the warm bacon candy salad.  The chef split the appetizers which was very elegant to have your own special plate of amazing food.  I fell in love with the Candy bacon.  Wow, perfectly rendered bacon with sugar... it inspired me to make my own.    The tuna tartar's presentation was packed with flavor, freshness and eye appealing.  For dinner,  I ordered the New York steak aged 35 days and packed with pepper and seasoned to perfection. I had this steak years ago here and have never forgotten it.  I love the au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach that is served with it.  This was a fantastic dinner.  We had wine with dinner that paired perfectly.  The evening was wonderful.  The dessert that our waiter brought out with Happy birthday written on it was Mascarpone Cheesecake with Rosemary sauce.  EXCELLENT!!!!  It's by far one of the best cheesecakes in my book.  The sauce is extraordinary!!  Carmel and Rosemary.... it works so wonderful together.  Thank you Tarbell's and staff for a great Birthday dinner."}
{"text":"This is our 'go-to' restaurant for our anniversary or a special occasion.  The food and service are consistently excellent.  When I want to recommend a restaurant without a second thought, Tarbell's immediately comes to mind.  We generally order one of their steak entrees and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and cocktails! Has a traditional steak house upscale feel but with a laid back atmosphere. My fiancé got the aged steak and loved it and I had the fish of the day. We ordered the Mac and cheese to share. Really really great food! Recommend!"}
{"text":"We ate here on a business trip as part of a recommendation from a friend.  I had the scotch beef with the buttermilk potatoes and it was delicious.   The beef melted in your mouth.  We also had some type of fried bean, calamari, and a sampling of their salads and everything was to die for.  Although it was pricey the meal was delicious and it was worth it.  I also like that our server was very confident in her recommendations and was willing to tell us something was better than something else.  You often get servers that are willing to tell you what is good and what is not on the menu while I don't think this place would have anything that was bad it was nice to know what the house specialties were"}
{"text":"I had a Magnificent Mother's Day dinner at Tarbell's  My son and I started with their fantastic Caesar salad (which they were more than happy to split for us). In fact, the chefs will create anything for you, and the service is impeccable! Everyone is so warm and relaxed. They make you feel right at home as you experience the elegance and evidence of a restaurant owned and operated by an Iron Chef America Champion and all of the national awards. Choosing a wine is effortless since Mark Tarbell is a wine connoisseur (has a wine store next door, writes a wine column) and has the perfect pairings or suggestions.  The Gnocchi with Lobster is spectacular! It had the freshest, sweetest tomatoes cooked to perfection, just like the gnocchi & lobster, in a light creamy sauce.   Their Créme Brûlée is exquisitely smooth with the perfect amount of vanilla, a flawless layer of caramelized sugar, and big fresh berries.   I also have to mention their special touches, like their housemade Tahini cumin hummus and chips, when we were seated, and the individually wrapped lemon cookies as we left. Our friends, who dined there last week, received individually wrapped pieces of banana bread as they left.  Tarbell's is very special and innovative, upscale yet relaxed."}
{"text":"I found Tarbell's when doing my usual restaurant research before a business trip, and I have been back every time I'm in town, even twice in one trip in December.  Service, atmosphere, and of course the food are all excellent.  I made sure to sit in Josh's section when I ate here two consecutive nights, and he brought out my colleagues favorite NA beer from the previous evening - truly a great experience!  The seasonal Veggie Plate was delicious along with their house staple of Ribbon Pasta with Chicken-Fennel Sausage.  I make kale chips for myself every week, and I was curious to try a salad of raw, purple kale.  So glad I got it.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I reserved for a birthday date and the staff were very accommodating to my request and friendly. I love the staff, wish every restaurant was as professional and courteous as Tarbell's. I will certainly use this place for special occasions and a dinner night out.   One thing I almost forgot to mention, I ordered a special they had that day and there was an issue with the food that I wont say but again the manager came out personally and apologized for the mistake after I reordered  and actually took that item out of our dinner bill. And I have to say that was a very expensive meal and I was really impressed with the service. Thank you Tarbell"}
{"text":"There are a lot of restaurants in the Phoenix area, but then there's Tarbell's . None better for great service & wonderful food. My wife & I have been going there since they opened in 1994. No matter what you order, be it a cocktail, a glass or bottle of wine it's top notch. Mark Tarbell is a gentleman from the old days & we are lucky to have him here in the Phoenix area.  Treat yourself and your companion to a meal. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place is on point from the excellent food to the spectacular bar service and Management! Don't hesitate, come have a glass of wine and relax while everything is taken care of. I had a glass of Caymus and enjoyed the escargot"}
{"text":"I love the consistency I receive at Tarbell's. The service is ALWAYS great and the food is ALWAYS delicious! I can always count on Tarbell's for my ole faithful! The interior is beautiful and simple. Perfect for a casual night with a friend, a date or even to sit by yourself at the bar! Wonderful location too!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I love this place! We have been going here for years for so many different occasions and I think thats why I love it so much. It is great for special days, like anniversaries or birthdays and my favorite time, Sunday night at the bar.   My favorite things to eat are: The mussels, the pizza, Mr. Fish of the moment, the chocolate cake, the meatballs, and those little apple bites he won on Iron Chef.   We love Jim and Harry and Patrick too! The people working there have been there for years and its always nice to see the familiar faces."}
{"text":"How in the world did we wait 10 years living in Phoenix before eating at Tarbell's? Doh! Magnificent! Not sure where to start - but we all enjoyed the appetizers, entrees, sides, cocktails and deserts. My wife had trouble deciding what to have - a good sign. Highly recommended - just choose what you like."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had at a restaurant. Food and service were both excellent. Our server Allen was almost too nice, but it seemed genuine and I hope we have him again in future visits.   We had calamari and their mozzarella special as appetizers, both had great flavor and I especially enjoyed the lighter batter they used for the calamari. Not one bit of chewiness in the calamari.   For entrees we had the lobster gnocchi and the Scotch beef. Portion for lobster gnocchi was reasonable, would leave me a little hungry if I had not gotten an appetizer. Great texture from the gnocchi and the lobster was well done. Wife enjoyed the scotch beef, picture an elevated pot roast.   Dessert was the cheesecake with their (rosemary?) caramel sauce. I did not really care for the sauce, although wife loved it and I'm sure many others do too. Again portion here was great and the texture was amazing. I hate ordering dessert (usually a rip off in my opinion) at restaurant but will certainly get this again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for Valentines Day, which happens to be his birthday.  We are in our early 30's and let's just say we brought down the average age by about 15 years.  The food and service were excellent.  Cocktails - delish and on point!    Definitely an older demographic.  Doesn't bother me for date night, but I probably wouldn't do a group dinner here for that reason."}
{"text":"My mother, sister and I had dinner here recently while out celebrating Mother's Day together. It was a truly fantastic night.   My mom ordered the House-Made Ribbon Pasta. It was truly phenomenal. The sauce was out of this world. I could have spent hours eating just that with a loaf of bread.   My sister had the Pan-Seared Scallops. I haven't eaten scallops in years after an icky food poisoning incident but I had to try a bite and they were melt-in-your-mouth nummy. Tasted more like lobster than scallops even.  I was torn as to what to order but I settled on the Pan-roasted Chicken and I was far from disappointed. It was, by far, the juiciest, best prepared chicken dish I've ever had.   All told, it was a perfect evening. The atmosphere felt a tad dated but it almost made it all the more charming... kinda like we were stepping back in time a bit."}
{"text":"Mixed Drinks.  Try the Texas Sazerac, and don't look back.  Very, very well made.  The chocolate mousse is a great way to end the night as well."}
{"text":"UPDATED IN AUGUST  Excellent. About everything you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.  I have to start with a long-ish story that tells a lot about the place:  When we were sitting at the bar, Shaq walked in and went to the VIP private room. (Tarbell knows how to show off his VIPs--the private room has a glass door looking out to the other tables.) Anyway, Shaq's publicist (I assume) was sitting next to me and my wife at the bar and was in a rather heated discussion with the restaurant manager. She wanted appetizers served right away to Shaq and the other guests (who were already seated in the private room,) so that he could get on with whatever other celebrity things he had to do that night. The manager refused, saying he didn't want to interfere with the flow of the meal by serving courses rushed or out of order. To me, refusing to cater to a celebrity to maintain the integrity of the meal is the sign of a truly great restaurant.  Anyway, onto the meal. First off, a first-rate mojito at the bar. I mean REALLY good. Ambiance is very modern and upscale, dangerously close to \"see and be seen\" but not quite going over.  The food really was spectacular. A hand-pulled mozzarella dish (basically a caprese) with unbelievably fresh, rich cheese, sweet and fresh basil and tomato that was better than farmer's market heirlooms. Even the micro-greens on the side were nutty, fresh and delicious, without any of the bitterness you often get with sprouts.  My wife had a fennel and orange soup. Not ingredients you normally think of putting together and I was hesitant to even try it, but it was spectacular! Fresh, light and wonderfully blended, subtle flavors. I enjoyed a cioppino that was surprisingly delicate and loaded with tasty seafood.  My Cast Iron Pepper Steak was slightly disappointing. It had an overwhelming amount of pepper on it--really a pepper crust. This was easily remedied with a little scraping, so it wasn't too bad. The accompanying pan-creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes were incredibly rich and amazingly good. I actually enjoyed the sides more than the steak itself. My wife had a perfectly cooked Yellowfin tuna steak that was rich and wonderfully flavored on its own but the soy- mirin broth was somewhat overpowering for the delicate fish.  We shared a marscapone cheesecake for dessert that my wife said was the best she's ever had. It had an unusual rosemary-caramel sauce that really put it over the top. Just an amazing sauce.  Overall a fantastic dining experience. Michael made the rounds to all the tables (not something you see as often anymore,) the atmosphere was comfortable and casual and even though they were very busy the staff was attentive and smoothly presented an excellent meal. A truly wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"JKL chapter 2 So at the risk of sounding like a Victrola I am becoming more and more disappointed with Valley bourgeois eateries. There is invariable something that becomes slightly bittersweet by the end of meal. Or beginning with Pizzeria Bianco.                                                     -side note- Sorry Chris, but your lines and wait times are outrageous. Simply because you are  the newest crush of Martha Stewart and Oprah should not allow your reputation to act like a Van Buren streetwalker. If people are first or second in line when it opens, they should have not to wait an additional hour to be seated. Phoenix is your bread and butter. If you lose us, your street cred will diminish faster than Lohan's descent into Dante's inferno.   Ok I am done.   So we arrived a few minutes past our reservations but this did not deter our hostess from seating us immediately. Very nice. And it was still busy at 8:30. Almost boisterous. We were happy. After a few minutes, servers presented us with chilled water and bread served with olive oil. The service was prompt on refills but not overbearing. Big point there. The bread was unremarkable as was the olive oil. Not very flavorful nor was the bread soft. But it was not bad.   We then order tuna tartare and and house pulled mozzarella (their name for Caprese salad). The salad would only be adequate for 2-3 people to share. However, it was delicious. Arugula, basil..well you know the rest. Very fresh, flavorful. The balsamic was amazing. The tuna was fresh but nearly flavorless. If I closed my eyes while eating it, I would have insisted that it was salty diced roma tomatoes via bruschetta. We also order a New Zealand sauvignon blanc. It was a good selection.   K ordered the pan roasted chicken. We started chuckling over this decision as chicken does not have various temperature deviations like beef or fish. So if they pulled off chicken well, that is a good sign. L ordered the bass but we were informed approximately 10 minutes later that they were out. Our spunky waitress apologized profusely.  L ordered Salmon with crispy potato cake with molasses lime syrup. I asked for the cast-iron pepper steak served medium.   K enjoyed his chicken. This is good news for Tarbells. L's fish and crispy potato cake were overwhelmed with the molasses and made the dish seem like more like dessert. Our waitress got L a new dish (3rd times the charm, right?). The manager came over and apologized. But she like it better than the first (or is it second) although it was a bit dry and missing flavor. My steak was 2/3 medium and 1/3 well-well done. It was quite peppercorny. Good cut, but the temp was off. And it could have used some more salt  from the chef so I would not have to salt it so. Perhaps it is my savory tongue that is too blame. It was not bad, just not great. The side potatoes of this dish were divine.  They comped our dessert, which was Warm Chocolate Cake with Pistachio Ice Cream. The ice cream was still solid when we got it instead of melting into some sweet fugue. The ice cream was tasty with hints of a liquor. L told me she thought our dessert was comparable to Safeway. Although it was comped, it still failed to wow us.  The food was almost completely unremarkable. The service was great. I would take servers-in-training to show them what exceptional service is. But not chefs. Bittersweet...."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Tarbell's in while and I always enjoy the food there, so the Beautiful Carin and I went for dinner a couple of nights ago. As always the food was first rate.  Carin and split a Caesar salad (I think that's becoming a theme with us, but the Caeser here is pretty good, with anchovies on request). I had the salmon, which I hadn't had before, and it was good (I don't usually get seafood in Phoenix...even Salt Cellar, Wildlfish, Ocean Club, etc., don't really measure up to Portland, Seattle and SFO, where I spent so much of my misspent youth). Carin had the pan-roasted chicken, which is also quite good. On previous visits I have had the mustard Pork Chop (which I can also recommend) and the Cheese burger (which isn't as good as others in the area. Add a couple of glasses of Syrah and it was a very pleasant dinner.  The service was good (attentive but not intrusive or rushed) and while not cheap at $100 for 2, it's not the priciest by a good big margin, and well worth it! I think of Tarbells when I want something that's comfortable but upscale and a little bit different (not just another steak or grilled Chilean Sea Bass with some kind of glaze). Mark Tarbell has thought this place out pretty well, and it's a very appealing spot."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant for the last ten years - I've had many dinners and even a few special events there.  Mark Tarbell is a great guy and he often hangs around the restaurant on weekends (and keeps the staff on their toes!).  If I had to pick the best items on the menu, I would recommend the Beef Carpaccio and the Spaghetti and Meatballs."}
{"text":"I have to say I would have given a 4 to 5 star rating particularly for the food, but our server was quite poor and it was clear he was struggling with multiple tables etc. My wife and I are from NY and know good food and this place has it. We came to the restaurant with our young autistic son who is very high functioning and is a hamburger nut. It was clear he frustrated the waiter even more! We had to wait for a drink quite a while so I got up to go to the bar to order. I wasn't upset as I recognized our waiter was dealing with an order issue at another table that was clearly not his doing. Nonetheless, it clearly set his mood off.  As for the food, I had the peppercorn steak and for appetizer the octopus. My wife had soft shell crabs and as an appetizer the beef carpaccio. The food across the board was amazing and cooked to perfection.  My wife and I said we would definitely come back but sit in a different section of the restaurant.   My wife and son came back into town yesterday so I booked a dinner here again tonight because we liked the food so much and we wanted to give it another try on the service. . Tonight was spectacular in every way from the manager coming up to the table to thank us us for coming again to the waiter and of course the food. Best restaurant in the area, and i changed my rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had a great birthday dinner at Tarbell's yesterday evening. It was a quaint restaurant with SUPERB service. The hostesses were very friendly and seated us promptly when we walked in (although we did make reservations ahead of time). The server was very genuine and attentive. She knew the menu and offered to split my guests meal in half because he could not choose on just one entree. Talk about service!  I ordered the special halibut (Mr. Catch of the Day) and it was exactly how it was described.   Although I would not recommend taking many children to Tarbell's, we did take our 10 mo old son and the wait staff was very gracious to him. They even thanked us for feeling comfortable enough for bringing the entire family to dine with them.  GREAT EXPERIENCE. I will return!"}
{"text":"Fresh menu, fresh ingredients, great service. Not much more to say on this one. The visible pizza oven was temping but on a visit for dinner I went for the fish special of the day which was a freshly caught swordfish and was not disappointed. The side bonus (which did not really apply to my menu selection for the night) was also seeing they are open to changing menu items to be gluten free as well. What? Recipes on their website too? Not sure when, if ever, I have seen that before.  Before coming here comments from others set the bar pretty high and I would say there was nothing to disappoint that expectation level on my first visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary, and it was very good. The ambience was a little old school, but the food was great. We split a light salad to start and the waiter had them split it onto two plates for us, which was really nice. The salad was flavorful, but not overpowering. I had scotch beef for my main and he had BBQ pork. They were both delicious! I could have licked the bowls. Finally for dessert we had this amazing cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce. It was so rich and wonderful. This place is a bit pricey, but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for what should've been a nice meal at the bar. I've never heard of a bar taking reservations. I've heard of reservations for tables but not a seat at the bar. The most idiotic thing I've ever heard in the restaurant business. Mark you should rethink position on somebody coming in wanting a cold refreshment and a meal and being able to have a open seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. I had the ribbon pasta with a spicy fennel chicken sausage.  Party of 6, and whether it was fish, steak, or pasta, superior plate presentation, food quality, taste, and temp. Outstanding meal. Terrific wines.  A big however, the ventilation of the kitchen is poor. Throughout the evening, the smelly smoke from the kitchen flowed into the whole restaurant, which clung onto our clothing after departure. In addition, the waiter service was excellent and formal, however initial time to take our order was 10 mins."}
{"text":"Tarbell's is at the top of the food chain here in Phoenix. In the dozens and dozens of times I have been here I have never been, nor have my guests ever been, let down.  The drinks are outstanding, the wine list well thought out, the menu a perfect mix that makes you think \"gee I wish I could have the Scotch Beef (best item on the menu) and Mark's Famous Spaghetti and Meatballs.\" Great News you can!  I will have a half order of this and a half order of that, and they say \"no problem!\"  Anyway, Mark Tarbell has created a special place that all should enjoy at least once; but I recommend not limiting yourself to just once.  Call for reservations, but keep in mind that the bar is a great place to have your meal as well..."}
{"text":"Bah.  I expected so much more.  Noca (one of my top 3 in AZ) is less than a mile away and I expected Tarbell's to be at least near the level of quality.  Now, I must say, the service was 5 stars (great server and charming Mr. Tarbell came by and chatted with us) However, the quality of what was on our table just simply wasn't there.    Two people in our party of three ordered off the restaurant week menu.  The fresh mozzarella appetizer was described as \"delicious, but lacking pesto\".  I ordered the Grilled Organic Salmon on Crispy Potato Cake molasses, lime, McClendon's honey.  The salmon was cooked to perfection and I thoroughly enjoyed the tangy glaze.  But OMG!!-- the crispy potato cake confused the hell out of me-- it tasted like burnt shoestring potato pieces.  Seriously. I expected crisp fritter or hash...something edible and not over-deep-fried.  Onto dessert.....I opted out, but the other 2 were given dessert with the restaurant week deal.  The mousse was terrific! (props to that) The doughnut holes were a letdown.  Like my potatoes, they where very overcooked.  In fact, one was ridiculously dark brown-- visibly over-fried.  We were kind of surprised it was even brought to our table like that.  For the price that we paid for average food, I really wished we would have gone across the street to Noca :(  Highlights:  service, atmosphere, mozzarella, mousse"}
{"text":"We're Brazilian. Well, my wife and her friends are (I've lived there for a decade) so we were amused to see Mark was doing a Sunday offering \"coxinhas\" - a brazilian \"street food\" thing that's difficult to fake. Simply amazing. I hope he does it again - best coxinhas we've ever had - including Rio de Janeiro."}
{"text":"First comment is we went in for a late dinner stayed beyond their closing time never a push a rush to leave. I really do not have one complaint the food was stellar The fish was excellent flaky delicious wine the waiter suggested was excellent everything was wonderful. Lastly I will comment about the staff everyone we met or encountered was pleasant!"}
{"text":"Incredibly pleasant surprise finding this gem owned by a chef who was on Iron Chef.  The menu was a great balance between seafood I love and non-seafood which my wife loves.  I initially chose this restaurant just for the grilled Caesar which was better than I thought it could be.  When our waiter Keith offered to give me a half portion of the lobster gnocchi and a 1/2 portion of the squid ink pasta instead of making me choose, I fell in love with the place.  Only thing better than that service was the taste of those two dishes which were INCREDIBLE!!!  Oh, the molten chocolate cake we had with salted caramel sauce topped this dinner off in a way I couldn't imagine.  Go have a great dinner at Tarbell's!"}
{"text":"This place is 5 stars.  a pillar of Phoenix eating"}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the pasta with bolognese sauce; very tasty. Bread pudding was divine. Service fair to partly cloudy. Table space is a bit tight. And, jaysus, does anyone put on decent garb to go out to dine anymore?  \"Let's see: just finished mowing the lawn. Shit, shower and shave? Nah, blow it off honey, I'll go with what I got on...\"  MadMen on AMC should be required viewing where men actually put on a necktie when going to someone else's home for dinner. Not that a tie is mandatory, but put on a collared shirt and a jacket in the winter time. Might actually lead an onlooker to believe you're doing well...hell, you'll believe it yourself after a while; funny how that works."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been here so I finally made a point to go!  Ambiance is great. I was on a date but I could have just have easily had a dinner with anyone here and it would have been perfect. The menu is not elaborate but very creative. My friend ordered the pasta and they offered to split two dishes for him so he could sample both. Great wine list. Not the best I've seen but you can definitely find a nice bottle.  Mark up is going to be ridiculous of course so find one you like and then get it at AJs or Total Wine.  The service was prompt and friendly. The table next to us was doing Grande Marnier flight which was different.  Dessert which we never skip was delicious! We had the mousse. I had the Scotch beef.  It was so tender and flavorful,  it just pulled apart on my fork. We also tried the pizza as an appetizer.  So good!  It was dim and quiet.  Some music played and there were plenty of servers.  Overall very nice place. Prices are a tad high comparatively.  Filet was about $49. But if it's a special occasion or, you're not paying,  definitely recommend! !"}
{"text":"Another amazing meal accompanied by amazing service! We started with sharing the caprese salad and beet salad, both very good. The homemade burrata was very creamy on very fresh plum tomatoes with a light pesto sauce. The beet salad with arugula was even better. The sweetest beets with fresh crisp arugula and creamy goat cheese with a very light dressing both were so large I was able to take some of the beet salad home to enjoy. For our entrees my husband had the NY strip; very tender, cooked perfectly medium rare delicious with a Cabernet reduction. He loved the accompanying  sides of creamed spinach and freshly cut, crispy pommes frites. I tried both and they were very good. The spinach wasn't overly creamed like some, just very light and perfectly seasoned. I had the gnocchi with lobster which had spinach and tomatoes in a light Parmesan cream sauce. It had several large pieces of lobster. Some pieces were large enough to cut with a knife and the lightest tender gnocci. We also had some additional sides, peas with multi-colored carrots all fresh and cooked perfectly still had some crispness and my favorite the tempura cauliflower, so crispy and delicious. I don't think I want to eat cauliflower any other way! For dessert we shared the cheesecake and it is wonderful! Light and airy but still very creamy and cheesy. Everything is large portions so we had plenty of take home boxes which made the next very special. Our waiter Allen was personable and really payed attention to all of requests taking notes along the way. He was attentive without be over-bearing. The perfect dinner. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little restaurant. It is on a busy corner with a small parking lot but once you are inside the ambiance is charming. There is an intimate dining area and a bar area so you can choose what you are in the mood for.  We were greeted and seated immediately in the dining area.  Our server, Audrey,  was fantastic. I noticed they have a nice wine selection, although I did not have a glass. They offer poutine and we could not turn down the temptation, so we had to start with that.  It was delicious! I wasn't thrilled when I saw how skinny the fries were but the taste was excellent. The menu offers an inviting selection of items and they offer daily specials.  We chose the salmon and the chicken.  The salmon had a sweet sauce which I liked and it was served on a bed of lettuce. The chicken was done perfectly and came with a side of creamy mashed potatoes that will make you want to have them every day.  Refills on waters were prompt and plates were cleared right away. My only regrets are not trying the scotch beef and not being hungry enough for what looked like some fabulous desserts. Guess we have to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in celebration of his recent promotion! Food was phenomenal as was the customer service! We will definitely be returning and recommending to others. Just a tip...BEST cheesecake we've ever had!!"}
