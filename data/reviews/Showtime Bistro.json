{"text":"Food was okay.  Price is between fast food and what I feel is a \"real\" restaurant.  It's kind of weird.  You get sat down and given a menu, then you have to get up and go to the desk to order, then sit down, then they call out your number and you have to walk across the restaurant to get your food, and walk back to where you sat down.  The food is served in plastic baskets with paper in it, you get plastic forks, and the food is okay.  I got the god father burger with a poutine, my girlfriend got a hail ceaser wrap and a poutine.  Her wrap was DRENCHED with sauce.  It filled the bottom of her basket.  The chicken was dry and over cooked.  My burger was good.  The pouting was alright.  The tables are dirty.    It was a very awkward situation.  We asked for glasses of water, but got no response, nor water.  May or may not come back."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends.  We ordered the jerk chicken poutine, the classic burger, and the showstopper (with only one pattie), and I ordered a smoked meat sandwich to go.   The smoked meat sandwich was very good.  The other two burgers were okay - the pattie was very dry for both. And the jerk chicken poutine was ok (it had too much mayo for our taste).  If I come back here again, I would probably just order the smoked meat sandwich.  If I didn't order the smoked meat sandwich, I would have given it two stars, but it was good. so it bumped the rating for me to 3 stars.   The service was good and friendly, and restaurant was clean and nice, but the other food items were okay, not amazing!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. Food is so over priced and not worth it. Did not taste great. Horrible customer service .. do not recommend"}
{"text":"Lets just start with the fact that it's not easy to find a truly halal proper burger joint. We found it folks! Burgers are amazing! And their Asian bites... I still think about them. I also want to give them the biggest rating for the Ferrero rocher shake. I will definitely be going back. The decor is nice as well. It's a clean place and I love the vibe!"}
{"text":"I visited Brampton for a week back in April, so my review is months late. BUT, given the fact that in a week I went there TWICE and am still craving their burgers and hot sauce like 6 months later, i think Showtime Bistro is worthy of a 5 star review.  What I had:  Main: Show Stopper and the Sixth Sense burgers.  Supporting (lol): Classic Poutine* and Greek Salad.  First of all, all their burgers can be had with a veggie patty making the whole burger menu pretty much vegetarian friendly (though some adjustment is needed). Huzzah for restaurants that are openly veggie friendly!!  Secondly, freaking all their ingredients are clearly fresh. The patty was a well-textured mix of grains and veggies. Nothing sloppy, nothing pasty, nothing crumbly about they patty. In fact, the patty was so succulent I am literally torturing myself writing this review :'( Oh my stars!   and third, but not least - THE MILLION ++ HOT SAUCE IS MASSIVELY HOT!!! I've never had a more perfectly balanced, delicious hot sauce in my life. It has 4 of the worlds hottest peppers ground with spices. I had a massive glob of it spread all over my burger (having no clue how hot this thing was) and it put me on a spice high for 3 hours. !!!DANG I CANT EVEN!!!  I miss this restaurant with all my veggie heart - please expand all over the world!!!  *One thing though, the poutine sauce is NOT vegetarian, so what we got was basically cheese fries :( This was a bit sad. But I have not yet found a single vegetarian poutine place in all of Canada - so I'm not even mad :)"}
{"text":"I went to show time bistro on a Monday after fasting all day and when I was ready to order I had found out that all their top sellers were out and we only had a limited selection. How are they out completely when the place was deserted? Well I guess I'll have to call in next time if I decide to go and see if their top sellers are available before going. #stockup"}
{"text":"Located on Markham Rd, minutes away from Islamic Foundation stands SHOWTIME! Not sure why they opted to go with that name, but the place is rather nice inside and outside. With a small town Planet Hollywood feel, you'll walk in and realize it's anything but.   For those of you following the Halal restaurant scene this is old A la Crepe dessert location which closed down not so long ago.  We waited 40 minutes for a table and were finally seated in the back left corner adjacent to the exit.  my kids ordered the Jerk Sandwich, my wife a Grilled Chicken burger and myself a Beef Burger. I had a bite of everyone's and have to say I'm not overly impressed. Bland beef, dark deep fried Jerk that came out hard and over all missing that lack luster feel. Each meal was about $11. Kinda steep for a mediocre burger and fries.   A few observations: No paper towel in the bathroom, nobody asks which dressing you woudl like with the garden salad and when being seated - patrons have 0 clue they need to get up and order, rather than being waited on....who exactly am i tipping? Even the utensils are self serve...  Service at the counters was decent enough. They could have been a bit friendlier but were quite attentive. The prices are higher than normal, but definitely reasonable, especially for the ambiance of the place. There is parking in the strip mall. I'd recommend coming here with a small intimate group."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken poutine wad really good! The chicken burgers are a bit on the dry side which i disliked. My friends had beef burgers and those looked really good. Service is okay!"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant on a weekend. Ofcourse i knew there may be a bit of a wait because its the weekend and there may be lots of people but for a 'quick style' bistro the wait was unacceptable. We waited 29 minutes for a burger and a wrap.   It wouldnt have been so bad if when the burgers came they were good but they barely had any thing on it, nothing was like it is in the pics actually. Ofcourse i know pics are always a bit more fancier and polished but we ordered the big show and there was no bacon no onions notning on there and the patty was dry.   I woulnt really go back just because nothing on the menu appealed to me and the food and service was horrible"}
{"text":"Very cool place!  Pros- Amazing food! I've been 2 times so far.  Free can refill Portion sizes are quite decent   Con- Size: I'd feel odd coming here with a big group because of the seating. Odd location to get to if your coming up from HWY48.   I got a burger this time and REALLY enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are the best! I recommend the Philly and the Po' Boy. You can see the ingredients are fresh and never from frozen. The chef himself will serve you as there are no dedicated wait staff. This is more of an upscale self serve place that is truly efficient and unique."}
{"text":"This is honestly my favourite burger spot! Not only is it halal but it's truly the best burger you'll ever have!! My personal favourite has to be the Mike Tyson Burger, highly recommend it! Iv also tried there poutine which is also really good! I highly recommend this place you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Took a little longer than most burger joints. The staff were friendly and the women at the counter asked if it was our first time (which it was) and she helped us through the menu. I ordered the six sense and upgraded the fries to poutine and my wife ordered the sliders. My wife really liked their hot sauces that they had on the side. Worth coming back again."}
{"text":"never again. We tried burgers, fries and short rib poutines- the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great new place serving specialty burgers. Loved their jerk chicken poutine. Lots of movies playing on the TV screens while classic film scores are filling the air. Feels nice to chomp down on a burger with the Superman theme playing in the background."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for hanging out with friends or having dinner with the family. They have lots of parking and seating in the dining room. The decor here looks pretty and they have quotes from movies on the wall. It's nice and bright for photos too.  The food here is all 100% halal. They've lot lots of burgers and poutines. They have a good selection of sandwiches to o and some entrees to choose from. The price per person is about $10-$20 depending what you choose to get. I would recommend the poutines. They're cheesy and saucy !   Make sure you save room for dessert ! Their milkshakes are pretty good !!"}
{"text":"Was there earlier today and left very impressed.  First off, plenty of parking available so no problem there.  One of the owners was there (apparently there was a change in ownership recently) and he was extremely helpful and patient. We had a party of almost 25 people so handling the whole crew was no small task - it was definitely good that we called ahead and reserved our tables.  We ordered several things off the menu and got a good sample of the various appetizers and burgers.  I thought the Mike Tyson burger was nothing short of excellent and the Showtime burger was huge. I didn't try the steak unfortunately but several of my group told me it was amongst the best they've had. I did have the Asian bites and they were really good.  The most surprising thing was how great the Ferrero Roche milkshake was. That thing was like a satisfying meal in itself. It seems they have a \"secret\" menu of limited time deals with ribs and different shakes so there will likely be different items to try next time.  Would definitely recommend this place and would be back in the future."}
{"text":"Went with my family for dinner. We ordered the following:   2 Fight Club sandwiches  Carne Asada  1 lb Wings with BBQ sauce  Big Show sandwich Sixth Sense sandwich   ----------------------  Here's the rundown. Showtime Bistro is fantastic and a must-try for those looking for something halal set in a modern cuisine. The sandwiches were flavourful and juicy. The highlight of the meal was definitely the Carne Asada. Mainly because we did not expect an appetizer dish to be so good. You have to order this! I had the Sixth Sense. The mushrooms were a great touch and overall, the sandwich was filling and well worth the $10.99. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised!!   The staff was very warm and friendly. And the food was just great!! I ordered the cool runnings burger and loved it. My sons kids meal was great too. The portions was amazing. And the waffle smore dessert was superb!!   This will become a regular for my family for sure!!"}
{"text":"great food (burgers and ribs were awesome!), you gotta try the milkshakes especially the ferrero rocher one! The service was amazing, they went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. Restaurant was clean also. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place on Uber Eats and the ferrero rocher milkshake is AMAZING. I try to avoid dairy as much as possible but this is the only exception because it's that good. It's a little on the pricey side ($7.50) but it's sooo worth it. I also tried their jerk chicken poutine the other day and it's easily the best in Scarborough (and that's saying a lot because there is tons of competition). Their hours are not that great if you have random cravings like I do but this place is well worth waiting until Thursday evening."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place received such low stars but I think it was very good. Yes it's a self serve thing... You have to pay before ordering maybe because a lot of people have dined and dashed... But who knows? As long as you have intentions of paying for your food then you're good! My brother had the steak which was so yummy!!!! Almost as good as the keg I had the sliders with beef bacon which was very nice as I don't eat regular bacon...  It was clean Washroom was clean (Incase it matters)  The owner was nice (I think he was the owner) he did check up on us to see if everything was ok Water was served in paper cups..  Not much to say Parking is available Go try it out!!!  It's halal!"}
{"text":"Showtime is beautifully decorated with cute movie quotes, classic movies playing on the screens (hence why it's called Showtime) I ordered the Fight Club, chicken was a little dry but the tangy sauce was delicious it helped balance it. I don't usually eat halal but the beef bacon on my chicken burger was yummy!"}
{"text":"My family bought home a burger and it was a little undercooked. I bought it back to the manager the next morning and she was so nice and friendly about it and she gave me a new chicken wrap for free!!! The service is so nice and the people here are amazing. I was sooo happy! The manager Stephanie is literally the best and the hail Caesar wrap was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Totally forgot to take advantage of the 10% off coupon - if you are reading this, remember to use it!  This is kind of a hidden gem and it makes the restaurant stand out within the plaza.  It's the kind of place you would go to casually catch up and have a tasty meal.  In particular i am giving my review based on the jerk chicken poutine that I enjoyed (yum and has a kick!) and also the waffles in the chicken and waffles.  Service was friendly and efficient, restaurant was clean and welcoming.  The biggest negative was that the caesar salad was drenched in sauce (which we could have done without). Otherwise, the burger was decent and tasted fresh.  It's more of a 3.5 stars in my books but I am all about supporting small local businesses. The waffles texture and bite is definitely one that you won't find anywhere else. Give it a try today and let me know how you like it :)"}
{"text":"Went back to show time after about 8 months and again they've changed the layout. Got rid of the booths and add few more tables. Again no longer order at counter now it's sit down. The menu has also been revamped with more options being offered. It's come far from the one pager they used to have about a year ago with only burgers. Now they've got fish and steak etc.  I got a show time burger came with wedges and wife got a steak wrap as well as wings as app. I was really surprised when I asked for a salad instead of fries and the waitress told me it would cost $4 more. I've never heard that anywhere. Funny thing is they used to offer salad or fries or wedges as sides no longer apparently. Really weird. However gotta say the wedges were crispy and delicious and man they gave maybe like 6 potatoes worth...it was slot. And the wings were delicious and good size. Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Walked in today around the late afternoon time, the place was very clean and had an interesting decor which was movie themed. The servers and staff were very friendly as well.   I ordered a \"Mike Tyson\" burger and I can honestly say it was amazing it came with a variety of toppings which included all of the basic stuff (onions tomatoes etc..) but it also had beef bacon and fried jalapeños  which I found delicious. I liked the fact that the jalapeños actually complemented the taste vs. just burning my mouth like it usually goes haha. Overall I had a very pleasant experience and thought the food was mouthwatering as can be seen in the picture."}
{"text":"Great underrated place. The first time I went it just opened it was alright but they have managed to improve their burgers. Really yummy now. Usually have their Mike Tyson burger. Beef Patty is soft and crumbles in mount and love the beef bacon and sauce , gives really rich flavour. Their jerk chicken poutine is just the best I have ever had and the serving is huge too. Everyone i take just looks at their? poutine and have a big smile on face.Only issue is  days they are open, it usually only Thur to sunday.highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My husband and I drove from Cambridge and strangely the restaurant was closed. The sign and the website said it was open until 10 and we came at 5 pm on a Sunday. Very confused as to why it was closed so early."}
{"text":"When we came in today (Tuesday evening) around 6:30PM, the place was empty.  I found the place is clean, and I like the decor. It is very movie-themed. They play movie soundtracks and there is an old movie playing as well on their TVs. I feel like this restaurant should be beside a Cineplex.   We chose our table, and you basically just have to come up to the front to place your order and pay. Once your order is ready, they call your order number and you pick it up in front and deliver it to your own table.  The prices are fair for what you get. My fiance got the short rib poutine ($10.99) and I got the sliders ($9.99). We requested waters and the server just gave us very tiny cups of water which I finished in one gulp. That wasn't good. I should have just ordered a bottle of water.  Short rib poutine - a big serving for $10.99! The short rib poutine is actually spiced! The sauce and the spice of the meat has overpowered everything else in the poutine, unfortunately. After a while the food gets tiresome, as the fries and cheese curds taste like the sauce, you don't get to taste the individual tastes of cheese curds / fries anymore.  Beef sliders - these are awesome and they taste good. This is a much recommended item from their menu. The patties are a good size and they are very flavorful, and I like that their sliders come with many different toppings!  I would definitely come back, as I find their service and ambiance wonderful. I can't help but name all the songs being played and figure out which movie each song is from, as they play movie soundtracks all day long. Wait time is minimal, I think we only waited about 5-6 minutes for our food.  Review 65 of 100"}
{"text":"Went there again for a dinner and I really don't see what people like about this place.  The poutine felt like it was made from frozen fries, the jerk chicken sauce and stuff is still good, but the fries were a major turn off.  We got burgers too this time, the buns were chewy and hard and the meat was tasteless and super dry. The final product was so bad it would give shitty bar food a run for its money."}
{"text":"Great food. The Mike Tyson burger was really tasty! Very nice customer service. The only downside was that the waiting time for the food was a bit long."}
{"text":"Horrible food burgers were dry no flavour I cook a better burger on my BBQ. Ordered a sandwich with beef bacon they charged me $15 and gave me literally a small shred. I can say the toppings were fresh but that's where it ends. Would not return."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night with my fiancé and it might just be our new favorite restaurant. Service was amazing, even the owners came out to greet us! Best burgers in town!"}
{"text":"We've been told to visit this place on many occasions and always put it off but tonight we finally did it! And we are def glad we did!   I had the steak wrap without the Cajun rice and my husband had the Tyson burger. Nothing was bland, or unpleasant.   Right from the jump things were good.. got seated within seconds from walking in the door. Our waiter was on top of things! It was quick and professional.   The only downside (which is totally okay still) they ran out of sweet potato fries ."}
{"text":"Service 1* Food 4* Ambiance 3* Sampled - Prime rib meal, a burger with beef bacon, prime rib poutine, one of the salads. Consistency is important so if it's good the next couple of times I'd give it a higher score. Prime rib was awesome. Burger above average. Poutine was good. Salad was just okay.  Service here is horrendous in my opinion.  I went a second time for take out my order was wrong they did nothing to accommodate an took 40 mins to make it right.  The layout isn't great for what their trying. You shouldn't have to be battling a line up of ignorant brown people to get around to your seats.  I recommend trying this place thats what's important don't expect a lot out of anything else."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers! I got the sixth sense with fries and a rootbeer $15. I like the feel of the place, clean and simple. Pretty slow area though since there's not many restaurants around the area. No problem with parking lol"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I ordered the chicken shawarma poutine. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be BLAND. The chicken was dry and didn't taste or look like what shawarma should've looked like. Also, they used this hot sauce all over the dish, which completely overpowered the taste of cheese curds and gravy.   I'm not sure how clean this restaurant is. Halfway through my meal, I watched one of the employees wipe something off the floor, then wipe the table with the SAME cloth afterwards."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently got taken over by new owners. I was really hesitant on going in because I didn't have the best experience when the previous owners were running this restaurant- in other words, I had a few bad experiences.   I heard a lot of good things so I decided to go on in. As soon as I entered I was greeted and taken to a table. The staff were all very pleasant and offered to give recommendations as I hadn't ordered from their new menus.   I ordered the jerk chicken poutine, chicken bites, Tyson burger and Fererro Milkshake.  Poutine- this involved ooey-gooey cheese, and lots of it  It was delicious but massive so I'd recommend sharing   Chicken bites - these were addictive! I recommend ordering these as an appetizer, you won't be disappointed.  Tyson burger - you could see the juice as you bite into your burger. You can tell they use good quality meat.   Fererro Milkshake - I can confidently say that if you have this Milkshake, you will want to go back.. again and again. I'm currently craving it  The good vibes and food will definitely take me back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken poutine! Huge portion size and very tasty. We also loved the Ferrero rocher milkshake!"}
{"text":"We walked in today (Saturday) at lunch time.  The waitress said they didn't have any salads or sandwiches.  She said that they only have salads when they're busy otherwise the vegetables get old sitting out.  That's pretty rediculous and she actually said it like it made complete sense to her.  Tables weren't clean and floors were sticky even though we were the first ones in the restaurant today.  I ordered the wrap which had cold rice in it.  I should have tried the burger instead since that is more popular apparently.  The real kicker is that when we were leaving she was eating a sandwich that I'm fairly sure was from there.  I think they have limited options when it's not busy.  Really unprofessional."}
