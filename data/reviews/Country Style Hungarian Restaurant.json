although, last time i was there i had a coffee and a tasty pastry. defs gonna hit it up asap.

{"text":"I've never written a yelp review, but the good rating of this restaurant led me so far astray that I felt I needed to. The food here is over priced and poor quality. Everything tastes manufactured, not wholesome or \"home-style.\" The bread is so bad it might as well be sliced wonder bread, I've tasted better beets out of a Bick's jar, and the potatoes were dry and over cooked. I'm sure the meat in my schnitzel was cheap and crappy like everything else here. It was like the Hungarian equivalent to McDonalds. Oh, and they take cash ONLY, but they don't tell you that until you're finished your meal and ready to pay. There's no sign about it anywhere. Step up your game guys, if you're going to charge $19 for a meal buy better ingredients, this isn't a $5 meal at Denny's!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Great food, big portions. Closed in August for renovations. Will reopen in September. Can't wait."}
{"text":"This was the largest piece of schnitzel I have eaten outside of the Middle East. 

I really go there for the schnitzel, but have also eaten the perogies which come with some seriously fried onions on the side.  This is not the healthiest menu and I didn't see too many salads around the place, but who cares?  That is not why one eats here.

The portions are as big as everyone is saying and the prices are cheap.  

The best part is that as soon as you enter, you go back in time.  This place has not been affected by any kind of trends or gentrification.  The decor is awesome and the people friendly.

My parents remember coming here when they moved to Toronto in the early 1970's and were just starting out.  We took my dad back there for dinner a while back and it looked exactly as he remembered."}
{"text":"Good food. The schnitzels are delicious.
Tripe goulash is good, but too much tripe and not enough potatoes or rice to soak up that delicious stew. I'm not saying to cut down on the amount of tripe, maybe just need more potatoes and/or rice to compliment the tripe goulash. Perogies are good, hits the spot when craving perogies. I could eat 3 plates of their perogies, they should make a large order of perogies.

Beet salad, canned? Cucumber salad is better, potatoes are deep fried, kinda like standard greasy-spoon style deep fried home fries.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Recently went to Country Style after not having been there in a long time.  Nothing has changed...and that's a good thing!  The food is great as always - had the schnitzel (which is bigger than the platter it arrives on) as well as the pickled cucumbers and the goulash as sides.  This place always delivers quality food and a friendly atmosphere.  Love it!"}
{"text":"People were nice. Food was OK. Definitely not what I consider Hungarian since it lacked the spice usually found in Hungarian food. Asked the waitress if they had some Paprika paste I could use to spice things up, they said they were more of a family restaurant and the stronger spices didn't go over very well with the younger group.

Still in search of a Hungarian restaurant in Toronto. I do enjoy going back to Budapest where I can rely on authentic Hungarian food as opposed to Canadianized Hungarian food.

Good people & food, definitely belongs on the alternative list of places to eat."}
{"text":"OPEN FOR BUSINESS after a much needed renovation!! Fantastic Hungarian food! Order the Wooden Board to have a taste of their most popular and delicious items! Don't forget to try the goulash and paprikash!"}
{"text":"The Goulash soup was way too salty (and I like salt), the schnitzel was okay, and the portion was very large, but we had to keep asking for more lemon. Man were they stingy with the lemon. 

Also, it was way too hot in there. Unbearable really. It ruined any enjoyment I could have had."}
{"text":"Love those cabbage rolls with sauer kraut! It's perfect. Melt in your mouth savoury goodness. 
I want some more :)


Schnitzel is as thin as it gets. Crust is crunchy. Flavours are subtle. 

Apple strudel is passable. Small portion, apple is like a thick puree/jam... pastry skin tasted.. a bit flour-like.

Crepe has a really satisfying texture! It's delicate and light, yet thick and a bit sticky-doughy (not paper thin like French kinds). We tried the walnut filing and I wasn't a fan of the crunchy granulated sugar. Next time I'll go for something smoother.

________________________________________________________________

Cute, family cottage-style decor. 

Service was inattentive at times. 

Comfy atmosphere with regulars.

Clean and private single room bathrooms with shared sink upstairs.

20$ for main dishes."}
{"text":"3.5-4. We only had the combo schnitzel platter that came with 2 kinds and all kind of sides. Highly recommended for your first try at this place. Large, crispy tender schnitzel and moist tasty cabbage roll. The only let down was the mush of rice. Maybe its suppose to be like that, I don't know. The decor is from another era, and  service was almost non- existing, but the food really makes up for it. Cash only."}
{"text":"This place is really fantastic!  We come here regularly and have never been disappointed.  The food is awesome and the portion sizes are huge.  

Would recommend any of the schnitzels, the chicken paprikash, and the goulash. Make sure to order dumplings and a side of cucumber salad with the meal. Yum. I've been to Hungary and can say that they do Hungarian food justice here.

The staff is always pleasant; there is one server (blonde hair) who always goes above and beyond and is seriously one of the nicest people you could ever meet.  I like the old-skool, homey feel in here--it's never pretentious.  

Bonus: the menu prices include tax, which helps a lot--especially for groups."}
{"text":"Ah Hungarian food. Although this place has had a few changes in ownership over the years, it's still a staple on Bloor St.  -  I've been going there for 20 years!  Why - well other than experimenting with how much sour cream one can consume without their arteries seizing up, this place dishes out some of the best, hearty food one can manage to enjoy on any given day.   The food is inexpensive and down home, good.  You can't go wrong with the cabbage rolls. However, if you're feeling like living on the edge - try the meat platter."}
{"text":"Puts the boring, bland, and entirely uninteresting coffee mill to shame.

Mega-portions of heart clogging goodness abound in this place.  Last time with a group of 3, we ordered the wooden plate of 2:  fistfulls of bacon, and a stack of schnitzel's about a foot across and a foot wide.  The 3 of us combined barely ate half - took the rest to go and literlly had days of good food left over.

On other occasions tried and enjoyed the cold cherry soup (summer only usually) and strudels.  Service is pretty solid as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant - authentic AND delicious Hungarian food. My family and I ordered a bunch of different items off the menu, and they were all fantastic. I must say that the breaded cheese and the veal stew were my favourite, off the entrees. The desserts were also delicious - tastes just like Hungary. 

Only feedback is that the meals didn't come at the same time, and that some entrees came before appetizers."}
{"text":"So happy places like this still exist in Toronto. Be warned: the serving sizes are huge. I'd recommend sharing. We shared an appetizer of cabbage rolls, then a main of Wiener Schnitzel (with dumplings). The schnitzel comes with perfectly pickled cucumbers. Beer. Strudel for dessert. Perfect meal on a cold night. It was also very busy and lively, which I enjoyed. Cash only but they have an ATM."}
{"text":"Good Day. This restaurant is a gem that at no time needs polishing!  The restaurant delivered on many levels and it was a great pleasure to dine there.  From the moment we walked in we were treated like family arriving home for a truly wonderful meal.  The wait staff was extremely accommodating and very professional.  We ordered our meal and then the magic began!  The chicken liver dumpling soup was ethereal with the the incredible dumplings and home made chicken broth.  I could not stop breathing in the incredible stock from my hot bowl of soup.  The dumplings were rustic and extremely delicious as if I had the luxury of being in Hungary indulging myself.  The breaded mushrooms were the best I have ever had and the portion size was large.  The cabbage rolls contained more ground meat than rice which one doesn't find very often. I encourage anyone who is a true lover of traditional Hungarian food to set a few hours aside for a real quality Hungarian feast!"}
{"text":"This was the fourth time I was at Country Style. I usually come here with my fiancé and her parents. They are Hungarian and they like this restaurant.
Ambiance 4/5
This is the typical Hungarian étterem, the ambiance reflect a true Hungarian style: white walls and wood finishes. 
Food 5/5
Excellent and traditional food. Their most famous dish is the Wooden Platter: 2 types of fried meat, sausage, house potatoes, 2 sides and stuffed cabbage. It is tasty and very filling. It can be ordered for 2 or 4 people. I recommend other plates: peas soup is delicious, the gypsy steak is the perfect combination of rustic flavors and (if you like) the tripe goulash is an explosion of flavors. In addition, portions are huge. Dinner for 4 is on average $80, be aware they only accept cash. 
Service 2/5
They are very warm and welcoming but they are a bit slow in taking orders or refilling your glass. Improving service would help."}
{"text":"Update: I moved away from Toronto in 2011. One of the things I've consistently missed is Country Style Hungarian. I'm on a visit to Toronto and so of course I made a beeline for CSHR. It's better than ever: the food is still every bit as awesome, but they've gone through and done a thoughtful renovation. New floor, new ceiling, newly-painted walls, new light fixtures, new table cloths. The place is sparkling clean and not so dark as before. I'd still give it six stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Huge portions. 

First found this place after googling \"biggest meals in Toronto\". 
Does not disappoint. 

There are a few non-meat items on the menu- but the big draw here is schnitzel. Weiner, chicken, Parisian, Hunter style, etc etc. Food comes out on big wood plates with knives stuck on it. Three of us shared a special combo for two. Lady says it serves 4. I guess Hungarians eat twice as much as other people.

Cash only - but all prices include tax (#winning). You can be massively full- and satisfied with what you ate for about 20 bucks including tax and tip. 

Lots of character."}
{"text":"Having been a past customer for over 20 years, I have watched Country Style Hungarian Restaurant go downhill and now it is just pathetic, surviving only due to its past customers and because it's the only Hungarian restaurant left in the Bathurst-Bloor area.

One person is graced with a basket of two allotted pieces of tasteless, stale bread.  They always served REAL SOURDOUGH bread in the past, but the owner just wants to charge more and give garbage.

The side dishes are now served in TINY TINY bowls, like the beet salad.  PATHETIC.  Cheap, cheap owner makes portions smaller every year.

The potatoes ARE DEEP FRIED, not grilled, and the portion is now ALSO TINY, like the bread & sides.  The meat is ONLY PORK.

$18.95 for a couple deep fried pieces of potato and a piece of flattened pork.  Absolutely no value.  The Goulash is AS TASTELESS AS WATER because it IS watered down to stretch the owner's dollar farther, as with everything else here.

NOTE RE SALT SHAKERS:  They have SALT shakers on the tables with HUGE holes.  You literally RUIN your schnitzel and they won't be replacing it for free either!

To the owner:  You should be ashamed, emptying your histrionic patrons' pockets every day, charging them more every 365 days, while giving them much, much less with each passing year.

The schnitzel breading is the only good thing about this place, which is now just an old, dusty dive with a cheap, lazy, uninspired owner."}
{"text":"Un excellent petit restaurant de tradition hongroise au cas où vous ne l'auriez pas compris. C'est un décor assez kitsch, on dirait quelque chose d'importé de la Hongrie d'avant la chute du mur de Berlin. Les photos accrochées au mur doivent dater des années 50, qu'importe vous êtes venus ici manger un bon schnitzel et des pâtes hongroises ! C'est frit, c'est copieux mais c'est excellent par un soir d'automne ou d'hiver. Attention, ici on ne paie que comptant, chose devenue rare à Toronto."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night. They seemed surprised customers actually came in. Food was very so so but high profit margin for them. Poor decor..."}
{"text":"Traditional Hungarian done right. I love this place for classics like the chicken liver dumpling soup, the cabbage rolls, paprikás, schnitzel, cucumber soup, it is almost reliving my Hungarian childhood. On top of all the great food is the Pálinka selection; they have all the best flavours. I recommend a shot before, during and after the meal in the real Magyar way!"}
{"text":"Welcome back! And congratulations on the reno's - the place is bright and spotless. 

Came here for a Sunday lunch recently, and it definitely hit the spot after a night out. The meals were the sizes of our torsos. My boyfriend ordered the schnitzel and I ordered chicken paprikash. The schnitzle has a delightfully crispy, thick batter and came with a wedge of lemon. I am a lemon lover, so we ordered up some more and it was no issue. The accompanied potatoes were so crisp on the inside, yet fluffy on the outside. My paprikash was very tender, but a bit under seasoned. With a bit of salt, pepper and paprika (all already on the table), the dish did liven up. The dumplings are a nice and different side that you should most certainly try. Each meal also comes with a salad, so we had coleslaw and beets. Classic tastes! Lightly dressed and pickley. 

Service is prompt and courteous- feels like a family is running the place? A proper meal!"}
{"text":"I can barely give this place two stars because Country Style is incredibly lazy for what they do. They owe us more because they should know better.

The concept is great - solid, tasty and filling European food you would find from roughly that part of the world. The prices just don't fit with that part of the world, they have gotten out of control. I also think the food quality is very inconsistent - sometimes even bad, with often re-heated, flavorless and long-frozen ingredients. They are slacking to Toronto standards, settling for the mediocre. So the concept fails because they really don't deliver fresh amazing Hungarian cuisine for an affordable price, or certainly at least not anymore. Maybe they were better 20 years ago when I lived up the street? Maybe, too they should hire a manager to make this place the much better tribute to Hungarian kitchen it could be.

Honestly the Country Style has become very run down and looks like a dump now, which is a pity. Pass and try Polonez on Roncesvalles, that's where I'm heading when I miss the approximate food styles of East Germany Hungary Austria Czech and Poland - food I know well enough from my many visits overseas."}
{"text":"Not as good a value as it used to be back in the 80s. Disappointed - the lunch priced as dinner pricing.
The Wiener schnitzel is their key dish and still good however not worth $12.50 for a sandwich and 6 potatoes. 
It's unfortunate as this place used to be a key university student stop but pricing themselves out of that market."}
{"text":"Liked it but didn't love it.

Really large portion sizes - the wooden meat platter for 4 was enough to feed six (although, of course we ordered other dishes too, so maybe it would be sufficient if it you really are ordering just the platter for four people).  I found the schnitzel to be dry, and the cabbage rolls were bland.  Ditto the goulash.

Decent enough for the prices though, and they definitely don't skimp on the meat.
Would recommend the cucumber salad as a palate cleanser if you're going for the platter, it's a welcome vegetable break!"}
{"text":"I'm Hungarian so maybe I'm biased because when I need a taste of home, I need it! Country Style has been my go to forever and a home away from home for my Hungarian family when they visited. Cozy atmosphere, huge (and I mean huge!) servings of hearty, rich, flavorful food with definite love put into it, prompt, friendly service, reasonable prices, delicious. Perfect really."}
{"text":"Goulash is watered down and tasteless. Chicken paprikash has almost no paprikash in it. I have been to Budapest 3 times and if you have been to Hungary you will definitely be disappointed. I went in with little expectation but they are definitely worse than I imagined."}
{"text":"A good spot for dinner! Good food, big portions! Price is almost fair. The staff are fast and caring. It's a bit tight in there but that's ok I think :)"}
{"text":"Had schnitzel and fish. Very disapointing meal. Big plates but tasteless food. May have been unlucky with choices. Place was packed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a lot longer than I would like to admit. For me, this place is all about the Hungarian Goulash and the cabbage rolls. I've  never found better but I also don't go looking for it, this place satisfies me when I get the rare craving.  The décor is very dated, old and old style but comfortable. If you like big portions (I don't) and the comfort of home while dining out then this place will do you fine."}
{"text":"The place is a dump...but the food is great...and the portions are huge...you'd think you were in middle America!"}
{"text":"I am half Hungarian so I think that I know my schnitzel, and it was very good!  Moist, tender, crispy breading, and cooked to near perfection!  I had the veal schnitzel along with dumplings and beet salad.  Everything was as it should be!  However the service was so-so.  The female server was not very friendly and barely said hello!  She seemed to be extremely run off her feet.  As the restaurant is a very tight squeeze it seemed amusing!  We expected some type of bread while we were waiting for our meal, which was only brought to our table when we asked for it!  My iced tea came 10 minutes later and finally our beet salad was served.  It would have been nice if the server could have been more interactive, perhaps asking if we had ever been there before or what we thought of the renovations.  Since I am disabled I was annoyed that I had to climb at least 18 steps to get to the washroom.  This establishment is not disability friendly!  We ordered the palancinta(crepe) for dessert and it was a bit charred and only one crepe was given although we expected two for the price.  My mother had the dobos torte and it was good however the frosting was not textbook, as it tasted like a typical birthday cake frosting from Metro.  My homemade dobos torte has a bittersweet chocolate frosting with a bit of strong coffee and brandy.  I will return to this establishment however I am hoping that the service improves."}
{"text":"They can easily double business if they just make a couple of changes.

Went there on a Wednesday evening because it was recommended by my friend last week while I was eating a Schnitzel. She said it's pretty good here. So I booked it with 4 friends to come here.

Place is nice and clean, what you would expect in a restaurant in the Annex. Nothing fancy which is fine as we came for the Schnitzel. As you can see from the countless photos that the presentation is very good. While there were 5 of us we order the big party one which serves 3-4, it was just enough where we were not bloated. 

As we were eating I noticed it was very dried and didn't taste too good. So I finally walked up to the server because she wasn't looking this way all night. (Bad service, more on that) I asked for ketchup and if there were any sauce for it, she was surprised and offered something. I didn't what it was but i tried it anyways and it made it taste very good. It should have been included in the meal.

Lastly the service was horrible. The place wasn't very busy and the server didn't have a lot of things to do, she stood at the front of the restaurant with her back to all the tables doing nothing really. This was very annoying because I had to constantly keep looking up to see if I can wave her down. After 15 minutes I just stood up and walk towards her.

This is a good place to try something different and it wasn't expensive, I would go back again if I want something different.

{"text":"My partner and I have been eating at Country Style for at least 5 years now. This is our #1 spot when we crave home-made, comfort-style Eastern European food. The staff is always very friendly and reasonably fast, the decor is welcoming and casual. The bathroom (upstairs) is always very clean.

The food, however, is the main reason we love this place. Their menu, while not extensive, features some of the staples of Eastern Europe/Hungary, including: goulash soup, schnitzels, cabbage rolls, and jam-filled crepes. The portions are generally huge, so bring your appetite, or plan to doggy-bag some for home. We are specially fans of their goulash soup, although we've enjoyed everything we tried on the menu. We also always enjoy the distinct bread (light-rye, I think) they serve with the food.

We even had the opportunity of taking a Hungarian there, who vouched for the authenticity of the food."}
{"text":"Went last night after having been there a long time ago and was saddened to see the front windows were papered up...looks like they've closed they're doors for good sorry I didn't get there sooner....it WAS great food!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times now and gotta say, it's a great little place for some real good, home cooked comfort food.

There must have been a renovation from the last time I was there (a few years ago) because the decor seemed slightly updated. Gotta admit, I liked the older decor a little better. It used to feel like I was in a neighbour kitchen back when I was a kid! It's more restauranty now. 

We ordered perogies, cabbage rolls and schnitzel to share and holy cow...you better show up with an appetite!! There was enough food for 4 people!! Everything was amazing and I couldn't really pick a favorite...ok probably the torso sized schnitzel! Nice and thin, super tender and fried to a perfect golden crisp. 

I would definately recommend this place and will certainly be back for some good old fashioned home cooking!"}
{"text":"We were here for dessert last week; Creamish (sp?) and pureed Chestnut. Evidently, it's genuine Hungarian. It's ok. definitely not addictive or somewhere i'd go again, but it was good for what it is that night"}
{"text":"Living in downtown Toronto, we get tired of the newer places that try to be so fancy and chic. A lot of residents prefer a family owned, simple place like Country Style. It's not fancy, but the food is simply amazing. Huge portions of deliciously cooked Schnitzel. With the meal you get dumplings or mashed taters, and beets or cole slaw. Meat lovers share the big platter with a variety of schnitzel, sausage, cabbage roll, etc. The prices on the menu include tax, so that's nice too. No surprises with the bill. Just a great place! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I first went to Country Style with my dad sometime in the early 1970s. The food has hardly changed, although the menu has been streamlined - try the schnitzels, the stews, the soups (the chicken soup is the ultimate comfort food), and the dumplings (nokedli or spaetzli), and if you can manage it, the palacinta (similar to a sweet crepe), the dobos (a torte made of alternating thin layers of cake and buttercream), the rétes (strudel), or the kr?mes (cream and pastry cream between layers of millefeuille). If you're adventurous about booze, try Unicum/Zwack (an herbal, slightly bitter, very strong digetif), or one of the pear pálinkas (distilled liquor) or Csaszarkorte (incredibly sweet pear liqueur), which you can't usually get at the LCBO.

The portions are now only large rather than truly impossible, but everything tastes just the same. The mid-70s decor has been (thank god) updated, and the place has a clean, simple hominess to it. 

(So long ago ... after lunch at Country Style me & dad went over to Honest Eds and bought a set of miniature screwdrivers, multicoloured, jewel-like, in a little plastic box, which for some reason struck me as magical. Ed's is gone now, but CS lives on.)."}
{"text":"Last of a dying breed. After the revolution in 1956 thousands of Hungarians were accepted as refugees into Canada and a lot of them opened restaurants and delis on Bloor between Bathurst and Spadina.
 There must have been 10 of them in the mid-70s when I started going there. My favourite was the Korona. They had the best [ie biggest] Transylvanian Wooden Platter, aka \"heart attack on a cutting board\".
 Only Country Style has survived, surrounded by endless nondescript sushi bars and vegan joints. The food is authentic and the portions are enormous. I usually go for the Parisian schnitzel and dumplings, although the large goulash soup is also gut-bustingly satisfying. It's totally unpretentious, from the rather cheesy \"decor\" to the \"cash only\" policy and the dineresque service.
 If you want to fill up for the day [and tomorrow], go there for lunch and you're set. I'll miss it if/when they throw in the paprikash."}
{"text":"About 25 years ago, on a cross country road trip, me and a friend ended up in Toronto for a few weeks. Since we didn't have much cash, we rarely went to 'fancier' places. So it was a real treat when we walked into a well-appointed Hungarian place and ordered what I remember was a 'Transylvanian Wooden Platter\". The platter was as advertised, wooden, and huge and loaded with schnitzel.  Two steak knives were driven into the top - the knife handles were stacked to the limit with onion rings. It was a memorable meal. 

I recently was reminded of this when I came across an article on Torontoist celebrating the days when Toronto had a big Hungarian food scene which was known cheekily as \"the goulash archipelago\" The article triggered a long dormant sense memory. 

http://torontoist.com/2015/03/vintage-toronto-ads-a-taste-of-hungary/

But it turns out that one of the last of these Hungarian places is Country Style. And although it isn't the same place I went to all those years ago, I decided that we needed to check it out. 

Our visit started out a bit rough. It was a cold night this past January and we had been walking all over with a couple of visitors from out of town. We were cold and hungry and had already missed the place and walked several blocks out of our way. When we went in it was very busy and we had to wait by the front door. We were approached promptly and told there was a 15-20 minute wait. There were 5 of us - so a bad number to get a table at the best of times. We watched as parties of two came and went, and the parties at bigger tables lingered over conversation and wine dregs - their plates long since finished. The time past slowly, the aromas and sights of food mocked us. It wasn't Country Style's fault that I was so hungry, but I was getting very annoyed. After more than 45 minutes I was starting to rally the team to leave in a huff. But miraculously a table freed up. Once seated the service was friendly and efficient. All my previous aggravation melted away with the first glass of Hungarian red. 

As a group we ordered a nice selection of the menu and it was all very satisfying. The schnitzel is great, the fried potatoes are awesome, spatzle dumplings are tasty. The platter for two is very reminiscent of that platter I had all those years ago - knives sticking out from a pile of food. A good time was had by all and we immediately talked of a return trip. 

Since we had lots of time to stand checking out the other patrons, we noted that the crowd that visits Country Style is curious. It really feels like a lot of long time regulars, mixed with inter-generational groups, family units, and a smattering of curious hipsters.

This is a long way around to say that the food and the service and the feeling of the room, really turned our chilly moods around. We grabbed a couple of strudels on the way out and had them the next day. They were very good."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday with a large group. The restaurant was just bustling. So packed and the turnover of the tables were quick because of the efficient service. The restaurant was fairly small but had a nice homey feel. 

Moving onto the food, this was the first time trying Hungarian food and I guess I realized that I am not really a schnitzel person. It was good but it mostly batter which was kinda alright. The portions however are massive but you also pay like Westernized prices where your average plate is $20. You can easily share your plate with another and get an appetizer on the side. But..yes...only come here if you are a fan of schnitzels."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to go against the grain on this one, I can't even bring myself to give it a three.

I paid $20 for a very bland, very tasteless chicken schnitzel sandwich. The menu seemed very limited without a whole lot of options.

The service was also very poor. Generally poor dispositions from the staff and slow to bring food, refill drink, etc.c"}
{"text":"Nice place.
I have gone here before, and a few times I wanted to go back, but I kept thinking the prices were too high (there is a menu in the window, with the prices)
But last night, my want for schnitzel outweighed my cheapness, 
The meal started off with a nice basket of bread.
Then I chose the coleslaw, and my girlfriend chose the beets (you get a choice of starter with each meal)
We ordered a starter of deep fried mushrooms, they were great, and not oily at all, my only suggestion would be to offer a large and a small (it was big enough for a meal)
I had seen the hunter schnitzel on a tv show, so I ordered that, it was not the same as the tv version, but it was huge, and good.
I had dumplings with it, I couldn't finish them, there was just too much fod.
My girlfriend ordered the chicken schnitzel along with mashed potatoes.
It was really good, however she ended up taking 2/3 of it home.

It is sad that we were so full, the desserts looked amazing. 
Ah well, next time.

The service was quick and friendly, the place was pretty busy, but we were never ignored."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here! I come from a Hungarian background (father is Hungarian and cooks it too) and I have to say this is the BEST Hungarian place left in and around the city! The prices are resonable and the amount of excellent food is amazing! Fresh, Homemade and fast!  By far one of our favorite places to go to!
Goulash Soup, Veal Paprika, Cabbage Rolls...all are EXCELLENT! The desserts are homemade, and look amazing but I am always too full to try them..lol."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The schnitzel is particularly good. The restaurant only accepts cash payment."}
{"text":"I spontaneously went here with a friend many years ago after a Hot Doc screening.  We had never been and went with some huge combo of various fried foods.

If you like fried food, and a lot of it, this combo is for you.  After a while I found that it was a bit bland; I think we left half of it behind.  

My memory is that the service was good and the decor fine.  It is a pretty neat place.  And yes, it really stands out among all of the same ol' sushi places on this part of Bloor.  

I don't recall this being a cheap place.

I would like to try it again but I would go with something more reasonable.  As in, just a regular plate.  At any rate, it is one of those places you should try on Bloor.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food but.... Yikes!!! They don't take credit cards!!!   Travel a lot and first restaurant in many years that does not take plastic.  Gave 3 stars for that. Threw me for a loop...  Went to machine but USA cards do not yet have chips so was not able to get cash.  Had USA cash but was told that even though the rate was 1.27 they would not do the exchange. Too bad,  all I had was $40 USD and the bill was $45 Canadian.  Gave them the $40 because it covered the bill.  
This made me very cautious rest of trip but even the fast food restaurants took plastic."}

Service is fine for the kind of restaurant it is, but you don't come here for the atmosphere...you come here for the food.  Save room for strudel, you'll be glad you did.  I love making time to eat here whenever I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here as a family to try the schnitzel platter.  The experience overall was fun but perhaps because I had high expectations; seeing great reviews of Toronto's highly rated cutlet places - but it was A-OK.   It's in the annex so you can park near one of the side streets and head in.  A good try.

Food: 3/5, we got the massive platter of different schnitzel pieces, potatoes, rice, cabbage rolls and  bread.  The bread that we began the meal was stale - which was disappointing.  Then we got the massive platter which was visually appealing.  The taste however was relatively bland which wasn't the best.  The potatoes were just normal and the rice and beets were fine.  The cabbage rolls however were the best part of the meal which was surprising since that's not we had came here for.

Service: 2/5, not much here, they bring the food and never return.  Paying at the end of the meal was somewhat of a hassle.

Ambiance, 2/5, very old school and things falling off the falls and diner (red/white checkered) tables.  It's not fancy at all but it's ok.

Price: 3/5, the food was alright but for the service/ambiance at the level it was, not sure if it was worth $20 per person.  The portions are good but I'd rather have better experience overall."}
{"text":"Go here often with my girlfriend. We both love it. The decor is maybe a bit outdated but the food definitely makes up for it.  The fried mushrooms are incredible and the tartar sauce served with it make the mushrooms even better. If you still have tartar left with from the appetizer mushrooms I would hold onto it for your main course schnitzel. We often have trouble choosing main courses so we usually go with the wooden plate which has a great assortment of the food from the menu.  Oddly after years and years of the wooden plate being listed on the menu as plate for 1 (that really was the plate 2) and the plate 2 (that was really plate for 4) they have decided to fix the menu and properly show them as plate for 2 and plate for 4.  Highly recommend this place as a good affordable restaurant. Especially if looking for a restaurant before going out for some drinks in one of the many area bars."}
{"text":"So comforting and for a great cost.
The food isn't mind blowing, but \"just\" really good and with huge portions - definitely worth more than the price you'll pay."}
{"text":"Been around forever and is my family's favorite restaurant. We love the family platter especially the cabbage rolls and schnitzel. Save room and reserve your custard before it sells out. heaven!"}
{"text":"Another time warp restaurant. The owners have obviously not put a dime of their profits back into the restaurant. Got the impression some Hungarian family recently purchased the business, all the service staff are young daughters of the same family. As many young people are want to do these days, providing service is definitely secondary. Realized that the folks clogging up the entrance smoking were the service staff, both as we entered and again as we left.
Extremely limited menu with almost zero explanation of what was included. Sides were miniscule little bowls of coleslaw or beets. Prices definitely not competitive with other Hungarian restaurants (Polonez for example) Really bland tastes, way too much bouillon cubes provides more salt that real flavour. 
No credit cards taken, tax included, means that a lot of sales don't make it onto the books."}
{"text":"Walking in, the first thing I noticed was a very familiar smell...it was the smell of every church potluck I'd ever been to in my life.  Needless to say, that is high praise for a restaurant.

The second thing one notices is the decor. Despite having allegedly recently undergone a renovation, there is nothing particularly eye-catching about the space. It is long and narrow with group tables open to each on the right, and smaller tables in their own little nooks on the left. And yet, somehow that compliments the food more than any other style possibly could.

The food itself is fantastic, though. It tastes like the perfect marriage of deep fried passion and decades of experience. It is profoundly unlikely that you will leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"As most of the reviews state, this place looks dated. But it doesn't really matter, I don't need a modern-chic Hungarian restaurant. To me Hungarian speaks homestyle, potatoes and making it like mom used to.

For five of us, we ordered the platter which includes three large pieces of schnitzel done two ways. Some good beets and potatoes beneath it. And some salad as well.

That was decent enough for us. The interesting thing is the batter on the schnitzel doesn't really \"stick\" to the meat, it kinda comes apart.

I'd say it's not bad for the price."}
{"text":"Meal portion is humongous..
Chicken breast schnitzel very good.
Service was POOR. 1 wait staff occupied with phone and laptop.."}
{"text":"Good service and large portions. My wife and I shared a wooden plate special and there was enough food for four people. The food came very quickly. While the Schnitzels were good, overall, the food was bland."}
{"text":"No nonsense here.   Hipsters stay away!
Here you will get good quality food and lots of it.  It's a very old school plain restaurant that the hipsters can not brag about.  Plaid table cloth and wooden chairs.  Great soup!  When the schnitzel came I couldn't tell if they gave me a a schnitzel or a door mat.  It's HUGE and very tasty.  Come hungry darling."}
{"text":"The place is clean, food is ample and delicious! We will be most definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Great food in large portion! It is doubtlessly comforting as it smells and tastes home-made! I even liked the decor, and I think it gives this restaurant a unique character as it neatly reflects how old this business is around. 

We ordered its Wiener schnitzel with dumplings. The schnitzel was perfectly crispy and yummy. I really enjoyed the dumplings too, no too heavy but filling enough. The staff were friendly, smiling, and prompt. Our server was very helpful and gave us good tips when we were hesitant what to order. The price was reasonable, considering the amount and the quality of the food. The only reason I didn't give it a five-star rate was the dessert. We got Hungarian crepe which was too oily, even smells oily! However, overall, it was a very good experience, and we will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice staff,  and the platter for 2 was enough to feed 3 of us.  The staff were very friendly and let us know which were the most popular items. We had the gulash, and also the fried cheese.  Both were yummy, but be warned that it's a heavy meal.  The food itis started taking over halfway through the meal.  We also tried their signature drink made of soda and cherry syrup, it was refreshing. We had the apricot and walnut crepe for dessert, it was decent. Over all good meal,  and the two types of schnitzel was a treat,  one with flour and another without. Oh and the pepper was Hungarian pepper of course. Went with my Hungarian friend, and he gave it 5 stars."}
{"text":"You know, it amazes me that people come to (for example) a Hungarian restaurant and then complain that the meal isn't served with North American condiments. Really?? Are these the same people who go to Japanese restaurants and get mad if there aren't any McDonald's cheeseburgers on the menu? To avoid foolish expectations, I'd suggest doing your research beforehand. In this day and age, most people have and iphone/android and it would take all of what, 3 seconds to search \"typical Hungarian meal\" in order to know that that's what they'd be getting. Please don't apply North American expectations or we'll be stuck with every restaurant \"Americanizing\" their food and that would just be sad. Rant over.

This is traditional Hungarian food. The traditional fruity drink made w a red syrup and water is yummo! Have the cucumber salad (tangy and sweet) and if they have the mushroom soup (everything is homemade here), try it. A tasty broth with fresh mushrooms. Light and satisfying. Then get the schnitzel (I like to forego the bread and add mashed potatoes instead). Ask for extra lemon wedges to squeeze it over the light, flavourful meat. So delicately breaded and perfectly browned, you'd swear that you're having breaded fish. For dessert (you won't have room but get it anyway) order the walnut crepes. Oh, and did I mention? Our server was excellent, always filling our water glasses, checking to see that everything was okay without being annoyingly hovering.Cash only. Go for a walk around the hood to work off all of that food."}
{"text":"We got the wooden plate, after seeing in some blog, and let me tell you, a lot of food, and it was good.

the menu says is for one person, for around $35, but even when we asked the waitress she said that is really for 2 ppl, and the 2ppl order is for 4 ppl!

it looks big in the plate. but most of the meats are thin. it's good for two people. it reminds me of a milanesa, if you guys have tried south or central american food. basically thin breaded meat. the cabbage roll was interesting, never had that before.

i would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been eating quite a bit of schnitzel as of late and I've found myself growing disillusioned with the seemingly impossible-to-mess-up item. It seems like most of the time it arrives at the table room temperature with underwhelming and tough meat.

Enter Country Style. In my opinion, these guys serve the best schnitzel in Toronto. It arrived at my table just a few minutes after I ordered it and it was as hot and fresh as one could imagine. Cooked to perfection, the schnitzel boasts a tasty breading and meat that's almost unbelievably soft and moist. You can cut your pieces with a fork!

We also tried the cucumber salad, which is essentially thinly sliced cucumbers in a sweet, tangy sauce. Very tasty. We closed out the meal with an apricot-filled crepe. I assumed it would be some previously-made crepe served right out of the fridge but it was actually fresh! The crepe itself was fantastic with a little bit of crust, while the apricot filling was perfectly tangy and delicious.

Service was excellent, although the restaurant's cash-only policy meant I had to head out in the rain to grab money from a bank machine. A minor hiccup in an otherwise flawless dining experience."}
{"text":"Very basic, old school Hungarian restaurant that appears mostly to cater to hungry fans of the cuisine.  Vienna and Parisien schnitzel - possibly the largest pieces of schnitzel I've ever seen.  All the traditional dishes are here, prepared in the traditional way.  Everything was good, well prepared and well presented.  Prices were very reasonable.  Everything's spotlessly clean.  If this is your kind of food and you're in the neighbourhood, it's well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had visited this restaurant several years ago and was able to confirm its decline, but this newly renovated incarnation has certainly made a 180 degree turn, especially in terms of food quality.  Though the renovations aren't spectacular the atmosphere remains comfy and unpretentious.  The schnitzel is excellent and I can vouch for its authenticity.  The key to success will be matching the food quality with a high level of service, especially during busy periods."}
{"text":"Being of Hungarian origin, I frequently eat at various Hungarian restaurants.  This evening my wife and I were on Bloor Street, and were hungry, so decided to have dinner at Country Style.  We walked in, the restaurant was nearly empty.  Both the staff members ignored us.  I had to ask three times, before they answered us.  They did not look us in the eye or act in a friendly manner.

After waiting for a few minutes for a table for two, we were offered the one right next to the kitchen door.  We asked to be seated at a different table, to avoid getting kitchen staff going back and forth in front of our table, all night long.

The guy refused without even looking at me.  I said you wanted to go to another restaurant?  He said \"I don't care\".

We walked out and here I am reviewing the place."}
{"text":"Great find for my Hungarian speaking friend from Phoenix.  Huge Portions, great desserts - one downfall - to know up front - It's a CASH ONLY establishment.  Schnitzel's are huge, the traditional meals are yummy and all the desserts (we had 4 of 6 offered) - are fresh and homemade.  Go with an appetite (or growing kids)"}
{"text":"Taste : 4.2/5.0 - Had the Schnitzel combo on the wooden plate, and the Creme for dessert. All dishes tasted exceptionally good. HUGE portion with many sides. Plating was cool and unique (maybe it was the traditional Hungarian plating for this dish?), which added positively to the taste. 

Value: 3.6/5.0 - The combo for two is not cheap ($39.95), but like I said, HUGE portion with many sides. 

Ambience: 3.7/5.0 - Warm, Hungarian (?) feeling. 

Service: 4.0/5.0 - Server was attentive and friendly. 

==================================

Will be back soon to get my newly developed Hungarian fix!"}
{"text":"How has this place been here forever and I've only just recently tried it? Country Style is a home-y little Hungarian diner right in the heart of the Annex. No frills, just delicious, hearty fare on the cheap. The décor is dated and there is only one server for the whole place (even on a busy weekend lunch hour), but food is plentiful and comes out of the kitchen fast. 

I tried:
- Cold cherry soup - so refreshing on a hot summer day! Definitely recommended. Sweet with a little cinnamon. 
- Cabbage roll - get the appetizer size for sure. It was bigger than my face. Pretty standard take on a classic. 
- Plum dumplings - thick, dough-y dumplings with sweet plums in the centre, brushed with ?bread crumbs and cinnamon. Very tasty but I was way too full at that point! 

My DC's schnitzel sandwich looked great, and someone at the next table got the pierogies and sausage which also looked and smelled so good!! 

This place reminds me of those cozy mom and pop Eastern European restaurants along Roncesvalles. So this is a good place to get that experience closer to downtown. Just bring your appetite because the lunch portions were massive and I can't imagine what the dinner platters are like!!"}
{"text":"I would never recommend this place...I have a European background....and accustomed to eating cabbage rolls, goulash, paprikash. The food is expensive with cheap cuts of meat....I has a dish served with while slop with no paprika in it over 2 chicken legs...I refused to eat it.... Went there once with my father, never again....There are better options...And no I do not eat at McDonalds.."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Child of Hungarian parents so am always biased (usually negatively) to Hungarian restaurants.

I have been dining at the Country style since I was old enough to eat solid food.  Next to my grandmothers cooking, this is as good as it gets in Toronto!

Traditional (old school) decor and kitchy items from the homeland all around - but like many have said before - you dont go here for the decor.

When we can we always order the traditional platter that comes with multiple type of meat (schitzel, chops, sausage, thick cut bacon), cabbage roll, potatoes (we also ask for melt in your mouth dumplings!), rice, cucumber salad and pickled beets.  Its says its for 2 but can feed 3-4 easily.

The cabbage rolls are fantastic as is the paprikash (slow cooked chicken with tomato gravy and dumplings - much tastier than I am making it sound). 

Honestly you cant go wrong with anything on the menu and they have daily specials. If you get the chance to go on Friday the Bean Soup is phenominal (kind of like  chili but with a smoked meat base and obviously more soupy) and their stuffed veal is also great.

Even full to the brim we make room for dessert here (or take them home) because the strudel, palacintaz (dessert crepes) and cremish (custard sandwiched between layers of pyllo topped with powder sugar) is divine!  The Dobosh Torte (when they have it) is a sweet layer cake with a topping make of burnt sugar. Its always been a favorite and we take many slices home when its available.

The place is small and a bit cramped but that gives it a family feel. Mealtime for Hungarian families is all about family and togetherness and they definitely deliver.

NOTE: Cash only!"}
{"text":"Last surviving  Hungarian restaurant on this stretch of Bloor since my U of T days in the 60's. Nothing much has changed which I like. We used to stuff ourselves, lasting for a  week at this place . You will not find a thinner , crispier, non greasy, giant schnitzel anywhere. Not cheap anymore but definitely worth it. We live in Seaton Village and when we need to replenish our aging frames with some real food this is where we go. Only complaint is that they have never had draught beer which would have been perfect."}
{"text":"The food - totally old school and wonderful - if you're in the mood for serious meat and solid rye bread.  We were and it was good.  

A good meal will come in around $20 and you won't need to eat again for a while.

Definitely not a hot weather restaurant for me - but it's autumn and time to go back."}
{"text":"A great feast and friendly no-nonsense service. Brightly lit and clean setting. 
Delicious generous sausages, lightly-breaded schnitzel, zesty sauerkraut and dense pillowy perogies. Don't skip the beets!

Cabbage rolls were tasty but not my personal favourite. 

Next time, we'll try the goulash on our return visit. 

Our party of four literally gave each other \"high-fives\" for polishing off the platter of food and copious rounds of Pilsner."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  I had pork stew, and my wife had chicken schnitzel.  The portions and prices were very good, and the atmosphere was cozy and unpretentious.  I'd return."}
{"text":"3.5 round up to 4. It's as authentic as Toronto gets for Hungarian food. Firstly, the cucumber salad is amazing. We shared the cabbage roll, schnitzel and galoush both with a side of the dumplings.  The cabbage roll was my favourite and the schnitzel was fried just right. I expected the galoush to be more tender, melt in your mouth but it was not bad. Service was friendly and alcohol was reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Not many Hungarian restaurants in Toronto, this happens to be a great one! Smaller place, and surprisingly very very busy! It has a cozy feel, and a European style decor...kind of like your in Grandmas kitchen! Note: CASH ONLY. This atmosphere is definiteley a nice change from your typical Toronto restaurant. There is a bit of a wait (30minute), so be sure to make a reservation well ahead of time. The best part about this restaurant is the portions and pricing. All prices are with tax included, so what you see is what you pay for! The portions are extremely generous compared to what you usually get in Toronto. My group of friends and I got the platter for 4 that included 3 schnitzels (veal, chicken and beef), 2 grilled sausages, beet salad, a breaded/cheese curd appetizer and potatoes, oh and not to forget the cabbage rolls and sauerkraut all for $70! Very delicious, my favourite was the cabbage rolls...they are very filling and full of flavour. Be sure to ask for some sauces for the schnitzels...your options are a bit limited with regular over the counter mayo and yellow mustard...it would be great if there was some organic or home made styled sauces. Very home styled feel, puts your right in Hungary. 4/5 would come again!"}
{"text":"If you like schnitzel, put this little restaurant on Bloor in the Annex on your list. It doesn't get better than this. I pride myself on my own schnitzel but tip my cap to the masters. We had a platter for two (which could serve 3) heaped with 2 kinds of schnitzel, sausage, cabbage roll with sauerkraut, plus potatoes, dumplings and cucumber salad. It was all delicious, hearty and filling as eastern European cuisine tends to be. It's a great winter dinner. I also had the liver dumpling soup, richly flavourful but a little too oily. On my next visit I'll try the goulash. 

The ambience is basic and tables are close but it's amply pleasant and the service is good. It's a notable value for the level of cuisine and quality, but bring cash; no credit cards or debit."}
{"text":"Once in awhile, you just need a good Schnitzel....and in the last few years, many of the 'Old School' Hungarian Schnitzel places have gone out of business. 30 or 40 years ago, on the stretch of Bloor St. running West from Spadina Ave, you'd find a dozen Hungarian restaurants. Restaurants like Tarogato, Continental, Korona, Sport, Duna Corzo, Hungarian Castle, Master Chef, Little Europe. No more. Gone forever. 
Luckily, Country Style has bucked the trend and have stayed in business, primarily because of their delicious, authentic Hungarian food.
Country Style (according to the waitress) has been in business since 1965, the last 18 years under new ownership. They also updated their decor, which is clean and modern.
We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. We did not have reservations, which I would advise to have if you're going over the weekend. The restaurant was half full and throughout our meal, had a steady flow of patrons.
Very friendly and knowledgeable waitress, who throughout the meal, made sure we were taken care of and was always available for help and suggestions.
Well, with us was our good friend Tibor, who grew up with Hungarian food, from his former birthplace. We let him order for us. And we decided to share all the food.
We started off with one Goulash soup and one Chicken soup with liver dumplings. Both were served hot and were excellent. 
For our main course, we decided on the 'Country Style Wooden Plate', that came with cabbage rolls, Wiener Schnitzel, Parisian Schnitzel, fried sausage and a generous portion of home-fried potatoes, dumplings, beets and cucumber salad. Fresh bread with butter was always available. DON'T fill up on the bread!!
The food was great. Served hot, the portions were big, generous and VERY tasty!! 
The Schnitzel and all the sides were enough for three hungry Adults. 
For dessert we ordered espressos and one apple strudel with ice-cream, to share. Coffee was great and the dessert, as was the rest of the meal, was very good.
All in all, a very good meal, reasonably priced and without a doubt, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"The cabbage rolls deserve a 4, if not a 4.5. Really yummy!

Unfortunately, I was not that impressed and not satisfied at all by the wooden plate. Meat was OK, but you will need 2 liters of water to try to eat all of this dry and bland food combo. No sauce. You can for sure ask for French mustard or ketchup... but then why going to a Hungarian restaurant. 

Staff was OK, but do not ask for any special things such as having your bier before starting your meal or mashed potatoes instead of roast potatoes... our waitress said \"yes, no problem\" but at the end, bier never came and roasted potatoes did..

Perhaps will I go again one day, but only for the cabbage rolls (unless I find better ones in another Hungarian or Tcheck restaurant)."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm alone on this one, but I thought the food at Country Style was verging on tasteless and awful. There aren't a lot of restaurants in the city that serve this food, but that doesn't make it great by default. I ordered schnitzel with coleslaw, and to start we had pierogies and sausage. The portions were giant, but I am of the idea that huge portion sizes do not equal good value if the food isn't bang-on. The pierogies were not very good, especially when you can pick up a bag of amazing pierogies from so many places on Roncesvalles and in Bloor West Village. The schnitzel was huge, but the batter separated from the meat and there was zero seasoning on it. It tasted of fried and that's about it. I didn't want to finish."}
{"text":"Country Style Hungarian Restaurant sure looks out of place in the sea of Japanese, Thai, pubs in the Annex area. 

The yelp's photos of Schnitzel are just bizarre!! I probably would not have go in solo because no way I am going to eat that Schnitzel all by myself without having a heartburn later. 

Walking inside Country Style did give me a feeling I have transferred back to one of those little European cities where chic and cool doesn't exist.. \"the way it is\" is always the best! Nothing wrong with this old world's charm as old timers would definitely feel just at home eating here. 

I sweet talked Rafi N who is a meat lover to share: 

Parisian Schnitzel ($18.95) 
- Lightly battered and deep fried to golden brown 
- Veal was pounded to paper thin and was surprising moist and tender 
- with minimum seasonings..dizzled with fresh lemon juice did take some of the deep fried oiliness away 

Goulash ($5.95) 
- Hearty with chucks of vegetables and beef 
- flavour too is a little bland..but definitely not salty over loaded with MSG.. maybe a pinch of salt will give it more flavour 

Services here is homey and slow.. how can one rush their grandma? 

Prices includes taxes and is Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Oh schnitzel, how I love thee. 

The Annex used to be a hotbed of Hungarian eats.  Times change as do neighbourhoods. Somehow, Country Style managed to get stuck in some sort of time vortex where concepts like \"change\" and \"evolution\" don't apply.

Ok, so the prices have gone up a bit since I was a child, but the huge portions of homemade Hungarian dishes have remained the same.

The goulash is fantastic and easily a meal on its own if you order a bowl.

The schnitzel is larger than the plate and hidden underneath, a mysterious side dish that doesn't deserve comment due to the distracting size of the aforementioned schnitzel.

Ignore the decor, and aging facade outside and the incredible lack of parking. Take the subway, (or in my case, a scooter), and taste a bit of the past."}
{"text":"The place was newly renovated so it's really clean especially the washrooms. It's my first time here considering that this place has been at Bloor for a while. My boyfriend had to convince me to go. I ordered the wiener schnitzel and the chicken liver soup. They're fantastic. Not a fan of the dumplings though. They're pretty bland. They were busy when I got there and the server is not that nice. I understand she's tired and all but don't I have the option of changing my mind from getting a to go to dining in? So rude. Anywah, I will probably come back for more schnitzel if I get the cravings."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did, but unfortunately, that was not to be. 

While the potions of schnitzel seem huge, this has gotta be the thinnest schnitzel I've ever eaten (I know what I'm talking about, I used to live in Switzerland). There was seriously as much breading as there was meat, and the breading wasn't thick at all. Also, the \"salad\" was seriously tiny - the portion size was on par with the free kimchi you get at korean restaurants. In addition, the \"dumplings\" that came with the schnitzel were like limp, mushy spaetzle covered in some sort of tasteless yellow sauce. Ugh. And all of the food was seriously bland. 

The waitstaff were very nice, though, but the place seems kind of sketch as they only take cash and the tax is included in the menu price.

All in all, really not worth the money."}
{"text":"In a city full of fantastic restaurants it would be easy to overlook this place. It isn't fancy, high end or modern. What it is, is hearty, warm, fast and delicious and all for an amazing price. The servers are fast and efficient without being cold. The menu is decidedly old world and traditional , but then the name of the restaurant is a clear indicator of that. 

Where a good many places in the city have a single entree starting at $25-35, this place has an entire platter of their best dishes which can easily feed two hungry adults at $42. The Wooden Platter is always my go to dish as it includes two types of schnitzel, sausage, cabbage roll, potatoes, beets, dumplings and sauerkraut.  

The desserts are limited with the ice cream being the best bet if you need to have something sweet after all the heavy food and have room in your stomach. 

One thing to note. It is a cash only business so keep that in mind when heading there. 

This place is great and I return often."}
{"text":"Normally we would rate an easy 5/5, except for today. 
Every New Years Day, we drive into Toronto for the best schnitzle around!
This year, the schnitzle was very good. The service was disappointing (to say the very least.)
      We ordered breaded mushrooms (as an appetizer.) As we each began our second mushroom, the server presented us with our main!! \"Oh my gosh\", I blurted out, \"It's too soon, we've barely started our appetizer!\" The server gave an obvious clue as to her reaction; we saw it plain as day on her face! She took our plates back to the kitchen without a single word! 

As I ponder the experience, I should have let her leave our food on the table, as it took quite a long time to have her acknowledge us after that.
When we were finally served our schnitzel dinners, (and again the server left the table very quickly)I said to my partner, \"Well, I was going to ask for our beets and salad, but I feel like I would really upset her!\". My partner agreed, and oh, how I missed that small dish of the tastiest pickle beets,more than you will ever know! To me, (& in years gone past) .... each food item is an important part of the schnitzle experience.  
We skipped the historically wonderful apple strudel, and instead opted to begin our long trek home.
Our tummies were full, our New Years Day but  a disappointing memory.

Oh well, there's always next year.

Sigh."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service!

We were greeted & seated promptly by the friendly owner. The resto was full but not packed (Thursday night) and there were a steady stream of people coming & going (take-out/sit down). Nice cosy and homey place, reminded me of the authentic restaurants in Budapest (only thing missing was smoking and Arany Azok!). 

Ordered the platter for 2 ($39.95) - cabbage rolls, potatoes, rice, beets, one massive breaded schnitzel, another large \"Parisian\" schnitzel. Both were really well cooked, and not soggy as you get in some places. Nice crunch to them, even better with a bit of lemon. Cabbage rolls were also good; very meaty and not salty at all. Ordered a side of goulash; while it wasn't as great as my Hungarian friend's mom's version, it was still very tasty and perfect for the cold weather. Lots of meat and potatoes in it. This place is definitely not stingy with their meat!

Wanted to try the dobos torte and their homemade strudel but was too full to even think of dessert. Next time!

This place is highly recommended! Perfect place to warm up and get stuffed, especially with the cold weather coming in. 

*cash only*"}
{"text":"My grandparents, parents and now I have been coming to this very restaurant for over 40 years.
One of the rare original gems of Toronto and the food has not changed a bit.  It is as good as it ever was.
It's a small, narrow place, full of tables.  A nice, intimate ambiance with a few touches of the Danube hanging around.  
The Wiener schnitzel is obviously one of the staples that everyone MUST try at least once in their lives.  It's quite the task if you can finish it too...  They give ample bread, and salad before your mammoth proportion.  And speaking from experience, and knowing where I'm coming from on this matter, this is the best schnitzel that I have ever had.  But everything at this place is a real experience.  So enjoy!
They also have great strudel if you can handle it...
It's a shame.  There used to be an amazing Hungarian butcher shop two doors up.  Unfortunately, it has been gone for a few years now.  But at least we still have this haven.
Let's hope it stays around for another forty years."}
{"text":"I've been fortunate enough to sample fairly style Hungarian from my wife and her family. So, when my wife asked me to look up Hungarian while we were in Toronto, I was happy to Yelp it and see what I'd get. The Country Style Hungarian was exactly what the doctor ordered. 

A $10 cab ride from downtown, the trip to the Annex was a pleasant ride through Toronto's college and museum district. We got there and we're seated almost immediately. A cozy cubby along the wall set for two was great and really made us feel like we were in our own little restaurant. The styling was grandma's basement meets...well, grandma's basement. And, the smells were just wonderful. You couldn't walk by this place without smelling what they're cooking, but you wouldn't turn your head because of its trendy good looks either!  Red and white checked table cloths, off white walls, dark wood accents and yellow lights smacked of the 1970's. 

The course began with delicious rye bread. The table had the holy trio...salt, pepper and smoked paprika.  My wife and I began with cucumber salad and delicious cold sour cherry soup. It was awesome. The delicious sweet and sour of the cherries with a mild pickling to the was awesome. It was just savory enough not to be a dessert and I mean just!  The cucumber salad was wonderful. The delicious thin sliced cucumber with vinegar and sugar was a delicious was to refresh the pallet. 

The main course was a preplanned shared decision that pitted chicken paprikash with Parisian wiener schnitzel. Both came in ample portions, enough for both of us to have shared either, and over a bed of delicious dumplings. The paprikash was awesome...Hungarian comfort food at its best. Two thighs and a leg of chicken smothered in delicious goodness. Though it didn't have sour cream in it, as my wife makes it, it was incredible. I could've brushed my teeth with the gravy. Conveniently, a bit of that gravy was already applied to the dumplings under my 7 x 10 plate of schnitzel. The tender veal flattened and lightly breaded was incredible. A fresh squeezed wedged lemon gave it a citrusy bite...and another bite, and another,,,and I kept going until I couldn't eat any more. This was incredible!

I was told you can't do Hungarian without dessert, and when in Rome... My wife ordered the delicious Dobos Torte with its layers of airy cake soaked in goodness with favors of coffee and liquor and delicious layers of frosting...it was an homage to the great Austria-Hungarian empires of old!  More to the Austrian in Hungary, my custard square was delicious light butter pastry between layers of light folded vanilla custard.  It was decadent. 

After that we rolled ourselves out to cab and tried to stave off the food coma long enough to give the cabby directions to our hotel!  This place is worth the stop. The food is wonderful, the service is incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is as comforting as the food. This place is the real deal, and will be a Toronto staple on our travels. Thanks Yelpers, for the suggestion!"}
