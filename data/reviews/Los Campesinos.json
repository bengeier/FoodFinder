{"text":"Definitely one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had. The restaurant isn't much to look at from the outside, and is rarely busy, but that is no indication of the high-quality food to be found inside. The price is right, and every meal is delicious."}
{"text":"This place closed as Los Campesinos and reopened in August 2011 as Rey Azteca. Last time I was there as Los Campesinos, they were out of tomatoes and avocados: kiss of death for a Mexican place, if you ask me. The new place is painted bright orange, and looks great. I've been there a couple of times now and LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Service and food were pretty good.  Only complaint is they were out of Flan and Fried Ice Cream, which is 2/3rds of their dessert menu.  That's frustrating for a place that wasn't all that busy."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Salsa was good, just be aware that they charge extra after the first bowl!  The food was good, prices were reasonable, and service wasn't bad.  Pretty solid Mexican establishment; nothing too extravagant, but not a bad place to stop by, especially if you're on the road and want a decent meal off the highway at a non fast food place."}
