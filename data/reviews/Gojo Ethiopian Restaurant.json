{"text":"This place looks like a dive, but it is such great food! They give BIG portions at inexpensive prices (compared to other Ethiopian restaurants). On my last visit, I got the veggie combo to-go (which they confirmed was vegan). It had 9 different items, plus 2 giant pieces of injera. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the best Ethiopian I've had at the lowest cost. New favorite spot for eating out! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!  We tried the Meat Sambussa appetizer (really good!), Veggie Combo, Doro Wot, Key Wot, and Alitcha Wot.  From this first experience, I don't think you can really go wrong since all of the food is so good.  Server was incredibly nice, too."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the food at this restaurant. I love Ethiopian food and have been to other Ethiopian Restaurants and found this one to be the best. It is not just the food but it is the service. This service is great and it is a family atmosphere. They are really warm and friendly. The lamb and the jasmine rice is SOOO GOOD! The sambusa is SOOO GOOD! Don't leave without having the vegetarian platter too. Be ready to eat with your hands by using the injera bread to pick up your food.

I hope you try this restaurant because it is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Gojo is maybe the best Ethiopian I have had.  Great quality meats and excellent flavors.  This place doesn't have the decor perfected, but the food, prices, and service are fantastic.  I have taken it to go and it has always been great too.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been fans of Ethiopian food since the 1980s and have been four or five different restaurants that serve it. This one is up there with the best of them. Like others have said, it is hard to find and looks kind of seedy outside, but the inside is simple and clean and the service is friendly and efficient. We got a veggie and meat combo for $13.99 that easily fed two people. The cheapest meal we've had in years, and one of the best!"}
{"text":"Try the meat and vegetarian combo(8 different flavors), Yebere Tibbs(beef with pepper),drink: Yekemen Shai, go with hot."}
{"text":"Such a fan of this place!  I've been to other Ethiopian restaurants and they've left me bloated and not feeling so great for at least the next two days.  But not Gojo, the food here is so good!  I've mostly just stuck to their vegetarian dishes, love them all.  I highly recommend the combination platter, it's all the veggie dishes plus two meat items I believe; and its enough to feed three people.  The prices are great too.  And if you're a fan of coffee you must come here on Mondays after 3pm.  They have a \"coffee ceremony\" where the coffee is roasted right in front of you and then served the way you like it.  It smells and tastes amazing!  The service is friendly and attentive as well :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere and amazing vegetarian food. Shared the large veggie sampler among 3 and it was more than enough. And no gross oily salad, just 7 or 8 great flavorful selections. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place does not charge enough for its excellent product.  I went to lunch with three other people, ate a delicious vegetarian platter, and paid $12 for all of us.  $3 per person? That is ridiculous! They could have easily charged double or three times that amount.  The food was very delicious and quite authentic as far as I know about Ethiopian food.  Some of the best that I have eaten, and I have eaten Ethiopian food for over 20 years.  The decor could probably have used some work, but I would certainly recommend going to Gojo if you want a delicious authentic Ethiopian meal for a very good value."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly; however, the food was not good - definitely not fresh. My friend and I had two different dishes. After we ate there, I felt heavy - my friend had food poisoning though."}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Ambiance - meh.  Service was terribly, terribly slow.  Took forever to get our drinks.  And when requesting another beer, it was forgotten.  Felt awful for the other two tables near us, they had been seated at least 15 minutes and no one had come to their table.  They were still waiting when we left.  There was one server for the entire restaurant on a Friday night, Valentines Day, at that.  I don't think anyone at our table will return."}
{"text":"We travel and always try Ethiopian in different cities. This was a wonderful experience. If you frequent this ethnic cuisine, you know to be patient and that you may or may not get refills or napkins. We got both napkins and refills and the waitress was affluent as well. She was extremely friendly. The food was excellent. We had the veggie combo and the Kitfo. Both were perfect! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Service is as stated, very friendly but not tripping over themselfs to take care of their clients. Food is amazing, eating here is always a treat, the flavor is unique and quality. I would recommend for anyone, and as stated, the service, while on the slow side, is very pleasant and seem eager to help you as best they can. Maybe a little shy due to lacking English skills?"}
{"text":"We were looking for something interesting, affordable, and vegetarian friendly. We got all this and more. It was the first time eating ethiopian food for all of us. We weren't quite sure what to expect, but we weren't disappointed. Highly recommend the combos so you can taste multiple things. On top of this, the service was fantastic. Our server was cheery and helpful with our questions. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS. 
I've come here three times now and each time the servers were so sweet and the food was amazing. I love the vegetarian combo platter because they give you a little of everything and it's only $11.99. It also fills up my sister, mother, and me. I got the combo with meat as well once because my boyfriend eats meat and he loved it and it was only $13.99 and definitely more than enough. WELL WORTH IT. 
The only downside is that there have been no other customers 2/3 times I've gone and just 2 others the other time. It's really depressing because it's such good food and friendly people and I would hate to see them close. Also, the service is kind of slow (not bringing out the food, but on refilling drinks and bringing the check) but I assume it's them trying to let the customer enjoy their food. 
DEFINITELY WORTH A TRY!"}
{"text":"It's family owned.. not many help, so service maybe slow. This place used be Bacchanal - a greek/mediterranean restaurant that closed. Glad there's a closer Ethiopian place around. I ordered the lamb dish.... It's alright....maybe next time in the area, I will try the veggie dish and hope that will change my review for the better. I like the mom and pop restos to succeed you know...but I got be honest in my reveiw."}
{"text":"I have never tried Ethiopian food before. So, on a whim my lady and I gave it a whirl. Absolutely delicious, super cheap and pretty healthy too. Basically radical."}
{"text":"I'd say Gojo is tied for best Ethiopian food in the Phoenix Metro area, but is cheaper and with friendlier staff than its main competitor, Cafe Lalibella. The quality of the food is excellent. I eat here a few times every month."}
{"text":"New for us... Very exotic!

Update 2-20-2014:  Was very satisfied and full off of the delicious food we had.  Very well priced.  Wished they had a dessert from the region to showcase to really cap off the experience."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous!  Never had Ethiopian so we shared the sampler platter.  A bit of everything and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I first tried this place a few months ago when I moved to the Phoenix area.  I was grateful at that time to find something other than American or Mexican.  Stopped in again today. 

And - meh. It was. Ok. Just ok. Their injera is less sour than I remember.  That's good. Ordered the veggie and meat combo.  Way too much food for one person.  Not a complaint. Just an observation and tip. 

Flavors were rather bland. Food wasn't as hot as I like. And the chicken chunks were way too big. I found myself messing around with injera to break them up. Water tasted like tap water. Serving tap water in Phoenix? Yuck. And the server was only reasonably attentive: details like taking away the menu and making sure my drink was filled etc were missed while she sat looking at her phone at the bar. There were only 3 other tables being served. She was decently responsive when I reached out to her.... But I honestly shouldn't have to. Definitely sweet, but a little off synch and kind of ungrounded. Maybe she was having an off day.   Not sure. 

Overall not awful for the price. Clean. Friendly. Prompt. Still... quite a few notches below other Ethiopian restaurants I've experienced in terms of quality, atmosphere, menu selection and attention to details."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that just opened about one month ago.  The location previously hosted a Greek restaurant, and the decor still reflects it.

For context, I follow a whole foods, plant based diet (no meat, no processed foods). One of the main challenges when eating at restaurants is finding vegan or vegetarian options that are not fried nor prepared with much oil.  A couple of months ago I discovered that Ethiopian cuisine provides many options that fit my diet, and the food is just absolutely delicious!

I have dined at three different Ethiopian restaurants: Zemam's in Tucson, Lalibela in Tempe, and now Gojo.  Gojo is my favorite because the food is prepared with very little oil, as compared to the food at Lalibela and Zemam's, and the food has lots of good flavor. The injera (flat bread) is also better at Gojo because it is thinner and less doughy.  

I have only tried the vegetarian dishes, so I cannot speak to the meat options.  We ordered a vegetarian sampler of all their vegetarian (eight) options.  By far, my favorite dishes were the Mushroom Wot (mushrooms cooked with onions, herbs and spices) and Misir Wot (red lentils cooked with onion and herbs).  One vegetarian sampler was enough food for two. We like spicy food, and unfortunately only the Mushroom Wot had any significant spice.  So if you prefer your food not to be spicy, you will be safe here. 

Service was good and the waitress was very attentive.  Our waitress was the owner and she took time to explain how the food is prepared.  We had lunch there on Saturday, and there were only four other tables occupied.  Apparently they do some business on takeout because when we were there about five orders left the restaurant. The restaurant is fairly large, and with only five tables occupied it looked almost empty, however that has more to do with their recent opening rather than the food.

Ethiopian food is traditionally eaten without utensils.  Instead, it is consumed with injera, which is sort of like a soft flat bread.  The injera is cut into small pieces that are then used to scoop up the food.

If you prefer an adventurous cuisine like Thai, Indian, and Vietnamese, you owe yourself a chance to try Ethiopian food.  Give Gojo a try and you will love it!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, but everything else caused me to give it 2 stars... In January, I went with two other people. There was one other table in the restaurant when we got there, and it took 20min to get menus... Overall the dinner took about 2.5hrs (and all we ordered was three entrees). We were enjoying ourselves but I think we could've been out in half the time if the service were better/faster. 

Few months later now, and I am throwing an African-themed party. I called Gojo (as of today it's been 10 times) to see if they would cater. The first few times - no answer and voicemail hasn't been set up. The next couple times - answer, but hung up on after a couple hello's. The next couple times - a woman answered, I would ask relevant questions and would something indescribable would occur:

for instance: me \"I am interested in having a party for 400 catered by Gojo next Saturday\"; woman \"no parties next Saturday\"; me \"you cannot cater any parties next Saturday?\"; woman \"we have none\"; me \"okay, I am interested in Gojo making food for a party I'm having next Saturday, can I speak with someone about that\"; woman \"okay what would you like to order\"; me \"well I'd like to get prices on a couple things, first the awaze tibbs\"; woman \"okay one order of awaze tibbs will be ready in 30min\"... 

then I was hung up on. I'm sure a lot of this has to do with differences in cultural communication / exchanges, but was nonetheless rather irritating. Finally, got several of the questions answered (after three consecutive phone calls of being hung up on), but was told to call back the next morning to speak with the owner. I call the next morning, man answers, I say can I speak with Million (yes, that's the owner's name), and then get hung up on. I'm not sure if there is a bad phone connection there or what, but I will never try to work with this restaurant again. After over a week of attempts, I am more than done - which is too bad, as it is hard to find good African food in this area!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I walked to this restaurant from my house as I am lucky enough for it to be about a mile away.  Very lucky, as the food is fantastic!  We had read the other reviews here on yelp so knew the portions were large and sharable.  We ordered the vegetarian combo with the meat add-ons.  I added the chicken, my friend added a beef dish. 
When our food came out the chef had included an additional chicken and additional beef dish!  The chicken dish, Doro Wat, was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten, tender chunks of chicken in a reddish wonderfully seasoned sauce with just a little kick to it.  
The veggie dishes were excellent too.  I especially liked the Fosolian(green beans with carrots and potatoes) and the Misir Wat lentils.  
As mentioned in other reviews the decor is nothing to write home about.  But I don't go to restaurants for the visual experience.  And when the food arrived, we could not have cared less what the place looked like as the food made up for it and any other shortcomings.  But there weren't any others.  The service was polite, helpful, and didn't lurk.  I can't stand when waiters lurk.  We were left to eat our meal and the server was there when we needed something - perfect!  Lastly, the price - very affordable!  We ate until we were stuffed and still took home enough for one more big meal or two small ones.  All for $13.99.  

I took a takeout menu and plan to use it often.  Do your tastebuds a favor and try this place!"}
{"text":"Despite what others say- FOOD WAS AMAZING!!! Had the beef samosa as an appetizer and GOJO combo as a two person dinner. Flavor was spot on. Plus the 2 Ethiopian beers were a great add!

We will definitely be back.

Would have been 5 starts but service was a slow start- give it a break different culture!"}
{"text":"Prices are good for the quality of food.  The service is not good.  They are friendly, but do not plan on having someone come over to you , asking if you need anything unless you ask.  (Just my experience)

The injera bread smelled like sour milk on my visit.  First time I ever had injera bread that smelled like that. 

Love the tea and the lentils.  The beef was very tough.

Nice big screen tv, with Ethiopian channels and music.

Will I return? For take out, possibly."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Service is friendly but a bit on the slow side, and drinks take a long time to be refilled, but the food is so tasty, I overlook these things."}
{"text":"Well priced, flavorful, vegetarian-friendly, ethnic food. 

I have gotten the big vegetarian platter twice and me and a friend could not finish it. Everything on it was tasty (and fairly healthy minus the oil) for $12.99. If you like ethnic (think middle eastern) food at an affordable price then you will like this place."}
{"text":"Note: There are two Ethiopian digs here. One is a cafe, and the other is GoJo. The latter has a blue awning. The former seems unhappy for what must be a daily influx of confused white people.

As for GoJo itself; It's the bomb! The prices end up ridiculously low per person if all that is ordered is a shared platter and perhaps a cinnamon iced tea (highly recommended)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Ethiopian food for awhile, and today I finally decided to take the plunge and I called up Gojo to place a take-out order.  The place was a little hard to find as it is in a very nondescript building in a dingy strip mall.  There is also an Ethiopian Market in the same strip mall which I almost walked into by mistake, they are not the same place!
I ordered the meat combo which consisted of traditional injera bread (kind of like a spongy pancake) and three different meats (chicken, lamb, and beef) seasoned with the traditional Ethiopian berbere spices.  When eaten by itself the injera had a very strong flavor somewhat like sourdough bread which was at first a little strange to me, though this is my first experience with Ethiopian cuisine and based on what I've read this is how authentic injera should taste.  However, when eaten together with the meat the flavors complemented each other nicely.  The meat itself was delicious!  It was all very tender and the spices were exotic and tasty.  The dish was about $12, but the portion was huge, enough that I will be able to get two meals out of it.
Next time I may bring a friend and try dining in.  The restaurant itself lacked ambience, but with food this good that is what you're really going for."}
{"text":"Great food nicely priced.
Food here is served in the traditional way. I checked all dishes in the menue in several visits, I like the way it is spiced, not too hot, you can ask for hot salsa. The special deal of the house is to have both variety of vagtebales, lentils, chicken and beef coocked slowly and come in variety of spices over their flat bread, injera! About $15 without a drink.  Can feed two!"}
{"text":"what a wonderful restaurant, my wife and i ordered and shared the veggie combo every item on the plate was so flavorful, the injera (bread) was so fresh and tasty.  we both enjoyed it so much we went back the next day and ordered the same. i would recommend this this restaurant, if you are looking for flavorful, healthy and affordable food."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic, when years ago, I discovered Blue Nile Cafe in Tempe.  Yes, being out in Goodyear, it was a MAJOR pain to drive out there.  But very good Ethiopian food in a city not exactly known for a variety of ethnic restaurants?!  And so, I dealt with the drive.  And then The Blue Nile closed and my heart sank ... until tonight.  This restaurant has been open for more than a year and why I didn't go looking for it till now, I'll never know  (but I'm glad I did).

My partner and I had the large combo plate, which includes all their vegetarian selections and three meat dishes.  At $13.99, it's a real bargain.  Unfortunately, gluttonous as we are, we EACH had one.  Okay, so we took some of it home (and, for those who know combo dishes, it will lose a lot of charm the next day, because you can't keep the individual dishes apart ... but really:  who cares?).

Unlike Blue Nile, the portions on the combo plate were big and spiced excellently.  The bread was spongy and moist  (yes, for those of you who don't know Ethiopian bread --- which resembles something like the chamois you use to dry your car --- this is exactly what you want to hear).  Hands down, this food is much better than what the Blue Nile used to serve; and we used to drive the 35 miles each way once a week to partake in it.

Now, here are the downsides:

The restaurant is located in a non-residential and very commercial area, which means business is likely to be slower during off-business hours than it should be.  It's also not the best of neighborhoods; but I'm betting one of the reasons for the property selection is lower rents than, say, in Tempe.  But, unfortunately, location is everything and this restaurant deserves to be packed ALL the time.  Given where it is, however, most students and yuppies, who would both enjoy eating here, won't be here in the evening  (and they do have very extensive operating hours).

The exterior of the restaurant is nice, but it's decorated to look like \"wood\".  This makes the place seem unobtrusive during the day and very hard to see at night.  This is the one time I would encourage some bright signage outside.

Service is polite, efficient, friendly and fast.  You are checked on to make sure everything is okay, but not in a way to make you feel like they bug you too much.  I can't speak for the other dishes, because I didn't have them, but I suspect the combo plate would be a good representation of what there is to be had.  If it is, don't walk, RUN to this restaurant.  It fully deserves your support and there's really nothing of substance to complain about."}
{"text":"I go here regularly because they make the best Ethiopian food I have ever had and because the people who work at Gojo are super genuine and kind. The vegetarian options are consistently awesome. The atmosphere is great and would be good for a party, a meeting, a show, or anything. Even has a good spiritual vibe, long may Ethiopia reign with peace, justice & love. I recommend Gojo and the Ethiopian cafe in the same plaza to everyone."}
{"text":"Liked the food very much. It was tasty, good portions and reasonably priced. The restaurant is clean but somehow seemed seedy from the stale cigarette smell in the restroom to the dated bar. Definitely in our rotation of \"go to\" places."}
{"text":"This is only my second time eating Ethiopian so I am by no means a connoisseur;  however I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Gojo on Thomas Rd. I went there with a dining companion late (a little after 9pm) on a Saturday evening at the end of June and though we weren't greeted immediately by anyone, we were eventually told by the friendly quiet girl at the bar to sit anywhere we liked. She did a very good job of managing the bar, the phone, take out orders and managing the tables---she was our waitress as well.

My companion and I ended up ordering the Meat/Veggie Combo which included the 3 meat dishes included on the meat combo as well as a sampling of all the veggie dishes which are included on the veggie combo. It was unclear to us until the girl pointed it out, that this was going to be our best option as my companion wanted the Veggie Combo for himself and she assured me that ordering that plus my ordering a meat entree would be A LOT of food for us. We also ordered one Thyme tea and one Ethiopian coffee. Though it was late we were most definitely not rushed and people even came in well after we did and sat and were served. I believe there is a decidedly slower pace for Ethiopian dining, so one shouldn't anticipate normal American restaurant experience (in other words, if you're in any way hurried or impatient, go elsewhere or get take-out).

When our food arrived we were still minus our coffee and tea, which we were told were having to be made and they came out shortly after the food. The tea was good and not overpowering and the coffee was wonderful without sweetener of any kind. We were told correctly by our waitress and in fact the Meat/Veggie combo platter was plenty of food for the two of us. Everything tasted very well, although of the meats I'd say the Key Wot (beef) was the clear winner over the Doro Wat (chicken) or the Alitcha Wot (lamb), though there was an entire drumstick included in the middle of the platter with the Doro Wat and the Alitcha Wot was spiced beautifully! All of the veggies we had were wonderfully spiced as well and I think only the cabbage was my least favorite (but I have no great love of cooked cabbages).

I would highly recommend eating here as I would gladly eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow. Such great food. Had the Fiji combo. Yummy. Spice is beautifully done. Next time will just get one combo. And there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! A Friend and I ate a Gojo for lunch yesterday and enjoyed the GoJo Combo platter loaded with a wonderful selection of delicious Ethiopian Spiced meats, legumes and vegetables topping lovely fresh injera, Ethiopian Flat Bread! GoJo is now among my select go to restaurants! Next visit, I'll grab some pics to better describe the gorgeous food and great staff! Thank you Gojo!"}
{"text":"Let me start out that saying, my life has a lot of Ethiopian in it as my wife is and we have visited Ethiopia several times. That being said, I guess my expectations are a little higher than the casual Ethiopian dining seeker. We dined at Gojo back in December. We liked some of the traditional Ethiopian features such as the coffee ceremony and wicker \"mesob\" tables. The menu also featured diverse options of traditional dishes. The prices were decent for what you received. The injera was fresh and tasty. Decorated with a Christmas tree was a nice touch.

As for the poor: The restaurant is old, very outdated and could use more ethiopian touches. The service wasn't very attentive even with maybe only 5 other tables filled. The meat wot was a bit bland and missing some spice. 

Overall, I would recommend Gojo to someone who has never tried ethiopian food as it offers an introduction into the cuisine. If you know a bit about the cuisine and culture, there may be better restaurants to visit nearby."}
{"text":"Way to go Gojo!  Brought my partner and 2 year old to this place on a whim when on a business trip to PHX.  GREAT food, reasonably priced and served with smiles all around.  

If you need ambiance then this is not your place... and the remaining Greek art (Parthenon) on one wall combined with some of the African portraits made us smile.    If you're looking for great food and generous quantities of authentic Ethio cuisine then you need to go!"}
{"text":"A unique and fun experience. Great service, interesting and tasty food. People who work here are passionate and they seem to be doing well. Enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Ethiopian food this is the place to go . . . Although I cook a few Ethiopian dishes myself (kai wat, doro wat, & alicha) I've never been able to make injera the way they do in Ethiopia. So I called up Gojo Ethiopian restaurant and asked for a take-out order of injera to go with the other dishes I'd made . . . and what I got was the best injera I've had in more than 20 years!!!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Got the vegetarian platter - excellent!  Service was wonderful, as well."}
{"text":"so authentic! the waitress was so patient with my mom when she couldn't figure out what to order. the food had so much flavor! it was the first time i tried mushroom wot. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Authentic and yum. The injera would have been better served warm. This is a vegetarians delight"}
{"text":"I really feel bad giving this a one star, I try to have more positive things to write but I just could not with this one. 

The boyfriend had been wanting to try Gojo for months. We finally went last night.  We walked in the door and waited, and waited and the host/server just looked over at us a few times never motioned to sit, never smiled, just nothing. 

Once we were sat we ordered the combo veggie and meat platter.  Oh, please keep in mind neither of us had ever had Ethiopian food before, however we like to try all kinds of different foods. 

I did know that we did not use utensils. I thought we would be served bread but Injera is what is served. This is what threw me off. To me, it was like an old sponge sitting around in your kitchen sink that was just awful. I read in a few reviews that others really enjoyed it, maybe it was just a texture thing with me. 

It did not bother me about the lack of Customer Service as I think it is a cultural thing.

I have never seen my boyfriend not ever finish a meal. GoJo may be great for others but it was definitely not for us."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fresh and fantastic. Sometimes service can be a bit slow, but it has greatly improved. 

The people are friendly and the price to portion ratio is fantastic. I'm a real big fan of their vegetarian platters and love all their lentil dishes!

Check it out if you get a chance, if you are looking for a 5 star atmosphere and modern decorating you won't get it, but it's the food that counts go for that not for looks."}
{"text":"Clean establishment, friendly staff, and the food is Excellent. Being a Vegetarian I appreciate the options they have on their menu."}
{"text":"This is a favorite, reminds me of the wonderful Ethiopian restaurants in Seattle I went to as a kid. The vegetarian platter is a must, the flavors are superb and you won't be disappointed. The staff is exceptionally friendly, and their laughter is infectious."}
{"text":"The Best Ethiopian Food in Phoenix!

You can't beat the food here, everything is very flavorful, fresh and very inexpensive. The waitstaff is very kind, and the ambiance is ok as well. If you're a \"ambiance snob\" look elsewhere because the food is the main attraction here, Myself and my wife ate here for under 20 dollars that included drinks and a very large combo meal. We had leftovers for the next day.. 

Very Recommended! A+ 5 STAR!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Ethiopian food when I was in college but unfortunately it is nowhere to be found where I live, so whenever I travel to cities I try to find it. I was visiting Tempe and saw amazing reviews of another Ethiopian place called Lalibela, but it was a bit expensive. Despite everyone highly recommending I go to Lalibela, I decided to go to Gojo and I am so happy that I did! This was the best Ethiopian food I've had (from a restaurant at least) and I highly recommend going to eat here. Lots of amazing food for a great price! Two of us split the vegetarian player and sambusas, and had leftovers. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because although the restaurant was fairly empty, getting the waitress's attention was a bit difficult."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the good reviews here.  I feel bad leaving a lackluster review.

First, I've never had Ethiopian food before. I had no idea what to expect. Turns out it's not for me, so even if it was good, I wouldn't know. Therefore this review is purely on the service.

Another reviewer mentioned the service isn't \"Americanized\", which would explain a lot.  There was one guy running the whole place. Clearly there should have been at least two.  His order taking style was unconventional to say the least.  Orders did seem to come fairly quickly, but trickled out over several minutes making for lots of waiting around with a plate of food in front of you waiting for everyone to get theirs. 

If you aren't looking to get the full cultural experience eating a soupy mix of meat and sauce with your fingers, you'll need to ask for a fork...and napkins. Lots of them because they are cocktail napkins.  The customary large plates, which hung off the table in front of each person of our party of 12, were never cleared, making after-lunch conversation awkward.  If you wanted a refill, you needed to ask, and even then you weren't guaranteed to get it.  We had to ask for the check multiple times.

Not sure if the news channel being projected on a nearby wall, showing riots was supposed to be part of the ambiance. lol.
 
When it was time to pay, he had us come to the bar one by one to pay.  Unconventional, but if it helps them keep in order, I don't have a problem with it.  But I'm quite sure they were still charging 9.3% sales tax even though it's back to 8.3% for Phoenix.  I tried to say something but he wasn't really understanding and I gave up.

The food does seem filling and reasonably priced. There weren't too many people that finished their dish so the portions are generous.  

Seems like a good value if you like Ethiopian, just know the experience for someone uncultured like myself may be a bit unconventional from what you are used to."}
{"text":"Showed up at 8 pm wth a couple of friends on a Tuesday night.  It was very slow, but the waitress was extremely friendly and seated us immediately.  The food was excellent!  It has been many years since I have had good Ethiopia food, and I have to say that this was some of the best that I have ever had!  One of my friends is, to put it mildly, rather demanding, but the waitress never lost her smile, and she assisted him in every way that she could.  It was an awesome evening, and I cannot wait to take som of my out of town guests here when they come in!  Great job, y'all!

{"text":"In California, a combo meat dish at any Ethiopian restaurant can run you $18-$22 easily. For the same amount of food and quality, Gojo's combo meat dish is only $14 and can still feed two VERY hungry people.

A sambussa order is 3 pieces. I ordered the veggie/meat combo plus a meat sambussa appetizer. Without tip, it was about $18 for the food alone.

It goes without saying that this is a GREAT deal! I came in on a Monday evening around 7 pm and it wasn't full. The service was fantastic and it felt very authentic and relaxed. This isn't exactly fine dining - the atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable. I definitely felt like I could have been eating in someone's home - and I mean this in the very best way!

The sambussas were great - not super oily, with the perfect amount of crunch. I was LOVING the meats offered in the meat combo. I wish I had asked for it extra spicy, but regardless it was delicious.

There's a full length mirror in the ladies bathroom, which I thought was cool LOL.

For you alcoholics: there's a FULL BAR! Not sure if it suddenly turns into a night club on the weekend or something, LOL, but that was pretty cool. It looks like they can host events too because there's a seating lounge area plus some open space. I thought that was interesting.

A+ Ethiopian food that isn't crazy expensive like Berkeley or San Jose restaurants back home. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had never had Ethiopian food before but I was really curious to try an authentic restaurant. Of course, my friends and I used trusty yelp to find a restaurant and this was one of the first results.

Overall, the exterior is unlabeled and a bit difficult to see from the street. It's in an unassuming strip mall and took a few tries to find. However, the decor makes it stand out a bit.

When we entered, the waitress said we could sit wherever we liked and she came out with menus and took our drink order. I ordered a cinnamon iced tea, which I really liked. 

For our main order, my friend and I split a veggie combo plate for $11.99. This includes all of the veggie options on a thin injera disc and three pieces of injera bread on the side. 

For those of you who have never had injera bread, it's a doughy pancake-y type of bread with a strong sour taste, similar to sourdough bread. I personally enjoyed the injera but one of my friends has a distaste for sourdough bread so it kind of ruined the meal for her. She, however, did like her cabbage that she ordered. I liked all of the vegetarian options and I was glad that I got to sample them all. All of the options were delicious and surprisingly, very filling! My friend and I were able to eat maybe half of the plate together.

Overall, our waitress was very courteous and attentive, despite being the only one working there that day. There is also a small dance floor and various Ethiopian music videos playing on the projector at the back of the restaurant. Great authentic experience and I'm always happy to support small, family-owned businesses."}
{"text":"We ordered the veggie sampler. It was enough to share between my husband and me. But, you might need to order an appetizer to be really full. 

The food was really fresh, aromatic and delightfully spicy. We went on a sunday afternoon, but there was no compromise on the food quality and freshness. I loved the injeras. 

The ambiance and vibes are very homely.
We found a new place to be the frequent visitors."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nicely sized portions. The combo is very affordable and can be split with a few friends. Food is tasty but some of the meats seemed dry - either overcooked or from too many reheatings."}
{"text":"Really good value; you won't spend much to get a flavorful, very filling meal here. As with most Ethiopian restaurants, the menu items are served on a generous disk of soft injera bread, with more injera bread served on the side. While I was tempted to get the Veggie Combo with its 7 items and salad, I'm glad I opted to get the 4-item veggie combo because even that turned out to be a lot of food. I chose misir wat (red split lentils), fosolian (spiced string beans with carrots and onion), tikil gomen (cabbage with potatoes), and mushroom wat. The combo was a good balance of mild and bold-spicy flavors, and refreshing iced yekemen shai (a herbal tea of cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom) was a perfect match for the flavorful viands. This restaurant is a gem of a find in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall.. Entrance is shady but the food is very authentic and tasty. They don't pretend to be someone else."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Ethiopian food.
Everything was OK - I enjoyed the chicken and a couple of the lentil offerings. It took a minute to get accustomed to the sponge bread - but I really enjoyed it.

I have a big appreciation for social and communal foods - so this should have been right up my alley.

Overall, I found most of the items bland, and my dining companion said in her experience, most places she's been to have notably more spice.

We were in for a late lunch, there was only one other table seated - and service was somewhere between lackluster and very slow.

There was nothing wrong with the meal - but I think I'd rather check out other Ethiopian places than come back here."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice service. Visited the place twice. The place is not fancy but you can not expect much for the price. 
Tried Veggie combos, Doro wat, Veggie Samboosa and Coffee."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I had the meat and veggie combo platter with Tibs.  Being only one person, it was too much for me so I put the rest in a container for home.
Friendly service  and reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Had lunch there yesterday & so happy it's 5 min away from my house. Great food! If you have been to Laibela it's comparable. Had the veggie/meat combo & it's huge could feed 3! Go & check it out."}
{"text":"I Love this place!!! It's was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I regret it took me so long. First off, let me tell you, the portions are huge and can EASILY be split between two people! I find this important to state because when I arrived I ordered a salad, 2 orders of shambussa and an entree for myself...I only finished the salad. 

Service: I had to get up and ask for a water refill, but besides that our waitress was great and very knowledgeable of the menu.

Food: obviously this is the most important part of the review and I can honestly say, every cent spent was worth it! The food was flavored to perfection and was very reminiscent of home.
* If you like spice, you MUST try the salad.  Simple but very flavorful.
* ordered: salad, meat shambussa, meat combo, Gojo combo."}
{"text":"Everything about his place is amazing. The customer service was warm and friendly. The food (I had the lamb wot) was MIND BLOWING and the price, one plate feeds three very hungry students. If you are in Phoenix and haven't eaten here you are missing out. The coffee was also PHENOMENAL. This place is very hole in the wall and very worth it."}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite Ethiopian restaurant!  

Today we had the meat veggie combo platter. Vivien had red wine and I had Ethiopian St George Beer. 

The meats on the combo plate are chicken, lamb and beef. 

I LOVE their veggies! They included lentils, peas, string beans, cabbage and collard greens! I think I am forgetting something! 

No silverware is available! You eat with your fingers using the Injera bread. 

It is GREAT!"}
{"text":"This is probably our 5th time at the restaurants and we drive 30 mins from north Glendale as well :) 
Guess that's enough to say how much we love this place. 

Anyway, this time we were the happiest camper! Ordered lekwanda combo ($18) and 4choices veggie combo ($7), lekwanda has 3 meat dishes (2/3 are uncooked) so I won't recommend that for first timer. Gojo combo has a good amount of veggie dishes but we made the right choice to choose our veggie... the mushroom was the star of veggie dishes!!! We even wanted to buy a separate mushroom dishes To go. Would totally order it again. The mango juice was a gem as well! We Love everything 

So happy we are moving to Tempe! Only 15 mins away from this hole-in-the-wall now xD"}
{"text":"I got a delicious vegetarian combo and Ethiopian coffee for just $14, you really can't beat that!!! I've only been to a handful of Ethiopian restaurants and noticed that all the décor and furniture are very outdated and dirty.  Maybe it's just the restaurants that I've been to so that means that I need to start going to more Ethiopian restaurants :) :)

When I walked in, the young hostess, waitress and cashier was very warm and inviting.  I ordered the following:
Meat Sambussa ($3): it came with 3-3\"x3\" pieces.  The crispy wrapper was filled with very flavorful beef and veggies.  It came with a tomato dipping sauce but the appetizer tasted great as is.  

4 item vegetarian with Injera bread ($7): one item had spinach, another item had green beans and carrots, another item had cabbage and potato and then lentils.  It was all so good!!!  The Injera bread was cold so I don't know if this place serves it cold because I've had it hot with other places I go to.  But it was still good. 

Ethiopian Coffee ($3): It was bold and smooth.  So delicious to end my dinner with this coffee.

I will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere!  I like getting the combo platters...especially the vegetarian one.  Reasonable prices.  No alcohol license, I believe."}
{"text":"Good value good flavors, mediocre ambiance.

In a unsuspecting old strip mall you will find and international mix of Chinese, Mexican and Ethiopian. Walk inside and the 1980's decore of glass block and an akward stage will greet you. Don't worry too much as the flavors are worth it.

For veggie people the menu (maybe lunch menu?) had 7 options including the old stands like Mizir what and, tikki komen and a dish that was new to me a mushroom wot.

I oped for the 4 item combo, 6.99 A real bargain considering it comes with enough anjera to feed an army and is presented on the same tray that one can feed  4 from. There were 4 decent sized scoops of the food on it. Each had great flavor and textures where appropriate. 

Service was a bit slow, however due to the slow lunch hour they staff accordingly. This did mean my drink was not refilled."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Gojo for New Year's Eve dinner before attending the symphony.  We didn't mind the low-key decor and leisurely service - sometimes good food can be found in dives, especially ethnic food.  I had the veggie sampler, and my hubby had the meat sampler.  We started with meat sambussas, which were yummy but entirely unnecessary, given how much food we got in our entrees.  I also had some hot spiced tea, and he had an Ethiopian beer.  Overall we were really happy with the food, and the server was very friendly and accommodating.  We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Great food, very reasonably priced. Very nice and informative server as we had not eaten Ethiopian food before. Was empty on a Friday night so I hope people see the reviews and help them make it. The lamb was especially delicious.

I've been back since with good results.

Previously posted this as a tip but wanted it to be a review."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food in the Valley. Absolutely outstanding. The atmosphere is a little weird, and the service is a little slow, but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"How this place has 4 stars I will never know. Ordered the meat/veggie combo to go and only received the vegetarian portions. Unfortunately this was not the problem. Of all the options received: Misir Wot (Lentils), Defen Misir, Mitten Shiro, Ater kik (Peas), Gome Wot (Collard), Fosolian (String Beans), Tikil Gomen (Cabbage), only the Fosolian was good. The Gome Wot and Tikil Gomen were OK. However all the pea or lentil dishes (4 dishes) tasted near identical, extremely salty similar to a dry soup mix. Generous portions of injera. The injera however was dry on the edges and the flavor was a bit sharp (too much teff flour). My compadre ordered the Meat Sampler: Doro Wot, Key Wot, Alitcha Wot. I tried the Doro Wot and it was only OK. I won't be back. I suggest going to Café Lalibela."}
{"text":"Made a return trip with family and still a hit.  So I'm submitting this update review to encourage folks to give this place a try.  We had St. George (Ethiopian) beer, vegetable sambussa, and the house combination platter, followed by Ethiopian coffee - flavorful and strong.  Delicious!  And, once again, service was warm and wonderful - and not in the least obnoxious.  If the next few trips here are as good as the first ones, I up this to a five star place even though the setting is a bit tired."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and worth 5 stars! 

Blue Nile in Tempe was my Go-to for Ethiopian, but when they closed down I was forced to look elsewhere. Luckily I came across this place on Yelp and with the amount of other Yelpers comparing this to Blue Nile, I knew I had to try it out and I am so happy I did!

My husband and I always get their Meat/Veggie combo ($14) to split. This comes 3 meat dishes: doro wot (chicken), key wot (beef), and Alitcha Wot (lamb); all of their veggie dishes (yay, my fav!) served on top of one large injera (sourdough-ish spongy bread) and with a side of rolled up injera. For those that are not familiar with Ethiopian Food, its best to eat the injera that is served under the dishes, that way you get more flavor! The Meat/Veggie combo is so much food for two people, we always have a bit leftover and I usually order their spiced tea ($1.50), so for all this food and drink our total (depending on if the hubster gets a drink) is anywhere from $16 to $19! You can't beat that price for a meal that leaves you full for hours afterward!. 

So why only four stars? Well, the \"decor\" is the left over, dilapidated Bacchanal (Opa!) decor with a few scattered Ethiopian advertisement posters on the wall. It could really, really use a cosmetic lift. It appears that the women's bathroom has upgraded its appearance from my previous experiences which is great because it needed a lot of help. My husband said the men's bathroom is still rough. Secondly, the service is SLOW, even when the restaurant is empty, somehow there is always a delay in receiving drinks. But, I have come to expect this so its not really an issue for me anymore. I just mention it because know it will bother a lot of people out there. The food is worth though - so don't give up, just come hydrated!

There are two booths in the back with the traditional mesabs (low, round wicker tables) with a few stools and plenty of regular tables with a clear vinyl tablecloth which weirds me out. Because this place is never at full occupancy, the husband and I always get to choose where we want to sit.

I love eating with my hands so Ethiopian food and I are best friends!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. This was our first time eating Ethiopian food with my husband, and we were really surprised because it tasted absolutely amazing... highly recommended. Also, the staff is pretty friendly. They explained us what was everything, and how to eat it. Great experience.! Psd. Combos feed 2 people, and they are soooo affordable."}
{"text":"My Ethiopian friend recommended this place to me so you know it's good. First time trying Ethiopian food and shared the meat/veggie combo with a friend to try as much as we can. Loved it (for some reason, it reminds me a lot of Indian food). The slightly sour taste of injera bread takes a little getting used to but I enjoyed my whole meal overall. Will come back!"}
{"text":"The food is so good.   The Veggie Combo is especially good.  I told the server I liked a particular dish, and she brought me an extra complimentary bowl of it!  They definitely have an alcohol license.  The St. George amber is nice.  And the Ethiopian coffee is amazing,  and roasted on site!  I can overlook the dated and dingy surroundings."}
{"text":"We had the veggie and meat platter, the flavors were good and each unique to their own. Better than another place we ended up in Phoenix a month ago, for sure. 
The prices were also reasonable and service was fine. Our server was nice, but it wasn't busy and it took a while to get her attention and our check once we were ready to head out. I'd go again, but looking forward to trying a few more spots out."}
{"text":"2* is only for the ambience and service. the restrooms don't have lock. There is just one guy to serve on the whole floor and he is kinda okay. I ordered coffee and he was comparing it to start bucks the whole time I was there. This restaurant is in a shady area though.

I would rate food a 4 on 5."}
{"text":"I'm pretty obsessed with this place, the food is awesome. I usually order one of the huge platters and it feeds me for a couple days. The injera is some of the best I've had. They also have this amazing spiced iced tea. 

The only drawback is semi slow service, but the food is ready so quickly it doesn't really matter if it takes longer than usual to order."}
{"text":"We tried the vegetarian combo platter and it was nothing short of phenomenal! 

Don't let the few bad/stupid reviews on here deter you from enjoying this place! 

If you're a fan of Ethiopian food, you have to try Gojo. No questions."}
{"text":"The food is very good . The lentil soup is very flavorful and tasty. The server is also very nice."}
{"text":"We loved the food here and agreed it was the best ethiopian we have tried! $13 for the meat and vege combo plate leaving 2 diners stuffed! The ethiopian spiced iced tea was also very nice and flavorful. Some soccer game was playing on a projector. Love sharing and eating with our hands. The only downside was the lack of service (we had to ask for napkins and hope for refills). Still we would be back in a heartbeat. Great place for parties of up to 20 at one table (if you don't mind waiting)."}
{"text":"Just delicious.

I had the veggie combo which was way too much food for one person, and I took more than half of the plate home. The restaurant was pretty empty when I arrived at noon on a Wednesday. The service was slow but not as bad as the other reviews describe. I probably waited 5 minutes to place my order after I closed my menu, then my order came out about 10 minutes later. It was during the winter holidays so 2 young boys who called the chef, \"mommy\" were being cute off in the corner. I will definitely be coming back often."}
{"text":"Living in North Phoenix, I was stoked to hear about an Ethiopian restaurant closer than Tempe, and I wasn't disappointed.  

Ambiance was somewhat dreary (in an awesome way).  Housed in a strip mall, the interior was all plain round tables and clear, glass bathroom blocks.  Seemingly a former bar, as our table was on the dance floor, I daydreamed about the late night hours when it turned into some funky East African night club.  (It doesn't, unfortunately.)

My table mates thought the service was a little slow, but I barely noticed.  So, great if you're having a casual dinner w/ friends, but not necessarily if you want to pick up a really quick bite before the movies.

Food was unexpectedly amazing, although we skipped the meat dishes, in favor of the veggie combo.  Injera was definitely better than elsewhere and the rest seemed a little more flavorful, too. Bill for party of four was insanely low, even w/ a couple of teas and a beer or two (the latter of which usually adds a ridiculous amount, anywhere).

Definitely heading back and hoping it sticks around for awhile, especially in a city where Fox Restaurant Concepts is the disappointing status quo.

Wheelchair friendly, although excepting the restroom, which we didn't try."}
{"text":"Writing to support a cute local business.  The restaurant is nothing to shake a stick at.  It still has circa 1983 glass block low wall dividers with tables that I'm sure have seen better days.  But you really are coming for the food.  And boy is there food a plenty.  The prices are dirt dirt cheap.  A veggie combo (4 different scoops of veggies/lentils/hummus etc) set on fluffy injera (with more injera on the side) is a whopping seven dollars.  Go for broke and order the large combination which comes with three meat dishes. It'll be $13.99  At this rate you can afford to have chai teat (hot or cold) and dessert.  Now I didn't try the dessert, I'm informed however it is baklava.  I will be back soon.  This is the type of place where you come to sit with a friend and talk.  The service is languid (i.e. not fast) but then again, they aren't going to hustle you out either.  It looks like they must have a hoppin' night life, with it's raised stage and what appears to be a screen broadcasting Ethiopian news.   (Oh and it still looks like the old Bacchanal, so it's like Greek restaurant meets Ethiopian teenager bedroom with crooked posters on the wall)  Overall though, it's a nice treat to be able to get away from the hot outdoors, break some spongy bread and not have to drive all the way to Tempe for some ethnic food that is a little less run of the mill than our usual taco joint."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service!  If you are looking for a unique dining experience definitely check this place out!  The prices are also super low for the amount of food you get :-) 

A definite \"Must Try\"!"}
{"text":"This was the second Ethiopian restaurant I've been to. The guy didn't greet us and told us where to sit from behind the bar. He didn't seem to interested answering my questions. But the food was delicious. Oh, and we didn't get any refills even though he clearly saw my glass was empty."}
{"text":"Good Ethiopian food at a very cheap price. The chicken curry and tibs very really good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here with a good-sized group of friends and we had an awesome time. This was my first experience with Ethiopian food but I'll be back for sure. First of all, it was all served family-style and you eat the meal by pulling apart the bread (injera) and dipping it by hand. All of the dips were amazing- most were some variation on lentils, or stewed meats. Some spicy, some not. The injera was...different. Tasty, but like nothing I've ever had before. It almost had a sourdough flavor to it, although it was flat and a bit spongy. And the food was FILLING even though it looked like small portions. We arrived hungry and still took food home. And it was CHEAP. I think there were 10 of us at the table, we ordered full meals and apps, and the tab with tip was under $60. Service was friendly and fast with none of the odd experiences that other reviewers have had. Definitely recommended if you're in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and they were good so my friend Shane and I decided to give it a try. This is my second time eating Ethiopian food. I ordered the meat and veggie plate. The taste of the food is very very good. The service was not good at all so that is why I could not give them 5 stars. After they brought our food they never came back to see if we needed anything nor to give us our tab. We got up to get a plate to go and get the tab. We grabbed the plate to go and tab and went and sat down again. They never came back to pick up out payment. We had to get up again to pay. The food tasted so good. The meat and veggie plate was to much for one person. I took the rest home and gave it to my daughter. I know she will love it once she eats it."}
{"text":"This has been a five-star place for me in the past, and the food is still tasty, but the condition of this restaurant is disgusting. It seemed like most of the light fixtures were missing a bulb or two, the interior could best be described as \"urban decay\", and I would not send someone to the bathroom on a bet.

One of the many problems with the restaurant's condition is that the kitchen is just a few steps from the bathroom. If management has the nerve to keep a bathroom so uncleanly and deteriorating, what does that say about their health standards generally?

Incidentally, the food tasted good (and the service was fine), but I did get ill for the next twelve hours or so. Power of suggestion? Maybe, but the stomach knows what the stomach knows."}
{"text":"Interestingly rustic. Pretty much what you expect from an Ethiopian restaurant. I had the Gojo combination which was very tasty and flavorful. It is a good representation of the various foods of their country. Some was very spicy some was just plain tasty. My friend got the lamb. He said it was okay. I don't think he was ready for the bitter kale that it was made with. 

Be ready to eat with your hands for every dish comes with a basket of bread like dough for scooping and the tray your food comes out on is also lined with this for convenience eating.

This is a family restaurant as in they are a small family trying to work a restaurant. So be patient the food is worth it and the people are very nice."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  
The food was flavorful and delicious.  The meat sombossa was awesome and the gojo combo plater had a great variety of flavors and foods. Our first experience of Ethiopian food was looking up. 
Today the proprietor seemed to be in a rush and the only one working. 
After the meal we wanted to take the left overs home.  So he came back with a. In and proceeded to shovel everything on top of each other.  This made one item indistinguishable from another and he said that's how they do it cuz he had customers.   I'm not sure what we were but if I want Ethiopian food I will search yelp for another place."}
{"text":"My husband and I love taking friends to this restaurant to try Ethiopian food. The exterior is pretty underwhelming and the interior is large, with rickety tables and chairs and some Ethiopian decor, but it all adds to the experience for me. We usually get an order of meat sambusa (like a samosa or a savory empanada) as an appetizer and then the combo, meat, or veggie platter depending on how many of us there are. The combo platter is enough for my husband, my brother (with a large appetite), and me. If we have more people, we'll get one meat and one veggie platter. It usually works out to $6-9/person. The different curries and meats come served as dollops on top of a Injera bread platter. Injera bread is like a thick sour crepe and it pairs very well with the different dishes. We tear off a piece of bread and scoop up some meat or curry and eat it. If you're looking for an interesting food experience, you should definitely try it!

Pros:
-Try lots of yummy interesting food!
-Cheap.
-Family run restaurant.

Cons:
-Slow service. There is usually only one server.
-The tap water has tasted kind of weird before. I usually bring my own water or ask for a bottle of water."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Some of the best Ethiopian I have had. We live close to an hour away from this place but would definitely make the trip again. 

Didn't get the 5 stars purely because of lack of any ambiance. Iv been to other Ethiopian places and as much as they are \"whole in the wall\" type of places, the interior somewhere gave you good, authentic vibe. The location is also a bit blah. We went closet to 10 pm and our car was the only car in their parking lot. Inside we were also the only customers. But when the food is as good as this I guess its easy to overlook. 

My husband and I ordered the meat and veggie combo. Everything was super delicious. Typically we have seen there a few dishes like the doro wat that tends to be pretty spicy but here everything had a different dimension to their flavors, so although the spice was lacking a bit we didnt seem to miss it too much. 

A must try place for sure."}
{"text":"Ehtiopian cuisine can be summed up in a few simple words: flavorful stew on bread.  The meat dishes are packed with savory spices such as \"berbere\" (Ethiopian spice mixture which includes chile pepper, garlic, ginger, cardamom, pepper)  

The dishes, referred to as 'Wat\", begin with sauteeing onions, then adding berbere or a slew of varying degrees of spices (depending on level of heat in the dish), legumes such as split peas and lentils, and meats such as lamb and beef.  Wats can be vegetarian, vegan, or entirely suited for carnivores.  Vegans rest assured that majority of Ethiopian cooks have found many alternatives to cooking with animal fats due  strict fasting periods where consumption of animals is forbidden.

\"Wat\" is incredibly flavorful.  In fact, there is hardly a dish at Gojo that isn't packed with  toothsome ingredients.  And to get the best representation I suggest the meat and veggie combo, which offers more than a half dozen \"Wats\", and costs only $13.99.  Represented will be Doro Wot, Key Wot, and Alitcha Wot in the meat category.

Doro Wot is the national dish of Ethiopia, a chicken stew using chicken legs where the meat falls off the bone, and is seasoned with \"berbere\", cumin, garlic,and many other dried herbs.

Key Wot,  the spicy beef stew, is one of my favorites.  It tastes very similar to Hungarian Goulash, as along with the \"berbere\" there are strong flavors of paprika -  along with cumin, turmeric, nutmeg, fenugreek, cloves, coriander, cinnamon, and more.  I think this dish speaks to the allure of Ethiopian, as there is such a beautiful amalgam of flavors.  

Finally, Alitcha Wot delivers another truly unique flavor profile and texture with lamb, yellow split peas, garam masala, cayenne, and tomato paste.

Misir Wot, the red lentils cooked with berbere deliver such a beautiful flavor and texture that you don't even realize it has no meat.  I highly recommend this, and this generally comes on the combo plate.  The lentil and split pea wats are in my opinion the best and most flavorful.  Other items you will find on your combo plate are collard greens, cabbage, string bean, and carrot.  All of them prepared in the \"Wat\" style, simmered in onions and garlic and seasoned with \"berbere\".

It blows my mind that my dining partner and I had two beverages, the meat sambussas (pastry stuffed w/ a blend of minced beef, onions, scallions, peppers & herbs) and the meat/veggie combo, and the total came to $22.

Highly recommend this experience, and indulging in these beautiful spices!"}
{"text":"I would give one star to the place cleanliness, another one for the appetizer , Samosa in all kinds, the third star about respecting Muslims population and serving Halal food. The atom regarding Ethiopia is realistic, you feel like Ethiopia and then your clothes will  be smelled as spices. The lost two others, one went in the cold main dish served which frustrated me. The other one is on the waiter himself since there was no checking on either food or beverages."}
{"text":"This place is a little piece of Ethiopian heaven!! 
To start the injera bread is huge and so delicious I could eat it for days! 
The Ethiopian salad is so tasty and the jalapeño gives it a little kick.
We had the cabbage and collards both cooked to perfection. 
Can't beat the prices for the amount of food! 
Will definitely be coming back ... A lot!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hip trendy place, this is not it. But if you want something new, this is a great place. The food was really good and filling (and spicy!). You have to get used to not eating with a fork and knife. You use a kind of flat bread to pick up the food with. Other than that, it's really good."}
{"text":"Two of us discovered this Ethiopian restaurant on Yelp and decided to come here for lunch. We were the first to arrive and the black-white colored interior consisted of a small bar, and plenty of tables that spread across several platforms that overlooked a screen looping various images of Ethiopia. 

We had the Meat and Vegetarian Combo ($13.99) that came with seven vegetarian items and our choice of lamb. There were two types of lentils and split peas, string beans, collard greens, spiced cabbage, and mushrooms. The ingredients were fresh and arrived with good consistency. However, the flavors were rather subdued as many items could use more spice and pop in the flavor.  One of their lentils was served at room temperature, and although such practice is common, I still prefer the warm version.

The Alitcha Wot was a bit dry and very greasy. The lamb was unexpectedly swimming in a pool of oil and not aesthetically pleasing. This is not a dish I would order again.

Their injera was fluffy and soft. As other reviewers had mentioned, it is on the sour side, but I really enjoyed it. However, there was a general lack of depth and intensity in the flavor when compared to others that might be more authentic.

Portions were huge and menu prices were excellent. Service was warm, friendly, and attentive. However, the worst part of this experience was when they overcharged the meal by having us to pay these two dishes separately--instead of the combo price that was listed on the menu. 

Several reviewers have mentioned about Blue Nile, so that's the next place I'm going to visit. Otherwise, I recommend people to try Lalibela for those that are searching for the cuisine in the area. My favorite of all times is still by far Awash, hands down."}
{"text":"My wife and I went together. We ordered the meat Sambosas and a salad for an appetizer to share. There are 3 Sambosas on the platter. My wife was a big fan of the Sambosas, she does not tend to like Middle Eastern, Indian, or African foods so this is a good menu item for a child or less adventurous eater. Sambosas reminded me of Spanikopita. The salad was lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and fresh jalapeño pepper. The dressing was lime juice, oil, salt, and pepper. The salad was amazing! The jalapeño was too hot for my wife, however I did not think it was very spicy.
We shared a meat and veggie combo which included everything in the vegetarian dish, Doro Wot, Key Wot, and Alitcha Wot. The combo also comes with Injera bread. As soon as the server placed the platter on the table we felt the room fill with the aroma of the spices. The food melted in our mouths. I was a fan of all the items. My wife enjoyed the vegetable and lentil items. Neither of us enjoyed the injera very much, however the injera pairs well with the bulkier meat dishes.
We both had water to drink. I had the iced tea, it was flavorful and tasted of cinammon. My wife had the Ethiopian coffee. It was strong and rich, we both enjoyed the taste. 
The served was very sweet, she was helpful with recommendations on the menu, however we were not provided with a refill on water when requested. It did not dampen the mood. The meal was delicious and filling. It was also affordable. We paid about $27 for the meal (not including tip). I would return to dine again. My wife most likely would not."}
{"text":"First time for this food.  It was delicious.  Recommend a combo plate for two to share.  Then buy another of what you want more of . . . It's all good.  Fun dining experience!"}
{"text":"We had the Gojo platter. Meat sauces and lentils are fantastic and compare to others I've had (LA, Vegas, homemade by my Ethiopian friend). Cabbage needs improvement. Mushroom/onion sauce was one of the best things I've ever eaten. 

Service was horrible. A friend said this was her favorite Ethiopian place and that she brings a lot people and business clients there. She said she had seen the man who serves us before, but had never been served by him. We weren't sure of a particular sauce from our platter that we wanted to reorder and he was rude and unhelpful when we asked. He brought out the wrong thing and then acted like a 10 year old child asking \"well what do you want\". SIR I'm from CHICAGO. If I was from Ethiopia I'd know. Then he continues to huff and puff and sigh while he was going back and forth from our table to the kitchen. Seriously dude?!?! 

The food is good. 
But service is equally important. 
Haven't decided if I'll give this place my money again. So many other highly reviewed Ethiopian places to try in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A sad end to a short, but passionate affair. 

A friend reviewed Gojo and inspired us to try it. We do a lot of take out, but not with a new spot. So we waited until we could dine in and finally tried this place a couple of months ago.

They've been in business for two years and I am not sure if they repainted or redecorated since Bacchanal closed, but the murals seem to fit and it's a lot brighter inside now. Nothing fancy, but clean and welcoming.

We dined in late on a Saturday night and they were rocking out to the Ethiopian music videos that were projected on the main wall (where Bacchanal's stage/dance floor was). And there was a group of young men (possibly just finished with football) at a larger table that were singing along and having a good time. Total, I think there were only 6 tables seated, including ours while we were there. And I think there was only one server, but she did a great job. She noticed an empty water glass and filled it without being asked and checked on us a couple of times. She also really seems to love her job and treated us like she knew us and was happy we were there.

We ordered the veggie sambusa appetizer and two veggie combos and it was a lot of food. We loved it all! The Veggie Sambusa appetizer included 3 triangular fried pastries, stuffed with lentils. They were hot! After they cooled down, we tore them apart with our hands and dipped them in the sauce, which reminded me of salsa. They were pretty good.

The Veggie Combo is served on a large platter and all of the items are on one large injera, which is like a spongy sourdough tortilla/pancake made out of teff (low gluten, in case you're not a glutton for gluten). A basket with 3 additional rolled up injera came with each of our platters. The sour flavor of the injera complements the salty-spicy flavors of the lentils, sweet yellow peas, greens, cabbage and potato, green beans and carrots, and another bean/grain dish(?). It was all so delicious and fun to eat with our hands.

We were very happy to work Gojo into our nightly rotation and for the past 2 months we have eaten here once a week, mostly take out.

Then it happened. There was a dice sized cube of meat in my food. If you eat meat, imagine biting into a cat's paw, cockroach, or a human finger and having to pull it out of your mouth to examine it and then imagine it cooking with the rest of your food, spreading its juices, fat, and flavors. For this vegetarian, that is a show stopper. I couldn't finish my food and didn't plan to keep the leftovers. My stomach felt off the rest of the night. Mr. H had devoured most of his food already, but was likewise hesitant to continue and we ended up dumping the rest of the food. Accidents happen, but for this type of food - stews cooked in separate pots - the thought of there being cross contamination is really gross."}
{"text":"We went to Gojo last night, and it was DELICIOUS!!!! 

The restaurant wasn't very busy (we might have been the only ones there), so we got most of the attention of Sarah, the lovely waitress/bartender. She doesn't speak English very well, but the food was wonderful, so who cares? =D  

The two of us split an appetizer ($3) and the Gojo Combo ($16), and we had quite a bit leftover. It was such a great deal!!  

We also got a glass of their homemade honey wine (not as sweet as it sounds), and it was fantastic!  We will definitely be going back very soon. :)"}
{"text":"My go-to place for Ethiopian. Very authentic setting. Some relishes can have a little sour taste sometimes perhaps cause they're older but when it's fresh, it's on point"}
{"text":"I split the veggie platter with a friend and we only got just over half way through it.  Got the rest to go.  I couldn't wait until I had room to eat again so I could eat the leftovers.  Sooo much good stuff.  I'm usually not a glutton, but there are a precious few places where I lose all self control and beach myself and this is apparently one of them.
We were there for an hour and half and asked all sorts of questions about how things were made and what they were.  The lady that waited on us may have been the owner.  She was cheerful and happily indulged our questions.
It's a large restaurant with plenty of seating for large groups, but it also seems to be an authentic family outfit.  They have a few beers in bottles and apparently authentic music.
I'm sad that I'm moving out of this neighborhood right as this moved in!  If I weren't leaving, I'd probably give up cooking entirely and just eat here every day, or try to get take-out.
If you're downtown or on the east side of Phoenix, it's worth the trip.  Really good ethnic places outside of the Italian/Chinese/Mexican/American mold are a treasure here in Phoenix.  If you're from somewhere more metropolitan, you know what I'm talking about.   West Bring friends, dates, clients, and employees here and impress them."}
{"text":"I can't believe Tasia  hasn't reviewed this place yet. I never thought I would beat her to a review. She is such a high maintenance Yelp whore....I love it

I took the lovely lady here for Valentines day. I know my woman is a keeper when her idea of a romantic Valentines day dinner was eating with our hands, mid meal food fights and fighting for the check. ( I Won) 

When we walked in, I was a bit nervous. The place was empty, totally empty, and their is a huge projector that was showing strange videos and playing funky Ethiopian music...I blame the emptiness on Valentines day, i doubt it is their busiest night of the year. 

We sat down, and pretty quickly decided on a veggie platter, and meat platter. I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were. The service was fine, we weren't overly services just because it was a quiet night, which I appreciate. I hate being bothered by a server over and over because they are bored. Food was delicious, so flavorful and fun to eat. 

I can't wait to go back here when I return from New York."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is fantastic and the prices are awesome!
It was my first time trying Ethiopian food and now I am a fan."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the prices were extremely reasonable.  I noticed a lot of others commented about the slow pace of service.  I've got to say I have to join in with that.  We were the only people in the restaurant and the tea I ordered with our food only came out about five minutes before we were done eating, only after I asked the waiter if it was ever coming the one time he managed to appear from the kitchen after bringing our dinner.  I'd go back, but not in a rush, and I definitely will stick with water, or maybe bring my own just in case it never comes."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The waitress was beyond nice and even demonstrated how to eat the food. It was my first time eating Ethiopian food, and I wish I had watched a YouTube tutorial on how to properly eat the food. It's difficult! (Really. Go find a tutorial before you try this). 

Will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"My niece is going on a trip to Ethiopia with her church in October. So we had a fundraising party for her and thought it would be fun to have Ethiopian food. I found Gojo's on yelp. I had never eaten this type of food before and didn't know what to order. People in the restaurant were so friendly and helpful. I had ordered enough food for about 30 people, and the amount that we got would have probably had 50 people. The food was so incredible, so much flavor in every dish. There were three meat dishes, beef lamb and chicken. Of those my favorite was the beef, such an intense flavor very delicious. Then we had five vegetarian dishes, three different types of lentil dishes all with amazing flavor. There was a cabbage and potato dish that everybody raved about. Last was a green bean and carrot dish that had a slight sweetness to it, was delicious. I forget what the little rolls of bread are called, but they are delicious and soak up the sauce perfectly. My guests were all very happy with the food. I had scheduled the pick up time for 4 o'clock, all of the food was ready and piping hot. This is really one of the best experiences I've had with a restaurant. I want to thank them for making our party very successful. I think this is my new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"So I am only giving 1 star because I have to to write the review. I'd give - if possible.

I ordered from them Friday night, on the way home from the airport after a long day out of state training for work. I ordered the Gojo Combo to go. I drove straight there from the airport and then home to Gilbert (30 min away) when I arrived home the tibs were ALL burnt beyond even close to edible. The Lamb, Chicken and beef (all the meats in the meat part of the combo) were so dry and chewy that I was not able to eat them. There was no flavor at all to any of it and therefore only ate some of the veggies. 

I called Saturday when they opened, as they were closed by the time I arrived home Friday night and discovered the burnt food. The owner told me that she would refund me, only 1/2 the amount though. And I'd have to drive 30 minutes there and 30 back, for $7.50. Then after asking if I could just send a picture of the food instead of driving an hour round trip for $7.50 refund, the owner started getting rude with me and then said that I would only have the option now to get the portion that was wrong/burnt remade. I asked again if I could just send a picture of the food since what she was refunding was less than the cost of the gas and time that I'd be spending to just get it read and she refused! This was ridiculous! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!! The food was less than slightly flavorful. And to be totally honest, when I googled Ethiopian food, I actually thought that it was a different place off of 42nd street and McDowell. When I gps'd it and was getting closer I realized which one Gojo was and was initially disappointed with myself for not remembering them from 1 other past experience where the food was Blah, to say the least and the service from the owner dismissive and lacking any customer service at all. Save your money and your tastebuds and don't go here!"}
{"text":"The service is great! The food is awesome! This is my second time coming and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 but because of the non half stars, I'll give it a 4.

Food was great, but service was lackadaisical. The woman, who I believe owned the restaurant was very polite and very nice but took forever. The food was quick, but in terms of ordering drinks and food, dropping off drinks, offering a check, picking up our check and returning the card, it took far too long. We had to ask for the check and then literally put the check on top of a glass wall for it to be picked up.

On that note, the food was good and always flavorful. It's very decently priced. They could spruce up the ambience, however we came on a Monday. They're only 6 months old, according to her, so I think they're open for suggestions.

Also, there's a very odd drink on their menu called Breast Milk on Acid? While humorous my date and I found this rather bizarre."}
{"text":"Ethiopian food is the hidden gem of the food world. I'm telling you if you've never given it a try, you are in for a treat. The spices and flavor combinations are unique and unlike anything I've ever had, but not in a way that might be hard to handle for people with a more sensitive palette. I've taken a handful of uninitiated friends and family here, and they have all raved about the food. There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options that rival any of the meat dishes. I always get the veggie combo, which allows you to sample four of the veggie items. For less than ten bucks, the price is hard to beat, especially since the big portion sizes and teff injera on the side generally lead to leftovers the next day. The atmosphere and customer care might be a little different than people are used to, but that's what happens when you open yourself up to a new culinary experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Gojo for several years and I really can't think of a better value out there! They can accommodate probably any dietary restriction, even me as a gluten free vegan! 

I always get the veggie platter which is $7.99 and it comes with 4 different items on injera bread. You eat everything here with your hands/injera bread, in case you don't know what you're getting into! 

Some of the items are spicy, which I personally love, so make sure to ask if you're sensitive to spice. Everything is so flavorful and even though a lot of dishes sound similar they all have their own distinct flavor. 

Try the cinnamon tea; it's delicious! 

The service can sometimes be slow when they are busy because there is normally only one server, but it's the type of environment that you don't rush anyway. Go to take your time, enjoy your company, and enjoy your meal and the experience. It's definitely a different and unique dining experience and everyone should try it at least once!"}
{"text":"Caveat: I have eaten at several Ethiopian restaurants but am not an expert in this cuisine.  So let me write my review in the form of questions.

1.  Should the injera (the soft flat bread that is served with just about everything) be overwhelmingly sour?
2.  Should virtually all of the meat and vegetarian dishes be hot enough to burn one's mouth a bit, but be otherwise devoid of flavor?
3.  Should pictures on the wall be askew, tables have prominent number stands as a centerpiece, and the ambient air temperature be about 90 degrees?

If you answer yes to these questions, Gojo is for you.

If not, you might object to the pricing as well, which is rather high for an atmosphereless, local, ethnic restaurant.

Note: The second star is for pleasant service and decent sambussas."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends the other evening.  Was surprised to learn that almost everything on their menu was hot and spicy (which I cannot eat).  Ethopian food is not supposed to be this way.  I ordered the only meat dish that was not spicy and it was OK. But this stuff they serve instead of bread I believe was the culprit.  I found out that it is fermented.  Well you know what fermented foods do to your stomach.  Think SAUERKRAUT.  I no sooner finished than I had to quickly excuse myself and make a beeline to the bathroom.  Now I know when I need a laxative to head to Gojo instead.  LOL
My 5 friends ordered 2 of those enormous platters which was way too much for them so they had boxes to go.  Always under order as you can always order extra IF that is not enough for your group.  Figure that 1 platter will serve 4-5 persons."}
{"text":"The food here is really great and it's ridiculously cheap.  $13 bucks fed two hungry men and could have easily fed 3 normal people. Our waitress was really friendly and made a good suggestion.  This is the kind of local mom and pop joint that I love.  There is no decor and no ambiance to speak of but I kind of like that in this setting.  You really feel like you're in Addis Ababa having a meal.  It's very Blood Diamonds decor.  I've never been to Africa so I can only use movies as a reference."}
{"text":"My first experience with authentic African cuisine occurred at Gojo Ethiopian Restaurant (3015 East Thomas Road, Suite 101, Phoenix, AZ 85016). I ordered the Veggie Combo, which consisted of a sampler of all the vegetable items on the menu, served on Injera, a flat bread made out of fermented teff flour. The food was eaten in the traditional manner by using Injera in the right hand to pick up the vegetables. The fresh vegetables were tasty and full of flavor. The Injera was most interesting in texture, yet quite good and filling. The staff was very helpful in explaining the menu items. The facilities were clean and parking was readily available."}
{"text":"I went to Gojo wanting to try something new. I had very low expectations not having read any of the reviews.  And it was AMAZING! Friendly staff.  Great food. We got the Gojo plater and Kitfo. Very kindly, the waiter warned is that the Kitfo was raw ground beef, which we appreciated, but decided to have anyway.  And wow! Evening was so tasty and I had a nice cold Ethiopian beer. 
Well done, Gojo!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were big fans of Blue Nile Cafe in Tempe. When it closed, we were left with a big tasty void in our lives. The other Ethiopian restaurants we tried just didn't stack up but we pressed on and hoped for something better.

Gojo is the new Blue Nile Cafe for us.

We didn't see sambusa on the menu so we asked. Sure they'd make them for us. They were outstanding: bigger than Blue Nile's and smaller than Messob's (our reigning favorite Ethiopian in Los Angeles) and so flavorful.

We had the Ethiopian iced tea and it was delightful. It's like regular iced tea but with Ethiopian spices. I'd highly recommend it as it's not intense at all.

We ordered two of the meat and vegetable combos, but the waitress suggested we'd only need one since they're substantial. I appreciated that. The injera was perfect, the dishes were exemplary. If you like Ethiopian food, this is the place you need to try!"}
{"text":"As I write this review, my eyes keep shifting to the pictures of the food and I'm tempted to go to Gojo right now. I noticed several newer Ethiopian restaurants have somewhat recently opened and I want to work my way through them all. This one is really good. If psychedelic has a flavor, this is it. The sample platters let you work your way through different combinations of layers of taste and textures, and the seasoning is robust and all around perfect. I went for the 7-veggie option because I wanted to sample everything. Looking back... I'd order the same thing again. I was too indecisive with what I had to narrow it down to larger portions of 4 items.

Portions are massive, so you have to bring your appetite. Even then, I had to take home leftovers because it was too much food for me to eat. I tried though, I just don't have enough room in my stomach to finish it in one sitting. The bonus to that is that I can have it again for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Upfront - if you're on a first date sitting in the restaurant trying to figure out what to order, you've come to the right review, not just for your culinary needs. Your date, too.

Order the combo. $15 and it'll feed you both. Then take your date game up 2 notches and order an appetizer (the samosa things are great) and a pot of Ethiopian coffee. \"Damn,\" she'll think. \"He's assertive and knows what he likes, that's good. Plus, he's not a cheapskate. He's ordering appetizers and drinks, that means his bank account isn't empty.\"

Congrats, friend, you're off to a good start.

Now, where are you sitting? At a table? You're embarrassing me. Get up and move to the corner booth with the little wicker table thing with the cover on it. That's a table, yes. Take off the table hat. Put it on her head. Is she laughing? That's good. Does she look pissed? It's ok, you're not going to spend more than $15 on her here anyways, and now you know she's not worth asking out again. That's the kind of built-in value Go-Jo provides.

Take a picture of her. Now scootch in close and get a selfy together. Now take the hat off. She doesn't want to wear it all night.

The combo is going to show up - a huge circle of unleavened sourdough-like bread with different food on top. It's going to have no silverware with it. That's because the BREAD IS THE SILVERWARE. \"Wow,\" she thinks. \"He's so adventurous.\"

Try the meat in the middle. Tell her the meat is the best. Now stop eating all the meat in the middle. \"He's so considerate,\" she thinks. Hah, you got her. You actually hate the meat, and everyone knows the cabbage is the best.

Now you've filled you belly, and it's coffee and conversation time. Remember Nixon's sage advice: \"The only thing worse in dating than being weird and unattractive is being boring\" or something.

Engage in conversation. A unique restaurant is no substitute for a unique personality. Some go-to first date conversation starters:

1. \"Should Iran be allowed to acquire nukes?\" Swirl your coffee salaciously in circles. She's not sure what to do with that question. Mention how Iran is known for its oil (although no new drilling has occurred since the 90s), but that pistachios are actually one of the primary drivers of the Iranian economy and that the sanctions on Iran have been really punishing in tying down the ability of Iranian farmers to export pistachios. You may not realize it, but she's now subconsciously attracted to you. Why? You just brought up explosions, nuts, drilling, punishment, and getting tied down. And the whole time she thought you were just talking about Iran. Keep her in the dark - don't reveal that you're playing Freudian 4D chess with her subconscious. She doesn't seem interested in Iran? That's fine, you've planted the seeds. Move on to oil exploration in other parts of the world. Move on to a conversation about opening up and drilling deep into unexplored tracts of land beneath the permafrost in Alaska. Mention that it may feel wrong to explore virgin tundra, but that drilling for oil in the arctic would cause massive stimulation to the domestic economy. Her eyes glazing over? That's not boredom, it's hypnosis. Good job, you're on your way to winning the first date.

2. Maybe you've already brought up Iran, and you're looking for another topic. How about the classic \"if you were a dictator and could make everyone wear one garment, why would you make everyone wear a cape?\" Dumb question. Capes are incredibly powerful and sexy. No one would ever attack your country, because they'd be worried you were comprised of millions of superheros. Never mind, don't bother asking this question. It's too obvious and shallow.

3. Lull in conversation? Skip right to an instant winner: \"how is your relationship with your father?\" Asking her serious questions about family will show her you mean business.

4. Nearing the end of dinner. She's getting up to go to the bathroom? But why is she taking her purse with her? Maybe she's going to brush up a bit. Makes sense. She wants to look her best for an after-dinner stroll down the famed walkways on Thomas Road. Why is she heading to the door though? That's not where the bathroom is. It's ok, she's probably just stepping outside to take a call. The right move is to step out and follow her. Pay in cash, grab your cape and follow her out the door. She'll appreciate you for considering her safety.

5. She's getting into an uber.

Don't worry, she'll be back. In a week, or a month. She won't know why. She'll just feel urges. She'll be at a Starbucks, and remember the way you slowly swirled your coffee grinds. Against her will, she'll ring you up and ask if you would be willing to go on a second date. Wow.

You take her back to Gojo - you sit down in the corner, take off your top hat, cape and monocle, and order an Ethiopian coffee. This time the date is on you. I only give out advice for one date at a time.

All I know is, order the combo."}
{"text":"Favorite Ethiopian in Phoenix area!  Delicious and fresh, injera close to, if not completely, authentic.  Ambiance feels like you've  walked into a restaurant  in Ethiopia, which I love.  Service is not speedy by US standards,  but culturally speaking, right on time."}
{"text":"Ok Ethiopian food for a pretty damn good price! Service was meh, though. 

I was trying to drive through Phoenix and find my hotel one Thursday afternoon when I stumbled upon this place instead. I figured it has been too long since I've had Ethiopian food so I may as well give Gojo a shot. 

I walked in and an employee invited me to sit anywhere in the restaurant and ensured me that he would take my order shortly. Turns out \"shortly\" really means 10 minutes. I thought the guy forgot about me! It's not like they were busy either. There was only one other customer at the time... 

When the guy finally arrived to take my order, I just pointed to the vegetarian combo page (choose four items for $6.99) and asked him to choose his four favorites. I thought hat was the end of it but he then started to ask me which items I wanted and continued ask me questions until I chose something. That really irked me...

Still, the food was good. I ordered the misir wot, fosolian, ater kik, tikil gomen. Things were a bit on the salty side for me but everything tasted ok. All of that was only $6.99! It would've cost much more back home in the bay area. I couldn't even finish my order. 

All-in-all, I don't mind the food. Wasn't too happy with my service. It's worth a stop if you haven't had Ethiopian food, though!"}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food, and after having this place bookmarked for months, I finally went to check it out.

Being that I'm still not familiar with the Phoenix area, I actually passed up this place coming from the I-51.  Once I doubled back, I saw it sitting in a little strip mall, across the street from the Fry's grocery store, on the SW corner of Thomas and 30th.  It was @ 30 minutes past noon and there was a \"Closed\" sign on the door.  Yelp said they open at noon on Sundays, so I pulled on the door. It was open.  A nice young lady said that they were open.  She apologized and said she simply forgot to turn the sign. (Hence, if you come during scheduled open hours and it says \"Closed,\" double check before driving away.)


If you're not familiar with Ethiopian food, know that even though there are meat dishes, you can always find vegan options.

Appetizers:

VEGGIE SAMBUSSAS - 
Think samosas (if you've had East Indian food), but these are filled with lentils instead of potatoes. Ours came out a tad over-cooked, but they were ok.  It was served with a spicy red sauce, which didn't compliment the sambussas.  I'd like to try them with a sweet & spicy type sauce (similar to tamarind); I might like them better that way. 


Entree:

Their entree menu is divided into to options: Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian.  Everything under \"Vegetarian Dishes\" is vegan. I suggest (especially for first timers) the Veggie Combo, which is a sampling of all the veggie items.  I don't like mushrooms (which is one of the offerings), so our waitress was kind enough to let me get double Misir Wot instead. 

MISIR (aka Misir Wot) - a slightly spicy red lentil dish. (This is my fav!)  Theirs was good and flavorful, but I'll ask for extra spicy next time.

TIKIL GOMEN - cabbage and potatoes. It's supposed to have carrots, but they were missing from my dish.  The cabbage was well prepared and this dish was very good.

FOSOLIAN - green beans, carrots and onions.  This dish is sometimes more tart than I'd prefer, but their tart levels were at a minimum. This dish is decent.

GOMEN - a collard greens dish, which sometimes can also have that tart factor (and I don't know what it is).  I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something was a little off with this dish here.  It was ok, but not the best gomen I've had. 

ATER KIK - Now this is just a personal opinion, but this has to be the grossest thing to ever cross my lips.  It was yellow and pretty much resembled what would happen if I ate another bite. My insides are churning just thinking about it.  Don't know what it was because my DD enjoyed it, but not I. Ew.  Next. 


Now this dish was supposed to come with 8 samplings, but I only got 7 (which included my double order of Misir Wot), so I don't know if the remaining item was DEFIN MISIR or MITTEN SHIRO. It was greenish in color, so maybe it was the pea dish (Mitten Shiro)?  Not sure, but I wasn't a fan of its taste.


INJERA BREAD - I'm singling out their injera because it's good and doesn't have that weird (tart) after-taste that the injera at some other restaurants have.  


There are no vegan desserts.


Non-veggie in my party: 
DD got the DORO WOT (chicken in a red berbere sauce), which came with 2 sides.  Her peeps on her paternal side serve this dish with a hard boiled egg, which she didn't get with her meal, and she immediately went on a Easter-like hunt for it.  Come to find out, you must ask for it if you want it.


Service was good, the waitress was delightfully friendly and helpful.  Prices were very reasonable.  The food was plenty; I couldn't even eat 1/2 of it.  I'd certainly return for more Misir Wot and Tikil Gomen."}
{"text":"My review of this restaurant may not be wholly accurate of the general experience one night have at Gojo as I went with a large group and we had our own buffet that we each paid 20$ for. Regardless, I got to try many different dishes (I'm sure I wouldn't have had the variety with a smaller group), and they all were so good! We had a chicken dish, a lamb dish, yellow lentils, Brown lentils, potatoes, spicy greens, etc etc... Not a single bite was bad! The injera bread was perfect for eating all the different dishes. I would love to return to experience Gojo as a small group and plan to in the near future!"}
{"text":"Instructions: walkin, order the combo, wait for the food to arrive, enjoy.

That's it.  This place has no ambiance, and the area is a little scary, but the food is great.  I love Ethiopian, and have made it a staple in my own kitchen, but the truth of the matter is that it just takes too long to make to enjoy for a simple meal.  

That is exactly why places like this exist.  Its much more simple and cost effective to go here and enjoy authentic Ethiopian, with consistently delicious food without having to scour spice stores trying to make bebere.  

So in the end, try making this at home once to really learn to appreciate the levels of spice and care that go into making something this good."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but not best, when comparing to other Ethiopian places.  I am not a fan of the atmosphere but I could not say that it was unpleasant in any way."}
{"text":"Best Ethiopian food I've ever eaten!  After we were stuffed, I looked at my friend and said, \"so, dinner here tomorrow?\"
It's very telling that she took me seriously and if she hadn't had other commitments, the answer would have been YES.
Based on the recommendations of others, we got the Vegetarian and Meat Combo.
So much food!  It was all absolutely, unequivocally, delicious.
The Ethiopian Iced Tea is lovely too.

A word of warning, the service is not Americanized.  They serve you, and then leave you alone for the most part.  You can have anything you want, you just need to ask.  Also, most countries don't drink the gallons of beverages that we Americans do, so don't expect refills of anything without needing to ask.  It's a cultural thing.

The big bummer is that I'm pretty sure unless we Yelpers spread the word, it's not going to survive.  The interior is still the old Bacchanal restaurant, so that's going to turn people off, and their prices are crazy cheap., so they're not going to make enough money.

We need to pack this place with people.  The food is too good to lose."}
{"text":"Pretty good Ethiopian food. I felt Blue Nile cafe was better when they were open. Gojo's prices are very reasonable for the size of dish you get. The injara here is excellent. I have only gotten their food to carry out, so I cannot comment on the service."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time after reading the reviews Saturday night.. 

Upon first impression - the air outside smelt AMAZING (which enticed me even more to go in), it was a quaint little place but rather clean and we were greeted right away by the nicest young lady that works there. She let us seat ourselves and grabbed our drink orders. If you like New Castle, I recommend trying the Ethiopian Amber Beer that they have. It was pretty tasty!

We shared the Vegetable Combo plate (which is a taste of everything made out of veggies), it was very good, super flavorful and tons of food! Definitely easily shared between 2 or 3 people! The cabbage and potatoes, mushrooms and red lentils were probably my favorite.

Towards the end, it started getting busy, so we had to wait several minutes for our check, but everything else made it a pleasant experience. Really no complaints about this place.. There was only the one girl working the tables, so the wait was totally legitimate."}
{"text":"I have no clue what I ate.  This was my first time eating Ethiopian food, and it was such a cool experience.  If you've never eaten Ethiopian food before, I definitely recommend checking out Gojo for a totally unique ethnic experience.  My group of three deferred entirely to the waitress, who brought us what appeared to be six or seven different curried vegetables (the yellow curried cabbage was my favorite!) served on a huge sheet of sour bread, with more sour bread on the side.  Someone more knowledgable than me is probably going to read this review and laugh at my attempts at describing this food, but having never tried anything like it before, I can't exactly find the words to describe what I ate.  I did recognize a large hunk of chicken in the center of the sour bread which we tore into with our hands, using chunks of the sour bread to ladle up scoops of lentils and spices.  We washed it all down with some iced cinnamon tea.

I think this place would be great for a date night... you really test your date's sense of adventure.  5 stars from me!  Can't wait to bring guests here."}
{"text":"Strange, Perhaps Unusual Experience...

I read the reviews on Gojo, and they were what motivated me to try it. I like Ethiopian food, and had just eaten at a different Ethiopian place the day before and was hungry for more. I arrived not long after they opened on a Saturday, and was the first customer. I was greeted immediately, allowed to select a table, and provided with a menu. I was already prepared for the lack of ambience, so it didn't bother me.

As I was considering the menu, a small boy (almost 4) came to my table, said hello to me, and began pointing to and saying various letters of the alphabet that were on my menu. At that point it was cute, but thankfully my server returned to take my order and sent him away. I ordered Ethiopian Coffee, and the Gojo Combo.

After a relatively short wait, my coffee was brought to me, and shortly after that, my food. I loved the coffee.

Unfortunately, just as I began to eat, a smell similar to lighting charcoal with lighter fluid made its way into my nostrils and completely obliterated the aroma of my food and completely spoiled my experience. 

I had to stop eating because the food was tasting like whatever that smell was. It turns out that someone had just completed the process of lighting up some sort of incense, which took a couple of minutes. They then began carrying the lit incense in a metal container around the restaurant, so I knew it was a smell that was not going to go away. It was also not a pleasant smell. I use incense at home, and this was nothing like anything I've ever smelled.

I overheard two other diners who had arrived after me comment on the smell as well. I asked for a to go container, which took a while to be brought. While I was waiting, the four year old boy came back again and started telling me repeatedly to finish my food. I told him I was taking it with me. He then picked up my pot of coffee that I was planning to drink, and the server had to come over and make him put it back down. I'm guessing he was the son of the owner or the chef, but he was reluctant to go away as the server asked him to do. 

I really didn't like that this child was putting his hands on, and reaching over my meal. I raised a daughter and know that you never know where children's hands have been. I quickly transferred my food to the take out container when it was brought along with my tab. When the child left my table, he went to the table of the other two diners, and wouldn't leave when the server initially asked him to. There was more with the child, but I've said enough. 

I barely ate any of the food, and what I ate was tainted by the impact of the incense on my taste buds. I remember seeing at least one review that commented about the incense, and now I understand. I will say that some of the dishes were very heavy on oil. I'm tempted to give a lower rating, but to be fair, you may not experience any of the things that I did. Gojo was a long drive for me, and I didn't really enjoy it so I'll be dining elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Ethiopian food, so I was really excited to try Gojo. The location is easy to find and there's plenty of parking. Restaurant is large, with plenty of seating. It's old, and the decor isn't wonderful, but it's clean and the servers really, really care about giving you a good experience.

We shared the big combo plate: all the veggies, plus 3 meats with injera. Food came out quickly, and was very good. The portion was really large and one combo plate could have easily fed 3 people. I'm not sure if everything was fresh, and it isn't the best Ethiopian I've had, but it was very nice.

If you're new to this kind of cuisine, I suggest trying the doro wott, misir wot, gomen wot, and alitcha wot.

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My first time trying Ethiopian. I was extremely nervous (I'm a picky eater) and was pleasantly surprised. Delicious! I got the meat and veggie combo and shared it with my friend. Price was great! The only complaint was that we went for dinner and with no other customers in the restaurant yet, it still took 15 minutes to be greeted. But we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Vegetarian combo which includes a sample of each of the veg dishes. All were delicious. The injera was perfect."}
{"text":"Delish & authentic! The serving was generous (meat combo fed 2). The injera was good (not too thick/doughy). Spicy and yummy. I would like to return and experience their coffee ceremony."}
{"text":"We loved  it and will be going back.  Did not really know what to have so we went with the sampler plater.  We loved everything we had.  The service was great and the girl serving us was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when I went in here, although I'd done my homework. I decided to get the combination. It is quite a bit of food for a relatively cheap price. It's mainly used by the locals during the day who order their food and come in to pick it up. For others, this seems to be a local social gathering space, and it doesn't seem to be an uncommon event to see many of them sitting around drinking beer and warmly greeting those who would choose to order in their food instead. The service could probably use some work, but they make up for it in the tastiness of their food as well as the amount of sampling the combination meal, for example, would provide. I would recommend coming here if you're in the mood for Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Definitely a good cheap eat! The food is good, however, I found some of the dishes not as flavorful as at other Ethiopian restaurants. It is true though, as another reviewer mentioned, I didn't feel as heavy and bloated afterward either (sorry, just keeping it real)  Also, a couple of the food portions weren't too warm, not even room temp, which was kind of a turn off. 

Our waitress was nice, but we could barely understand one another! She barely spoke English, like not even two words! Kind of frustrating when you have questions about the menu. We actually didn't get what we ordered either, but it was too frustrating to try and explain and have them change it to what we actually wanted. 

All and all, not a terrible place to visit, definitely great on the wallet, but I think I'm going to have to stick with my regular Ethiopian spot in Tempe :)"}
