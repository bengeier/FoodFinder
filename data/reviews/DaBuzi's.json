{"text":"Yippee - a great Meatball SW shop in the South Hills!  We had delivery. We tried the \"Traditional\" and the \"Teriyaki\" for our first try and they were both excellent. These both used 100% real beef with great beefy goodness - nice thick tomatoe sauce & cheese  on the traditional and a teriyaki glaze with peppers & onions on the othe The soft rolls were perfect.. My only complaint is I wanted MORE sauce, so I will definitely ask for extra next time."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We love grabbing a pie from here as well as the meatballs.  Always great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great pizza stromboli and wings. Stromboli is made with beautiful dough and crust naked perfectly.  Service is friendly Family run business that puts their heart into food"}
{"text":"Great place and great food.   I love alfredo and they have so many things with it and they are all so incredibly good. Loaded Fries with bacon alfredo, chicken alfredo Stromboli, and chicken meatball alfredo hoagies, and of course chicken penne alfredo. ummmmm. I haven't tried anything else personally but I have been told their other stuff is good too from people I have gone with.  Their prices are pretty reasonable to fair compared to other places too.  While they have a lot of space to eat in inside they really have ZERO parking. Two spots in front on the street. Delivery or pick up is best unless you are already parked someplace else and don't mind walking over. I usually do that myself. But I'm not holding this against them in this review."}
{"text":"Love DaBuzi's! They have awesome pizza, an even better staff and an extremely impressive delivery time. We've never waited longer than 30 minutes for pizza or hoagies to be delivered. We've eaten at DaBuzi's once and we had the place to ourselves so of course we took advantage of the 25 cent pinball machine."}
{"text":"DaBuzis has the best pizza and wings around. The amount of street parking isn't great but the food won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"The pizza exceeded our expectations. Good crust, fresh ingredients, not greasy. The service was fine. This is probably best as a takeout place though. The basement space was cold and dirty. It was empty when we were there. I would have thought it was really just used as a takeout place if not for all the food on the floor from the prior day. The space is used for storage and the TV was blaring. I'd give it four stars for the food but have to rate it down given how unpleasant it was to actually eat there."}
