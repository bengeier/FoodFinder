{"text":"Just missed the lunch crowd at 1pm. Limited seating but service was very fast. Sushi is really good. Good came out very fast as well. Ordered, sat at nice table by window & my food (3 rolls) came out within 8-10 minutes. I had a rainbow roll, spicy tuna & spicy salmon roll. All we're very good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Sashimi and Nigiri are my jam so this place is perfect for me! I can usually get lunch for $8-$12 and its quality fish. I LOVE the gyoza, too. ANd the western type sushi is good, too. Who doesn't love a Philly Roll every once in a while? The spicy tuna is also not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and I had a bad experience once but gave it another shot today and ordered the \"fantastic roll\" lunch special - and all it had was crab stick, avocado and some kind of minced crab? on top - this was not how it was advertised - was supposed to have more fish.  And just a ton of rice again like the last time - it used to be so reliably good -not sure what happened.  Not sure I can go back anymore which is a shame since the people there are all nice, service is good and they are quick and it is very convenient."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant upon a recommendation from a co-worker, and was certainly not disappointed. I did not call ahead to place a takeout order however did not wait longer than 5 minutes for my sushi to be made. I had a tuna and a salmon roll.  Both rolls held EXTREMELY generous portions of fish, which I didn't expect due to their rather low prices. The quality of the fish was excellent, the tuna was especially lean.   The service was professional and courteous. I'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"When I first started getting lunch here I was really impressed with quality and preparation- however, lately there seems to be less and less sushi in my sushi, which is a problem obviously. I'm not paying good $$$ for rice and cucumber- if I can't barely tell that there's tuna/salmon/crab etc in my roll what's the point!  If this keeps up I will likely start going elsewhere- there are already too many \"cheap\" sushi places downtown. I'm disappointed that it looks like this place may be heading in the same direction."}
{"text":"So delicious and reasonably priced! The service is consistently good. I only wish it was open on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I work right in town and I order lunch here maybe 2-3 times a week. I am in love with this place! Their sushi is so fresh and so delicious. I can honestly say this is the best sushi I have ever had. I have been do many sushi places and this one beats them all! Their Bahama Mama is my favorite, nice tasty lobster on top of their shrimp tempura roll. ahh so good! consumer service is also amazing! wish they were open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"I returned to Pittsburgh and was in the mood for some downtown sushi. Decided to give No. 1 Sushi another shot and was very satisfied.   The lady remembered me, and offered me my meal on the house to make up for the last time.  Overall very happy with the food and service and my faith in them is restored."}
{"text":"Get one of the daily lunch specials! Fast, affordable, flavorful, HEALTHY. The only place in town which won't leave you with a 3pm pit in your stomach.  The ginger dressing salad is fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is great!   It's super close to work, fast, tasty and doesn't require me to take out a personal loan! I stopped by on a Saturday, so I will say I was the only one in there, but regardless they were very friendly and fast. Got the #2 special: spicy tuna roll, cali roll and miso soup for $11.  They also have little containers of seaweed salad, crab salad and other stuff to go, which is nice! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Come here pretty often before class. Great little place with friendly owners. I know I'll always be welcomed when I walk through the door. Also one of the best rainbow rolls in town."}
{"text":"No. 1 Sushi is consistent, fresh and delicious.  I recently moved here from NYC and have tried a majority of the restaurants in the area.  As far as good Sushi Restaurants.   No. 1 Sushi and Penn Avenue are superb.   The owners of No. 1 Sushi are wonderful people.  They are courteous,  professional and very grateful to their customers.     I highly recommend you make it a point to stop at No. 1 Sushi!"}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing! We came into the restaurant right before closing, not knowing and stayed for 45 minutes and staff was so kind! Great price too!"}
{"text":"They are extremely fast and if you speak to the chef and ask him what best suits your tastes he'll direct you to something awesome on the menu. Trust them, they're glad to help. Lunch is busy but very fast and you can order to go to shorten the wait. Great portions and awesome choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Tiny establishment off Market Square--you would miss it if you weren't looking for it. Sushi is fresh! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had eaten at a sushi place in the same location maybe a year or so ago (sinobi, i think?), and was less than impressed. So even though the name had changed a couple times, I was rather hesitant...  I shouldn't have been. I got the #3 special, which was a (spicy) tuna roll and (spicy) salmon roll with choice of soup or salad (i got salad) and it was excellent!! Plus only cost 12.95...  It was a very good spice level without compromising flavor, the fish tasted fresh and was good quality, and the portion was great (plenty of food). Not to mention the extremely personable staff.  I didn't try any of their more complex maki rolls, but saw some pass me after ordering and wondered if I should have... they looked great!  I normally don't post reviews, just glean the wisdom of others, but I truly felt the need to compliment this place after my visit."}
{"text":"The staff here is so incredibly friendly, making everyone's wait more pleasant inside the tiny restaurant just off market square.They have all the standard options plus delicious (and filling) lunch specials. I wouldn't recommend here for a sit down sushi dinner, but to grab and go for lunch, it's perfect. And as of a few weeks ago, they added seaweed salad as a lunch special side option! Yay! Fresh ingredients, handmade right in front of you. Convenient, speedy, quality, reasonably priced and very welcoming. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great food, employees are all very friendly, small seating area inside, but they are happy to make anything to go. I eat here weekly and have always been happy with my food. They run great daily specials too!"}
{"text":"Very very poorly done. Sushi for the unwashed masses at best. You'd do better at the local grocery store."}
{"text":"Cheap and very quick sushi fix, but don't expect high quality.  More suited to take out but there are a few tables. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Almost walked by it but decided to stop in.  Was very impressed.  The miso was perfect and the rolls were fresh and very good.  I would definitely be here once a week if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite sushi joints in Pittsburgh. Great prices, amazing portions and lovely employees.   Location is a tad small but seating in Market Square is often plentiful. I typically purchase salmon or tuna rolls but recently returned and had their Playboll lunch special which was roughly $15 which included a 8 piece roll, miso soup (other options were available) and I purchased a water as well.   Quality is always top notch. Definitely a great place for fast sushi, possibly for a lunch break."}
{"text":"After coming here a few more times, I felt I had to update my review. This is a good place to get your sushi fix, since there aren't many sushi options in town. While it isn't the best sushi I've had, it's pretty decent. Taste-wise, not bad, but presentation-wise, these sushi chefs are hella sloppy. Maybe it's to meet the demands of the lunch rush?   No. 1 Sushi is not going to be anything you haven't tried before (unless you've never had sushi). Prices are reasonable and it's a nice place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet, because that's what my visits here usually are.  I've had the crab roll, the spicy shrimp roll, and the gyoza so far, and each one far outshines the usual Asian fare I find around town. The atmosphere is cozy, and the price point is great for a quick bite. The staff is very friendly too. Great place for lunch downtown."}
{"text":"Clean, calm and relaxing  place,  the chef was friendly and smily when we came in. The sushi was really good and fresh!! A perf spot in Downtown Pittsburgh,"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing!  We ordered many varieties to try try and the did not disappoint on any!  There isn't a lot of seating inside, but it is quaint for a small group. The Bahama Mamma was suggested to us by another patron and they were spot on on the tastiness. The Ichiban was amazing in flavor. The sushi is fresh and melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"For quick lunch time sushi that is ample and affordable, go to #1 sushi. There are better options, but this fits the convenience and quality crossroads."}
{"text":"Everyone's reviews are pretty spot-on and in general, this is a good place, with a friendly feel, and tasty sushi. But there are two things stopping me from giving this restaurant a better rating than \"A-OK.\"  1) There are usually around 4 sushi chefs behind the counter, quickly putting together orders. I don't know which one it is, but one of them uses WAY TOO MUCH rice for the rolls! This makes it difficult to eat the role in one bite because it's so bulky. I usually have to knock half of it off, and then my roll falls apart, and then, well, screw trying to dip it in soy sauce. They need to give more training to their chefs! 2) Why...WHY are the lunch specials ONLY rolls? Why is there never anything else as a special? Like a little combo box: a few of pieces of nigiri, a roll, miso soup and small salad.  For the two reasons above, I only go here when I'm limited on time because it's only a 5 minute walk from my work. Otherwise, you will see me at \"Sushi and Rolls\" in Oxford Centre!"}
{"text":"For the price you can't beat this place.  Very reasonably priced for sushi and it's good quality. Now I've certainly have had better quality sushi at some expensive restaurants but as I said, for the price you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"About five bucks for decent sushi roll . Nice staff . Made to order . Great lunch spot"}
{"text":"If you need a sushi fix, this is a pretty good place to indulge in that craving. I ordered some lunch to-go relatively recently, opting to eat my meal back in my office. Given that there aren't many tables and the counter you can sit at is relatively small, I doubt that I personally would plan on eating in No. 1 Sushi Sushi itself - at least not during the lunch rush.   That said, my order was so good I would definitely consider carrying another meal out at some point! The quality of the food - gyoza and a surprisingly fresh rainbow roll - was better than I expected and left me more than satisfied. Reading about other specials available here makes me want to come back for more fresh fish, too. I went with what my gut wanted during my last visit, but this girl could definitely change her mind and order if the price of the daily special was right!  My only criticism would be that the sushi did not maintain its shape (i.e. the roll began crumbling) as I ate it. I use the word criticism loosely here because I have no problem eating sushi with my hands, so I was able to keep my rolls from falling apart too much. Still, if someone were more of a hands-off eater, they might be disappointed that their sushi rolls didn't stay in one piece when picked up by chopsticks.  Still, the overall quality of my meal left me impressed and happy. I will definitely keep No. 1 Sushi Sushi in mind during future trips downtown - with reasonable prices and tasty options available here, I'm more than willing to walk down to Market St. for a sushi lunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at an excellent price. We each had the salmon/tuna/california roll combo (comes with soup). I also got a seaweed salad and he got a drink. Under $34 including tax. Awesome!  This is a spot to come for good food without flair. Take-out or some high tables with stools to sit with one or two people. Great location off of Market Square.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just found my 'Once a Week' addiction...  this sushi is so fresh & delicious- my mouth keeps chewing but my brain isn't letting me swallow...!  This is the best I've had in Pittsburgh and judging by the size of the crowds in there everyday at lunch- I'm not the only one to think this..."}
{"text":"Really fresh sashimi and veggies coupled with friendly service.  Only major complaint is that everything is served in styrofoam to-go containers. It would be great if they switched to ceramic for in-restaurant use or at least used something recyclable."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Very small restaurant only 11 seats in the whole place. Not a fan of their miso soup."}
{"text":"The sushi sashimi and roll here are really fresh and delicious. And the owners are nice Japanese couples."}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna roll is the best in the city and spicy salmon is pretty good too. You will not be disappointed with the quality of No. 1.   I usually end up here at least twice a week and will probably get mercury poisoning at some point, but I just can't stop.   Also, the price is way better than other places."}
{"text":"Really good Sushi and the service is friendly and quick.  I got one of the specials, which was 2 Sushi Rolls and a salad and I was quite pleased.  The shop is rather small, but works well for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place, the quality of fish is very good for the price and you get quite a few pieces. Everything in nicely presented and if you are ordering takeout the chef carefully places everything in the Styrofoam container. There is hardly any seating but if the weather is warm you can just walk to Market Square and use one of the public dining tables.  I've tried a couple of different rolls but usually come back to the spicy tuna and often get their specials (which change often, sometimes even in the middle of the day). I love the sauce they drizzle on the spicy tuna and the rice-to-fish ratio is perfect too. Lastly, the owners are very kind and seem to genuinely appreciate your business.   Bonus: they are open until 8 pm."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have really good, quality, fresh sushi that is affordable. Literally bang for your buck. On a daily basis, they have lunch specials that are awesome, simply because you get a variety of rolls. It changes on a day to day basis, which is also great so that you can try different ones when you come. Furthermore, the prices are super reasonable. I've tried multiple rolls from this place, spicy tuna, california rolls, and eel rolls in the past and every single time, it's been great! I highly recommend this place if you're craving sushi for lunch out of the office or even if you're just a visitor in town! I know that I will definitely be going back sometime soon. Another bonus: the owners are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. Ever.  I've come here a few times and each time I leave ridiculously satisfied. Super friendly staff as well!!!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some sushi downtown and this spot didn't disappoint. I was led here by the good reviews. Nothing fancy and the seating isn't very comfortable but the sushi is on point. They also have a couple salads you can get as well like seaweed and octopus. we had the spicy California and spicy tuna rolls. Great prices and everything tastes great. Impressed by the quick service! I was in and out of there in less than ten minutes."}
{"text":"I am all about good, cheap sushi and this place completely fits the bill.  Not to say that you can't get pricier sushi here cause they do have a very full and diverse menu, but if sushi specials are your thing, this is the only place downtown that will fulfill your hunger.   My husband and I went in on a Wednesday at 11:30.  There were two people ahead of me in line and they quickly took our order and gave us the seaweed salads that came with our special.  They waited until we finished the delectable little salads before they brought over our sushi - which I wasn't expecting.  A lot of nice restaurants don't even give you time to finish your appetizer before they bring out the main course.  The sushi was beautifully presented in an albeit sad styrofoam container.  We both got the spicy salmon and the shrimp tempura special.  The salmon was sliced, not pureed which was lovely and fresh.  The shrimp tempura wasn't too hot which was good in the container.  It came with soy sauce, pickled ginger and a tiny spot of wasabi.  There was also a tiny mint in the container.   Surprisingly good quality fish in the heart of market square!"}
{"text":"My sushi was not able to be eaten with chopsticks! I ended up eating them with my hands on a side walk because it was falling apart so badly. It was my first time going and I don't think that I'd try it again. They also do not have Vegas rolls, they charged me for the few orange eggs on top, I forgot the place I normally go to has cream cheese in theirs.  The flavor was ok, but again, likely not going back due to the poor construction of it."}
{"text":"Best kept secret for some fresh made Sushi. Today I tried the Spicy Salmon Roll which was very good. My other favorites are the Yammy Yammy Roll, the Spicy Wonderful Roll and my favorite, The Jalapeño (Spicy crab, cream cheese, cucumber topped with Jalapeño and a Spicy Mayo.  For the price you can't beat it."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall sushi place in the middle of town and I didn't really know what to expect. But stopped here for lunch last week and ordered 8 pieces of sushi, a baby octopus salad, and a drink for $33. That's a ton to pay for lunch, but given the order it's about $3/piece of sushi, which is quite in the ballpark for most decent places.   I was surprised at how decent. The fish was fresh and at a nice temperature, and the rice was well cooked and seasoned. So it's not the most cheapo sushi place around (and...do you really want to go to that place considering it's raw fish we're talking about?) but Sushi Sushi is the real deal for what it is."}
{"text":"A lot of sushi for a reasonable price fro lunch. They have 3 lunch specials which comes with either a salade, soup, or seaweed salade. Then two kinds of sushi rolls. It does not sound like a lot but there are really a lot of rolls. You can really tell when they had you the takeout container, it is heavy!  The sushi was good but not the best ever, you can't expect that at this price but for what it was, it was good and I would go back if I worked Downtown."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! At first I was like no way will I eat sushi from a to go restaurant, but I'm glad I did. Everything on the menu is amazing! Everything is fresh! Everything is great. This is now my go to sushi spot. I just wished they delivered, we're open on the weekends, and could be place in my kitchen. This place is clean, friendly, and customer oriented. It is also very reasonable. Don't forget the are very reasonable and every combo come with either a spring roll, egg roll, provider not match"}
{"text":"This is really a gem in market square and my go-to place for sushi. The owners are great and the sushi is pretty good and consistent."}
{"text":"Been coming here for lunch for over a year and always an excellent experience.  Mostly pick up and some eat in.  Warning there is limited seating.  Usually get a tuna and a salmon roll with seaweed salad and an aloe drink.  Sushi is always fresh and generous portions. A few times roll construction wasn't perfect, but usually excellent. So good!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. I just found it and I love it. They give you huge portions of sushi and they have daily specials so it's not too expensive. I got a whole roll and a green salad for $13.95 can't beat that. Everything is super fresh and it doesn't take a long time for them to make your food. I will get mine to go if it's too busy and they never have taken longer than a few minutes even when it was steady with people coming in and out. I would definitely try this place."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and seating is very limited - I would only recommend this for take-out, never dine-in. Extremely fast service and very good sushi. If you are looking for a nice dine-in sushi experience with fancy presentation, you are not getting that here. Just great sushi on the go."}
{"text":"This place was awful. I had a salmon roll and a tuna roll, which are pretty hard to mess up-and yet they did. The texture of the fish was horrible. You can tell that this restaurant's chef has not been taught to cut fish properly. I also got a single piece of red snapper. I had to chew on this stringy piece of fish for several minutes. I can't believe people eat this. I also found a bone in my salmon. They truly don't care about their work at all."}
{"text":"I stopped by on Thurs. prior to seeing a musical at the Benedum for a quick and inexpensive dinner.  Upon initially passing by, I wasn't sure if they were open, since the \"Open\" sign was unlit and nobody was inside.  Having ensured that they're open until 8pm, I decided to take a chance, and walked in.  I was quickly greeted by a gentleman seated behind the counter.  Upon saying I hadn't been there before and asking him for a recommendation, he asked me what kind of fish I liked.  I told him I enjoyed salmon and tuna, and he pointed out the daily specials, one of which was a spicy salmon roll and California roll, and another of which was a spicy salmon roll and California roll, both of which came with a side of miso soup or a salad.  I decided to go with the first combo ($10.99 before tax), with the soup.  The soup, was served first, was on the salty side and wasn't super flavorful, but it was served nice and warm, and made for a nice starter on a cold and rainy evening.  The rolls were brought out about 10 min. after ordering, and I was pleasantly surprised that 10 of each type came with an order.  Of the two types of rolls, I'm definitely more a fan of the spicy salmon than the California.  The spicy sauces drizzled on the salmon rolls added a dose of zest, and the salmon itself added some nice color and flavor.  I found the California rolls rather bland--but then again, I'm not a big fan of California rolls in general due to their blandness.  I know many people like them, but I'm just not a fan, so it would have been nice if one of the specials came with something other than California rolls.  As it were, I was quite pleased with the amount of food I received for the price--for me, it was more than enough for dinner, let alone lunch.  As others have noted, this place does more of a take out business than eat in, but there is a counter as well as a few tables if you wish to eat in.  The man and woman who waited on me, who I'm guessing were the owners, were very friendly, asking me how everything was and even bidding me goodbye when I went to leave.  While I'd rate the food a solid 4, the value and great service push my rating up to a 4.5, making this one of the better sushi joints I've been to in PGH."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on my way to the farmer's market in Market Square.  I love sushi and was excited to discover an option within walking distance from my North Shore office location.  They have daily lunch specials that range from $7-$10 and include soup or salad and sushi options.  There is also a decently large menu featuring the traditional rolls and pieces and also many specialty rolls.  There was quite a line when I ordered, but they hustle and really get orders out to you quickly.  Everything was very fresh and tasty.  There was just the right amount of sauces and the flavors on my roll complimented each other perfectly.  There is seating inside, but there were so many people waiting for food (at least during the lunch rush) that you are probably better off getting your food to go rather than enduring the crowds.  A great experience with extremely tasty and fresh food.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Seaweed salad was rotten. We took it back and they said that's how it was supposed to taste.  The sushi was not good ...basically big rice balls.  Really let down by the high Yelp ratings that brought us here.   Miso soup was good."}
{"text":"Good luck getting a table in this small sushi joint, but definitely worth trying. The staff was very friendly , even when I mistakenly got their near the end of the day. They gave me the sushi in a to go container saying if one of the tables opens up by the time it was ready, please feel welcome to stay. My complaint about this place is hard for me to actually complain about because it's not actually a bad thing. My only complaint is that they fit too much fish in the rolls and it did not stay together very well. This really only hurt the look and presentation. The flavours were good and it was very filling. I will be back."}
{"text":"I got a salad and a roll with salmon, avocado, cream cheese, and jalapeno. The salad was really good so I figured it was a promising start. But the jalapenos on my roll were pickled! No no no no. Why?  I couldn't eat it. They covered it in different sauces and put barely any fish in there and then once you threw in the pickled jalapenos, I just couldn't stomach it. They seemed nice enough there. Maybe other rolls are better. I just prefer good fish with fresh veggies and not all the sauce and preserved junk."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi place in Downtown.The Sushi is delicious and the people are the best ..Friendly clean and always delicious.Have recommended to several people."}
{"text":"Really good quick sushi in market square! We ordered on the phone to-go and then went to the point and ate along the water.  Their daily specials include 2 rolls and a soup or salad ($10-$13). The salad was delicious and fresh and the dressing wasn't very mayo-heavy which I enjoyed. The rolls were tasty and filling. Definitely not the best sushi you can find, but good nonetheless. I'd recommend to a friend!   Parking can be a bit tough, so you might have to loop around the block a few times."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The sushi is amazing and the staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week - it is absolutely delicious! The staff work so hard and are so pleasant. If you are looking for a quick and good lunch, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice this week and loved it both times!  First time I ate there I got the Volcano Roll which is my go-to anytime I get sushi, so of course I loved it.  This time around I got the Philadelphia Roll and the Spicy Wonderful Roll, which were both really good.  Really convenient location but super easy to walk right by without even knowing you passed it!  There is a sign out front and they have a board with specials set up on the sidewalk, but the actual restaurant is super tiny, which really doesn't matter, but I can imagine that it gets a little cramped in there during busy times.  Either way, the food is really good and the people who work there are really friendly.  You can eat in or take out and they allow you to call ahead with a take out order which is convenient.  I wouldn't say this place is the absolute BEST sushi I've ever had, but it's definitely a great little local spot that's worth stopping in to if you're craving sushi!"}
{"text":"Simple sushi, nice staff and food was good.  Fair prices, check your pretentious thoughts at the door and enjoy."}
{"text":"Let me say this is more like a 4.5, I just couldn't do a full 5 stars. This place is the sushi that downtown needed!   I came in 30 minutes before they closed on Christmas Eve Eve (yes I know this review is late) and wanted to get a bunch of rolls for my boyfriend and I. I felt so bad being that person to crush them right before close but they were wonderful. I obviously ordered way wayyy too much sushi I just can never decide in sushi places and get way more than I need but I'm so glad I did.   I honestly don't remember all the rolls I ordered but I think it was 5 in total and they put it on a great platter for me to take. The sushi is very very good and fresh, not the absolute best I ever had which is the only reason I couldn't do 5 stars.   Super friendly staff and very clean place. Absolutely will go often!"}
{"text":"Location/Hours: On Market Street leading into Market Square, across from The Market and in between Diamond Market and Prantls. Mon-Fri 11a-8p. No Weekends : (  Staff: Warm, receptive and will remember your and your order if you become a regular. They will ask your name for the order and no matter how busy, they work hard but keep composure with the cashier always easy to talk to.  Sushi: It's my objective to try every roll that they have but that will be a while. They have many selections and roll sizes. They have party options and catering available. Their rolls are served rice on outside but let them know and they can change that. Wasabi/Ginger/Soy sauce will always be in your to-go order so don't shake your container around unless you enjoy ginger all over your sushi. They have miso, seaweed salad and other menu options as well.  Drinks: The options are awesome. They have cans/bottles of soda, Snapple, Red Bull of all sizes and fair priced, teas and traditional Asian drinks.   Overall: Great sushi downtown, can become a tight space during lunch hour so I suggest going outside of 11a-1:30p. Yami Yami roll is a good start for those who haven't experienced raw fish sushi. The menu is a bit hard to read and on the wall. Grab a paper menu and sit down before ordering, there will always be a daily special on the chalk board. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious sushi! They opened 4 months ago and they have been serving downtown sushi lovers. I ordered the pink lady (tuna cucumber avocado and spicy tuna on top of soy wrap) and it was amazing. The tuna avocado and Alaskan  were good too. I will be going back."}
{"text":"If this place had a frequent buyer punch card, I'd probably run them out of business. Their lunch specials cannot be beat! Everyday, they offer 3-4 different rolls and each come with miso soup or salad, ranging from $9-$12. The quality of the fish is excellent. It's fresh, flavorful and they never use tempura as a filler. The lunch rolls typically = 12 pieces of sushi. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but the size of their rolls, plus the soup or salad is always plenty of food. Sometimes, I am able to make two meals out of a lunch special!   The restaurant itself is very small. They have a few tables inside but I recommend ordering takeout if you're heading over between 11-2. Their lunch rush is busy so sitting at a table means you'll probably have a mass of people standing around waiting for their orders, leaving little room for personal space.   Along with their sushi, they offer seaweed salad, octopus salad & house salad with ginger dressing. I've never had a bad meal!   The staff is friendly, fast and professional. My only complaint is that they do not have an active website or social media account (other than yelp) to advertise their daily specials. You either have to stop down in person or call."}
{"text":"Had the salmon roll, tuna roll and avocado/crab roll. Decent serving size and price. The fish was fresh. How they cooked the rice though, could use a lot of improvement. It was stiff and dry. Japanese rice is supposed to be sticky, soft, and fluffy.  Not the best I've tasted, not the worst either."}
{"text":"I agree with the normalized 4-star review. Ingredients are average, wait time to receive rolls is superior! Only thing I would note is that the sushi rice could use a bit more vinegar. Will be back. Impressed and prices were very affordable."}
{"text":"Sushi was well prepared. Lots of different sushi options, thankfully none that were deep fried.  Small establishment, not suitable for dining in. Especially if you are with a group of people.   Good prices and quiet and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was originally extremely nervous about a sushi place in downtown Pittsburgh. I just started eating sushi actually, so that coupled with the worry about getting sick from it, made me nervous!  From the start of my stopping in on the recommendation of a work colleague however, I was impressed! The location is extremely clean, and the salmon don I ordered was delicious! I will return again and again whenever I get that sushi craving!  Downgraded by one star due to really having my heart set on sushi today before a pick up night shift at work, arriving to find that they're closed on Saturday. The to go menu they provided me last time I was here (the very first time I was here) shows they're open Saturdays 12-8pm."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi place in Market Square. Service was very fast and friendly.nGreat for lunch. Limited seating so take out it a great idea but if you come early around 1130-1145am you can just beat the lunch rush and get a seat. Daily specials available and excellent prices.   The sushi was great and miso soup flavorful.   I would definitely come back here.   If you work downtown and like sushi, check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent fast inexpensive sushi place.  Nice staff and owner.  The ginger dressing for the salad is home made.  Very clean and well run place. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here the last 2 days for lunch. Excellent quality flavor and presentation. Only downside is the size of the location, but I guess that keeps the price down. During lunch rush it can get pretty busy but with only 2 men preparing the sushi I have been in and out within 10 minutes both times. Sushi was excellent and the miso soup was really good as well.   Only place to go in town for quality sushi!"}
{"text":"Mom and pop shops occupy a special place in my heart, because they're really what sustains the restaurant industry, and really, the American dream, proving repeatedly that anyone, with enough passion and skill, can leave their mark on this world.  Enter No. 1 Sushi, a tiny little shop just outside of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, which serves some of the largest rolls filled with the freshest sushi that I've tasted, all at ridiculously low prices that keep me coming back.  Now, it helps that there's not much competition around, but No. 1 Sushi has really grown on me. After a few visits and a few different rolls, I settled on the Ichiban Roll and the Viagra Roll (yeah, I didn't ask either), which have the most amount of fresh fish per roll.  Add a bowl of miso soup or some edamame, and you will leave quite full. There's really few options that are better for lunch in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Service is always great but the quality has been poor both times I have been. It's disappointing because the reviews on here are so good. But each time the rolls have been missing ingredients and I had to go back. The second visit had the roll actually falling apart because it was so poorly made. I'm very reluctant to give it a 3rd chance but there aren't too many great sushi places downtown..."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, and fast sushi!!! Owners are Korean and very friendly. I believe this place should be one dollar sign, not two.  I got one roll (8 pieces) for $6.50. Water bottles weren't overpriced either; $1 for a bottle.   Overall, great experience. Probably my new favorite sushi place in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The go-to sushi spot in downtown Pittsburgh. Never disappoints and the specials are always a good deal."}
{"text":"The service here was very good and it was very quick for sushi! The employees greeted us as we came in and was very friendly. The sushi itself was good but not super filling for me, as I was very hungry. The prices were decent for sushi, $5-12 depending on what's in it and how many rolls. I got a double roll (12 pieces total) with a california roll and a salmon roll for about $9.  It's a good location, in the center of downtown. It is also in a walkable distance from point state park.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for a quick small bite of sushi!  tldr; food 4/5 price 5/5 service 5/5 timeliness 5/5 location 5/5"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for sushi and wanted something close by and good. Thanks to my fellow yelpers I tried No. 1 sushi. It is a small restaurant so keep that in mind if your looking to dine in.  I ordered the #2 special,  spicy tuna, California rolls, and choice of miso soup or seaweed salad $10.95. I also ordered spicy salmon $5.95. Prices were on par with other sushi restaurants in my opinion.   The rice was cooked well and the fish tasted fresh. I didn't give this place five stars because the spicy mayo and spicy sauce was a lot...too much. I ended up scraping off some of it.   Overall it was a good meal with a minor hiccup.  I also want to add that this establishment is very friendly and personable.  I was in and out in ten minutes."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never been a BIG sushi fan due to bad experience, however I recently decided to give sushi another try, and i'm glad that I did at No. 1 Sushi. The rice is cooked to the perfect consistency and has a hint of sweetness, and the fish, crab, and shrimp is ALWAYS so fresh! The staff here are extremely friendly and accommodating and also very patient considering the lunch time rush. Great prices as well! I'm now a sushi addict, as I frequent this place at least twice a week!."}
{"text":"Excellent place to go! I happened to run into this place that's a little bit hidden but still in Market Square. The lady who was serving was so sweet and made sure you had everything you needed.   The sushi itself was great, especially the rainbow roll. I was very impressed. Prices were reasonable. The place is small but you can always get your food to go and eat outside. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a small place located on a side street of Market Square. They sell nothing but sushi, miso soup, a few small salads (anyone up for an octopus salad?) and drinks. Think sushi with a fast food approach.    The dining area seats 11 people and the seats aren't very comfortable. I think the idea is to get you in and on your way as quickly as possible which would be fine on a nice day when you can relax and enjoy your lunch outside in Market Square.  Today I got the special:  California roll and salmon roll with the miso soup. The soup was tasty and I enjoyed both rolls; it was definitely worth the $11.72 that I spent on it. Actually it was more food than I really wanted and I ended up wasting about half a roll.  I really would have been satisfied with just one roll.  Chalk it up as a sushi rookie mistake... I never think that this stuff will fill me up and I'm always surprised when it does.   My only real knock on No1. Sushi Sushi is that the chopsticks that I got were warped -- I tried two different sets. It's not so much a big deal for me, I'm relatively proficient when it comes to chop sticks but I could see a newbie could get frustrated quickly."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy salmon roll, and I wasn't crazy about the spicy mayo-based sauce they drizzle on top of it.  I called and let them know this, and they offered to replace my order with a regular salmon roll.  It was delicious.  Excellent customer service and top-notch sushi -- I recommend No. 1 Sushi Sushi very highly."}
{"text":"It's sushi and it's super cheap but the quality and serving size would definitely tell you different. I enjoyed my tempura and the welcoming staff are very nice. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, made fresh and quick.  Unfortunately, lately, the sushi rolls have been falling apart when they are dipped in soy.  Fix this problem, and I would give 5 stars.  Other than that, best downtown sushi."}
{"text":"Small, friendly sushi restaurant in Downtown. We got the eel & avocado roll, ichiban roll, and two salmon rolls. The rolls are huge (especially the ichiban roll)! So worth the price, not that they are even that expensive. They were decent, although I thought the ichiban roll lacked some flavor.   Service here is fantastic. I ordered takeout and was greeted warmly. Felt no rush to order as the lady told me to take my time. After placing my order, she called me by my first name every time she spoke to me. After waiting for just a couple minutes, one of the sushi chefs came over to me to tell me that it'll be another few minutes before my sushi is done because they wanted to use fresher ingredients. The lady told me to take a seat as I waited and, five seconds later, brought me a bowl of hot miso soup to enjoy. How sweet! When my order was ready, she even took the extra step to clean the sauce that was stuck to the bottom of the styrofoam box before putting it into the bag. She and the sushi chef both apologized for the wait and thanked me for waiting, even though it only took about 10-12 minutes. Really was not expecting such great service for just ordering takeout. Imagine the service you'd get if you ate in!   Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 3 Service | 5  OVERALL | 3.5"}
{"text":"Look, the idea of eating raw fish when your city is sandwiched between two rivers with unbelievably disgusting pasts isn't always pleasant... but if you know where to go, a purging of the mind is possible with some excellent quality.  Aside from Andy's sushi stand at Wholey's, I frequent No. 1 more often than any other.  They always recognize me and remember my name, either from frequency of my patronage or because I have a significant beard that is burned into their memory.  Either way, it's appreciated and they are always pleasant.  It's close to the office, it's relatively quick, and the variety is great... even if they pander to the yinzers by way of dressed up California rolls with Pittsburgh names for a few items, one of which contains cream cheese.  Filth like that should be named after the Monongahela, but I digress.    This review is not for the specials, nor any particular roll, but more so the general satisfaction they provide with their sushi.  Crispy salmon skin rolls are simple but well executed, the green monster is a great vegetarian option with nice texture contrast (albeit pieces are giant and make it somewhat difficult to maintain a pristine facial shrub), the spicy eel and avocado has a great balance of flavors, and the overall variety of fish gives you an endless bounty of options to help you dip your toes in the deep end.  In addition, the seaweed salad is always eaten on the side.  Forget the iceberg mix and ginger dressing... you can eat salad like that at home.  Expand your horizons and get more nutrients.  The seaweed is bright, crunchy, salty, and a little nutty from the toasted sesame seeds.  Oh, that neon green hair of a deep sea angel, be still my heart.  As long as they're slingin' fresh fish in my work neighborhood, I'll be going back at least every other week.  There aren't many places I'd feel safe eating sushi in this city, but I'm glad one of them is right down the street."}
{"text":"Don't get sushi if you're visiting and you live by the water. Not fresh and they use WAY too much rice!! It's all RICE!  I was traveling for work and craved sushi. Was hesitant at first considering its Pittsburgh but then the raging reviews convinced me to go. I regretted my decision. I ate it cause I was starving. Lesson learned! Only order sushi when you're by the coast."}
{"text":"I popped in for lunch and ordered the #2 Special of California Roll and Spicy Tuna roll with seaweed salad. Then on impulse I added two pieces of Yellowtail. Total came to $17.00.  I should have just stuck with the lunch special. Yikes   On the plus it very yummy and quickly prepared. I will be back but might wait till payday to order non special menu items...."}
{"text":"A real sushi bar downtown that caters to the lunch crowd. Try the daily specials as they are excellent and the service is remarkably fast.  The seating is tight and limited and there is no bathroom.  So with that get here early if you want to eat in as it get busy really fast."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, decent quality sushi located conveniently in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. This is the place to go to quickly satisfy a sushi craving that won't break the bank. They have an extensive menu of your typical run-of-the-mill rolls as well as a good selection of specialty rolls (with some very, uh, unique names).   The vegetarian options are definitely more varied than other sushi take-out spots I've seen so I was pleasantly surprised. I went for two of the vegetarian specialty rolls: Veggie Lover and Green Monster (both around $8 a roll). Personally, I would recommend the Green Monster if you're looking for a hearty veggie roll. The Veggie Lover was simply bland and tasteless. Neither were extraordinary by any means, but hey, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Super friendly, great sushi, fair prices, clean. A little hidden away off 5th, but worth seeking out!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place!  This is one of my favorite sushi places. Customer Service is excellent, everyone there is always friendly.  All the ingredients are very fresh, even the wasabi!  I always just get take out because there is not much room for dining in. I'm usually in and out in 5 minutes.  Prices are about average.  Try their specials, they come with a side. I've always gotten the miso soup which is also excellent and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is tucked in a little side street beside Market Square.   After seeing a sign on the sidewalk advertising a reasonably priced ($10) sushi lunch special, I decided to give it a try.  The inside is small, but tastefully decorated with a few tables and a wall bar area.  I was immediately fond of the place simply because the woman taking orders and manning the register was SOOO NICE.  Seriously, she is ultra-friendly and was running around trying to help customers, get them more ginger, etc.  In a lunch area dominated by busy businessmen and women trying to get in and out as quickly as possible, with restaurant workers typically disinterested in providing good customer service, this was a refreshing change!  The lunch special came with two sushi rolls and a side salad.  It was a perfect lunch portion and honestly included more sushi than I had expected for the price.  The sushi was good.  Not mind-blowing, not terrible, but better than expected at the price and given the cost of doing business in that location.  In short - it's a solid lunch spot!    I'd happily go back and I really hope that they succeed.  If they keep providing such great customer service I have no doubt they will do well."}
