{"text":"Having been a big fan of the original Campiti's in Dormont I had to give this place a try. Much to my surprise if I had my eyes closed I would have thought I was sitting on Potomac Ave!!! The pizza is perfect! Nice thin crunchy crust matched with the ever slightly sweet sauce. Not shy on the cheese either! Ordered my favorite topping of pepperoni as this is where the rubber meets the road and fail it did not! Spicy and with a slight crisp on the edges make it the best! Also had a steak hoagie. No disappointment here either. Tender thin sliced steak piled high with the usual lettuce tomato and onion. But the difference is they use Italian dressing rather than some overly sweet steak sauce or smothered in mayo. Very pleasing to the taste buds! Overall the place is very clean and the staff helpful and courteous. The owner Frank has hit a home run! We will frequent his place on a regular basis! A full 5 stars since that's all I can give!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, great people, they actually bag there pizza, keeps it fresh, and hot, I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love their pizza! We come back every week and are never disappointed. Their crust is delicious!! Great location and ownership."}
{"text":"Campiti's is a gem! Tastes just as good as the original in Dormont. Nothing quite like pizza out of a paper bag! The Works is the way to go. The staff is super friendly and enjoyable to converse with when you're waiting for your food to be served up fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Service was great, people friendly.  The pizza with \"The Works\" was outstanding.  We were surprised to discover Campiti's in Bethel Park.  This new location is much more convenient to get to than the original shop in Dormont.  Very clean!"}
{"text":"South Hill ls friends- check them out! Delicious pizza and hoagies. Great prices and extremely friendly staff. Some of you may have visited their Potomac Ave. (Dormont) location. They have expanded. Pizza is ready in a flash and packed to go in a bag instead of a box. Kinda cool! This method keeps the pizza from getting cold quicker. Give them a try- you won't be disappointed! Both locations offer dine in as well."}
{"text":"Great new location on Library Rd. Great pizza. Has seating if you don't want to take out. Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Campiti's Pizza is a legend in Dormont and the new Bethel Park location is great. Easy to park, they don't deliver....it is worth the drive.  I love their Pizza in a bag!  It is easier to get rid of than a bulky cardboard box.  Then, there is the pizza!  Old fashioned thin crust Pizza. Love it, love the new place... fresh, bright and sparkling clean."}
{"text":"I'm originally from New York so I'm very picky when it comes to pizza. I'm a big critic I love my pizza sauce to have a zesty tangy little kick to it. I hate when the pizza sauce is sweet because of sugar in it. I've been going to this pizza place now for the last three weeks almost every day and it really is worth the drive plus it's great for lunch the price is perfect. Plus it reminds me of home. This is by far the best pizza I have had since I've been here in Pa"}
{"text":"I'm very picky with pizza, we decided to try them out and loved the food! We went on Friday night and ordered to go. The wait was a little long with no where to sit. Extra cheese pizza was good, needed more cheese though. Loved the steak hoagie with Italian dressing on it! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time at Campiti's and it was great! Staff was very friendly and welcoming and the restaurant was very clean! Cleaner than I've ever seen a pizza shop. Fantastic sign to me! I'm not a big pizza eater but this was worth it. Thin, crispy crust and loads of toppings. Came out quickly even though it was a Friday night and the phone rang constantly while we were there. Inside has maybe 4 tables (can't quite remember) each with a few chairs. And they do have a high chair. Loved it!"}
{"text":"We lived in Dormont for many years and loved the Camps on Potomac Avenue. Now we live in Bethel Park and were thrilled there was a new Camps in this area and it is just as good.  The best pizza and hoagies anywhere! This is the only place we go for pizza and hoagies, in fact we are going there this afternoon because that is what our lunch guest want. I know we will not be disappointed now or ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Still upset about the garbage experience 2 weeks ago, I would never eat their again.  Pizza in bags, with a dry cracker crust, dry cheese, and no flavor . It tasted like a saltine cracker with cheese, oh and it was like $15 for a large ....... and the large was SMALLER than any other place's large. Horrible business."}
{"text":"I've seen this place, tucked behind Sheetz, & kept thinking \"I need to try that place sometime.\" I decided to give it a shot today. I ordered a small pepperoni & half of an Italian hoagie. I was going to stack the 2 items to carry out, but when my order was presented they put the small pizza in a brown paper bag. Yes, a bag.  When I got home & opened the bag I see the pizza on a cardboard disk. I was pissed off they didn't have a box to present it in. A bag, really??? I pulled it out & was delighted to see little pepperonis. After tasting it I got disappointed again. The pepperoni was great, the cheese & sauce were good, but the crust was terrible. The crust tastes like pre-made pizza crusts you'd get at a grocery store. The crust was thin, which I like, but it had no flavor. It was dry & boring, & too crunchy on the outside. I ate a couple slices & threw the rest out. Oh well, there's still more.  Next up was the Italian hoagie. The hoagie was sub-par. I'm not sure if it was the bread or the meats, but it was definitely lacking in flavor. It didn't pop & get my attention. It was on par with a gas station hoagie.  Perhaps because there is so much competition in Pittsburgh for pizza shops that my standards are a little higher, but I can think of a handful of places that I will go to from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a small 10\" cheese pizza for lunch.  Pizza was good with a slightly sweet sauce to it, and a crust that is not too thin, and not thick either.  Location just opened, so everything is all nice and new.  There are only four tables, and all of them were full by 11:30 today, but there does seem to be room to expand, so I hope they get some more tables soon.  Note: They do not serve slices, so the six-cut small pie is the smallest choice they have, at least for now.  Next time I'll come back and try one of the hoagies."}
{"text":"First time trying Campiti's, yes first time, never been to the Dormont location either. We ordered a small pepperoni pizza with extra sauce for carry out. It was ready within 15 minutes. Interesting how it comes in a paper bag. The smell on the drive home made me hungry! Nice sized pizza for two with a couple slices leftover. Is a thin crust with plenty of pepperoni. Would like to try their other pizzas. Very clean restaurant with helpful staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  Was thinking pizza but noticed the great deal on 1/2 Italian hoagie, chips and 20 oz drink for $4.99.  Sold!  The hoagie is good, not as good as my fave place but good.  Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We were anxious to try them when they finally opened. The pizza was good, but the sauce was too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Nice middle of the road pizzeria. Pizza tasty, place is clean and employees friendly. Newly opened on library road in milliniem shops by sheetz."}
