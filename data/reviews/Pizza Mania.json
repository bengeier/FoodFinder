{"text":"Called to see if they were open and they said yes.  I show up 20 minutes later and the place is closed.  I learned that they run pizza's behind their store to the more expensive Italian place two doors down.  Bummer that it was more upscale than we were looking for but the pizza's were good."}
{"text":"Since I was at Lake Las Vegas I was planning on some premium pizza.  Don't get me wrong my calzone was good and filling but I just expected more from the location and the price I paid.  It was also probably one of the cheaper places to eat there so I probably just should have went to a fancier spot"}
{"text":"As a pizza connoisseur, I've definitely had better. The pizza was typical pay by the slice pizza;  flat and greasy. I just had the slice of pizza, so maybe the other food there is better. The service was slow, but the Lake Las Vegas atmosphere was cool. It was nice that you can eat outside if you want."}
{"text":"Exactly what Bethany said, I called, they said they were open, but alas closed upon arrival 15 minutes later. Turns out they are related to the Luna..Italian place 2 shops down. We ended up eating there instead. Felt bad cause we were dressed very casual. Anyway, it had mediocre food, unfriendly waiter."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had. The person at the counter disappears for 15 minutes at a time. They are part of the Italian restaurant next door (Luna Rossa). When my pizza was ready a non English speaking person put our pizza in box and set it on the counter without saying anything. I opened the box and verified the pizza was mine. We needed plates and silverware so we could eat in the restaurant. The guy at the counter did not understand English and did not even try to find someone that did. I walked over to Luna Rossa to get someone to help us. The owner was very upset with me but met me in the pizza place. He was extremely rude but he did give us what we needed. We will never go back!"}
{"text":"As others have said there is no infrastructure here.  They only had pizza by the slice towards middle of afternoon because the restaurant next door stops making it for them.  Once they sold out of those slices they closed out.  They have a sign advertising all the other offerings and it was disappointing after planning the day around coning here."}
{"text":"We called in the order, but had to pick it up two doors down and pay for it there as well. The lady on the phone said they didn't have green peppers and asked if yellow was ok. We said yes. We got yellow, red and green peppers but no pepperoni, like we asked. And the other cheese pizza was burnt on the bottom. Plus she only gave us three papers plates with two large pizzas!?!  Will not return."}
