{"text":"1 star for good service. we had fajitas and carne asada and none of it had any flavor at all. the chips and salsa werent good. oh well.  the price is way too high to walk away this unsatisfied."}
{"text":"We went there last night for dinner - our first visit in probably a year. The food was still good and of course the margaritas delicious. And the service was pretty good. What I did notice this visit as compared to visits before was that the place was dirty. We sat at a table next to some shutters and they were covered with dust. The light above our table was dusty, and the restroom was filthy. Makes me wonder what kind of cleaning they are doing in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is a completely bias review.  If you want an unbias, read the next reviews.    I am a simple guy when it comes to food and the food I've eaten there has always been excellient.  I love it.  Honestly, probably my favorite place to go in Vegas for food.  I love the enchilladas, they are simple and delicious.  Not full of random ingredients where the cooks are just trying to make them more exotic.  Simple, and great.    I think with Mexican food, people probably would think it is too simple, so that's why I say I'm bias.    I give it a 4 because I don't know if I have ever come across a good server there, waitress, waiter, anything.  They are normally pretty bad.  And I And I know how bias I am to the food, so I automatically took down the 1 star to be fair."}
{"text":"Really solid food, quality ingredients, very accommodating for large groups."}
{"text":"Nice setting, okay service.   I've gone here for my craving of Made to Order Guacamole. They are very inconsistant.  Sometimes, the diced tomatoes and avocado look old, so I'm always taking a chance.  They're very cincy with the tortilla chips that come with the guac, so don't be afraid to ask for more.  I've tried their Tequila Shrimp and thought it had a weird after taste and the shrimp was too rubbery.  I've had the 3 item combo, try to order something other than the taquitos with your combo because they are small.  Chips and salsa with refried beans are tasty. When ordering the nachos, ask for the refried beans on the side because they put a big heap of it.  You want to taste the cheese and meat but they smother it with beans to be cheap.    Their breakfast specials are inexpensive and I liked the breakfast quesadilla without the egg."}
{"text":"I knew the mango margaritas would be good, but I was amazed at how wonderful the tilapia was!! Flaky and fresh and not over-battered...I highly recommend trying it!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Some of the best guacamole in town and margaritas are exceptional as well"}
{"text":"the good:  i know, now, this place is a hit it and quit it joint.  the bad:  food. Joseph tasted his smothered burrito and put his fork down, and said, 'I always expect Mexican restaurant food to be as flavorful as your friend's mama's  homemade, and it always remains as bland as hell.' even my entree was bland. the only tasty thing on my plate was rice. dessert did not even make up for any of the blah entrees. i have had fried ice cream before and this was not. the ice cream was rolled around on some cinnamon sugar churro-like crumb sprinkle. the only thing previously fried was the ready shell that their taco salad comes in.  the ugly: no warm greeting. no warm service. no good MIXED DRINK! and, i think, many of the plain clothed people walkin around the service areas must have been related to the kitchen and service staff somehow. ugh, this turns me off because it always makes for poor service.  with the quality of the food here, menu item prices should start at $4.95 and be no higher than $7.95 {that would be for the seafood entrees} I'd hate to see how little seafood is served on such a plate."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.  It was almost a 3-star review, but I am bumping it to 4-stars because they have a $5.95 menu with a few popular items that comes with their regular menu.  I'm pretty sure that no other Mexican restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter) hands you a \"cheap menu\" along with their regular menu!    For a small family like mine, the $5.95 worked perfect.  Order one entree off the regular menu, order one off the cheap menu, and you can walk out of there at dinner for less than $20.    They serve chips and salsa at every table - the chips are served as whole tortillas and you have to break them up to dip.  I have never seen that before and I can honestly say I have probably eaten at over 1,000 Mexican restaurants in my life.    For our first visit, we stuck to the basic enchiladas and tacos.   The food was very average.   We really liked the mexican rice - it was better than at most places.  Our service was average.  The restaurant was pretty busy on a Wednesday night.  We plan to return and try some other items.  All in all, a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I love SuperMex! I go here for either lunch or dinner and I seem to always get the same waitress who is super nice and friendly!! The food comes out hot and I recommend the beef or chicken flautas! MMM!!!! It's nothing fancy which is totally fine to me! I mean, come on, it's next to a gas station, it's going to be casual!   Only complaint is the size of the bean and carne asada burrito I got to go for my parents....I thought it would be a big one like Roberto's burritos...but...it was the size of the tip of my middle finger to the end of my palm. But she also gave me tortilla \"chips\" and salsa to go!   Always look forward to my flautas! lol"}
{"text":"Salsa is very good, Tijuana tacos excellent, also very good selection of Mexican beers on tap. Bar could use more high top tables."}
{"text":"SuperMex is one of those good, authentic, Mexican restaurants and has always been consistent when I've dined with them. I've tried several items, but for some reason, always go back to the simple bean and cheese burrito. Their beans are what I would expect from a Mexican restaurant, not like the \"out of the can\" garbage that most Mexican restaurants out here seem to serve.   The atmosphere is nice...kind of dark, but feels like your south of the border on vacation. While in the restaurant, you forget there's a busy city outside and just enjoy the food, atmosphere, and the company you're with."}
{"text":"I think I'll be eating here every time I come to Vegas from now on.  My brother took us here because he had a Yelp deal he bought for it but we'll return in the future, deal or not!    My wife, who is Mexican, was in the mood for chilaquiles for breakfast so that's what we set out for.  Sure enough, they were on the menu and at a great price.  I think most of the items on their breakfast menu came in around $4 and the portions were huge.  We easily could have split one plate, but we ended up taking home leftovers and they did not go to waste in the fridge!  The chilaquiles had great flavor.  They weren't very spicy but surprisingly, my wife didn't seem to mind.  I got shredded chicken on mine and it was delicious.  My wife pointed out that they didn't have any eggs on them but I was too busy scarfing them down to notice.  She just made a mental note so that she orders them with eggs next time.  We liked the bean dip and the salsa that came with the chips.  Actually, chips might not be the best description.  It's more like a basket of tostadas that you can break into chips.  They were definitely fresh and authentic.  The only thing that kept it from 5 stars was the speed of the service.  It seemed like there was only one server, but there was only 4-5 tables occupied when we were in there and I didn't see her checking on their drinks either.  Unless she was the cook too, she was slacking."}
{"text":"Love everyone that works here. I've been going here for at least 3 years now. i would say 4 out of 5 times everything is perfect. I dont care what time it is super mex is always my first choice !!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. The waitress barely spoke English and the manager couldn't understand our issue well enough to remedy the problem."}
{"text":"good americanized mexican food.  love the bean dip and salsa combination as well as the value menu items.  not gourmet, but pretty good. will definitely return."}
{"text":"Kind of a dump, but we got seated right away.  We just came for food, didn't check out the bar area.  Menu has the standard mex options for a sit down place, plus breakfast 24 hours a day.  My friends got quesadillas, chimichanga, and a torta and they thought it was meh ok.  One friend got a horchata and said it was a really good horchata.  Soft drinks were refillable.  I stuck with water, and it had a nice lemon slice in it.  The chips are fried tortillas that you have to break apart yourself.  I'd have prefered standard chips.  The salsa it came with was fantastic.  I don't know why, I don't know what I like about it but I really liked the salsa.  It came with bean dip too, but I just stuck with this salsa I really liked.  I got a bowl from the \"lite\" menu, it had carne asada, green rice (no idea what green rice is but it was rice and it was green and it tasted good), mushrooms, and a baja kind of sauce.  YUM!  wow this bowl was really good.  Kind of pricey for nine dollars.  I'd love to see a calorie count, if this was truly a dieter food, I would definately recommend this, because I'm a big guy that's not on a diet and loved it just for what it was.  If it turns out this is a low cal bowl, then raise my review a star, I'd become the next Jared and just eat this every day and lose 50 pounds.  All in all, there are better options for sit down mexican, but the reason this gets three stars is because of the carne asada bowl I got and that this place is open 24 hours and the salsa the chips come with.  Occasionally there are groupons available, and I'll basically come here if I can get a groupon or if it's really late and other options aren't open, but I wouldn't really come for dinner during regular hours at the full menu price.  I'd also be willing to come to try out any specials or happy hour etc. where the prices are cheaper."}
{"text":"I came here one night with my friend who lives in Henderson and we were looking for a place to eat.  We got here late, around 11PM, so it was not crowded at all.  We sat ourselves and looked through the menu while our server brought us chips and salsa to snack on.  After looking the menu over, I decided to order off of their specials menu.  I ended up with a burrito (shredded chicken) and taco (shredded beef) combo plate that came with rice and beans for $7.  When it came out , the food was really hot but that's a good thing because it meant they just cooked it.  In the end, I couldn't finish the plate but was like 95% of the way there.  The food was good for a chain type Mexican place but doesn't match up to the taquerias I've been to in the Bay Area.  However, it's open late and good for quenching those late night hunger pangs."}
{"text":"We found this place through GroupOn, and glad we did.  We have been searching for good and reasonable sit-down dining Mexican, this is it.  Great bean dip and salsa and our meals were great.  Ample servings and very tasty.  Saw 5-6 kids highchairs so I am thinking local families know of this place.  There is a separate bar area with TV;s and poker tables, and a separate dining room for families or those that prefer non-bar area to eat.  It's a little far from our home but we will be making regular return trips.  You won't be disappointed.  It is just North of the 215.  I had the Chimichanga meal (diet food - ha ha) and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Great food, many dishes are not traditional \"American\" Mexican, but with a twist! Try the Mexican pizza w/steak, fabulous!"}
{"text":"California comes to Vegas! This place is like the restaurants in California, but better. It's open 24/7 363 days a year (closed on Easter and Christmas) I'm usually here on there graveyard shift or sometimes early dinner. Great food and affordable. Look for discounts in the Entertainment Book!"}
{"text":"I eat here quite often and spread the word to friends about it and now it's one of their favorite places for Mexican food. I love it and enjoy the nice vibe when I'm eating. We always return to this place :) My favorite is the Tamales."}
{"text":"This is not gourmet or a charming hole-in-the-wall. It's a gas station restaurant.   Yes, one half is devoted to dispensing fossil fuels, the other to refried beans. Do not expect miracles.    They will give you the largest chips you have ever seen.  They will also give you refried beans and salsa.  Fancy.  Food is basic and will meet your Tex-Mex needs.  Do not expect an authentic experience.  Also, in case you were wondering, the restaurant does not smell like gasoline."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon to here, went on Friday night with wife and kids. Walked in and sat ourselves in restaurant area. Ordered some Margaritas for the wife and myself. Frozen Raz for her and On the rocks for me. Those both came out good. (though i had to pour my shot in myself which i thought was weird)  For Food she wanted to order 3 different Tamales, which led to a bit of disappointment as the server said the only ones they had tonight were shredded beef. She got 3 of those then. I ordered the Tacos Tijuana off the specialty plate. Taste wise both were good, though both of us liked mine better. For the kids we ordered one grilled cheese, which was pretty sad actually for $5.99. Decent size, just cheese was barely melted and hardly toasted for the bread. (though i dunno how much i can fault a Mexican place for a poor grilled cheese).   The kids menu also came with an ice cream, which server was nice enough to bring out one for each kid even though we only ordered one. That upped her tip a bit for sure.   All in all this place would have gotten a solid four stars for taste and service, but had to deduct one for only one choice of Tamale."}
{"text":"I have been to Super Mex a few times since my last review. The last two times however I have noticed a huge improvement in the food. Everything was tastier and even the service was improved. Way to go sport-o, one more star for you!l."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite spots to frequent but, the last two times they fell short of the greatness of the first few times that we went... a dozen tostada with beans and salsa, when hot, are to die for.... Their \"lite and healthy\" menu all have been great in the past... I hope that they return to their top quality of food and service soon."}
{"text":"Damn their chips and salsa rock! Especially with a margarita on the rocks. Consistent food, BoGo coupon two other reasons why we keep coming back to Super Mex. Yuuuuuuumy!"}
{"text":"i dont go here enough but after a night out on the town this would hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"This  place  is  very  nice-  Service  is  great  and  food  very  good--not  overly  spicy.  Open  24  hours,  and the  best  waiter , at  night,   is            Marcello.       .  During the  day ,  get  a  table  with Anna  Maria  serving  you.  We  are  locals  and  we  go  at  least  once  a  week."}
{"text":"Long time customer of SM. I love their chips which are giant fried corn tortillas. Fresh salsa always. I'm in love with their garlic cream sauce on their combination plates. I'm a Texan, so I'm all about the ground beef enchiladas. They are awesome here!  My absolutely favorite is their grilled veggies. I'm not a girl that usually goes straight to the veggies but the way they sauté their squash and onions is amazing. I'm always trying to repeat it. They also have a separate counter for the take home customers. Grab a burrito at night and take it home for lunch the next day. Nom nom nom! It will be possibly two lunches!"}
{"text":"I been to the location over by the airport one night with some co-wokers, seems like that location taste much better than the one here over in the SW on Durango. The service wasn't soo great, the dish i ordered wasn't as nearly satifying as it was over off Sunset, i think that's the street. I won't ever come back to this Durango location, maybe i'll go back to the other place, maybe."}
{"text":"Meh, it was okay. Just like any other 3 stars. But this is a little too pricey for my liking for just OK food. The service was just normal as well."}
{"text":"decent food But definitely going downhill.  On my most recent visit, I sat at the bar, and was virtually ignored by the waitress, who was obviously entertaining some friends.  It took me over twenty minutes to get a drink and almost 1/2 hour before she took my food order -  even though there were fewer than ten people in the place.   Just after I got my food, she cashed out, sat down next to me at the bar - with her friends - and commenced chain-smoking - which is, illegal, I believe.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Okay for the price and quality of food. Definitely better places in town but they will cost more. Good happy hour prices... And down the street."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!  This is my \"go-to\" place for those rough Saturday or Sunday brunches.  You know what I mean.  SuperMex is a reliable standard of good food quality.  If you're hunting for really authentic wonderful Mexican cuisine, this might not be the spot, but for a great guacamole and Mexican pizza, they always deliver.  And several other menu items are just good 'ol SW Mexican dishes.  Great lunch specials too.  Can eat well for $7.  Thanks SuperMex for all the times you've saved my weekend!"}
{"text":"Great chips and bean dip right when you sit down."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time rocked.. Was for lunch had a perfect bean tip and chips.. the bean dip was amazing. It had cooked pork mixed in it and was a nice surprise. The chicken Fajitas were tasty and I was onto the best new place in Vegas for Mexican (according to me).   Then the second trip.. not so good. Dip was flavorless and wasn't anyhting like the last time. The tacos were basic and weren't as good as Putters Taco Basket. So.. thrid time will be the tie breakers.. Let u know.."}
{"text":"I have visited here many times and find it a great place when I am craving some Mexican food. The place is open 24hr and the food is consistently decent for the price and the portion. They also serve fresh in house made tortillas like most Mexican places do these days.  I visited this location on a friends recommendation and because I had a coupon and I also wanted some home style Mexican food and not some del taco. The location was semi hard to find since its kinda of not visible from the 215 exit but once you know its right next to the gas station you cant miss it.  The restaurant itself is clean and very roomy they offer booths and table seating. Their menu offers some pretty standard Mexican dish's with good explications of what you will receive. If you are unsure about portions ask the server and they will be happy to tell you portion sizes. Once we took out booth and ordered our drinks the complimentary chips and salsa came out fresh and tasty. After a short wait of maybe 5-10 minutes all of our food came out. The portions where exactly as explained by the server so it was no surprise there. Overall the food here is good and not overly greasy like a lot of Mexican food can be. I would recommend it to anyone craving some sit down food any time of the day. Last time I visited I noticed they have a lunch special menu as well which is very reasonably priced.  I usually end up orders the SuperMex Burrito covered in read sauce. Its a kinda big burrito but if you can eat a lot like me I would give it a go!"}
{"text":"Solid and simple Mexican restaurant. Very attentive service. Cozy dining area. The food is simple but well crafted. Excellent value."}
{"text":"Great food & prices.  We have eaten here a fe times with friends during our visits to Las Vegas.  My only complaint is we had a very large group of 20 (4 families) and just wanted the server to separate our check by each family and they said they weren't allowed to. It took us almost 30 minutes to figure out each family's bill and we decided this was not a place we will visit again as a group!"}
{"text":"This is a solid joint for mexican food. It's not gourmet, but it's not a total dive either.  I stopped in for dinner last week with my Dad, and we sat down in the dining area (non-smoking). Very quickly, the room started to smell like someone was smoking weed. Of course, I pretended to not know what the smell was, but my Dad caught my lie. That turned into an awkward dinner conversation. Oh well.  The server was very kind and offered to move us to the bar area, without us asking.  In any case....when you are seated, you get a nice plate of chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The food is quite good. Lots of options. There is a \"healthy\" menu, as well as a \"seniors\" menu.   I opted for the Chicken Sarandeado. A grilled chicken breast that was nicely seasoned, served with tortillas, rice, beans and pico.   Nothing about this place stands out as life-changing, but this place is A-Ok and I would come back because the service was good, the food was good, and atmosphere was fun.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Ok to start off this was my 2nd time going to eat here the 1st time was great sat in the bar got greeted immediately by the bartender jodi. She was very friendly knowledgeable and just overall nice, that's why i decided to go back.  On that note, I walked in and we went straight for the bar. It wasnt busy there were 2 other customers. For starters the bartender CARINA did not greet us no smile, no hi I'll be right with you ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! When she finally did come over she did not introduce herself just very rudely said \"I'm going to need to see both of your id's.\" There are proper ways to ask for ones id and that was not even close. So we showed her then ordered 2 margarita's, it was happy hour and by the way that was the main reason we rushed down there. So she brings our drinks takes our order(which wasn't difficult at all) the food comes out pretty quick but mine wasnt right i ordered the super mex burrito no lettuce and chile verde sauce on the side. It took her 7-8 mins to come back i had to push my burrito to the edge so she would notice. I told her what was wrong and she pretty much acted like it was my fault and then proceeded to get her notepad to show me what she wrote down, she didnt even say i'm sorry just told me i needed to specify better. So there we are waiting for my food are margarita's on the brink of emptiness and happy hour over in 10 mins, after 5-6 mins of her not coming over i went up to the bar and waited another 3 mins once again she did not acknowledge me, was going to walk right past and not say anything i told her that we wanted to get 2 more margarita's before happy hour was over, she says its 6:01 happy hour is over. My phone said it was 5:59, she could've redeemed herself if we would've gotten the drinks. At that point I was pissed!! My burrito finally came out and she had fully changed my order. I wanted the super mex burrito because it had rice in it, the burrito she brought me just had beans cilantro and onions. I'm sorry but how fucking hard is it to put SAUCE ON THE SIDE. You have to be an idiot if its that hard to push a damn button. Being a server myself I would never leave a restaurant without leaving a tip NO MATTER how terrible the service. But this was by far the worst service I have ever dealt with she was talking down to other customers telling me how I should order my food the next time so that there's no confusion. Seriously lady?! By all means i am not bashing the restaurant the food is good, but i will be calling to make sure that she is not the bartender when i go in."}
{"text":"My main reason to go here was because we has a groupon. Boy am i glad we went! Excellent food and fantastic service!!! Their menu is huge and yummy margaritas!"}
{"text":"Service was ok, food was mediocre. Their margaritas were awesome!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my husband almost 3 years ago. Prior to that, I've heard of it before, but have been. Since then, we come here maybe...every other month (or whenever we get a coupon for this place).   Every single time we've been there we've had great customer service. We've gone when it's been both slow AND busy and have never had any problems. Food is usually at the table within minutes of us ordering.   They give complimentary chips and salsa which I actually don't mind. I know some reviewers say it's bland, but I usually doctor up the beans and just add some hot sauce to the salsa and my hubby and I are fine with that. I'm assuming that have to keep the level of spiciness and a moderate level to cater to the masses. I've always loved the chips and salsa so no complaint there.   Hubby usually gets steak fajitas and I get my carnitas plate. Almost always I scan the menu wanting to try something new, but I LLLLLOOOOVVVVE carnitas and with the exception of one time, I've never been disappointed. The one time I was disappointed was because I felt it hadn't been seasoned enough and needed just a tad bit more simmering/slow-cooking/whatever you call it. That was about a year ago, and I've had it twice since then and I'm completely happy with it. Hubby LOVES his fajitas. Let me tell you...once again, have never been disappointed. The steak has always been seasoned well and never overpowering.   In my opinion, the portions are HUGE! We always have to take leftovers home. We even ask for extra tortillas for take home and they always oblige!!   And yes, I've had all kinds of Mexican food and although this may not be super authentic, the food's great and I'd recommend it any day!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us came for lunch today.  Nice selection of lunch specials for $5.95.  Two of us ordered the chicken taco salad.  The guacamole on both ours was not right so we sent it back.  They brought us out fresh salads and those tasted just fine.  Juicy pulled chicken, lettuce, pico de gallo served in a crispy taco bowl.  The service was very attentive.  The salsa and refried beans were rather tasty and of course that always gets me!  So the two stars is for the not quite right guacamole.  Maybe we'll have better salads next time.  We'll try it again."}
{"text":"Our cab driver gave us this recommendation - it was well worth the trip.  I had the carnitas - YUM!!!  with enough left over for a midnight snack!!  my daughters had chimichangas - the plate comes with 2 of them!!!  way too much for them to eat - but again...midnight snacks!  we will definitely go back for more if we ever make it back to vegas!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it :(   I have to take this location off my places to take people to eat... for the these reasons:  - Poor service - Cold food - poor service  Our group actually thought that Super Mex wanted us to leave.   I don't know who to blame for this...well the waiter for one, but I don't know if they needed more cooks, or what but I wanted to walk out after waiting 30 minutes for a torta.   Good thing there's Super Mex's else where."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but nothing too special.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with the chefs spicy red sauce.  Portions were good, lots of food I couldn't eat it all.  I also like the tortilla chips and beans and salsa.  Prices are a bit high when compared to quality.  Not that it wasn't good, but for the prices I expect it to be better than just average."}
{"text":"Can't beat the prices here.  Love the chips and salsa.  Margarita's are good.  Always get seated right away.  Refies are just okay.  Always friendly service."}
{"text":"This place was great. Awesome atmosphere, cheap prices, and great build-your-own meal selection. Also loved the refried beans with chips and salsa as well. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We eat here on a non-regular basis, but every time we do, it's been pretty consistent.   We both ordered the chicken chimichangas tonight. For $10.95, you get a great serving. We both needed to-go boxes and will have a full meal for lunch tomorrow. You get 2 chimi's, rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole.   The drinks are a little pricey at $2.25 for a glass of soda.   The service was ok. It is usually hit and miss. Tonight it was mostly good. We didn't wait for any refills, the server was polite and attentive. We did, however, get our order messed up a little. We asked for no guac and no sour cream on one dish. It was a minor mix up, but still a lack of attention to detail. If either of us were allergic, it would have been a bigger deal.   Either way, we like the place and go here from time to time. We'll go again, regardless."}
{"text":"Very liberal with the salt in he carnitas but overall not bad food. Got the super burrito and it was a good amount of food for the money"}
{"text":"If you are looking for real Mexican food don't waste your money here . Roberto's has more authentic and tastier food. Burritos are 75% beans 25%  meat and bland. Spend your money at Casa Don Juan in the downtown area instead. That's probably the best Mexican food that this SoCali girl has found in LV... Cabo at Red Rock is better too...overall Super Mex was Super Disappointing   PS - be prepared to have them take your smartphone to the bar cashier to redeem your groupon... Super Disturbing to have someone take my open phone out of my sight :-/"}
{"text":"Meh... It's more like OK Mex instead of Super Mex. Nothing bad about the place, just nothing \"super\" about it.  The Super Mex Margarita is pretty good, so that alone might be reason to come here if you weren't necessarily looking to eat."}
{"text":"We went late, so maybe the chef was having an off night.   It was pretty busy despite how late it was, but it seemed there was only one girl running the entire bar and restaurant area by herself. She was darting all over the place. That being the case, it often took quite awhile for her to come back around. Our waters were drained and salsa emptied and then we just waited around for her. To her credit, she was pleasant when she was around.   I ordered the chile relleno and a shrimp taco a la carte, while the boy ordered the mixed fajitas [chicken & steak]. When the food arrived, the fajita meat was super BLAND. The description said it had a spicy kick, but it just tasted like lightly salted chicken. It was thoroughly disappointing and not worth the $13-14 they wanted for it. We sent it back and ate the rice and beans in the tortillas instead.   My shrimp taco was decent, but nothing to get excited for either. On the plus side, they were bigger than I expected and NOT coated in batter. I like my shrimp naked, so that much was good.   Overall, a forgettable meal. Open 24 hours, but so is Roberto's and Pepe's Tacos."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I grew up in southern California and I think I know a little something about mexican food.  This place rocks!  The food is inexpensive and they give you huge portions.  The chips are always fresh and the salsa is great.  The burritoes are big and tasty.  I wish I could live in San Diego and eat here every day.  I lived in Henderson for 8 months and I was a regular here.  This is a must stop in for me every time I visit Vegas.  Yummmy"}
{"text":"First time I came here, it sucked so bad I told myself I didn't want to come back. Food was terrible and unappetizing. BUT my boyfriend wanted to come back here for Happy Hour so I grudgingly went. We both got margaritas which were OK, nothing awesome but what did we expect for cheap-o margaritas. Chips and salsa never disappoint and they are served with some yummy beans as well. I did noticed, however, that they updated their menu (not updated on their website yet) and I decided to try one of the new items. They have a new taco platter that you can get either as an appetizer or as an entree. Getting it as an entree means you get a side of rice and beans and two tacos. HOLY CRAP THESE TACOS WERE AWESOME! They give you a choice of either chicken or steak and I asked if I could do one chicken and one steak and they said yes. So out comes our tacos and they were topped with chorizo and some crumbled queso fresco. Was I in the same place I came before?? The quality of the food was great and nothing like the rubbery little pieces I was served before. Rice and beans were good too. I want to come back and try the other new menu items they have. Hopefully they are good too."}
{"text":"The burrito was salty and so was the enchilada that my husband had. It looked nice enough inside and our server was very nice but the food didn't do anything for me or my husband. There are better Mexican food places in the area and I suggest you explore them."}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada nachos, we were maybe only the 2nd customer in the place. It took forever to receive our food and when we did they forgot our beans inside the nachos (who does that?) and got the order wrong. I looked forward to these cause it's all I've ordered in the past, it was nothing like before. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoy the patio dining here. The mountain view is beautiful when the sun is going down which is about the time happy hour is winding down as well. The same waiter (I didn't get his name) has served my table several times and he is topnotch. It's a good place to have a drink and relax.  I like the green rice and boiled whole pinto beans. It's a lighter option to the standard sides of beans and rice offered at most Mexican restaurants. I don't usually order appetizers here. The entree portions are large and they bring out some really yummy chips and salsa to start making the apps unnecessary. The fajitas are large enough to share or take home and reheat for lunch the next day. They offer a nice selection of Mexican beers on tap. Which I like because I prefer draft to bottled brew."}
{"text":"Using a buy one get one from the mail. We eat here at least 2 times a month with this coupon. You get a lot of food for the price. The service is always good also. They get a little busy for dinner but lunch is always kinda slow."}
{"text":"Stale chips, food under seasoned and their bathrooms smell horrible no thanks Super Mex................................."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because of its close proximity to my casa & they have a Groupon this week! Duh. When I saw someone's picture of a Mexican Pizza, I was sold. The chips & salsa were decent (especially considering their free-ness), but everything else was very sub-par compared to other Mexican restaurants. I let my husband handle the ordering because he always complains about the \"weird\" stuff I order, so we got the Mexican pizza & surprisingly, you can choose the protein that goes inside! He chose the shredded beef since I've seen many good reviews for it, as well as the huge Super Mex carnitas burrito.   When I was a kid, I used to LOVE the Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell. I thought it was the best thing ever, so crispy & fatty & what not. The Mexican pizza looked great, until I tried to get a piece. It was so soggy I had to use two forks to pick it up and we all had to eat it with a knife & fork because we couldn't pick it up like the Mexican pizza of my childhood. In hind sight, I think that the shredded beef may not have been the best choice to go on a Mexican pizza because it's usually swimming in juice right before they ladel it. I MAY try this again with steak next time (if there is one), or just something that's not so watery. Another problem I had with it was that some of the chunks of shredded beef were WAY too big. I had one that was 2in. x 2in. Who wants a piece of beef that huge in a fallen apart Mexican pizza? Not me! I want my beef actually shredded thanks, not the cow delivered to me to shred.   The carnitas burrito was pretty gross. My favorite carnitas is from the Amigos Tacos, not far from here, but this carnitas was shredded, dry, and chewy. Wamp. They also put crappy iceberg lettuce in their burritos which I should have read and asked for them to exclude. I think iceberg lettuce has a crappy flavor when combined with Mexican food because it tastes so bitter. They just don't go together. So, bill pre-Groupon was $22. Not bad considering the amount of food we got. We actually brought home the majority of the burrito which is surprising because I'm usually a food disposal and I never had left overs, but unfortunately, I didn't think any of this food was worth the calories so I didn't do my standard over-eating. Hey, I guess this place is great if you're on a diet, because you won't have too much that's edible and enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a Mexican coworker and it doesn't disappoint. The salsa and bean dip are fantastic, I could make a meal from the chips and dips alone! Love the low fat green rice and the choice of sauces - mole is a good one. Will keep returning to this gem of a place!"}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life. Got food poisoning from a pork burrito and was sick all day. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of food and a special menu right now a 4.99 pick one item special.  We eat here a lot and the food and salsa is great.  They are understaffed though and the service is sometime slow.  But you cant beat the price for the food you get."}
{"text":"meh. That's the best way to describe this place. Not the worst food out there but definitely not great. I tried the chicken chimichanga. It was perfectly fried, with the outside nice and crispy. But the chicken inside was so bone dry and tasteless that I could barely eat it. The service was decent. Our waitress was friendly and stopped by often to check on us. But the food was just so blah.  This is a totally uninspired review for a totally uninspiring restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food. The carne asada burrito (super mex style) is exquisite. The chips are great,served promptly and with a wonderful bean dip (upon request). The bar side has friendly and attentive bartenders who make you enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"I'm not that hard to please at all, but I wasn't impressed from the minute I stepped foot in this restaurant. I can't even list one positive thing about my experience here. Upon arrival, we waited for a brief few minutes, then we were seated at a dirty table. The table was sticky and disgusting, the menus had food smeared on them, there was leftover fork sitting at our table, the carpet looked dirty, and it was just so dim in there. Based on the decors, filthiness, darkness and filthy menu, I instantly thought of the food network show \"Restaurant Takeover\" and thought  we should just turn around and exit now, but I figured I'd give the food a chance. Bad idea.  Our waiter was terrible... terrible... just terrible... did I mention terrible? gosh, it was terrible!! He came by and said he'd be right with us to take our drinks order, 10 minutes later, he comes to take our drink order and we were already ready to order so we just ordered our meals as well. I got the chicken fajitas and hubs got the beef burrito... took awhile, but whatever, I'm in no hurry.  Finally, we get our food and we realized we were never given fork or knife or napkins, so we patiently waited... and waited... and waited... finally decided to get up and find someone to ask for our silverware and napkins since no one obviously cared to come our way. I'm not a great cook, but my chicken fajitas are 10 times better than theirs. The chicken was flavorless and bland. I ordered both flour and corn tortillas and I only got corn. My husbands burrito consisted of BIG chunks of beef... and I mean chunks. He ate about a fourth of it, and said it was too gross for his liking. My husband drank his entire glass of pepsi and was never offered a refill. Our waiter never once came by to see how things were or offer us anything. When we were done eating, we sat there patiently again, waiting. 10 minutes later someone takes our plates, and another 10 minutes later the waiter finally comes to ask if we needed anything... well gee, the check would be great, get me the eff out of here!"}
{"text":"We kept our menu simple, started off with chips and salsa, main dishes were carne asada and a veggie burrito.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.  The seasonings were lacking or salty, the beans had the too smooth lardy texture, and salsa was a bit weak.  I've only tried the restaurant once, so I'll give it another try and leave it at that for now..."}
{"text":"So Sat. night rolls around and this mom wanted to go out to eat instead of cooking and doing dishes. We decided to give Super Mex (the South Durango location) a try and we were kinda delighted and surprised all at the same time. The food and margarita quality is what pleased us the most. The food was tasty. I tried an item from their \"Lite\" menu, a soft chicken taco with green rice and beans, not refried, but a healthier version, and it was delish. My guy had the chicken enchilda, also from the \"Lite\" menu and he enjoyed his plate also. Actually he cleaned his plate and their was nothing left. The margaritas where good, and at $5.50/$5.75 each, who can complain. We even ordered a second round because they were that well priced. Overall we will be returning to Super Mex when we are craving Mexican food. Service was good, but not great. Give them a try if u can. Great for families, as we took our 16 month old with us and he enjoyed the complimentary bean dip and chips :)"}
{"text":"Wow...and not a good wow. Terrible guacamole and stale chips. Service was below average as I sat with an empty glass for 2/3 of my meal. Chicken quesadillas were not cooked and ceviche was best part, but again, chips we stale so nothing good to compliment the ceviche. Bumma!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. Definitely one of the better Mexican food places in Las Vegas. But as is the case with most of the Mexican restaurants in town, the food lacks a taste of freshness."}
{"text":"Four stars for the lobster enchiladas ($16.95) and refillable horchata - other than that, atmosphere was relatively loud, service was not bad but also not terribly attentive, oh..... and I didn't see any actual Mexicans.   I'm usually wary of ethnic eateries not frequented by people of said ethnicity, but at the same time I gotta remember this is Las Vegas - I'm sure half the people eating there were from out of town anyway."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying this restaurant is visually very appealing, but when the food arrives it's like finding out Santa is not real- every time. Seriously, the salsa was so watered down I bet a baby could drink it out of a bottle and not flinch. Super Mex, I want to love you. Your prices are really reasonable, the staff friendly, but it all comes down to the undesirable food. Here's the scoop on what I've tried: Chicken Chimichanga-  Now the meat is moist and flavorful, but the burro doesn't seem crispy enough and the toppings are bland. Even trying to put everything on my plate on my fork at once cannot save this dish. Guacomole- I had everyone at the table try this and we agree this cannot be fresh. It tastes just as watered down as the salsa! Steak Fajitas- Chewy meat chunks, but good veggies Cheese Enchilada- This was the only selection I mildy enjoyed. Snaps for that Super Mex Overall, what is a Mexican restaurant without a decent salsa and guacamole? Simply not a fan, amigo."}
{"text":"went downhill rather fast over the past 3 years, hard stale cold chips, extremely week Margaritas, but good waitstaff, very attentive. food not really cheap either."}
{"text":"Some great Americanized Mexican good with an awesome happy hour.  Decided to check out supermex after a couple friends kept telling me about how good the food was. I had always thought it was like a Mexican themed bar/gaming hall, but it turns out that its actually a full service restaurant and cantina.  We came in during happy hour and were surprised to see such an extensive offering of HH dishes. Pretty much their entire appetizer menu is half off with a few exceptions. We ordered the street tacos, nachos, and carne asada fries. Keep in mind, that the place can get pretty packed during the HH especially if there is a game going on,  The street tacos were perfect. Lately, I have noticed alot of 'street taco' places pop which offer a tiny taco with a small portion of meat on a small corn tortailla. Here, you actually get some real street tacos. 3 big tacos topped with a bunch of meat (can't go wrong with the chicken or carne asada) along with a bunch of feta (i think) cheese and salsa. For about 5 bucks during HH it's a steal.  The nachos/fries were pretty standard and actually interchangeable. They were essentially the same dish one with chips, the other with fries. Nothing special but not bad either.  One of the cool things about the place is that they actually bring you unlimited chips (which are actually just small tortillas fried and served whole) with a variety of salsas and bean dip which ends up being a meal itself.   The serve was great despite being so busy and the place is actually pretty nice. If you looking for some good mexican food, look no further."}
{"text":"I love going for breakfast. Huevos rancheros is one of my favorites. Service is on the slow side. None of the servers have a smile on their face and it takes forever to get your check. Hostess is always in the back and you can stand at the front without anyone acknowledging you. Managers never seem to pitch in and help. Furniture needs to be reupholstered. Go for the food but nothing else."}
{"text":"I just ate here with my family and so far, as I write this, my wife threw up twice. My eldest son ordered chicken nuggets from the kids' menu and they gave him two (2). My youngest son ordered the 'mexican pizza' and said, \"I'm not eating this, it smells funny.\" I was supposed to get three shrimp enchiladas. They buried it under lettuce and there was one, cut in half and the shrimp was not cleaned. The guacamole appetizer was a complete disaster and really an insult with few chips and poorly prepared. This was the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. The service was somewhat friendly, but incredibly slow.  This was a shock to me because friends enjoy this place. There is so much better in Las Vegas. Don't take the chance."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to go! It's near home and the service is outstanding. Never had a bad experience here. My husband orders the chicken quesadilla, I get the chicken fajitas, and we start with the fresh made guacamole..... the food here is addicting! They know our order every time we go and I look forward to going here as often as possible."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon for Super Mex.  I can't belive I never knew about this place.   It's not a fancy place, we got a seat right away.  The waitress sat us down, and  took our drink order.  Ok, I can sometimes be typical, I wanted a strawberry Margrarita, then she started rolling off other flavors.....Whoa, hold up, wait a minute.  My husband isn't even a Margarita kinda guy, but she mentioned a blue something margarita on the rocks, that sounded really good.  So My husband ordered that.  I decided to go with the Mango Margarita.  Well, she thought I was going to stick with the strawberry margarita, so she brought that out?  I reminded her I wanted the Mango Margarita!  Oh...she forgot, so she gave me the strawberry one on the house.  It was good, I prefered the mango over the strawberry, but I really liked the blue one my hus band got on the rocks!  I'm not an on the rocks kinda gal either, but it was awsome. The chips and dip!  OMG, I've never been to a place where they fry the whole corn tortilla!  yea, the whole round thing!  lol  You get bean and pico de galo.  Not bad.  My husband order a burito, it was huge, with this green looking guacamole on the  side, but don't let the looks of the guacamole, fool you!  It was good!  I order the combo plate.  Rice beans, tamale, and enchillada, all shreadded beef.  I really didn't think I was going to like the tamale...yep, another shocker!  I really liked it, the rice and beans were on point.  This place is open 24 hrs, we will be back."}
{"text":"Super Mex isn't the greatest Mexican joint in Vegas, but it's my go-to place when it's late and I don't feel like dropping $20 on a meal.  It's cheap, fast, and good.  Plus, it's open 24 hours.  When I first moved to Vegas from Ohio, I was so pumped because I thought all the Mexican places here would be better than what I was used to.  You know, because Further West+Further South=Awesome Mexican Food.  While I have been fairly disappointed on this front, Super Mex is always a good bet when I'm feeling like having the basics."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican place ever!!!! Their chicken is horrible pink not fully cooked!!! Had the chicken enchilada 's and had horrible food poisoning out both ends. The bartender was rude! The servers were nice but the service sucked, I came in there when it was completely dead and waited hours for my food to arrive. You would think they would give good quality service when they don't have many costumers in there. The salsa dip and the beans were good but the rest of the food made me lose my hunger. It was very expensive for the shitty service and food for the same price go to the best Mexican restaurant Lindo michoacan!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   Great Tex Mex food for sure!   They have the best shredded beef tacos in all of Vegas, yes they do. I welcome you to try them for yourself!!!   Also their enchiladas are yummy!   Portion size is good, always leave full!   The atmosphere is slightly dark and cozy, also the service is always consistently good!   Love the free basket of fried whole corn tortillas and salsa and bean dip! Yummo!   Check this place out you won't be disappointed!!!   They also have a Cantina for alcohol with gaming as well."}
{"text":"I can't say how the food was because the kitchen was closed when we tried to eat at Supermex today (12/24/2012) at 2:15PM.  The bar was open, but no food service.  The server turned us away with an apology."}
{"text":"I asked server for best burrito they have. She told me it was there Carnitas Suer Mex Green Chili Burrito, so that's what I ordered. The size way impressive, almost a meal for two. If that was the best burrito on the menu I would hate to have the other ones. There was a good amount of pork in burrito but was very plain. fished about half of the burrito then figured I would just finish the meat. opened up the burrito but it was all gone, good thing i didn't start with the other half. Probably won't go there again. Salsa and chips are to be expected but having a no taste and no heat salsa as your only option was disappointing as well. Person who was with me said the Shrimp Tacos were great. so if I do go back maybe I will give them a try."}
{"text":"my favorite Mex food hands down. As good as the original in Long Beach Cali. Check out happy hour 3-6. Great selection of tequila. Olaa!"}
{"text":"Really disliked my meal.  Considering the bar was set pretty high by an amazing Mexican restaurant I went to in Chicago (who's name escapes me!!), I was really disappointed.  No need to visit again."}
{"text":"I can only review the lite menu, because that is all we ordered:   Lettuce Wraps with Chicken Shredded dark meat chicken and leafs of lettuce. That is it. The chicken wasn't that bad but it definitely wasn't healthy. The lettuce was old and wilted, I had to throw it out.  Whole Wheat Quesadilla with Chicken Whole wheat tortilla with shredded chicken and low fat cheese. It didn't taste healthy, but it didn't taste good either. Really greasy. Probably the best out of what we ordered.  2 Low Carb Tacos-1 Chicken and 1 Beef Same chicken as before. The tortilla was supposedly low carb, it was hard to tell how it tasted because it was soaked in grease. The beef was inedible! Mushy, super salty, I couldn't put my finger on the taste, but I almost threw up. We threw it away.   The lettuce wraps and taco combo came with a side of veggies of mushrooms, onions, and zucchini. The onions were pretty good, like they were pickled in vinegar. We didn't eat the other veggies because they had been cooked in either oil or butter.  We ended up with something that looked like a tostada, we didn't order it. The chicken on it was chunks of white breast meat, it tasted pretty good. That chicken seemed healthier than the shredded.  There is no way we would go back."}
{"text":"I stopped here yesterday to use a Groupon that was expiring soon.  The restaurant is a small area but quite cozy and pleasant.    Instead of chips and salsa, they bring you a nice basket of fried tortillas and bean dip with a small bowl of a little spicy salsa.  You break the tortillas as you want and dip.    I ordered the soup of the day which was chicken tortilla soup.  It was a tomato based soup with lots of cheese and real chicken with nice tortilla strips.  It was a thicker soup-quite flavorful and something I'd get again.  A bowl of this soup in the winter would be great!  For my main course, I got the Chicken Sarandeado, a grilled chicken breast with their \"special spices.\"  With the platter came rice, pico, some guacamole, and refried beans.  This was another tasty dish for Super Mex.    For dessert, I got the fried ice cream.  It didn't appear as if this ice cream had ever been near a fryer but it was good.  It was simply a ball of vanilla ice cream that had been rolled in a small amount of coating and then frozen.  It was placed in a sweetened tortilla basket and decorated with whipped cream, and some strawberry and chocolate syrup.  Mind you, it was a decadent ending to my meal, but it was not fried as far as I could tell.  I was tempted to give the place 4 stars but I had one BIG hangup with the service.  For the most part, it was very good.  However, I had just started to eat my soup when a server appeared with my main course and set it down.  Why do you do this?  It seems to happen more in Tex-Mex places than anywhere else.  Cabo at Red Rock was notorious for this.  Can't they do courses like a normal restaurant?"}
{"text":"Second visit and the food was terrific.  A lunch menu of specials gave lots of choices for $5.55 and the appetizers are all half price between 3 p.m. & 6 p.m.  We split the tacos (3), I had a super burrito and Matt had the taco salad.  Two big Wows,  really delicious and a take-home bag of left-overs. Be warned though,  if you sit in the bar you may encounter smokers. The dinning room is closed @ lunch but there's a dining area off the bar if 2nd hand smoke impacts your taste buds too. I hope you're fortunate enough to get Gretchen as your waitress. She's great. Upgraded rating since our last visit.  Recommend"}
{"text":"Surprisingly A-OK for this random joint.    The chips and salsa were the best part.  Good salsa.    The menu was pretty large.  Lots of options and combos and such.  The food was pretty standard for reasonably priced \"american\" Mexican.    The fish taco was good.  Flavorful creamy chipotle sauce.    Nothing will knock your socks off but definitely a decent meal for the price.  The place is cute too."}
{"text":"BLAND!!! No flavor in anything. Don't waste the walk from your car inside. I've had better Mexican at Taco Bell. The best part of the meal was my diet soda. After our plates were cleared it took over 20 mins for the waiter to bring our check. Not recommend AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Super Mex, I've got to be honest.  I judged you.  Hard.  I moved in across the street months ago and started laughing at your ridiculous name.  I claimed that no 24 hour establishment could possibly serve good mexican food.  And I was totally ignorant of your Super Super happy hour.  I have seen the error of my ways.  Happy hour is 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. (Think it's only good in the bar area)  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly.  I ordered the Tacos Tijuana appetizer.  Three tacos with char-grilled chicken and spicy chorizo.  Very good and well worth the $3.95 happy hour price.  The chips and salsa was just okay.  Usually mediocre chips and salsa would cause me to look elsewhere for my mexican fix.  But $2 margaritas and 1/2 appetizers will keep me coming back for more Super Mex happy hour.  Super Mex, I'm glad I finally made your accquaintance."}
{"text":"For what it is - a cheap Mexican restaurant - this place gets 4 stars. I have been going here for the past 4 days for lunch and I sit at the bar. The staff is really friendly.  their food is great, and that $4.99 menu is fantastic - no skimping on portions here! Their chips are great, but I don't think they serve beans any longer with them.... at least not at the bar for the times I went. The salsa is muy authentico!!  Super Mex is a hidden gem for a cheap, full-portioned, and tasty meal."}
{"text":"We really like Super Mex.  It has pretty decent Tex Mex offerings and a pretty large menu.  They even have a discounted and a \"lite\" menu, for even more options.  You are bound to find something you like here.  We started going to Super Mex when I found a few buy one get one coupons from the Vegas Entertainment book.  I love a good coupon and the place was around the corner from where hubby works, so of course we had to go.  I am so happy we went too because the food is pretty yummy!  It is good, solid Tex Mex style food at reasonable prices.  Our favorite dishes are the chimichangas, gigantic burritos, tacos, and the flautas.   I actually get the chimi 8 out of 10 times that we go because they are so addictive!  You can even get them enchilada style, meaning covered in red enchilada sauce and cheese, which is simply AMAZING!  My hubby is the same way with the tacos.  Yummy!  On top of the menu items, you also get chips, salsa, and bean dip.  The chips are actually tostadas that you break apart and scoop the yumminess onto.  The salsa at Super Mex is really good too.  It doesn't taste like your average salsa from other places.  It is darker in color and has different layers of flavor.  Tasty!  And the bean dip rocks.  I usually finished it off before my hubby and daughter can even get a bite.  Hey, you snooze, you lose when there is bean dip on the table next to me!  The service here is hit and miss though.  Sometimes you get awesome service and sometimes not.  That is why I wen with 3 stars.  The food is easily 4 stars and is pretty consistent in my opinion.  So see you at Super Mex.  I will be the one stuffing my face with a chimichanga!"}
{"text":"Super Mex has become a family favorite for us.  The meals are good sized and reasonably priced.  They have no problems with special requests, which is nice since my daughter is a picky eater! Sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but the wait staff is generally friendly."}
{"text":"The building itself is nothing special. The service is pretty bad most of the time. But, for the price, the food is really good. The Super Mex margarita is worth going there for. I'm a huge relleno fan and theirs is the best I've had. Beware: if you order extra condiments, like sour cream, they may not let you know but an extra charge will show up on your bill."}
{"text":"It was always good when I came here to eat in the years earlier, but when I came here with my husband, he just thought it was ok. The atmosphere is really nice- don't let the strip mall locale or the funny name fool you. There is a To-Go entrance and a regular dine-in entrance. There is bar seating, tables, and booths. The service was really good. It was a busy restaurant with quite a few patrons every time I came here.  I always got the carne asada plate- it was deliciously seasoned and pretty big- never disappointed me, ever. I should add that I am not a meat & potatoes person, so for me to order, red meat, is saying something. I did take home leftovers (no complaints here). I should also mention that this place was introduced to me by my then BF, who was Mexican.   Since it was just ok for my husband, I don't believe that I will be coming here anytime soon unless I meet one of my girlfriends here for dinner. Where my girls at?"}
{"text":"Guacamole: Avocado was diced rather than mashed. I could understand if this was a California fusion type of restaurant but it's MEXICAN, can I get some authentic guac?   Service was OK. Nothing to rave about.   My son and I shared the Flautas & Chimichangas. I wish there was more meat than wrap on the Chimichangas. The wrap was so thick that it didn't cook all the way through and became uber chewy and to top it off it was GREASY. I don't really know anyone that likes to have to tilt their plate so to gather the grease on one side so not to make my food soggy... Anyone out there?   My husband enjoyed his Fajitas and even mentioned that the price was pretty good considering what the norm for the dish is.   Going to Roberto's is much more satisfying to me if i want some real Mexican Food... I'm from SoCal and I've been to Mexico so I pretty much have a standard and they didn't really meet them."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place. I've been here a few times during their lunch rush and never had to wait for a table for longer than a few minutes. The food is decent and the price is right. Service if friendly and free fresh chips and salsa for snacking while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"awe come-on 3 stars??  really?  Being from Long Beach California I enjoy super mex when im home all the time.  Was pleasantly surprised when I drove by on Durango and saw that they had opened one up in Las Vegas.  So had to go in!    Authentic mexican food that is great tasting and fattening.  Its an awesome place, and I've been to a ton, of Mexican restaurants.  Every time I go to a Mexican restaurant I usually end up getting some sort of combo platter.  Got their soft shell tacos with rice and beans.  I love their taco meat, it is really seasoned well and juicy.  Doesn't have the texture of a dry taco.  I hate those!    Super mex is definitely not the finest dining in Las Vegas BUT, it is great authentic mexican for a low price.  It doesn't get any better than this place!  Glad they are expanding."}
{"text":"In a town that's hard to find good Mexican food, Super Mex is one of the better choices.  The staff are nice and accommodating, the chips and salsa plentiful.  The carnitas are good but missing the \"crusty\" bits. The chili relleno was tasty. My family enjoyed their orders of tacos and taco salad.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"I will say this for Super Mex: they're consistent. They're nothing spectacular, and the service is sometimes a bit lackluster, but for reasonably inexpensive Mexican food, 24 hours a day, they definitely do the trick! Their fajitas are actually quite good, and both the cheese enchiladas and chimichangas are good standby items."}
{"text":"Although I strongly prefer Tex-Mex over Cali-Mex, the food here isn't bad.  I ordered take out tonight, and they only gave me half of my order... Hopefully that was a one-time oversight, but I'd still recommend checking your order carefully before you leave."}
{"text":"We love this place. If you love the taste of south of the border food, you will too. Give it a try and I am sure you will make it a regular dining place."}
{"text":"This was generally my last stop of the night when I would go out and I really was not impressed.  This could easily be due to the time that I would come here - fresh food can be elusive after midnight.  The bar staff seems generally disgruntled.  They are more that willing to discuss the owner's (ineffective) marketing strategies, generally unsolicited.  The food is edible and prices are manageable, but it is not the type of quality that would bring me back.  Maybe a little staff turn over and a visit earlier in the day would increase my review, but based on my experiences 2-stars is very fair."}
{"text":"Very thing about this place is great, EXCEPT the service. Every time I go they always only have 1 waitress who you have to ask to order, u have to ask for a drink it's pathetic and sad. I'm making the drive to the sunset location from now on where they have the best service!"}
{"text":"This place is super duper diddly aweeeesssome.  I work right across the street from this place and always order the cheese enchilada.  Omg they are so good. The restaurant is very clean and organized if you go from like 1pm after they have the restaurant closed down, but you can still order from the bar.  The bar is pretty cool too. The bartender is a looker. I like to sneak over on my lunch breaks and have a few. Even if you just order drinks they will give you tortillas and salsa which is really good.  Prices at this place are decent. The staff is really friendly.  Try the cheese enchiladas..."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat Mexican food.. The place gone down, the service is bad as well as the food. They raised the prices and the food was either burnt or half cook."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food in town, but I'm a fan of their lunch specials. Cheap and fast, great for a working lunch. I love their bean dip, salsa and chips as well! I'd recommend it if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local Mexican restaurant.  The food is good & reasonably priced, the SuperMex margaritas are quite tasty & the service is always good.  This is a great local spot for a tasty quick dinner & a drink or two."}
{"text":"My bf had gone to watch a bball game @ PT's and we should have just eaten their half priced pizza there, very good and crispy by the way. Well he ordered a wet burrito, which he said was just ok, nothing to write home about. The chips and salsa were ok. I ordered mole enchiladas. and you tire of the sweet taste after awhile. Mole should have spice, when there is none it tastes, well ... WRONG. I honestly can say I didnt' hate it but I didnt finish my food and let my bf pick apart the rest of it for me. With so many other choices I dont think I'd go there again.  They got nothing on Rubio's or Baja Fresh, and those arent exactly \"authentic\" either. also as a note, they dont serve menudo. If they did I'd have ordered that... but so far Viva Michoacan is the best one i've tasted in town."}
{"text":"This place is different. Has good salsa, recently started serving them with refried beans. \"chips and salsa\" are really tostada shells and salsa...no prob  Really good shrimp tacos, the best I've had.  Service is so so, usually can find a seat, not a server. Sometimes I feel like the cook is going to come out and take my order."}
{"text":"A neighborhood joint that we pass by all the time.  Coupons for this place come all the time, so we figure we may as well give it a go.  The restaurant is split up into two sections - dining in establishment on the left, bar area o the right.    They start you off with tortilla chips, salsa, and a bean dip while they get your drink orders in.  The Husband ordered the Mexican Pizza (Large $10.45).  It's your choice of protein with all the standard fixings of Mexican food piled onto a crispy tortilla.    I went for the Combination Plate (3 Items for $9.95), and chose an  enchilada, tamale, and soft taco.  For the most part, you can choose your own filling (a few cost extra) and sauce on them.  With it, you get rice and beans.    When the order came out, we thought they were both pretty generous.  Unfortunately for me, the requested low-fat green cilantro rice and low-fat boiled pinto beans were not replacing the red rice and refried beans I had asked for.  The waiter immediately took it back and they fixed the problem.  (Not sure if it was the waiter's fault or the kitchen's fault, but it was done quickly without too much drama.)  My enchilada and tamale were both tasty, although the chicken soft taco was a bit dry.  That was probably my least favorite part of the dish.  It made for good leftovers the next day.  They also have a Lite Menu, specials for those 60 years and older, gaming promos, and more.  Service was fine. It wasn't too busy on a weekday for lunch, so no real problems there.  Overall, it's a decent place for lunch when you want some Mexican food.  It helps when you find those BOGO coupons that come along though!"}
{"text":"Just a quick one. The food is pretty good but the service is bad. I have gone 3 times and endured terrible service for the food, every time swearing I won't come back. LOL If you can stand the bad service the food is worth it or maybe not. Coin flip decision at best."}
{"text":"Food was decent but the service was terrible. Do not go to this place if you have a group larger than 4 people. They refused to split our checks. The whole process of paying our bill took as long as it did for us to eat! WILL NOT be coming back"}
{"text":"Two words.  FREAKIN AWESOME. Super Mex is a Sunday tradition now.  My daughter and I always get the Chicken Taco salad and it has never failed us.  Always cooked and put together perfectly.  The Bloody Marys are super good too.  We've never had a complaint with the service.  Delicious and perfect every time."}
{"text":"I have been to Super Mex before but it has been a couple of years. I ordered the super burrito on the value menu and my husband ordered the enchilada rice and bean plate also off their value menu.. We both had margaritas. I had banana which was really pretty good. My husband had a chicken enchilada that he said was very good. My burrito was tasty except that it had no cheese. No cheese anywhere. My husband's plate had cheese. I missed the cheese!  I asked the server and she told me that cheese is an extra cost. I have never been to Mexican restaurant that charged for extra cheese! We also had a problem when paying. The server messed up our check by charging the wrong table to our credit card which she corrected and was very apologetic. Mistakes happen so that was no big deal. I probably will return but I will order off the regular menu."}
{"text":"Usually pretty quiet inside. The kitchen is 24 hours. The food is always hot and the service is usually decent. My favorite thing about this place is that I can get Mexican food 24-7."}
{"text":"Awful service, just okay food.  Ordered fajitas which came with only 3 tortillas.  Asked for more.  When I got the bill I saw they charged  .70 cents for extra tortillas.  They said it was the Managers decision to charge for additional tortillas. I know .70 cents but it's the principal.  The guacamole that came with condiment plate for the fajitas was tasteless. Processed store bought slime,  Makes my stomach queasy just thinking about it.   The chicken rice bowl was decent.  Had to flag a waitress down every time we needed something and they were not short on help and were not busy.  Overall unfriendly service.  When we came in they were all gathered around the hostess desk chatting it up.  One actually sitting on the hostess stand. The people in the booth next to us arrived after us and got their food first.  They had 5 people and we had 2.  I hate to say this but they were Hispanic and knew one of the waitresses because she sat at their table for while and a fun time. Had lunch at Bonito Michoacan on S. Decatur today and the food was far more superior.  Employees were friendly and the service was spot on and they had a full house."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure why it was so dark in Super Mex.   Thematically, I don't think of American-Mexican restaurant food as \"brooding.\"  However, it was a good choice for a late-shift lunch break, as it was inexpensive, well-portioned and filling.  I think it came out (financially and serviced) about as well as it would have been at a grab-and-dash place like Roberto's, and they weren't skimpy on the free chips.     But who turned the lights out?"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Open 24-7!!! You have to love the 4.75 menu and the staff!! I didn't go there for about 3 months and they still remembered my order!!! The waiter at night looks like Doug from king of queens.. The bean dip and salsa it to die for!!! Love, love, love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to the one on Sunset, first exp here. Very cozy and comfortable in the restaurant section..bar laid back w/ lots of video going.  Food is pretty much the same..had a combo plate. enchildas were good...nice that you get a choice of sauces to blend. Chile Relanos..nice very mild, nice crunch went you bit into them, lots of filling. Food is not high end...great local place..chips, salsa, bean dip..great so if the meal doesnt satisfy...you have back up.....enjoy.."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate when I moved to Vegas about ten years ago. I fell in love and have been back hundreds of time since.  Where to start...  The chips and salsa are the best I have ever had. The flavors are amazing. I have considered on more than one occasion paying one of the line cooks to make a bucket for me. The guacamole is amazing as well. Fresh, chunky, and creamy with great flavor.  I have to say I haven't explored the menu too much. I have ordered the same dish every visit with maybe a half-dozen exceptions. Their carnitas are second to none. Cooked perfectly, their version of preparing this meat is unparalleled by anyone I have seen anywhere.  I order a slightly different version: 3 item combo of all carnitas tacos : crispy corn tortilla instead of flour : only lettuce, cheese, and red sauce as topping.  I believe I have perfected this order and if you are fortunate enough to give it a try I challenge you not pass out in ecstasy (ok, maybe you won't pass out, but it' pretty damn good).  My death row meal would probably be this place. Go east here now!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch at 2:30, the only ones in the place, service was okay, ordered a Modelo draft and a super burrito. The Bartender wasn't sure what was on it but went ahead and ordered anyway. it came out luke warm. No sals and very bland. The order of Guacamole was strange in comparison to any other guac I have ordered and it was bland too. Wont be back"}
{"text":"Nope, no way, never again. This is probably the 5th time we've been here and I've walked away disappointed every time. The customers that we saw eating tonight are a great example of what kind of food and who it's prepared for, old, white people who don't know what Mexican food is and don't like anything with flavor or picante. From the chips & flavorless salsa to the bland carnitas burrito I really didn't care for anything that we had. Our waitress was pleasant and we did get pretty good service but outside of that I'd be headed to a lot of other places before I go back here again. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in almost 8 years. 8 years! I recently moved back to the area and thought I'd make another visit. I am so glad that I did, because I remembered why I used to come here 8 years ago.  The staff is very friendly. Brought my mom in and we were seated immediately despite a busy lunch crowd. We were presented with chips with salsa and refried beans. The chips are round and oversized and very good. We almost ate them all before we could order! Had to slow down to save room for the main course.  I ordered the grilled vegetable burrito and mom ordered the shredded beef taco salad. The grilled veggie burrito? OMG was is it good! I believe this is what I ordered 8 years ago and absolutely loved! Mom was a huge fan of her taco salad as well. The portions are so oversized that it's impossible to complete. That's never a bad thing, especially when you can take home leftovers.  I wil most definitely make certain that it will not be another 8 years before I come back to this place. This is by far the best Mexican food I've had in a long while, and I've tried a few of the other big names and Ma and Pop spots. I highly recommend you give it a shot. You'll be surprised!"}
{"text":"For the price, you really can't do much better. The staff is nice, the food is good & the prices are reasonable. Also, their salsa is super yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Massively surprised at how yummy this place is.  I really thought it would be some cheap dump with food that would make Chipolte seem like a gourmet dinner.    But man - the food actually seems like it is homemade and by someone that cares.  I'm not an expert on authentic Mexican, but I know what tastes good.  Normally the chips and salsa are the worst part of the meal, but they fry up entire corn tortillas and serve them to you as chips that way, as it makes it easier to keep track how many massive calories you ingested before your actual meal.  And the salsa - we literally inhaled it.    Tried a variety of dishes (we had 4 people eating) and everything was solid - my only complaint was the tamales - they are beef only and the masa on the outside wasn't my favorite.  But because they are so close to my house, open 24/7 and it was a severely cheap dinner (about 40 bucks for 4 people) makes it a 5 star establishment to me.  Props go to the carnitas here -  these were so flavorful with crispy ends that I prefer it to Phat Phranks.  Double props goes to their huge \"lite\" menu.  Lots of offerings with whole wheat tortillas, low fat cheese, low calorie pinto beans and low calorie cilantro rice.  And for the low carbers, they will pretty much lettuce wrap anything you want and have a lot of \"burrito bowls\" with pretty much any protein and sauce and veggies you want.  This is truely a great family Mexican style restaurant with something for everyone, and my entire family was really pleased with the food here."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome... I first heard and fell in love with SuperMex back home in Long Beach, CA. Was in awe when I found one here in Vegas... and even more impressed when I found that the food was just as good as the one back home."}
{"text":"My fave dish is the value menu ground beef enchilada! I substitute my rice with cilantro rice --- healthier and I love cilantro! And they have the BEST fried ice cream ever!"}
{"text":"It's 12:30 AM - what are two Texans supposed to have for dinner in a city known for crappy Mexican food? Sub-par Mexican food, of course.   My friend Jerry J. (who is fast becoming my dining buddy) and I, weren't sure what to go do after work. It was almost midnight afterall, and Jerry said he had to get some food, regardless of what we decided on doing. This morning (7/27/11,) after contemplating what was still open, and wouldn't cost a fortune, I suggested going to \"That place that looks like a giant Mexican PT's on Sunset.\" I had never been there, and he told me that he had went there and the \"enchilada sauce tastes like I-talian sauce.\" Despite that fact, It's a hop and a jump away from our homes so we headed on over anyway.   We sat in the empty dining room and munched on decent salsa and chips that were just deep fried corn tortillas that hadn't been cut up. We both ordered a two item plate meal with no beans - he got shredded beef enchiladas, I got 1 chile rellano and one chicken enchilada with chipotle cream sauce.   We sat and chatted, and chatted some more then the food came out. 1/3 of my plate was filled with refried beans. I hate it when waitresses don't listen. I took a bite from the left side of the cheesy, saucy mound in the middle of the plate. \"This tastes like egg. Is this an omelet? I think they put some sort of omelet on my plate.\" Jerry insisted on getting the waitress. She explained that their chile rellanos are done \"Super Mex\" style, which is to put them in eggs and cook them like an omelet. I picked the chile rellano out of the omelet and ate that. The sauce was neither bad nor food. It was just whatever.  Jerry said he liked what he ordered better than last time, but this Mexican food doesn't compare to home. Our check, with $5 tip came out to I think $25 (I wasn't allowed to see the bill.) The only great thing is that this place is open 24 hours, because we ended up chatting and sipping drinks until 2:20 in the morning."}
{"text":"We were unsure where to go for food, I had a craving for some Mexican food, Filipitos was my choice, but the wife wanted something a bit less greasy last night. Super Mex it was.  Knowing that drinks are $2.25 each and last time we both got entrees, we spent almost $30.00 for alright food, we went about things different. The chimichanga plate is usually enough for 2 meals for both of us, so we decided to split it this time.  Somehow, by the end of the meal, I was starving (not an uncommon thing for me in general - may be due to the fact I knew there was no more food available).  Our server was friendly and had a good personality, we didn't have to ask for drinks, she was just a little absent when our drinks were low for a few minutes.  Food quality was good, their chips and salsa are very tasty."}
{"text":"Not good to me they messed up on my order the food was okay but not all that. I don't think I will go back there nice place I don't think I will go back there nice place that the food wasn't that great but  the food wasn't that great"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We eat here EVERY weekend!! The creamy chipotle sauce is to die for!! Yummy tacos!! Yummy fajitas !! Yummy cheese enchiladas!!! They treat us like family !!!"}
{"text":"They have good prices and always have coupons online... This is my fave mex resturant in Vegas!! They get you on the price of beer so the coupons help alot!! I get an Entertainment book every year for their coupons...."}
{"text":"Ok after reading the reviews here desided to give place a try god was I dumb! This place is a rat hole. We sat in the restaurant and it was just dirty, and it felt dirty. Service was extra slow. We ordered the mexican pizza and it came out with mushrooms. Now I am allergic I did ask the server what came on it and he never mentioned mushrooms so had to send it back. When he finally came back for our main order I ordered the tequila shrimp I asked about the mushrooms and he said no but it came with mushrooms... wtf said I was allergic I could see he didnt care. I am a server and a bartender and when my guest tell me they have an allergy to something I pay attention. My husband never got a refill for his soda glad I asked for water or he would have had nothing to drink. Avoid this place not worth it."}
{"text":"The food I give three stars, the service four. The chips, salsa, & bean dip is great. The nachos were good too, though the cheese could have been melted a little more & not clumpy. I didn't try anything else after that, and my friends said their plates were just okay. I really would love to count the food in my four star rating since they practically have everything for a cheap price (fried ice cream, pancakes, and a breakfast menu at a mexican restaurant?!), but the quality is just okay.  Our server however was amazing. It did take a minute for us to be seated and get drinks, but our server was nothing but friendly and made us laugh. Drinks are awesome here! They definitely pack a punch, I would watch out for the mango margarita since they definitely load that up with plenty rum for you! Beers are dirt cheap, and the place was virtually empty when we went after hours. The bar seems to be the lively place to go when the restaurant is slow, and if you have a birthday, they'll come over with a guitar and sing happy birthday mexican style! ;)"}
{"text":"We went to SuperMex for dinner last night and it was just okay. Bonus for serving refrieds with chips-- but bland salsa. And the chips are tostadas and they're not warm or crisp... I had the chicken flautas, which were uneventful but not terrible. My husband tried cheese enchiladas with 3 different salsa and thought it was good.   I wasn't wow-ed by this place and don't have a real craving to go back anytime soon. I think there are better Mexican restaurants around here. Actually, I think Taco Bell has more flavor then this place... a shame."}
{"text":"I am a regular here, and love the food! The wait staff is usually good as well! Their \"creamy chipolte\" sauce on enchiladas is unbelieveable. The prices are decent, and I have yet to find a Mexican type restaurant that has food that compares for the money to this place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"As always their strong 4 star rating stands!  My family took me here for my late b-day celebration as I was out of town during my birthday visiting Medford, Oregon.  Mmmm watch out for that basket of hot complimentary chips and salsa, mmm yummy so addictive!  Mmmm started off with my favorite appetizer, hand prepared fresh guacamole and chips! Mmmm a generous heaping bowl of guacamole so fresh and good! Mmmmmm yum yes!  I ordered my combination plate and chose three shredded beef tacos rice and beans as they have the best tacos in town...PERIOD!  The ex-hubsters ordered one of their famous burritos, so full of flavor and delicious marinated meat. HUGE! For the first time in his life he could not clean his plate! Amazing all in itself!  Mom ordered one of their new specials enchilada, rice and beans.  My precious nephew had the children's menu selection, chicken strips/fries.  Nothing special just frozen and fried up, I sure hope he acquires his flavor for Mexican soon! Then he can really enjoy this restaurant! Children's menu items include drink and dessert.  As always the food was hot and delicious as well as reasonable!  The service is hit and miss, this visit our waitress was MIA and our check was dropped off by another server. Refills on drinks were hard to come by and my nephew did not get the dessert that comes with his child's meal.   Check out my photos from this filling and yummy visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best chips & salsa before your meal, service was great, food was great. The best margaritas in town for sure! Last time I was there I had one of their Super Mex Chicken Burritos. SO good. I've actually only been to the Durango location a few times, but I used to go to the other one on Sunset in Green Valley all the time. I was thinking about trying their breakfast this week & decided to write a review on here. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say. This was my second attempt eating at this location and I can say I'm still not impressed.   I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, but was appalled at the sad wilted lettuce that they had the nerve to put on my plate. I didn't bother asking for a replacement of the lettuce, since I was already grossed out by the soggy greens that were there. I'm shocked that anyone would even bother placing them there to begin with. I'd rather they just tell me they ran out of lettuce than putting that gross stuff on my place. I pushed them to the side and concentrated on the shredded chicken and salsa. The chicken was beyond dry and flavorless. The salsa did little to help that either. My fella got the carne asada meal and although he was relatively happy with his meal, he found the meat to be a little flavorless as well. He thoroughly enjoyed their salsa, so that was the only plus of the meal.   I left still hungry and happy that I had my Entertainment Book coupon, otherwise I would have felt utterly ripped off for our meal. I won't be back to this location. In this case, strike two and you're out."}
{"text":"SuperMex is one of my favorite Las Vegas restaurants.  I've never been to the other location off Durango and I-215, but the location at Sunset and Pecos is an old haunt that features the best Mexican food in Las Vegas (a tall order).  Open 24 hours a day, the food is great and prices are amazingly reasonable.  If you've never been to SuperMex, you've never had Mexican food in Vegas!"}
