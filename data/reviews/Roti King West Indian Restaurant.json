{"text":"Horrible service.

Came with a friend, after about a minute of awkwardly waiting by the menu which is so small that you can't even see it when you walk in, my friends order was taken. He ordered, the chef left, and I assumed he would come back to get my order. 10 minutes later, he pops his head out, asks me \"spicy or mild\" to which I respond, \"I still have not ordered yet...\" I guess he didn't care, because two minutes later he brought my friends food out and didn't even ask me if I still wanted to order. It seemed like it had a lot of locals, so maybe it's ok. But if you're looking for a place to stop and get lunch, KEEP WALKING!"}
{"text":"This is a little joint that has a more than decent Trini- style roti.
Consistently good. Decor could do with an update but as we say in Trinidad, say wat.. de food good. ;)"}
{"text":"The rating I'm giving is based mostly on food and less on service/atmosphere. This place smells like incense, and the menu is a tiny white board hidden in the corner and barely legible. To be straight, this is more of a bar for locals than a dine in spot so I highly recommend calling in your order and picking it up. I would describe the roti here as similar to a chicken curry burrito. I ordered the boneless chicken roti spicy and loved every messy bite of it. My boyfriend order the same and his was a bit on the saltier side. Overall I enjoyed my roti and if I'm ever back around that part of town I might order out again."}
