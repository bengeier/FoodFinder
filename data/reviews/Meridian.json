{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time a couple days ago, and it seems like they're still trying to work out the kinks.  The food was alright - nothing to write home about.  And the service was VERY slow during the lunch rush ... it took 40 minutes to receive our food.  There were four of us dining, and the server inadvertently forgot one of our meals.  It only took about five minutes to get it to our table, but nonetheless, a total of two hours is how long we were there.  In all fairness, we didn't order until about 20 minutes after being seated, but that still means over 1.5 hours for service.  Also, our server and another seemed to be at odds with each other and were being snarky about the other one to our table.  Not great camaraderie or very professional.  I probably won't go back for lunch, but I'll give it a try for breakfast (that menu looks super tasty), and maybe happy hour."}
{"text":"Terrible service, and my Ahi salad was tasteless. I requested dressing and wasabi. The server stated they didn't have any. Seriously? I was with a party of eight, and both our drinks and meals were served in shifts. 20 minutes for a glass of wine. Food was served without silverware and upon completion, we sat in front of empty dishes until we left.  Not impressed. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Uh ... So Meridian doesn't sell food.  Meridiem - a restaurant slightly south of this pin, does sell food.  Just a tip."}
{"text":"I am rating this bar with a one star. They just had us pay for somebody elses bill. Which was $28.11 for what they claim was 1 shot of crown. I do not recommend this bar. We had a going away party and spent $100s of dollars. But because the bartender messed up we got charged $28.00 for one shot to fix their error."}
{"text":"This is the first Sunday the restaurant is open so lots of rough edges that need to be worked out. Did not see anyone that appeared to be in charge so some confusion as to who had what duties, such as a few tables sat empty and not cleaned for waiting customers or not enough servers to handle the crowd. Food was a little slow in coming out but was tasty and our server did a good job. Hopefully they can work the kinks out as time goes on. Probably will wait a few months before trying the place again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Good drinks, excellent menu. Food is delicious and service is prompt and attentive. 
This is my new favorite place for martinis. 

I recommend this place to anyone who would like a bar setting, social gathering, outside seating and lounging. 

I can't wait to come back!!"}
