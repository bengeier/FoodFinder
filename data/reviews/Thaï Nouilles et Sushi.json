{"text":"First impressions entering into this restaurant is a warm, cosy but muted décor with nothing that stands out, and the staff are very warm and inviting. The first food station is sushi only and the second food station is anything faux Thai. 

Why Thai Nouilles & Sushi is sitting with a high 4.5 score perplexes me. That scoring is the reason that I availed myself of this mediocre fare. 

The takeout version of chicken Pad Thai, with peanuts and a wedge of fresh lime was a generous portion. The added small cubes of tofu were tender and probably added to make up for the lack of chicken for which the dish is supposed to have lots of. The bean sprouts had a nice crunch, the one bit of green was near mushy and tastelessness, possibly a piece of shallot, perhaps a very small snow pea as well. Again, with the chicken if the pieces were cut any smaller I would've had to have used Japanese hashi instead of my Chinese set to pick up the chicken, shameful. To be fair Thai use a spoon and fork in tandem not chopsticks.  Three times while ordering I asked for a spicy hot Pad Thai, it was anything but, some flavour but lacking in heat and spicing. The noodles were over cooked. I have had better Thai fare at the Thai Express on St. John's road. A very poor showing indeed.

The cost of this take-out is $9.14 tax included it should've been a $5 tax included meal. I certainly would not pay anymore for this disaster. I ate it because I'd not eaten since an early lunch, it smelled great in the car driving home and that is where it all ended."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about a dozen times now. We love the sushi and the daily special. Food is always consistent, you can bring your wine, and after they have seen you there a few times, they take notice. :)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for Tom Yum soup and sushi makis.  Not too many choices of raw fish which were disappointing, as they mainly have tuna and salmon.  The sushi chef make up for it up in his creative maki selections: soft crab maki, rainbow and other ones which I don't know the names.  Great portions, friendly and attentive staff, good prices.  RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!

Fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. Rainbow roll was excellent, avocado roll was wonderful, and the kamikaze was scrumptious."}
{"text":"We came here for Father's day. We entered and we were greeted by the waitress.

We sat down, the waitress was EXTREMELY nice. She answered all our questions with ease. Overall the service was amazing.

We started with the appetizer which include but not limited to: fried calamari, dumplings with peanut butter sauce and spring rolls. They were all good but nothing special.

We tried: pad Thai, pad sew, Cantonese chemin and noodles black beans sauce. All were beef. The pad Thai was a little too sweet, the pad sew was good, the Cantonese chemein was amazing and the black bean sauce noodles was good.

Overall I was impressed and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Ate here the other day with my wife. Great Asian food spot.

- prompt service
- excellent prices
- awesome portions
- AMAZING food

Noting bad to say about my experience here. Don't be mistaken, it isn't the fanciest place around. Just good decent Asian food."}
{"text":"I eat here often!! I love the vegetarian sushi roll at this place!!! The soy sauce is made so well and the rice is cooked very flavourfully and I actually crave it often!!! I wish they had more veggie roll options though."}
{"text":"This place isn't well known it seems and it's a shame! Very nice discovery in the West Island! Located in Marché de l'Ouest complexe, this Thai Restaurant offers a very good tasty menu and authentic Thai! Every time we need an asian fix, it's our place to go and it makes us happy happy. 

So far EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious. If I may suggest the fried basil rice with shrimp (omg), the pad thi and the Miso soup which contains fish & shrimp: Yummy! Give it a try and I am pretty sure it will be part of your go to's when thinking of asian food :)

Pro's: 
- It's a bring your own wine/beer restaurant
- Staff is super friendly and understanding
- Great choice of menu for in house or take-out  
- Portions are very generous & very affordable price 
(Most plates under 10$)


Con's: 
- Opening hours on week days is very early (9 pm) for those late night munchies (besides thursday-friday) 
- Calamares entree is very small portion, although price is cheap but still :( 

If the management reads this, continue the great job! Please read below 

In order to get more customers, please take my advice (free):

- Send punctual flyers in surrounding neighbourhoods as your competitors already do with a special \"initial\" promotion(s) perhaps to encourage your restaurant versus other asian restaurants available. 
-Encourage your customers to rate Thai Nouille & Sushi on yelp (or any other platform really) for takeouts as much as for in restaurant customers. You can say it verbally and/or you could have it written down on the bottom of the bill. 
- Give a loyalty card (Ex: free sushi roll with 5 purchases of X$ amount)
- Update your google business profil as it seems there's barely any information on the company which doesn't help finding this gem!

Hope this helps and you will consider :)"}
{"text":"I don't think I would touch any other Thai in the west island. This place is fantastic. Everything tastes fresh and delicious. Beats most restaurants around here by a long shot."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  I would go somewhere else.  My soup was descent, but the other two meals delivered to our table were so pathetic that we didn't eat them."}
{"text":"Weak on sushi but EVERYTHING else was sooooo good. Homemade, fresh and very tasty. Good service. Clean. Must try"}
{"text":"I am regular to this place.
Every time I go, the sushi is delicious and very fresh. The staff is always friendly and quick.

I recommend this spot to anyone looking for a good meal, especially if you want to keep it low in price."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is great and the portions are huge! The Tom Yom soup (chock full of veggies) and wonton soup (meaty wontons, not all doughy like others) taste amazing. 
Fifteen bucks gets a soup, 3 pieces of sushi, a crispy and tasteful imperial roll and a main dish, as well as tea or coffee. 
Highly recommended if  you live in the west and want Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Great value!  The meals are reasonably priced and tasty.  The staff is very friendly and providing great service.  It's uncommon to find service this good for such a good price.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is excellent. We eat here frequently. 2. -3 month . The only issue I have is the Tom yom soup which is great I like rice and noodles and they want to charge me $2 for a spoon of rice. Silly  when we are frequent loyal customers."}
{"text":"This was truly a flawless experience.
- The wait staff was prompt and friendly.
- I ordered the special. It was a 4 course meal for $15.
- The food was very tasty and the portions were super generous.
I really have nothing to complain about. My gf was initially avoiding the place but without good reason. I'm happy a place like this exists. Finding a nice clean place that serves heaps of tasty food at a competitive price is increasingly difficult in the West Island (probably true for the whole island, but I can't comment)

Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant use the real stuff, the real miso soup with real shrimp and real fish, real everything!! Love it  SUPER!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I only went to this restaurant based on the reviews on this website, but our review is totally the opposite. I wish I enjoyed a meal of Thai food, as I was craving it that night!! The service was good, but their food was so bland! I did not order the sushi, I ordered the spicy chicken with rice.... it literally tasted like NOTHING! My husband tried it and thought it was the same.... there was no salt or no spice. After few bites I asked the waiter if he could get me a new one... all they did was pour it back into the pan and drizzled it with hot sauce... REALLY?!! I'm never going back there again! Waste of money."}
