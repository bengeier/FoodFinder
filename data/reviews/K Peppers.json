{"text":"Good food, good service, laid back atmosphere.  Been back three times for lunch and dinner.  Very consistent."}
{"text":"Came here with my Korean cousins.  I have been on a huge Korean kick over the past few years, and am making Korean at home.  Sometimes, its just great to have someone else make it.    This place doesn't disappoint.  Its not really \"fusion,\" though I suspect they put that there to entice people not used to Korean food.  My wife and I have gone several times.  Service is good, but its usually just one waitress.  I've been there only for lunch.  The prices are a little on the high side but nothing extraordinary.  You can't go wrong with the bulgogi or tofu jigae.  You can alternate the spiciness as approrpiate.  While it can't compare to true barely-english-speaking Korean restaurants in major cities, it is a very good restaurant especially for Madison, and a great place to learn Korean cuisine, which i can summarize as sweet and spicy (to a degree).  Currently K Peppers is our favorite restaurant here in Madison...."}
{"text":"Excellent \"safe\" Korean.  Nothing scary on the menu. Excellent quality bulgogi - really excellent quality pork and beef.  Watch out for the spice, 2 is hot, 3 and above are killer hot (3 is inedible for me, and I'm a spice guy).  Serving sizes are pretty big.  It's an every other week place for me.  Entrees include soup and 4-5 small tastings of different types of Kimchi.  I would like it if they had a full sized side of Kimchi vs. the small side.  They don't do the traditional BBQ.  Still really good though."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, once for lunch, once for dinner. Both times the service was great and the food was excellent. The beef bulgogi bibimbap is awesome. My dinner partner loved the chicken bulgogi. Other reviews suggested spending the extra $1 for the hot stone and it was well worth it. The side dishes of soup and kimchi and stuff varied by day; all were delicious. Not only was the food superb, but I felt that my business was truly appreciated. :)"}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for... satisfying delicious food and ridiculously affordable wine.  Routinely dissapointed by the \"spicy\" food in Madison, I was thrilled by the heat and flavor. I had pork bulgogi spice level 4 and Gal-bi. I've never written a review before, because I've never cared enough. This place is worth keeping around, so go immediately."}
{"text":"Website: http://www.k-peppers.com/  Since the first time I was here, I've started developing an strange craving for kimchi thanks to them including a small serving with my entree.  Now, at least monthly, I stop by to pick up some Kimchi Jjigae (a kimchi soup with tofu, and pork or tuna), and my wife thinks I'm obsessed (she is right).  They also started including kimchi as a optional flavor for their Korean fried rice.  The fried rice version isn't spicy, but the soup certainly can be! (edit: no more Kimchi fried rice as of 1st quarter 2012 - bring it back please!!)  For any of their spicy dishes marked by a pepper on the menu (the Kimchi Jjigae is one of these), you can select the spiciness level from 1 to 5.  I made the mistake of of ordering it at a \"3 spicy\" the first time I had the Jjigae, and it tasted great but was a lot hotter than I was used to.  Nothing like saying \"this tastes soooo awesome!\", while your face is red and your eyes are watering.  I've graduated from a 1, to 1.5, to 2 spiciness now.  Point being - this seems to be a great destination for hot heads.  For the other parts of their menu, I've enjoyed various appetizers.  And I really like that they include a lot of little plates of kimchi and vegetables and whatnot with the entrees.  You get to taste a bit of everything.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that I wish their prices were $1-2 lower.  They do have takeout, which I use regularly.  10-15 minutes between calling and picking it up, so that's nice.  They also use some kind of third party delivery service (that I haven't tried)  that a lot of other establishments on that side of town use - if you're looking to get it at home.  The delivery service tacks on some fees however. UPDATE: straight2yourdoor.com  If you're looking to sit down and eat, I wouldn't worry about timing.  It's been pretty dead (even empty) when I've been picking up takeout recently.  Which is a shame because they have really good food.  I hope they don't close because I need my kimchi fix."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service was wonderful-friendly and gave information about the different foods. Bbb was awesome! Can't wait to go there again. If you're looking to switch it up, go here! And if you like spicy foods it's a definite must!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place with the owner/manager working his butt off. He was the only server on a Friday night, so it obviously took a bit longer to get our food. However, we ordered an appetizer and small complimentary samples are provided for each table. That kept us entertained while food arrived. For being a busy Friday night, our food was made correctly and was delicious. Nice to see someone put his heart and soul into his work."}
{"text":"On a business trip in WI and wanted to try something different for supper.  I definitely found a great type of food that I have managed to miss until now.  Korean food may replace Thai as my favorite Asian food.  I had the kimchi jjigae which is a kind of cabbage stew with onions and lots of other wonderful veggies.  I had the tuna but could have chosen pork.  The tuna was wonderful and the soup brought together so many wonderful tastes and textures that I will definitely be searching for Korean food when I get back home!  I began the meal with an order of spring rolls which were crispy as few restaurants can accomplish.  Service could not have been better.  If you are in Middleton, Wi and looking for some awesome combinations of subtle spices, warm and friendly service and an enjoyable evening, you should definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Pros: 1. Friendly owner 2. Korean restaurant in an area without many Korean restaurants, so fills a need.  Cons: 1. Owner \"nickel and dimes\" you, charging for everything. $1 here, $2 there. Prices overall on the high side. 2. Food tastes a little \"artificial\"."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch wanting generous helpings of Korean cuisine and we were not disappointed. The lunch prices are closer to what I'd pay for an entree but the servings were large enough to make it a great value. My wife ordered the beef bulgolgi, which featured deliciously marinated meat served with a bright Korean veggie stir fry. Extra meat would have been appreciated to balance out the stir fry because the meat was truly exceptional. My bibimbap could easily have fed two people. And it's definitely worth the extra dollar cost to have it served in the traditional stone pot. The only reason I couldn't give K Pepper's five stars is because there dishes seemed more like perfectly executed traditional Korean cooking instead of the advertised Korean-American cooking I was expecting. But, this may be because we ordered lunch specials instead of dinner entrees. Regardless, the food was delicious enough to compete with my own Korean mother's cooking, and I couldn't get enough of their kimchi!"}
{"text":"our workplace cafe is being remodeled this week, so we are forced to venture out to get sustenance. i happened upon a local review of this new restaurant, and my lunchmate's been to korea, so we decided to give it a try.  it was absolutely remarkable. the interior of the restaurant is very clean and welcoming, the two men working were very attentive; one asked if i didn't like the sauce for the bibimbap because i hadn't mixed it in yet. i assured him that i would like it, i just hadn't gotten that far yet.  the kimchi was good, it tasted better after i had gotten to other flavors. there was also a cucumber kimchi, potato soaked with syrup, and a macaroni salad. this also comes with a bowl of miso soup.  i could not finish all of the food and happily boxed up the rest for leftovers."}
{"text":"I'm sad to read the poor reviews for this restaurant. My husband and I ventured out last week and were both pleasantly surprised. The \"fusion\" label had turned us off a little, since we like our Korean as authentic as possible, but I'm glad we gave this place a chance.   The owner, I think, was our server, and he was great. Personable, helpful, kind, attentive...everything you'd want a server to be. There were a handful of other tables in the dining room and he was the only one working the front of the house, but we never felt neglected or like we were waiting an exorbitant amount of time for anything we needed.   My husband ordered the seafood bulgogi, and it was maybe the best thing either of us have ever put in our mouths. I had the dolsot bulgogi bibimbap and it was delicious. Also, randomly, the lemonade was awesome.   I was extra pleased to see that, even though they call themselves \"fusion,\" they still brought out soup and banchan, all of which were delicious (though the kimchi was a little sour for my taste, but the cucumber kimchi was to die for).   In summary, this place is a little gem in Middleton. We'll be going back again...and again...and again.  Don't take the bad reviews seriously, or you'll miss out on some great Madison dining (and there isn't that much, so take what you can get)."}
{"text":"My sweetie and I went on a Friday night, about an hour before closing.  I was enticed to go here by the many positive reviews, and I'd say.... eh, it was okay.    The service was great and the atmosphere sophisticated and cozy.  I got the bibimbap with the hot stone (it's a bowl made of stone that is heated to keep the food hot as you eat it).    Sadly, I'm pretty sure the bibimbap I've had elsewhere was more colorful and plenty more flavor than here.  Both of us dining added soy sauce, hot sauce, and ladled in soup and mushrooms from our side dishes, to make the bibimbap taste like anything.  (Also, next time, I'll forgo the hot stone because it kept my food too hot for too long!)  We'll probably try again sometime, but because of the dish I ordered, the place didn't become insta-fave."}
{"text":"Ever since I ate here, I've been craving it! dishes range between $15-$23 but def worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Had the \"Haemulpajun\" appetizer and \"Pork Bulbogi\" Both were very good! Waitress was extremely pleasant and able to explain menu items as I wasn't that familiar with the food. I'll definitely make this a stop when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I came to K Peppers twice in a two day period while I was in Middleton for a little adventure.  It's not necessarily that it was good--I just needed a warm, comforting meal the night before my adventure and a satisfying meal afterwards.  K Peppers was up to the task.  I got the tofu soup for one meal and the bibimbop for another.  The tofu soup was perfect for a cold February evening in Wisconsin.  The bibimbop was hearty and satisfying.  It's not authentic Korean, but the taste is good.  The banchan especially were a little fancier than a typical Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'd give 2.5 stars if I could. I wouldn't refuse to come back, if for example some friends really wanted to go, but I would prefer to eat elsewhere.  The service is bad. When we came here we were asked to sit down at the front for two minutes and ended up sitting there for 15 minutes, even though several tables were open, and when we finally ordered it the food took about 30 minutes to come out. A meal that should've taken about one hour max took almost two hours for us. In addition, there are fees everywhere. Plate sharing, sauce with your bimbimbap, hot stone bowl, extra sides, etc. You will be asked if you want these but won't know you were charged until you see your bill. While most of these are not unreasonable, most other Korean restaurants will not charge you for some of these, and this was the first time I've ever seen an extra charge for bimbimbap sauce, ridiculous.  Which brings me to pricing. This place is pricey but also has some great quality food. Some items on the menu, however, are pretty lackluster for the price, such as the rice cakes (Toppoki)."}
{"text":"We would not recommend this for authentic Korean food.  If you are looking for American Korean food, this might be it for you!   Portion is small and pricy."}
{"text":"Working as a Field engineer having lots of dining out restaurants, K Pepper is the one I revisit for sure no matter when I am in town. Thanks for having me tasting home town food."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Right after you order they bring out an assortment of side dishes. The kimchi and seaweed were delicious! We ordered the beef bolgogi bibimbap which was very tasty, especially reheated, and the bbq short ribs. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Big fan of K Peppers.  I am always reminded why I go back...when I go back! The Bibimbap is still the best around (gotta do the hot stone bowl).   The flavors are great and their Red Chili Paste is excellent it's incredibly flavorful.  Their sides are always interesting and delicious.  This goes especially for the kimchee which is alway crunchy with a perfect amount of flavor and spice.    I was also pleasantly surprised to have the check split for us without asking as we had a group of six in there for what was obviously a work group lunch.  Individual checks were brought the the table without having to ask for them to be divided.  It was a very nice touch.  It is hard to find a place these days that don't roll their eyes when separate checks are requested and we didn't even have to ask!  It is a favorite lunch spot of mine and will continue to be so."}
{"text":"We did take-out from here and we were so glad we did. The tofu bibimbap was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating it even though I was full and my stomach started to hurt.. I still needed to eat ALL THE BIBIMBAP. Give me BIBIMBAP!!"}
{"text":"Who would've guessed a fantastic Korean restaurant in Middleton?  It's fresh, the husband and wife team is friendly and it's in between Devil's Lake and Madison. The food is tasty- we had the seafood pancake, the bibimbap, the chicken bulgogi (super tasty).  The food is authentic- everything is made in house."}
{"text":"Just came back from eating here.  This is probably our favorite restaurant in the Mafdison area.  It's certainly mine!  The food is always outstanding!  Fresh and perfectly flavored.  Most of the family usually orders Beef Bulgogi, in spice levels between 0 and 5.  Nate orders Beef Bulgogi Bibimbap, and it's his new go-to.   Tonight, I had the Seafood Stew (I'm not going to try to remember how to spell it) for the second time at spice level 4...Fantastic!  I come from Northern CA,  and was always spoiled by Cioppino, which when done well, is wonderful.  This stew at K-Peppers was an order of magnitude better than any cioppino I've ever had, which isn't a slam on Cioppino, it's just that this stew is THAT good!  Came home with some leftover stew and some take-away kimche (best I've ever tasted) for lunch tomorrow.  I'm a happy man!  If you like asian food (Korean or otherwise), you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Let's get right to it: the bulgogi bibimbap at K Peppers is my absolute favorite restaurant meal right now. Period.  But there's so much more to recommend K Peppers. Delicious banchan (which have been different every time I've eaten there - gotta love variety). Wonderful spring rolls (always served piping hot). And a range of spiciness from mild to \"pain.\" (Seriously - that's what it says on the menu.)  Back to the bibimbap. You can get it in a hot rock bowl (worth the very slight extra charge) and they'll make the rice extra crispy for you. There are so many wonderful layers of flavor, too - it isn't just about heat. You can get it with any number of proteins, but get the bulgogi - just sayin'.  The service (rendered almost entirely by the owner, himself) is prompt and polite.  I can't wait to go back. This deliciousness is becoming a fixture in my life."}
{"text":"16 of my friends asked if I can go to this place to try it out for them since I'm into Asian cuisine and customer service is my number 1 priority and let me tell you, If there was a NO star I would've given it. Don't let the nice looks in the restaurant fool you for the owners are cheap. My topokki came out hotter (taste) than I thought so I asked if they can redo it so it's not so hot and this is what he said to me \"but..it's already been made. You can drink a lot of water.\" (Wtf?!?!) I want to enjoy the food NOT spend most of the time drinking water!!! Lots of good Korean restaurant will remake your dish to fit your taste bud for your great experience.   The food is too over priced!!!!! My topokki is $10 and I barely had 9 pieces of rice cake in it. I also had the beef bulgogi, the plate was a good size but the amount of beef on it was small! Definitely NOT worth the price of $17. I will NOT be returning for I had a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, good service. Food was good, not great. The bean paste and the kimpai were too vinegary. The soup was great, but I'm a sucker for sodium. The Korean express rice with chicken was pretty average."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see a Korean restaurant open near my neighborhood. It's a small space for a sit down restaurant, but the atmosphere is cozy.   Korean food may be my favorite cuisine and K Peppers does a great job in serving authentic dishes. They also let you pick your level of spiciness (1-5) and it's one of the few places where order it at the extra spicy level actually packs enough heat for me. I recommend the pork bulgogi, although it can get messy with the lettuce wraps. I've also had the bibambap and it was also tasty, but the portions were smaller than other Korean restaurants. I'm not a big eater, but it's rare for me to actually clear my entire plate.  Most recently, I tried one of their spicy seafood soups. It was fantastic and tasted even better reheated the next day.  The only complaint I have is that the prices were high for the portion size. It may be better for lunch, but they only serve that Monday through Friday. Saturday lunch is dinner menu only, which kind of make you feel like their trying to chisel a little extra out of you because it's the weekend. I'd rather see them lower the prices to match the portion size or increase the portions to match the price.  I think fans of Korean food won't mind the price due to the high quality of dishes, but more casual diners might find it a little overpriced. I hope they make it, but I think they may be asking for too much out of the local diner's pocket to be a huge success."}
{"text":"Maybe it should be \"con-fusion\" cooking.  Or at least menu.  Lots of instructions in this cozy restaurant .  Not a good sign when the front of the menu, under the name, gives owners'  definition and social ideology of the tipping process.  Sign at entrance explains that due to \"energy\" and \"traffic\" issues, they will no longer be open for lunch on Mondays. Carbon footprint problems?  Much of menu contains lots of special directives, many uses of the word \"NOT\" and \"NO\" and complex instructions regarding the ordering of sides, which were never defined.  Food was passable; soup tepid; not used to paying two dollars for a cup of tea with lunch special at most West Coast Korean restaurants, anyway.  Waitress was a model wannabe who thought job beneath her--interrupted us frequently without excusing herself for speaking over us to ask if everything was okay--when any fool could see we were out of water and tea. Why do so many waitpeople equate good service with just showing up at table and interrupting and not anticipating what is needed?  The locale has easy off street parking; very tidy inside; decor is Hello Kitty meets Pottery Barn."}
{"text":"Pork bulgogi is good. Food is spicy. 3 star, for example, means heat."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Korean restaurant... this is for sure an overpriced Korean food.... every Korean restaurant i went come with at least 5 to 8 banchan (side dishes) and free refill.. unlike this one who try to upcharge for a refill... especially ontop of the already over charged food. Food was Ok.. nothing special... not coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"Very quaint restaurant in Downtown Middleton.  My husband ordered the beef bulgolgi and I had the beef bulgolgi and kimchi bibimbap- both were fabulous! Excellent Korean food on the West side- that also does carryout!"}
{"text":"I've been craving Korean food for some time now.  The only option close to downtown is not so tasty, so I've been dying to dine at K Peppers.   I'm happy to report that K Peppers killed it; exactly what I was looking for. We were the first table on a Monday night sbout an hour and a half after they opened, so we got some pretty attentive service. The prices are a little steep for what I've come to expect, but it's worth it.   I knew the meal was off to a good start when we got bowls of potato soup and some solid banchan. The kimchi was taaaasty and some of the best I've had.   We started with toppoki - rice cakes braised in sweet & spicy chili sauce. I love me some toppoki and this was the bomb.   I was craving some soup and decided on the kimchi jjigae with pork - a rich stew with kimchi, tofu, pork, and some seasonings. Holy amazeballs, this stuff was great!! My only regret was not super sizing up to a stone bowl. Definitely excited to head out again for some more soup.   Hey Middleton (and Madison), get out there and support K Peppers; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"An excellent lunch restaurant if you have the time to go visit.  There are two things that hurt my experience while dining at K Peppers, and none of it had to do with my main dish. Careful with your stars! I enjoy a bit of heat but found 3-stars to be my limit of enjoyment.  1) There is only one server/host, and while attentive, when busy the role is stretched. May not get refills on drinks when necessary if at a busy time.  2) The \"fusion\" part of the restaurant. It's the first restaurant I've ever been served kimchi and macaroni salad as side dishes on the same table. Not sure how I feel about that one."}
{"text":"I've been a Korean food lover for 30 years. Korean cuisine done truly well (i.e. truly Korean) is bursting with flavor and spices, and excellent even to the western palate.  K-Peppers serves a \"watered down\", \"Americanized\" fair (I suspect this is why they use the term \"fusion cuisine\" to describe it). The result is a bland experience, and for relatively a high price -- don't bother. If you want real Korean fair, there are restaurants in town more authentic, tastier, and at better prices.  I believe the Yelp ratings on this restaurant are skewed more positive than warranted."}
{"text":"So rude.  I walked in to order something for take out and felt like I was bothering the host. He said immediately that it would be way longer than 30 minutes because of all the people in the restaurant which he proceeded to point out to me and then left me standing there. The part that is really upsetting is he didn't even know what I wanted to order. It could have been a bowl of rice. Not going back there again"}
{"text":"Waiter was hilarious (though might be taken as rude). Food was delicious but pretty expensive.   I got the bulgogi bibimbap. Medium spicy. It wasn't spicy at all, just as a disclaimer. Go higher if you want. I also got it in the stone bowl, which is extra $$, but in my opinion isn't that effective and was not worth it. The meal was $16 in total. I kept leftovers that lasted me a couple more meals, but for the average person, the dish is pretty finish-able in one sitting. I don't think that it was worth $16.   Price aside, the food was pretty good. Definitely better than most things closer to downtown, so I encourage venturing out."}
{"text":"Ordered Spring rolls, steak BIBIMBAP rock bowl and , my guest ordered the everything BIBIMBAP rock bowl....the food was amazing , very fresh ,good size portions and the red sauce finger licking good! Atmosphere was quiet and comfortable ...a little overpriced but worth it for good Korean"}
{"text":"I've got to highlight this place in a review, in the hopes that Yelp fosters good word-of-mouth. I've had lunch here three times, and dinner once. It has become one of my favorite places in the Madison area. I'm concerned for its future because the place is usually three-quarters empty. One reviewer noted robust carry-out activity, so I hope that's what keeps K Peppers thriving. It is rather tucked away under Barriques' shadow, so I doubt it's getting a lot of drive-by traffic. And as others have pointed out, the decor and ambience is average. But it's the food you'll want to come for (and ultimately come back for).  For appetizers, avoid the curry croquettes . . . the dumplings, though, are great. What's nice is that they bring out small samples of Pajun and Kimchi (and, inexplicably, potato salad) whether you order appetizers or not. This is the case for both lunch and dinner. For entrees, you've got one major choice . . . whether you'll get the Bulgogi (Korean BBQ) or not. If you elect not to go the spicy meat route, you've still got some great choices, including heartwarming noodle dishes and the amazing-looking (I have yet to order it) Bibimbap. The Bulgogi, though, is fabulous . . . go for spice-level 3 if you can and enjoy the burn. I can't imagine what 5 must be like (inedible?).   One final note: if you have a head cold and it's a frigid winter day, go here for lunch and get the Ramyon noodles with the Bulgogi on top. Not only will it clear your sinuses but it will warm the cockles for the rest of the day. Just wish this was on the dinner menu as well."}
{"text":"This is a cute fusion restaurant tucked away in the corner of a commercial plaza. The area is nice, with plenty of parking, and it is a short walk to other establishments in the area for after-dinner drinks.   Service was prompt and light hearted, and the atmosphere was welcoming. While the menu does have distinctly Korean fare, I think the preparation has more emphasis on the fusion. This might be a good place to introduce a friend to Korean cuisine - the flavors are non-threatening and should be familiar to the western palate - though I would recommend ordering family style to get the most out of your experience.   I don't think it's likely I'll be back here because I think the prices are a bit high for what you're getting food-wise. But, I wouldn't protest loudly if I was part of a group that really wanted to come here. What's not to like about miso soup?"}
{"text":"Curtious,  friendly & attentive staff. Food quality was out of this world. My first kimchi experience & it was freaking awesome. Sea food Bibimbap... Get the stone bowl. The crunchy rice is amazing!  I can't wait to go back and explore more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Food here is amazing.  Bulgogi Bibimbap has amazing flavor and a generous portion.  It is still a smaller operation so the kitchen can be a little slow sometimes, but worth the wait.  Be careful on the menu's 1-5 spicy scale.  The 3 was very hot, still good though.  Think I will stick to the level 2."}
{"text":"Ordered bulgogi beef bibimbap. Cost $16.50. Then, I was charged to put it in a hot stone bowl ($1). This was clearly marked in the menu. So the bowl actually cost $17.50. The rice was not \"extra crispy,\" as advertised -- so I'd recommend skipping that extra charge. Another surprise was that the charged for spice level. I chose a number 2 for \"spicy\" and found another $1 charge on my bill. Overall, the food tasted very good. But the little upcharges here and there make this one of the most expensive bibimbaps I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had Korean Pancake and pork dumplings for starter. The pancake wasn't bad. The dumplings were cold and bland. Felt like it was heated up from frozen dumpling bags. For main course, we ordered a beef bulgogi and a tofu bibambap. We were not impressed with both. The sides served with the meal were okay but had very tiny portions. The place is too expensive for the food it serves. I am not impressed at all. I have had better Korean food in Madison"}
{"text":"I've never had Korean food like this before.  I had their Goon Mandoo (potstickers) which were tasty with a sweet and slightly red pepper seasoned sauce.  It was just delicate enough for my sensitive taste.  The Shrimp Bimbibap was fantastic.  You could add some hot sauce to get the mix of flavors even further.  What I found that was extremely tasty about the dish was that it had 6 different vegetables - including the fresh spinach on the bottom.  I was totally feeling like I had fresh healthy food for lunch."}
{"text":"Being a Korean-American who lives in Seoul and runs his own Korean blog, I can assure you that K-Peppers does a pretty good job delivering almost-authentic Korean food to Madison/Middleton. I say \"almost-authentic\" only because most of the dishes are slightly sweeter and milder than its original Korean counterparts, and they have quite a few ingredient substitutions that make it more appealing to American palates. Because of this, I think the label \"fusion\" is justified, especially in case a hard-core native Korean (like me) came in and started making a ruckus because their soup/stew wasn't spicy enough. Or you never want to insult the huge population of Koreans in Madison as well.    This was my second visit (both for lunch) and I had the pleasure of bringing along my sister, a long-time Madison resident, who was hesitant about Korean food especially after disappointing visits to New Seoul, the other Korean restaurant in town. I told her that my first visit was pretty good and this second one would be for validation. Luckily for both so us, we were both very pleased with our dishes--spicy bulgogi, soft tofu soup, and a side of jin mandu (steamed dumplings). We got them at the spiciest level 5 and they surprisingly cleared both our sinuses in no time, something that we are accustomed to when eating traditional Korean food. The only quirk I had was the egg roll on my plate, seeming totally out of place on a bulgogi dish, but then again that's where \"fusion\" comes in.   As for service, the American waiter was very nice, prompt, and knowledgeable about the food--no issues there. The ambiance and atmosphere was better than your normal Korean restaurant, which oftentimes skimp out on quality decor to save money. Actually, it wouldn't surprise me if they hired an interior designer or consultant to give the place a more rustic, Asian charm. We both thought the Korean figurines and ornaments were a nice touch to the place. As for the budget, the price is on the higher end, but it's understandable because of logistics and location. The two Korean markets here get their inventory from Chicago, which in turn makes prices slightly higher than your average restaurant.  Overall, I was very pleased with our visit and even more pleased that my sister now has a place to indulge in decent Korean cuisine. And although my stay is limited to a few more weeks, I won't hesitate to return just to try out some of the more \"exotic\" Korean dishes served here. Well done K-Peppers.    Food: 4  Service: 5 Value: 3 Atmosphere: 4  (Out of 5 stars)  PS. Additional photos have been posted compliments of mykoreaneats.com."}
{"text":"The food is still great! My new favorite - the spicy beef bulgogi - is a great improvement of my previous favorite, the beef bulgogi."}
{"text":"I don't know what I ate. It wasn't really Korean homestyle food, but it was Korean-ish, hence the label for Asian Fusion? I had the bulgogi bibimbap and it lacked flavor. There was a mix of seasonal vegetables (such as cabbage-lots of it- and zucchini) which I liked but wasn't thrilled about. My husband ordered the coconut jambbongbap that was a bit too spicy for him. I warned him though. He liked that the squid was very soft. I liked the taste of this dish better than the bibimbap. I was looking forward to the banchan, but slightly deflated when out came some macaroni salad with black sesame...good, but that's not asian....but ok..my husband ate both of ours. The corn hotteok-like dish was delicious. I could have had a pan of that for dinner and be happy.   Dinner portions were large and we brought home at least 1/2 of each dish. Reheated and with the addition of fish sauce and other condiments, the dishes were reincarnated into awesome Thai-like meals.   Service was attentive even with the busy dinner rush."}
{"text":"I moved to Madison recently after having lived in bigger east coast cities that have many Korean restaurants. I love Korean food and consider it my favorite. Having been very disappointed by the other Korean restaurants in town, I was very excited to read the reviews about K Peppers. It did not disappoint! My fiance and I got excellent service and the food was authentic and delicious!  We both ordered the bulgogi (he the pork and I the beef). The sauce for the pork was perfectly spicy and everything tasted very fresh. It was so good, I ordered a jab-che to-go so I could have it for lunch the next day (it was great too). To my surprise the owner of the restaurant came out himself to tell me how best to reheat my food the next day for maximum delicious-ness!  K Peppers has quickly shot up in the ranks of my favorite Madison restaurants. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"A horrible take at Korean food, even if you take into account the term \"fusion\".  The food here just doesn't taste right. I think the only thing that tasted remotely Korean are the fried dumplings -- if you mess that up, that's pretty bad... I also remembered that one time I ordered the pork bulgogi, it wasn't fully cooked (i.e. pieces of the meat were still red). We brought that to our waiter's attention and rather than either recooking it or giving me an entirely new dish, he had it microwaved for me. Not cool.  Anyways, good Korean food does not exist in the Madison area. You may be tempted to think otherwise, but you might be sorely disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I are unfamiliar with Korean cuisine. We love Thai, Japanese, Chinese and a good American steak from time to time. Looking for a new spot, we found K Peppers on Yelp. We checked the menu and thought it looked interesting.   We came in as it opened on Saturday. We were the 1st to arrive. It's appearance was cozy, but adorned minimally. t least the walls weren't white and it's clean. After a few minutes, other couples started to pour in (all Asian -- a good sign).   The sampler looked so good on Yelp we had to order it there. Everything was good, but the potato croquettes stood out. They were so delicious. The topping is mayo and ketchup -- the only condiment that would have been an improvement would have been a sweet barbecue sauce instead.   We ordered the squid and shrimp bulgogi (3* Spice Level) + shrimp and bacon bibimbap (in stone bowl).  Both dishes were amazing and balanced each other quite well. The bulgogi was sweet and spicy with very tender squid, while the bibimbap was more earthy and textural (the shrimp were tiny, but tasted fine).  They did serve four bonus mini-dishes with the main courses. Outside the kimchi, they were mediocre. The worst was a store-purchased potato salad with some dried cranberries thrown in. Why bother?  We do plan to come back. The food was delicious, it did not cost too much and service was good. Most importantly, it helped us appreciate a new cuisine."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of experience with Korean food and I have only been to one other Korean restaurant in Madison but I have gone back to K Pepper multiple times for their chicken bibimbap. Delicious. The other dishes I've tried there were good but the bibimbap is a good choice for an American girl who doesn't know what to order."}
{"text":"Unlike many of the scary reviews before me, I did not have any problems with the service. Our waiter was polite and actually pretty helpful in explaining our options and apologized when he delayed once on the way to our table. I ordered the Tuk Mandooguk and Pajun as an appetizer. I found the spice level(for my tastes) on the Tuk Mandooguk satisfactory. I actually low-balled it with a \"2/5\" spice level and will probably try for 3/5 on the next visit but I've gone to chinese restaurants and ordered 6/6 spice and felt like I was having french fries or something...so I'm glad they actually put HEAT in their food. I find it hard to commit a higher review until I try something with tofu and more spice but I'm pretty impressed so far.  A menu suggestion - I'd say, in general, it'd be better to simply have a \"vegetarian section\" of the menu rather than have the \"can be made vegetarian\" option or underneath each menu item, have something like [Vegetable $11 Pork $12 Beef $12] or whatever. Without either, when I instinctively see the green broccoli and don't see a meat listed in the item description, I assumed it's a vegetarian item and didn't require an additional request to make it vegetarian. Fortunately the helpful waiter came back and double checked, likely because I was ordering previous vegetarian appetizers, but on a typical day, I'm worried it would cause problems for other vegetarians who come. ( I know there is a \"key\" also that says \"item CAN be made vegetarian\" but again, I don't think many study menu details that much in restaurants.) Its just better to be \"safe than sorry\" because I know I would have a 0% chance of eating an item with meat which results in me having to trade with another person at the table or having to send it back which upsets staff."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I just missed the small print on the menu last time but there it was: lettuce and ssam jang for my Kalbi. So time to update the review. The menu was a little more limited than I remember, But the food was good. The service this time was much better. Again, not many options for Korean food in town. I would be pretty sad if they weren't here."}
{"text":"Had the Spicy Beef Bulgogi, with a level 3 out of the 1-5 range for spicy.  I cannot fathom what the level 4 or 5 must be like.  My entire upper body is still on fire as I write this.  Was not a huge fan of the appetizers however the soup and main dish were very good.  I'll definitely be back but next time it will be a level 2 on the spicy scale."}
{"text":"This place has excellent customer service. The waitstaff work their asses off and try their very best to get everything right.  The food here is... good. It's A-OK. They Korean fusion (which by all intents and purposes so am I har har har) so make some changes to the food. The problem I have with this place is that the menu is a bit limited. Spicy Pork Bulgogi and Ttuekboki are the stand outs in my opinion. Soon Dubu isn't worth ordering.   Also their spicy scale is SPICY. Do NOT be fooled. I had the kimchi jigae in a 3 and could barely finish it. Don't try to prove your manliness by ordering a 5 because like another review said... I don't even want to imagine.  No soju but they have sake... bit weird but hey whatever floats your boat. 10 to 15 bucks an entree."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The staff was attentive and friendly. We started with hot tea (Chinese black tea and a green tea) and the rice and bean curd appetizer. The appetizer was light and tasty. I can't remember the name of my dish, but it was beef, green onions, egg and glass noodles in a beef broth. Absolutely delicious. I went for a \"3\" on their spicy scale, it was perfect. My partner had the pork bulgogi, also wonderful.  I enjoyed the banchan, especially fried vegetables with spicy sauce. I wish I lived closer, I would eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The owner Eric is typically the server and while he is usually scrambling, he is a funny and genuinely nice.  The food is fantastic.  I usually get either bibimbap or bulgogi.  I'm not sold on the stone bowls only because you have to wait too long to start eating.  The spice level tends to be pretty high.  A \"3\" is pretty spicy, I can go a 4 in the depths of winter, but couldn't imagine a 5.  They serve the traditional lagniappe of little tasters that can be pretty simple but you can turn down free?  The chicken wings are the epitome of indulgence and highly recommended, as is anything with their kimchi.  Overall a great little find, that I'm glad is close to my house."}
{"text":"Great food. It's a bit more expensive than standard asian food, but its also quite a bit better quality (good cuts of meat/etc.). You also get a nice array of \"free\" starters (kim-chi, fish cake, etc.) with your meal, as is common at Korean restaurants as well. This really isn't mentioned on the menu, so will take some by surprise.   I went with spice level 4, which was just right. Overall I really enjoyed the place and would recommend it."}
{"text":"The Service is horrible! I cannot believe how it has 4star rating! There were just 3 tables of people but the waitress made us to wait outside for almost 10 minutes! When I asked for some more napkins , the waiter replied \"You haven't started yet, why you need napkins\". He just left and gave me nothing. That is offensive! And finally he charged us 18% tips as \"gratitude\". Never go there again!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 7. Luckily, it happened to be a slower night, so we had excellent service from the owner. He explained everything to us, as we were newbies, and was very friendly and funny. Most of us ordered bibimbap, which was quite tasty. I'm told the pork bulgogi and japchae were also good choices. Most of the table ordered  1-2 spice and thought their dishes were very spicy. I ordered 3 spice and could have gone with hotter. My only complaint is that we all ordered and paid for the hot stone bowl so that we would get crispy rice in our bibimbap, but my rice was not crispy at all. Crispy rice doesn't seem like a big deal, but with bibimbap, it is. The many side dishes were also a surprise and a treat, though not so much with our less adventurous eaters. Be prepared to shell out $15-20 for your meal, which was slightly unexpected, but the portions were definitely large. I will be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and I'll definitely be coming back! I would recommend going here if you plan on taking your time with dinner, as I'm pretty sure only like two people work here. However, don't let that deter you from ever going because the food is fantastic! We tried the steamed dumplings, the japchae, chicken bibimbap and the seafood bokum noodles and there wasn't a weak one in the bunch! Everything tasted fresh and was sufficiently spicy. Good work, KPeppers!"}
{"text":"It's run by Korean, but the place is not that good. All the food there is way too sugary. It doesn't matter what you get. The waiter was okay, but not good."}
{"text":"Admittedly my only prior experience with Korean food was on Korean Air (derided by frequent fliers for always serving bibimbap on every flight in all classes of service, but it is tasty and travels well), so I'm no expert on Korean food.  The menu seemed Korean, rather than Korean-fusion.  There are traditional dumplings, bulgogi and bibimbap on the menu.  We had dumplings and bulgogi, which were tasty and enjoyable.  Service was prompt and friendly.  There was one server working the room, but it all worked out fine.  Their spicy dishes are spicy.  We've got a high spice tolerance (when in India we order spiciness \"as the chef would prepare for himself\"), but I found a 2-star to be definitively spicy and enjoyable.  A 3-star might have been too much.  Be warned.  The side dishes were very tasty, though the typical-Wisconsin elbow macaroni salad with mayonnaise seemed completely incongruous.    I'd definitely go back when I have a craving for Korean food."}
{"text":"I will not go to this restaurant any more. First, the service is not good. We were set to sit closed to the door, and it was too cold. Then we asked whether we could chang to another inside table. We were told those tables were reserved for 3 people. After a few minutes, another two couples came in and they were set to those inside tables. And a small side dish needed $2. I went to other Korean restaurant, these small side dishes are free to refill."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch around 1 pm.  Both of us ordered the Bibimbap in the hot stone bowl.  Mine was a 4 star heat.  I must say it was very tasty.  My bowl was sizzling when it came out so no problems there.  I think it could have used a few more vegetables but overall I enjoyed it.  I must say that a lot of the reviews seem to point to the attitude of the owner, and we had no contact with him so maybe that helped.  He sounds a bit like the soup nazi from Seinfeld....our waiter was very polite and attentive.   '  Would I go back?  I think so!"}
{"text":"I came here with a coworker... I was hesitant because I am vegetarian and I know Koreans are know for there meaty bbq BUT guess what I could eat there .. We started off with this savory crepe sort of dish that was delish, then i had the veggie bibimap or however you spell it .. to bad  I couldnt have the kimchi - its not veggie here :(  but anything with a broccoli next to it on the menu I was able to eat... Also it is decorated very well, I forgot I was in Wisconsin (hey don't judge). I felt like I was in Santa Monica or Korea Town ..."}
{"text":"Hey food is not bad at all ! I had Kimchi Jigae and when I wanted spicy, they gave me spicy alright ! The reason why I am giving them 3 stars because the service was iffy. My friend did not like her dish, so our waitress first offers her a new look in the menu and then adds in, \"Oh you need to pay for both\" then after my friend showed disatisfaction, she tells her \"Can we somehow change the way it tastes by taking it back in?\"  Also side dishes are not unlimited (I never been to a place that doesn't offer unlimited side dishes)  Prices are a little high too. Oh and make sure to ask separate checks or else !"}
{"text":"They had a lot of vegan options, and everything was delicious.  Only down side is they do not sell wine by the glass (was told they were dumping too much out), so by the bottle only.  Since I was there alone, that was a bummer."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday when a Badger football game was going on in the evening. So I think thats why we were the only 3 people in there. But they seemed to be having alot of carryout.   First came out the free banchan along with the egg broth soup. Really enjoyed the kimchi and the fried corn things with a sweet mayo sesame dressing. The soup was well seasoned. The appetizer topokki we got with a level 4. I like heat and that wad just right. Don't want to imagine level 5 (pain). The rice cakes had a chewy texture so I recommend eating it rather quickly because they do get a little harder to chew when it cools off. Had nice flavor from the gochujang. Sweet, spicy and savory.   Now to the entrees. The Bibimbap was cool in the stone pot. It kept it hot and cooked the egg when stired. The Japchae I got with chicken. The homemade sweet soy sauce was yummy. The noodle were clear even thou they were made from sweet potatoes. I also got the solomon tea. Had a nice nutty flavor. Truly different from the oolong tea you get in a chinese restaurent, The Chicken Bulgogi Rice was amazing. Had just the right amount of sweetness but still savory.   The waitress was great at answering any questions, but the entrees came out not even minutes after getting the appetizer and banchan. Thats how we noticed the rice cakes were hard to chew cause we were trying to eat our entrees also when they were still hot. But I say again we were the only ones in there besides the carryout and a couple that came in alittle after we got there. So we will just make sure to tell the wait staff next time when we order out appetizers to hold off the entrees at least 10 minutes cause we were stuffing or faces with the great food so fast. We had no time to chat. Thats the only hiccup that stuck with me. The food was so good and different then any other place around I easy forgive.My mouth was in heaven. I felt like I was in Korea. Nice, Clean atmosphere. Will take the hour drive for dinner very soon again."}
{"text":"I guess that \"fusion\" is a good way to say that \"we don't know what we're doing\"  This is overpriced Korean street vendor food, the only con-\"fusion\" is why we should pay entree prices.  I guess that people enjoy the experience of something new keeps them in business.  I would only suggest that they make this a Korean BBQ and do justice to their menu."}
{"text":"We found this gem when walking around. The food was excellent and the service was great. The bimibop bowl was like I remembered from South Korea, and the fried veggie balls was an amazing starter. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If there's better Korean food in the Madison area, I challenge you to find it. Seriously. I'm throwing down the gauntlet.  The owner here is super nice, and we had a great conversation with him while we were waiting for our entrees. For an appetizer, we got the seafood pancakes (and they omitted the squid so I didn't go anaphylactic lol). The couple that founded this restaurant are from Korea, and knew they wanted to open a place in the US. I'm SO glad they chose Wisconsin.  We were both boring and ordered the Bibimbap (I got the beef and he got the pork). When they brought out the meals, I wanted to sing \"Alleluia!\" because they were JUST AS SPICY AS WE ASKED. This is normally a huge problem in Madison: Other places simply don't believe you when you say you want it spicy. Not so at K Pepper - they put it at exactly the levels we wanted (and they were not for the faint of heart).  I can't wait to go back. The parking lot makes it easy to find a spot near dinnertime, but we can walk (lucky dogs!).  Love this place."}
{"text":"FINALLY got the man to go with me tonight!   I don't know which dishes we were more enticed by...ours, or the ones at the table beside us! I got the hot stone bibimbap(well worth the extra buck for the stone bowl), and he had the Kimchi Jjigae. Our dishes both came out sizzling/boiling(literally). Our neighbors order came out on the cart, and our eyes glazed over like the saucy meat rolling by. I'm pretty sure it was bulgogi, but whatever it was...I'm ordering it next time!!!  We both left with smiles on our faces, full bellies, and a raised internal body temperature!  Fresh, flavorful dishes. Super friendly and helpful people. Is there anything else you could need?"}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place a higher rating.  I've dined in twice, and had take out 3 times now.  Every take out order had been incorrect.  It's been incorrect items being put in the bag, or spiciness level applied to the wrong meal.  i.e. the last take out meal we had.  Mine was unfortunately not 5, and someone else in the group mistakenly got my heat level.  You can't imagine my disappointment that I had a meal that was bland and fit for a Briton or even someone from Wisconsin.  That being said, I love it that I've found another restaurant that actually understands proper spice levels.        Dining in the meals have always been fantastic.  The wait service was polite, and apologetic for any incorrectness or delays.  The japchae, bokumbap, and bibimbap have all been great when dining in.  I think you'll find the over use of oil in cooking here is less than other asian restaurants in the area, and I suspect without actually asking that they don't use msg's.  I'll be trying the bulgogi at some point this weekend, we'll see if I edit this initial review."}
{"text":"It's really good. Definite emphasis on fusion. The kitchen seems to be having fun and in a  good and interesting way.  I'd generally skip the appetizers."}
{"text":"I'm working my way through Korean restaurants in the area, and this was by far the best! I got the pork bolgogi bibimbap. It has all sorts of interesting flavors and textures - I was impressed (and I don't generally get bibimbap because it can be boring.) I might not get the stone bowl next time since the food was so hot (heat-wise) that it took a long time to cool down so I could eat it. But the spice was just right (I got 3) and the banchan were great. The restaurant was busy but service was still good. The only thing I would change is that it doesn't make sense to me to charge extra for spicy...  I do second the nickle and dime thing somebody else mentioned. But the food was so great I'll be back for dinner."}
{"text":"They do little to Americanize or help explain the menu of traditional Korean dishes. An inexplicable 1-5 spiciness choice. We last tried the 3 level, and being non-Asian but a lover of Korean food and tolerant of kimchi, found it completely inedible. If you want to introduce Korean food as an American staple, you have to do it like the Chinese did it 50 years ago, or survive on Korean Americans supporting you."}
{"text":"The spice levels are what stand out here.  \"How spicy would you like it? We have 1-5\" \"5\", I say.  \"5?\" \"Yes\" \"The spice levels are described on the menu. 5 says PAIN\" \"Yes please, I'd like it like that\" \"Oookayy...\"  It turned out that he was appropriate in politely questioning my choice, because it's true, 5=PAIN. This place is unusual in Madison because they really mean it when they say spicy.  When handed the food, I got a helpful explanation about how to mix/put it together for maximum benefit (it was takeout).   The meat had a great texture and was very well seasoned. I couldn't say much about the flavor because I accidently got it so damned spicy that I couldn't taste much.  The heat was awesome and made me kind of giddy, but I recommend not going up to 5 if you want to actually taste the food.  I don't mind the \"nickel and dime-ing\" thing that others talk about, because those extras do cost money. I'd rather pay for it only if I want it, than pay more for everything overall, regardless of whether I take it or not, because it's part of the overhead.  When dining in, the addition of all those little sides make it a better and more authentic meal. Those are really the heart of Korean Cuisine."}
{"text":"The staff were very courteous and friendly; taking the time to answer all of our questions and making sure that we knew exactly how spicy we wanted our food to be. The ambience of the small but inviting restaurant was very enjoyable. The food itself was quite tasty and very delicious, but I would probably not go back unless for a special treat due to it being a bit more pricey."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted between 3-4, but I'll give this place the higher rating. This is probably the highest quality korean food that I've gotten to try in the greater Madison area; however, you gotta pay the price. It pains me to go here sometimes, but nonetheless I go at least once every other month. You probably won't get out without spending $15 a person.  Recommend:  Kimchi side dishes are pretty on point. I enjoy all of the kimchi/beef soups and the korean pancakes are pretty good.  Do not recommend: I can't justify spending $18 on a special bi bim bap and having to pay the extra $$ for a stone pot. Nothing particularly special on this one."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and authentic. The service is great and the environment is quaint and lovely. Everything I've tried here has been wonderful."}
{"text":"Let me tell you how my valentine's day was ruined by our dinner here.   They offered a seven course dinner for $39 a person. My husband emailed in advance if the  galbi could be chicken galbi (It did not specify what flavor, but my lovely husband confirmed my preferences for no beef) and Eric replied that would work. Half way through dinner we inquired about this and they offered us a veggie option so we asked about the chicken galbi, this is where the waitress' demeanor became even worse, which I didn't think was possible. Eric came over and said he'd go check on it's possibility. 10 minutes later he said he could do it.   (I used to wait tables and I am not just deluding myself when I tell you that I am very polite person. I continued to be polite despite the service we received.)  Twenty minutes later the waitress loudly announced \"not beef\" when putting the galbi on the table and each time when she referred to it. She shot me the nastiest glare I have ever received from someone I didn't fight with in high school. You know that feeling you get around your neck and down your back when you know someone is gossiping about you, that's what it felt like after I confirmed the request we made days in advance. We apologized three times, though I felt we really had nothing to be sorry for, and we received zero actual apologies.   Eric made us feel like he wanted us to be happy but not make us happy. I do not agree with the sentiment that the \"customer is always right,\" but when the customer is polite, PAYING $40 A PERSON, comes frequently, a little bit more than \"I'm sorry you're not happy\" is expected. I don't appreciate the condescension.  Actual food wise, there was no doubt that we were punished. The chicken came out and it was one fourth of the size of a normal portion. My husband's beef galbi contained bones in each bite.  The size of the cheesecake was LITERALLY two centimeters squared, boy that hershey's syrup  sprinkled on the plate sure made up for the dismal dessert.   We're out 83 dollars for a horrible experience, we'll never be back and I regret recommending this place to the people I did."}
{"text":"My favorite food and place in all Wisconsin. Can't go wrong with any of the dishes. The place is always clean and the staff is very friendly. I Was there for valentines day last year as well and it was a great idea going there! I will keep going there and highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with a friend.  We had an Asian waiter who appeared to be the owner (30-40s with glasses) and asked him for his recommendation.   He gave us the look \"are you serious\" and we felt as if we shouldn't have asked.  After the awkward pause, we asked again and he made an effort to recommend their signature dish: bulgogi bibimbap ($15).   The restaurant wasn't too busy, about 35-40% filled on a Monday night.  The food was good and I'd rate it 4/5 for the bibimbap.  Before we left, I asked the owner about how to go about fixing my cracked dolsot (hot stone bowl).  He didn't seem to care and replied \"Oh you can't fix it\".  It was an another awkward moment and perhaps I shouldn't have asked.  Trying to carry the conversation to avoid the awkwardness, I remarked, \"Dolsots are expensive.\"  He asked, \"How much did you get it for?  \"$30\" I replied.  He then condescendingly replied, \"That's cheap.  Ours is more expensive. It's commercial.\"  The owner needs to work on his customer service skills.  In all fairness, he did do a good job refilling our water and we gave him the standard tip, despite his poor attitude. Bottom line:  Food 4/5, Price 2.5/5, Service 3/5."}
{"text":"Got the spicy pork bulgogi plate and was more onions than meat. Flavors weren't horrible, but could've been better."}
{"text":"A bit of mixed-bag: On the positive side, kimchee soup was super delicious. I liked K-peppers' kimchee soup better than New Souls'. The service was friendly. And speaking of the service, it's slowness was somewhat of let down. I guess they were sort of busy, but it didn't look THAT busy. And one more negative star for luke-warm bibimbap stone bowl - imo, the bowl needs to be sizzling hot that it'd make the rice crusty.  So there you go, three lukewarm stars for the first try at K-Peppers."}
{"text":"The bulgogi bibimbap is excellent! Very flavorful and delicious.  Since the ingredients are fresh, they may run out of certain items towards closing time (this is not a late night place). Tasty little appetizers set out while you are awaiting your order. Very pleasant service, often by the owner.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our temporarily incomplete party of six came in at 6 pm on Monday, and we were seated right away. The solo cashier/host/server/food runner handled all of his tables really well (ours plus or minus 2 others throughout our night), but I can see if it had been any more crowded, there could've been some issues getting drink or side refills in a timely manner.  It was a cold night and a little chilly in the restaurant so I opted for the hot plum tea, and DANG, it was delicious. I got some to take home. It comes as a condensed \"goo\" and you dilute it into hot or cold water. I was skeptical because I'm not a huge sweet person, but that tea was a great addition to my-somehow-first real Korean food experience. I like trying different foods, so when my lab mate said he wanted to go here for his birthday dinner, I was excited to try a place I probably wouldn't ordinarily go to (+ sorry Middelton, but you're usually a little far out for my downtown self).  I got the tofu bibimbap in the hot stone ($1 extra) *insert flashbacks to getting a pedicure and deciding what extras to opt in to* (this one is worth it). It came with a small cup of really good vegetarian-friendly soup and an assortment of fun side dishes (including macaroni salad, kimchi heavy on the fish sauce, and vinegar-y cucumbers). My birthday friend told us they were bottomless, so hey, \"can we get more of... everything?\" I added some of the side dishes to my meal, and I wasn't complaining.  I opted for no spice but for the sauce on the side. I ended up adding all of it, and it wasn't too spicy. The spice levels intrigued us (\"5= pain\"). Another friend wanted a \"3,\" and he was warned that his meal would be VERY SPICY... and it was according to his watery eyes, running nose, and request for more rice to dilute some of the taste. I got more rice too (honestly, mostly so that I could have enough food for a leftover meal). That was free too!   The prices of the meals are not cheap, but the quality and taste are good. The bathrooms are clean. The service was friendly. And, if you want Korean food in Midwest Madison, Wisconsin, you should come here."}
{"text":"Where is everyone? Srsly Middleton! Show up. Represent!   After an exhausting... er I mean underwhelming trip to World Market Tom, Ryan and I decided it was time to make the drive west worth it. Tom had been craving Korean for some time and because I don't make decisions I was game. The interior is pretty fancy pants for a small strip off the beaten path. Nice booths, tasteful artwork, cool color palate. But the paper napkins? That's like going to L'Etoile and eating dinner with a spork.  Here's the thing though, I'd eat K Peppers with a spork, with a spatula or with my own bare hands, heck I'd eat K Peppers with YOUR bare hands... it's that good. We started with Topokki, Korean rice cake and a boiled egg cooked in a sweet and spicy sauce. We all thought 2 stars (spicy) was pretty darn spicy, but the sweetness balanced it out. From there, I moved on to Bulgogi which was unbulgogievable (wah wah). Tender meat, sweet soy, some veg for good measure... it was bomb, more than I could polish off after the app, but great for breakfast.   A little bummed that we were the first table there at ten after six, and the only table dining for the hour-ish we stayed. But maybe people just don't know K Pepper's brilliance just yet.   Get to know."}
{"text":"This place is 45 min out of my way without traffic and I still make a point to go as often as possible. I have yet to have something that didn't have great flavor and understand it's all homemade! Give it a try because you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try some Korean food for a while now and discovered this place.  From my non-expert research it seemed like bulgogi or bibimbap were the way to go.  I had pork bulgogi, one friend had the beef bulgogi, and the other had samgyubsai which is particularly porky pork side.  Pretty dang tasty.  I ordered my bulgogi a 3 on a scale of 1-5 in hotness and it was about as spicy as you'd want anything to be--plenty fiery but the spice didn't overpower the other flavors.  I'd advise lower numbers if you're not looking for something legitimately spicy.  They also give you a bunch of side dishes: kimchi, cole slaw, a kind of tempura broccoli, a fish cake thing, and a fritter with sweet sauce.  I'm no kimchi expert but it was pretty good.  So, add me to the list of fans of this place.  Definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"This review is challenging because K Peppers has potential to be amazing but is handicapping itself. Flavors are great but service and oddly high prices is their downfall.   Variety of dishes and their flavors are great, the 5 side dishes offer nice variety and the kimchi is freshly made. The spicy rice cake appetizer is delicious. The beef bibimbop is pretty close to classic/authentic, but definitely Americanized. The spicy beef bulgogi is also a solid choice. They just got Korean beer on premise too.  Beware of the spice level you choose: I can tolerate a lot of heat (and no, I don't mean Taco Bell's \"hot sauce\" type of heat). That being said the #4 on the 1-5 scale was intolerable and made my food virtually inedible. That was a mistake I made despite the owner's warnings, that's on me 100%--but moral of the story: listen to your elders and don't do it.   Sadly, there is no wait staff or bussers. The manager does all the front of the house so when he's not waiting tables he's seating customers and ringing them up--which is a lot of work for one person and the table service suffers.   The prices are really disproportional to normal Korean restaurants. Galbi (short ribs) is insanely expensive and their galbi bibimbop is priced at $22, which is super odd given that bibimbop is 90% rice and vegetables. Not sure how they justify it but it's definitely disappointing when you want to support small businesses."}
{"text":"Big fan of the pork bibimbap in a stone bowl. Also, great and super friendly service."}
{"text":"Wow! I've known about this place for a while but hadn't tried it because of another asian restaurant I was loyal to. When that restaurant changed owners the recipes changed so therfore I needed to find a new place..... Well my boyfriend and I walked in on a sat night it was packed and I could tell the staff was stressed, the host (I think) was sweating but we were seated at the only available table and immediately felt welcome. The food took a little longer than expected but only due to the obvious fact they were short handed. There was only one waitress to 1O tables. The food was amazing spicy but not to much for a mild spice girl, I had the kimichi (spelling not to sure)with tuna at a 1 on the spice scale and my boyfriend had the beef bolgogi at a 2 on the spice scale which he loved and got plenty of! I give it 4 stars, the only thing that could have been a bit better was the decor:)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Madison. Consistently amazing, and I eat here about once a week."}
{"text":"Super good Korean food! And they're also the most spicy one...! A nice place to have dinner, but could be a little pricy."}
{"text":"Cozy spot, family-operated, with good, hearty food that can be made seriously spicy.  We like the bibimbap and the seafood tofu jigae; we're also fans of the banchan, usually a lovely assortment of kimchi and other delights that's different every time.  The proprietor remembers what we like without our having to look at the menu at this point.  A cold weather favorite, especially if you choose your dish in a hot stone bowl."}
{"text":"Kpeppers is...ok!  After running to Madison for the weekend I decided to check out Kpeppers. It's a small place situated in a strip mall. Parking isn't too bad, and you should get a spot even when it's busy. My first impression was the place was small, clean and had a good atmosphere. We were seated right away by the owner. I was sad to not see any soju on the menu, but there was an explanation about liquor licenses and what not. Reading the menu further...Awwww snap no kimchijeon either :(  what the feck?? So I subbed soju for water and kimchijeon for pajun (which was made with egg, not what I'm used to but good overall). A plus was that there was gimbap on the menu!  I was with a group of six that night and the waitress was friendly and fast. The sides were ok, kimchi was very good but the rest of the sides left a lot to be desired (no anchovy, squid or potatoes). I ordered the beef bulgogi bibimbap in the hot bowl because there was no jajangmyeon, seriously I almost cried! Everything came to us quick, hot and as ordered. The bibimbap was good, nice flavors and the sauce gave it a nice little kick. The portions were just right even though it was a little costly. My impression of Kpeppers was ok, I've had better but this is Wisconsin and I'm glad to see Korean restaurants at all!!! I would come back to try the topokki and Tuk Mandooguk next.   I wish I could give more stars but the lack of soju, kimchijeon, or jajangmyeon crushes me. Those are my staples and without them I usually opt for a burger."}
{"text":"Wow. WOW. I did a google search of vegetarian food in my area and came up with K Peppers, which was right near my place of work. I had seen it a lot but never tried it. A lot of the food is vegetarian, so I decided to try it. I had the lunch special, L1, which is vegetable bibimbap. It was AWESOME. That meal only cost me $10, and not only was it so much food that I could only eat half (so now I have lunch for tomorrow, too!), but it also came with a free side of tofu soup, which was amazing as well, plus a side of sweet kim chi which, as you can guess, was delicious, too! I highly recommend K Peppers, and most definitely will be back very, very soon!"}
{"text":"Went there with two friends last night our first time eating korean and it exceeded our expectations.... delicious! We got the vegetable balls and toppokki (delicious btw) and for the main courses short rib galbi, chicken bugolgi, and pork bibimbop, wonderful! i have no idea what all these negative reviews are about, and this place is much better than the ratings its given."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect, but was truly impressed with their gluten-free chicken Bibimbap. The waiter was so accommodating, helpful and efficient. Went for lunch on a Wednesday, and was glad to see business was very lively. Also observed many \"regular\" customers which is always a good thing. Lunch prices were very reasonable, and portions  generous and delicious.  Will definitely return, just wish parking was more plentiful."}
{"text":"It's billed as \"Fusion Korean Cuisine\" and while I don't really see the fusion here, I consider the non-fusionness a good thing.  Good food here.  Many of the items are what you might see at scattered restaurants in Koreatown, and everything I've tasted has been reasonably good to very-good.  The menu's not huge but that's fine; what they do they do well, I think, which is how the best Korean restaurants generally swing.  And if you want spicy, you get spicy.  They have a scale of 1-5, and at most places I get 5, but here I got 3 and that was hot enough for me.  4-5 would be even hotter.  My favorite is the spicy beef soup (listed in Korean as \"haejangguk\" although it's not the usual variation of haejungguk I've had at other places, no matter, it was still good.  Try it if you're hung over.)   My sister got the stone pot bibimbap, and I was pleased to see fernbraken and bellflower root, which most bibimbaps in America lack.  They also had yangnyeom chicken, which is chicken in special sauce with sweet potatoes and peanuts.  I might try that next time if I'm rich.  Speaking of, what I don't like are the prices, which I take off a star for, and the decor, which I don't really take off anything for but feel like mentioning.  Decor = they try a little bit *too* hard.  It's more or less standard Korean restaurant looking, but fancy in a few odd ways.  I think of it as Americanized decor and service.The prices for menu items range from upper-end-of-average to a-little-ways-off-the-deep-end.  Yes, the quality is good, but slightly less good for the price, and the portions aren't huge.  Hot tea and sometimes sikhye (sweet rice drink) are served free at most Korean restaurants.  Here tea's an extra $1.95, which irritates me, and that sikhye stuff at the end of the meal is $2.95, though I'll let that one slide since I don't prefer it anyway.    Then refills on side dishes (of which they don't give you a lot to begin with) are an extra 25 cents each -- while that's reasonable, you get free refills at most Korean restaurants.   The side dishes also try a little bit too hard, in my opinion.  The napa & radish kimchi were good, but the broccoli didn't need to be breaded & fried (esp. since it was kinda cold), the pancake had too many extras in it and the potato salad was a bit too sweet, though the cherries were a nice touch.  Maybe lay off the rest of the sugar in that  My other gripe: they don't have brown rice. :(  Three and a half, but I'm rounding up since the food quality is good."}
{"text":"oh man... where to start...  I walked in on a sunday night with my 9 month old baby and my husband, there was a decent amount of tables filled and no one waiting.  I ask the owner how long the wait is... he eyes us and tells us 40 minutes to an hour!! I didn't think much of it at the time buuuuutttt, the next time i came i realized he just didn't want us to dine there!  So this last time I actually got to eat there we sat down and ordered our food, I pulled out my baby's food and bottle so I could feed him.  The owner came back like seriously 5 separate times to tell us how inconvenient it was that we brought a baby to his place!  The first time he looks at me with a serious face and asks \"does your baby like drop food all over the floor?\" and I was just so shocked I said yes he might a little?  I mean, I'm definitely NOT one of those moms who leaves a mess on the floor... I literally clean up the floor before I leave! Anyways... so he comes back again after 5 min and says that I can't serve any outside food in the restaurant.  So I asked if he was talking about my homemade baby food and he said yes, you are not allowed to bring food for your baby because it is against the law?! Um I've been to many places in Madison and given homemade baby food to my son and I've NEVER been told this comment.  SO i asked him then I can't give him formula either? And he said no, so I said then how can I feed my baby?! And he says \"Thats why its difficult to travel with a baby!\"   AND he said all this with a straight face!! I will never be going back to K peppers, they are racist (against koreans, I am korean) and outright rude!   PS. I am korean and the korean \"fusion\" food there is ok, not the best."}
{"text":"I did a two month internship in Korea, so every time I go somewhere, I look for a Korean restaurant. This is by far the most authentic Korean food you will find.   It tastes exactly like the food I ate while I was there. The owner is great, and the food is well priced."}
{"text":"So, we went here Thursday night for dinner. The spicy chicken wing appetizer was good. But, quite frankly, I make better Bibimbap at home. Pretty flavorless. Out of 3 people, 2 of us had very upset tummies. We will not return."}
