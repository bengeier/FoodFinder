{"text":"This little place, right across the street from the Birmingham Bridge, has excellent tacos.  Tacos are cheap and authentic ($2.50 for a taco full of all the fixins' you could want: rice, beans, guacamole, salsa, lime, etc.)  The tortillas are the real deal.  They sell all the Mexican pops along with aguas frescas.  We had agua de pina y fresa, and it was really good.  The decor is nothing fancy, but there are some colorful murals on the walls, and the place is clean.  It is run by a friendly couple.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The thing to remember about tacos is that in Mexico, they are street food usually served out of a food cart. Other than being in a storefront rather than a cart, this is everything I could want in a real taco stand. Seriously. I loved the TVs tuned in to Mexican music channels. I loved the simple venue with tables high enough that I could stand and eat (I am a weirdo who rarely sits to eat).  The place is very, very clean with no errant odors to give me pause. The food is all prepared in the open, so you know there's nothing weird going on in the kitchen. The owners are friendly and attentive, giving you the warm welcome that a person comes to expect from someone raised in the Mexican culture.  I had the tacos dorados, which were lovely handrolled taquitos covered in a bright, fresh-tasting guacamole and filled with delicious chicken. The rice was fluffy and soft, the flavor was just about what you'd expect. The agua fresca today was watermelon, and so HECK YES I drank the everlovin' mess out of that mess. It was fantastic.  The fiancee had beef tacos, which were quite tasty. He found the spice level to be perfectly to his liking. I just love how they take a soft tortilla and fry it up when they make your taco to order; this is the true way to have a taco, not some cardboard thing out of a cardboard box. He was also thrilled that they have Jarritos and Sidra Mundhet available in addition to the usual soda fountain.   At the toppings bar, we found diced onion, jalapeno peppers, lime wedges and fresh cilantro. All were reasonably fresh-seeming. The salsa was in condiment bottles, similiar to how you find ketchup at a hot dog stand. The bottles were clean, with no streaks or drips on them FWIW. They featured both red and green salsa. Both were quite hot, but tasty.  Pricing was reasonable; lunch for the two of us, including a Jarritos and an agua fresca at about three bucks each, came out to a total of $18. Not bad for a tasty and very filling lunch in the city. I will be back as often as concievably possible."}
{"text":"Appears to be closed. These were the best hot tacos in Pittsburgh :-("}
{"text":"Finally a good little taco place on the South Side.  Very cheap and good.  Definitely better than Emiliano's and on par with Las Palmas.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Nice authentic Mexican food. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Was walking the dog yesterday on Carson st., and right around 23rd or so, just past Cupka's same side of the road, saw a street standing sign \"Taqueria\".  This will draw me in like a cracker to a pig roast.  Just go here.  I don't have time at this point to really do a critical essay on exactly how great this place is.  Go here for lunch.  Get the barbacoa, or the carne asada tacos or burrito.  The meat is perfect.   I mean, seriously, perfect.  And it is run by the owners.  The guy who whips up the food is nice and talkative, and a good speak.  I assume his wife is behind the register.  She is just fine, as far as, she rings you up and takes your money.    Seriously. Seriously...   BEST taqueria, taquirea, taco, street taco, in Pittsburgh.  (I did all that for the benefit of the search engines).  I am not kidding.  I am posting pictures later.  BEST BEST BEST."}
{"text":"Swam for an hour looking over Bea's all the while uncertain as to why I wanted a taco so badly. Until I finally spotted Bea's and knew it had to be. Bea's I have to admit, you made me a bit nervous when I walked in at 6 and there was no one around, even more so when you didn't seem all that ready for a dinner crowd but I gave you a chance and am glad I did. The food was delicious and the portion for one taco was so big I had to use a second shell, not that I am complaining.  With that in mind, ignore everything else and try Bea's when you're in the mood for a good street taco, you too will be glad you did."}
{"text":"At the office, we like to show up every Tuesday to celebrate Taco Tuesday. Lately, it's turned into Burrito Tuesday. If things get busy and we're feeling especially wild, it becomes Burrito Wednesday.  Bea's opens in the mornings when the meat is ready. Sometimes, you'll see the nice folks at the counter hanging out through the window, but the door will be locked. A knock and a wave on our end is then met with a few gestures and words on their end, usually \"five minutes!\" or sometimes, \"whoops, come on in!\"  The premise is simple: choose from a long list of meats (chorizo, beef tongue, chicken, etc.), a short list of preparations (taco, burrito, quesadilla, etc.), grab a drink (soft drink or imported bottles), eat some food.  It's cheap, it tastes good, and it keeps me coming back. Sometimes, I even go to Bea's outside office-hours, on Late-Night Alcohol Fridays."}
{"text":"I think I must've missed something with the reviews so complimentary on here. When we walked in we didn't understand what to do(you have to walk in back to order). The order took awhile and they misunderstood when I said I wanted 1 taco not 2. Then I got the taco and the shell was soggy and gross and the meat was meh."}
{"text":"I am so glad I discovered this place last night. They have very good traditional-style tacos with great late-night specials, and there is a toppings bar so you can dress up your tacos any way you want. The employees are super friendly and even with a line, the wait for your food doesn't take long. The venue is very simple but the food so I wouldn't come here on a special occasion, but if you are just looking for some good, cheap tacos, this is your spot."}
