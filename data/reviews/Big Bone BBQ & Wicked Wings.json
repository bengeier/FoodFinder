{"text":"With ribs, wings, coleslaw, beans, bread, onion ring it is such a good deal for under $30 in a friendly environment restaurant!!!  Ribs are excellent tasting, we love it!!!  Definitely, we go back and try their sandwiches!
Restaurant are very clean and tidy even washroom!!!"}
{"text":"Monday mania = dry ribs no sauce what so ever cold fries
Order a side of pulled pork very oily no flavour either they changed their sauce if so I will never go back and soon they will close again"}
{"text":"The best pulled pork I have ever tried! 

I can't ever count the number of times I have visited the place! I either order the pulled pork sandwich, which they pile on a huge amount of pork in the sandwich or purchase a pound or 2 of pulled pork and have friends over to eat! 

Have also tried the ribs and wings and the sauce on them are fantastic! Love their bbq sauce and the meat just comes right off the bone!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, around 8pm, and it was fairly busy. There was a line up pretty much right up to closing time and all the tables were taken. The place was smaller than we expected but they also have a decent sized patio which I'm sure gets busy during the summer days. It's a family run establishment and the workers are very nice and easy going.

We ordered the Big Bone combo which included a 1/2 rack ribs, 1lb wings, fries, coleslaw, beans, 1pc cornbread for $23.95. Shared between 2 people it was just the right amount for us. The ribs were not fall off the bone tender but the flavour of the bbq was good - it was smokey which a touch of sweetness. For the wings we got the Chicago Roadhouse flavour which was supposed to be a smokey bbq with onion. Not sure I really tasted onion, but I did like the flavour and juiciness of the wings (NB: it wasn't spicy at all). I didn't really like their cornbread since it was cold and dry, but I liked their creamy coleslaw.

I would definitely come back, especially with a group of friends. Overall I enjoyed the platter but want more of the wings. 

For parents: it is a kid friendly place as they do have a kids menu and have high chairs. Their washrooms are not the cleanest though."}
{"text":"Giving 4 starts... for now! Likely to improve with an in-restaurant visit! We got the Monday deal to go. Full rack of ribs, 1lb wings, and lots (I mean LOTS) of fries. I hear the price will go up a whopping $3 (sarcasm obviously) from $25 tax included, to $28 tax included, after 12 years! It was long overdue and I believe raising even more would have been acceptable, but for now I can't see anyone complaining about that!

The ribs were SO meaty! There were tons of them. They came with the standard BBQ but we got some spicy BBQ sauce on the side. It took them from yum to amazing! The wings were decent sized, saucy yet still pretty crispy. They didn't sog up like I would have expected take-out to do.  And the fires were coated and seasoned. They were not just typical potatoes, but so much more! I will definitely be heading there for a dine-in experience. If their service is as good as their food I will be pleasantly surprised! 

3 of us were stuffed with a good serving of leftovers for lunch the next day for 2 people. I can't wait to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food all around, good prices as well especially the Monday deal. Would recommend the ribs for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing deal $25 for a full rack of ribs, 1lbs of wings and fries. Make sure if ordering takeout to ask extra sauce for the ribs,  their BBQ sauce amazing :)."}
{"text":"If you are on the fence about trying their ribs and wings then the Mondays special is your best bet."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is fantastic so are the fries
the sides are a hit an miss though. sometimes they're really good, other times not so much"}
{"text":"Our favourite spot for BBQ in Newmarket. Big portions of very tasty food for reasonable prices.

The pulled pork nachos are so good. Unreal.
Their sandwiches and burgers are large and full of flavour. Have tried the pulled pork, beef brisket, and the fantasy burger. All delicious. I do admit that the fantasy burger has defeated my appetite and any semblance of table manners. What a tasty mess.

The ribs are very good, and reasonably priced. And the sides you get with any meal are over the top. Our to-go fries amounted to almost a 750 g bag. Plus brown beans and slaw. So good.

I save my final comment for the wings. The house smoked wings are good. The sauce is really nice and smokey. But there's something about the fried wings. Good size. Tons of really flavourful sauce. Best wings around in my opinion. And for $11 you also get a big batch of fries or rings. Just wow.

Please keep it up."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq. Had the big bone combo and it was enough for two people. Came with a half rack of ribs (6 bones but when the food came we got 7), 1lb of wings, fries, cornbread, beans and coleslaw. The ribs were nice and meaty and near fall off the bone pieces. The wings were your typical wings that you could get at any wing place but they did have a fair amount of choices in flavours. Service was superb and fast. Definitely recommend to any who love bbq and have not tried this place out before."}
{"text":"You would maybe drive right by but DON'T, this place is great. No need to wait for Ribfest....this place is open all year. Ribs have perfect consistency and not over sauced. Fresh cornbread was delicious with the baked beans and of course the classic coleslaw cools the spicy wings down. Went for my Birthday...super casual...which is what I like. There were 7 of us , we ordered the combo for 6 people and had a bit of everything, including pulled pork and brisket. Onion rings were alright too.....and we watched soccer while we were there. If you live in Markham don't miss this gem!!"}
{"text":"Ordered ribs, chicken wings, beef brisket. The honey garlic spicy chicken wings was awesome. The ribs were good. The only thing I don't like is the beef brisket because it is too dry and pieces were thinly sliced that is why I minus 1 star. The flavours were awesome and the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Ribs are amazing!!! Signature sauce!!  At lunch my co worker and I shared a pound of ribs and the beef brisket sandwich.  Everything was done to perfection.  This place is small so it's better to go there after lunch time or call in for take out."}
{"text":"Had the Elvis Platter. Wings, ribs, pulled pork, fries, beans and coleslaw! What a great mix! Had the wings with Alabama Hot sauce! Hands down the best wing I ever had. Wings had a great crunch and snap. But still moist! I would recommend these to anyone!"}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by saying that I have had good meals at Big Bone BBQ & Wicked Wings in the past and have brought many of my friends here and the experiences have been good, with the exception of tonight.  

There were 4 adults and 2 kids in our group and we decided to order family meal #3 (2 racks of ribs and wings) along with chicken fingers and a brisket sandwich.  The ribs and wings were ok (the ribs were actually a bit too soft and they looked a bit \"frayed\" at the edges after being heated on the grill - this is an indication of being over done, as there was no pull to the meat, but none the less, the smokey taste was good).  The wings were also fine.

Now for the kicker, that brisket sandwich - what an absolutely REVOLTING experience!  All 4 adults in our group had a little bite, as sometimes you doubt yourself when you taste something that you cannot believe was served to you.  This meat tasted like it was \"turning\" - I took a small bite and had to spit it out.  We told  our waitress that the brisket was \"off\" and she proceeded to tell us that it was smoked today and that not very many people order the brisket, as if this was some sort of appropriate response that would convince us that we hadn't tasted that acrid brisket.  Now, all of us thought that the brisket must have been at least a week old.  I actually believe that if that meat was tested by a food inspector, the restaurant would be shut down.  I would have preferred it if the waitress had come back to us after we ordered and said that they ran out instead of being served that putrid brisket.  

I'm actually feeling a bit of a stomach rumble as we speak!"}
{"text":"Great ribs and wings, almost as good as mine!! Awesome baked beans too!! Take out ribs is not always as consistent as the dine in ribs, they're sometimes dry. Overall very good though! Who doesn't like a big bone?!  :P"}
{"text":"pulled pork were amazing....ribs were delicious and today we tried the 911 wings...and we couldnt eat that...lol...its really spicy we couldnt handle it...so just dont try the 911 wings..we finally had to throw it away...such a waste...definitely recommend this place but dont order 911 wings unless u reallyyy really love spicy foods and u were born without taste bud..."}
{"text":"Tried this place finally after hearing about it for years...

- Amazing food with huge portions i had two meals out of my meal (took my order as take out) 

- Best pulled pork I've ever had also the fries are something special for just frozen bag fries 

- Only small minor complaints would be its not the cheapest and the dine inn restaurant looks a bit cramped but the food quality and taste vastly over shadows this 

Ps top notch costumer service I felt right at home"}
{"text":"A quick review to say that I was craving some BBQ and this hit the spot.  I had been to Memphis BBQ on Islington and these are the same ownership group.   The portion was big, and filling.   The grilled wings were the highlight for me.   Liked the ribs very much and the corn bread and brown beans.   Less enthusiastic about the pulled pork and would like to have a brisket selection.   They offered rings over fries which I preferred.  
Will go back here.   Well worth the drive.   The location is just north of Major Mac on WEST side of Keele in behind the Maple Bakery."}
{"text":"Portion is big and price are lower.  Smoky tasty rib with a deep smoky flavors and juicy which is what they are famous for.  Texture is like soft and meat is easier bite out of the bone. Well, wing is good but it is a normal size.  Sure Wild Wing is bigger and all star got more sauce choice, but surely more expensive and tip bigger.  Well, service is much faster compare to others wing place.  Pull pork taste is deep (I mean BBQ sauce that is  and juicy (actually chef told me that he can make it more juicy depend on your order).  BTW, got a very good price kids menu.  I bring my kids to eat there.

About this location, ambience is like an old small restaurant or local pizza joint or a family restaurant, so if you are picky on ambience or love a bar or sport bar setting, I think you should pick sometime else like wild wings or even real sport in ACC.  Surely you paid high on drinks and wings.  They have 5 different location, but this place is small and quiet which good for a family or friend gathering that love to talk quietly.  I don't recommend for a big group over 6 because the place is not big.  BTW, no wifi. 

Service level is not like a bar that has a nice waiter to serve you.  So, how big the tip is all up to you like those that needs to be 15% and up, since there is only 1 person to serve.  Well, I never compare this one with a bar, sport bar and high end restaurant because I will adjust the rating to its price, quality, portion, ambience, service and facilities.  I think this one worth around a four star."}
{"text":"Very kind and generous owner backed by a great team to bring you a consistently good meal no matter what menu option you pick."}
{"text":"If you and your friends or family couldn't decide where to eat on Friday evening or Sunday noon, Big Bone is the place to be.  Me and 6 friends had a lunch and we ordered the $109 dollars party meal (2lbs ribs, 2 lbs chicken wings, 2 lbs pulled pork, large fries). The ribs are awesome (juicy, smokey and flavourful). They also have different variety of wings flavours but not as much as Wild Wings.

I just find their location weird since its situated at Bullock Drive industrial areas but the restaurant has a good parking space.  Customer service is also great! 

Overall, the quality is great and filling.  You should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! 
I love the wings, ribs, pulled pork and burgers! 
The BBQ sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"'She believed she could eat it all, so she did.'

...That's how that quote goes, right?...Well, don't believe everything you read because I couldn't eat it all. I got the pulled pork sandwich (smoked in-house, like the wings) with fries, and it was very good. The pork was tender and smoky, but could have used more BBQ sauce, in my opinion. Fries were nice and crispy too, and reheated surprisingly well because of the light crispy coating. Service is fine, but one big downside is the crappy beer selection. I've yet to try the wings, but am definitely looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ place in the whole city. The service was excellent even though it was busy when we first walked in they had us seated n served very efficiently. We had combo number 2 which is a full rack of ribs and pound of wings fries, coleslaw n beans all delicious and the cornbread is to die for but also added an extra pound of the smoked wings cause they are so good n all three of us where really hungry. We finished it all n everyone was stuffed after. I've also been here many times alone n had the pulled pork n brisket sandwiches which come with a side of beans coleslaw n fries both extremely good n filling portions almost too much for one hungry grown man."}
{"text":"Made reservations ahead of time for a table of 8

This place is REALLY busy with in house orders and take out!! The decor is very simple and they also have a patio area.

Service
Very attentive when they can, because there were only 2 ppl in the front of the house, and when we were putting in our order for food she was kind enough to advised that we were over ordering and should eat as we go 

Food
we ordered the following:
Pig Skin - This was like potato skin with pulled pork and cheese, when it came to our table the waitress noticed that some of the potato skin didn't have the toppings on top and immediately apologied and brough us more toppings to pull in the missing potato skin which i though was very nice
The skin is soft, but the taste combination of everything wasn't bad

Nachos with pulled pork - nothing spectacular, your regular nachos, but the pork was a bit dry

Onion rings- Yummy!, the batter didn't fall off the onion ring but had a good coating

We ordered combo #3 2 full racks, 2 lbs wings ,fries, beans, coleslaw, and big bucket of sauce
Ribs- very tender and tasty you can taste the smokiness but not over powering! yummy!

2 lb wings- we ordered the very smoky and Cajun, I know cajun is suppose to be dry but the wings felt like it was over cooked dry and the very smoky wing flavor was just ok..nothing very wow

fries - crispy ! tasty! yummy!

beans- soft and warm, very flavorful

coleslaw - I am not sure if it comes with 2 different kinds but some of them tasted creamy, and some of them tasted bland...mmm..but the creamy ones where very good

big bucket of sauce...we never got it..nor could ask cause they were too busy therefore can't comment

Overall I would come by to eat the ribs for sure but not the wings"}
{"text":"Best smoked BBQ in Markham hands down. Amazing food in general, home made coleslaw , beans and most importantly the cornbread it's all so good worth every penny and the staff is great when they don't have something at the end of the night they will make sure you leave happy!"}
{"text":"Ribs? Who doesn't like ribs?! Big bone is definitely worth the trip out of the city to have these delicious ribs. Besides, they have some great deals where you can have ribs, pulled pork and wings. It's a meat fest!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant one time after reviewing its comments from food website. Me and my friend felt so satisfactory with our food order ... The BBQ meat was so delicious, juicy, tender and well flavored. Definitely I will come back for the food and will also recommend this place to my friends and family..."}
{"text":"my new fav wings.
who needs rib fest
The owner cares"}
{"text":"Had the $25 for full rack an outdoor of wings. If you're hungry, it's worth the money. The ribs tasted good, the wings were ok ( don't get the parm wings). The reason for the 3 stars, is I was expecting something awesome..... there was nothing to go crazy over. What I can say is, not to saucy, we cooked and there was a lot of food. It wouldn't be my first choice if I were looking for awesome ribs"}
{"text":"I expected more of a sports bar when arriving at this restaurant. Since it was Sunday, I wanted to catch the football games but it didn't have that vibe. Regardless, we ordered food and were quite content. 

Fries lovers like myself would enjoy the generous amounts that they provide with their meals. The wings were nicely portioned and now I have regrets not ordering their famous Big Bone Ribs. 

Along with our wings and fries combo, we indulged on their popular potato and bacon soup (must try) and a round of Caesar salad, good enough for even 3 to share.

Overall, this place is quite friendly, polite staff and not a loud venue. It had the feels and smells of a Ribfest festival. I'd likely go back again with a much larger group so we can try more of their flavourand the RIBS!

Total Price: less then $45 including Tip"}
{"text":"awesome food. huge servings. good service.

I usually come in for lunch. I usually have pulled pork or brisket. Both are great - both are fairly tender with good amounts of sauce. sides are huge here - I often can't finish and i'm a guy with a pretty good appetite. prices are pretty fair (never been here for the monday special - which is an amazing deal). 

my only worry is that this place will start to get worse as the number of customers coming in has started to slow down. i hope not."}
{"text":"i agree with others when they say Big Bone is a hit and miss place. 

over the years i've gone a number of times, and some have been good, other time not so much.


one thing though, i've always found their fries soggy and their cornbread a bit too dry ."}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for ribs since I live really close by. I love the ribs here although sometimes it is inconsistent with the sauce. Sometimes they are very saucy and sometimes not. Regardless, the ribs are always good.

I also love the fries here too! Always very crispy! 

I got the wings several times in the original smoked flavour. There was one time I ordered \"hot creamy parm\" sauce and it was really spice. I felt that the sauce takes away the taste of the wing. I would stay away from the spicy sauce as I generally like to taste the wing flavour, so maybe I'll try a lighter sauce next time. However, it is safe to stick to their original smoked flavour."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday night.

It's a casual atmosphere, with limited seating. There were a lot of people there for take out.

We ordered the pulled pork, ribs and chicken wings. I highly recommend the hot honey garlic wings. The ribs were too dry. The pulled pork wasn't bad.

We also had the nachos... but I felt there wasn't enough toppings. Overall this is a decent place for North American BBQ in Markham."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and the thing about Big Bone is that they are consistent.  You can expect everything to taste exactly as you remembered from the last time.  They for sure have their recipes down solid.  Service is also always very quick, the food comes literally minutes after you place your order, and for the amount you get, it's real good value.  I'm a big fan of the wings (with honey garlic), they are ridiculously addictive, some of the other meats are bit too saucy and sweet, and I like sweet but you could get a toothache after devouring a combo platter.  The sit down area is not much to write about, you don't come for the decor, and though the staff is friendly enough, it's annoying to hear them horsing around and laughing/talking loudly to each other from front to back during your meal.  It's a small space so you hear EVERYTHING they are talking about, and it sometimes seems like they are talking about the customers!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the positive, Service was excellent. 5 adults went here on a Thursday evening. We shared a pound of wings which were quite delicious. I had the brisket sandwich. When I ordered this item, I imagined smoked tender pieces of brisket between a bun. Surprisingly what they served  was a soggy, pulled beef clump between a bun, flavourless and watery. They definitely need to improve this item. Compared to other brisket sandwiches I have enjoyed in North America (specifically Smoq'd in Chicago) this one did not even come close. Fries were great and prices are fair."}
{"text":"First time here. Did a pick up (only has a few tables for eat in) and tried one of the take out combos so we could try everything. The pull pork was excellent, as were the ribs. Not crazy about the wings (kind of small). The beans are GREAT!  My wife  not a rib chicken wing fan really enjoyed the ribs, coleslaw and corn bread. When in the mood for comfort food, this is the place. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Had some amazing wings here tonight! Everything was great but the wings were def my fave! Staff is really friendly to! Think I found my new spot :)"}
{"text":"My go-to wings place now. I always grab the wings with the fries and the fries and freaking good. The portion is enough for 1.5 meals at least for me. I can't comment on the service and enviro as I take out."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night at 7pm....no seats left.

I had to wait about an hour for my food so I wasn't in the best of mood at that point.  Even the customer before looked very frustrated.  Even those that had ordered by phone still had to wait when they came.

When the food finally arrived, they did apologize and said the kitchen was caught off guard by the demand.  To their credit, they did give us a loaf of corn bread on the house.

Even before eating, my wife said she's not going back because of the long wait.

The ribs were similar to what I have eaten at ribfest, so it was good but not mind blowing.
The chicken with their signature BBQ sauce was much better than I was expecting.
The corn bread was ok, nothing special.

I would consider coming here again, but only during off hours or perhaps ordering takeout ahead."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! The pulled pork sandwich, wings, ribs, and burgers are all a must try! Every time I eat there I crave it again or the rest of the week!"}
{"text":"Was here again and ordered the largest platter they had. Hotter food this time. Tasty and filling. Love the coleslaw.  
One downside was the corn bread was over salted and too much baking soda used in the mix. It seems to be either tasteless or over salted, so it hasn't been good either time I've had it."}
{"text":"On occassion, I've been guilty about being a snob with a preference for downtown restaurants and so I was sceptical about a rib joint in the suburbs. In this instance, I'm happy to be wrong.

The ribs are tender, jucy and flavourful!

Like others have mentioned, don't bother with rib fest. Just go to Big Bone.

A couple of tips:
1. Get takeout. There isn't a lot of seating so it's a good idea to get takeout, especially if you have a group bigger than 4.
2. Get the onion rings."}
{"text":"great food, huge portions!
Place is small though...on more than one occasion on a weeknight we've turned away as there wasn't any seating for the 2-3 of us. That's the only knock I have against it really, but its really disappointing when you had your heart set on it."}
{"text":"Driving thru from NYC heading up to Moore Falls to go fishing. Saw this hidden gem (good BBQ and wings?? All I need is a cigarette after to make it perfect!) and had to see what Canadians know about southern cooking and let me tell you, these guys are pretty dang good. 

Had the fried wings with the sauces on the side to get a better variety. The hot honey garlic was awesome! The jerk rasta didn't really resemble traditional jerk sauce too much but who needs jerk flavored wings when you got the other great sauces!? 

The ribs were really good. It was smoked just right and wasn't over cooked and stringy like some places. The meat was marinated, smoked and cooked just right. I will be paying this place a visit every time I'm up here. I will take this way up just for the BBQ and wings. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss. My first visit I was pretty blown away.  The smokey flavours, portion vs price...everything!  My second experience was unfortunate as I had a big party and bought takeout and told everyone how good this place was.  When we arrived home with the food...it was pretty dissapointing.  Gave it one more chance and again it was great!  All in all, the food quality is not consistent, nor are the smokey smoked wings.

Price is good considering the portions...however the portions are almost disturbing.  I can't believe the size of some of the meals.  A single combo can probably feed 3.  But that's ok, I love the left overs.

This is the type of place I will visit only once a year at most and likely over the winter, for two reasons.  #1 I don't think there is any dinner on the menu less than 2500 calories and #2 why would I buy ribs when I make better ribs."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have not been disappointed. Items I've tried here are the ribs, wings, pulled pork sandwich. The prices are fair for the large portions they give you. If you happen to go for their Monday special it is one heck of a deal for $25 tax included."}
{"text":"Super delicious american BBQ! We got Monday special - full rack + 1 pound wing for $25 only!
Onion rings and fries are - You Must Try! Pulled pork and ribs are our favourate."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! If you're going to Big Bone BBQ, make sure you have an BIG appetite to eat!

This is probably the best BBQ place I have been uptown! The service was amazing, as the staff was easy-going and very welcoming. 

Pull Pork Sandwich |$10 | (came with fries and coleslaw): SO GOOD. It is their house specialty, made with their house BBQ sauce. The fries were crispy, and their coleslaw was refreshing.

Big Bone Combo | $22 | (1/2 rack of ribs + 1 lb wings + fries (free substitution for onion rings) + corn bread + coleslaw): The ribs were fall-off-the-bone, and well done. Not too saucy, and the meat was moist. We got the wings fried, with their house BBQ sauce - DELICIOUS. The corn bread was good too, and the onion rings were even better than the fries. 

Definitely go on Mondays, where they have a special of a rack of ribs, and 1 lb of for $25. This is a great place for kids as well, as they have smaller sized meals for kids 12 and younger. They also do catering (I can only wish for this kind of work lunch!). Their beer selection could be better, just Canadian beer, and Stella. 

I would definitely go back to Big Bone BBQ with a large group of friends, to just chill or watch games on their TVs, or grab take out on my way home!"}
{"text":"I did not know this was a franchise of Memphis BBQ which I've been to and liked.

This venue has a cleaner, newer look than the one in Vaughan: much nicer decor. 

I had the 3-bone dinner for $11.99 They actually gave me 4 pieces. The 4th was smaller but it was nice to get that extra. Substituting onion rings for fries came at no extra cost. I thought dinners came with coleslaw, corn bread, fries or beans, but it is \"AND\" so you get a little of everything.

I rather have savory than sweet sauces and this was on the sweeter side which I enjoyed but a good savory sauce would have made me love this place. I've been told from a rib connoisseur that the meat is NOT supposed to fall off the bone. In the past, I liked it when it does. This one does not but it is not tough or require a lot of effort to remove, so the texture was good.

The onion rings, beans and coleslaw were typical of other places and was adequately done. The portion size was generous. The corn bread was dense and heavy. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be like that, but I was not a fan.

The customer service was attentive as well.

It is heavy food so I would only come here maybe once a year or so but is is definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The ribs are so good and I'm not much of a meat eater, it just falls off the bone. Love the honey garlic wings, french fries and corn bread. The slaw is healthy, fresh and natural tasting. The beans are well seasoned and a nice touch to the combo meal. Highly recommended! A great deal for everything you get, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went with two kids on a Saturday afternoon in March. We shared a pulled pork sandwich and fries and wings and rings. Two meals between three people was still too much food!  Service was great, food was excellent, ambience was what you'd expect from a storefront in a run down strip mall. If this food was in a nicer restaurant setting it would rate 5stars"}
{"text":"Warmer weather we've been experiencing has me seeking good old fashion BBQ.  


Ordered a Big Bone Combo to split which has a little bit of everything to try. 

Includes a half rack of ribs, 1 lbs. of wings, fries, beans, coleslaw, and corn bread.  

Inside, decor is simple, wooden chairs, arrangements of 2 or 4; a large table was setup for 10.  On the walls trophies from competitions and media mentions. They do serve alcohol here Canadian, Keith's, Steamwhistle, Fuzion Red & White Argentinian wine. 

When our food was ready, the chef behind the counter proudly presented it to us. 

My take:

The ribs are smoked with a pronounced dry rub flavor.

The wings deep fried then tossed in sauce. we had a Spicy BBQ sauce it was perfect combination of sweetness from a ketchup based BBQ sauce and frank hots to give it a Buffalo flavour. 

Fries were ok but I've had similar tasting ones at KFC. If I could make a suggestion, is to offer fresh cut to complete the house made experience. 

Coleslaw - fresh not soggy. Ok.

Baked beans - house made good balance of molasses and bits of meats

Corn bread - like a cake, dense not what I was expecting. 

I found Big Bone quality a bit better than the travelling rib fests vendors. Only thing Id suggest is they could improve on the frozen fries. 

I enjoyed the meal very much and look forward to revisiting. 


Recommend!"}
{"text":"Best ribs and pulled pork I've ever had!! Huge portions, took most of it home. Prices are reasonable and the beer is cheap. 

It's located around the corner of the plaza, we had to circle around to find it."}
{"text":"This company needs to learn a thing or two about customer service. I had been trying to contact the corporate office regarding catering for two weeks. Today I finally spoke to a manager. He advised me that the date I requested had been booked over a month ago.  When I tried to explain the inconvenience it caused me he told me that he had to go. I was in the process of telling him that I would be posting a review regarding my experience and he just hung up on me.  Not a great way to treat a potential customer that was going to spend $1500."}
{"text":"Having been a regular at the Newmarket location, we stumbled on this location in Markham. Our first experience was very good so much so that we returned again, this being a shorter drive than the Newmarket location. However, our subsequent trips proved not as pleasant. The quality of food seems to vary a lot from week to week. the fries are not fried enough and the cole slaw always tastes different.

The owners are friendly and appear to genuinely like what they are doing. But the variation in food taste everytime we go made us decide to return to the original Newmarket location instead. Aside from these two issues, generally the food tastes just as great."}
{"text":"We have become regulars at this place now. Big Bone serves huge portions of succulent barbecue fair. We usually go straight for the big ribs and the smoked wings. The cole slaw is always great. We love this place so much that we usually order some extra to take home to eat during the following days. 

The restaurant is in an unassuming plaza on Eagle Street in Newmarket. The embience is very basic but yet it gives a good vibe. It's a pleasure to dine in. 

I observe there are two things that can be improved although they are not critical enough to take a star away from the rating. 1) the cole slaw portion can be bigger and 2) the fries are frozen like at Costco. When fried well they are crispy and tasty. If not, they become oily and soggy. 

Big Bone is so good we usually go once every two weeks. Great job guys. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place as we are big BBQ fans. The Ribs were ok, a little TOO soft and chewy for us. The wings were very very small and you dont get a lot with your order. The pulled pork was great, it was moist and the BBQ sauce with it was great. The corn bread is disgusting. It tastes like white wonderbread with some cornmeal thrown in. The beans were decent and the coleslaw... well gross. We ordered a few extra sauces to try them out. The creamy parm was nothing more then mayo with garlic and parm cheese on top, gross!!! 

We would be saying that this place is decent but we cant because the services was so terrible!!! The staff acted like it we were in their way, did not offer another drink. We sat there for 5 minutes with empty plates waiting for someone to come to our table (we were the ONLY PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE PLACE!), and finally my husband got our bill and paid for it. He asked if I could have a glass of water. I was presenting with a glass of warm water which had particles floating it in and a few ice cubes. Once again we seemed like we were in the staffs way. Will not return ever!"}
{"text":"I ate the garlic parm wings when I went here and they were a bit overcooked and the fries are pretty much costco fries so nothing special there. The ribs according to my friend however were the best ribs she's ever had which makes sense since that's their speciality. The staff could be a bit friendlier but overall a pretty good place to go."}
{"text":"I've had the pulled pork sandwich and the chicken sandwich here - both are really great.  Be prepared for A LOT of food.  The pulled pork sandwich is giant - I'm a big eater, and I barely managed to finish half of it.  It's an insane amount of meat.  The chicken sandwich is also SUPER yummy - it's a full chicken breast, and it was cooked perfectly.

The meat is really the star here as the sides are okay.  The coleslaw is pretty good, and the fries are decent - they're the generic frozen kind.  Nothing special, but not bad either.  The cornbread is yummy.

I think the only thing keeping this from being a home run are the buns they use.  The pulled pork was in a generic looking sausage bun and chicken sandwich bun was super lackluster hamburger bun.  In both cases, I ended up ditching the bun and just eating the meat, which is a travesty because I love bread.  It isn't bad by any means, but it's definitely a disappointment when compared to the rest of the great food."}
{"text":"Was in the area and was told to hit up another place around the corner. When we arrived the place was closed on Mondays. Hit up YELP and BIG BONES popped up (restaurant that is). Monday night they have a sweet rib and wing deal but there was 6 of us so.. We went with combo 3 ( 2 racks,2pounds wings, slaw, beans and fries) we all ate and were full for a great price. The place was really busy and the staff still made time to keep an eye on a table for us. We were sitting down in 10 minutes. Tons of people has been waiting for takeout which also helped our situation. I am happy the other spot was closed. Next time i am in the area you can be sure i will be going  back. Food was great and staff were super awesome..Cheers! (Sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes)"}
{"text":"In an homage to Calvin Trillin I have driven many a back road in an attempt to find real food (and often got lost, but that's just part of the fun), travelling through towns where all roads mysteriously change their names as you cross intersections.  At this point, you might suggest that I purchase a GPS.   But part of the fun of being a food adventurer means getting lost, getting confused and somehow finding yourself and possibly a completely different restaurant than the one you originally had in mind.  And so it was that the Big K and I discovered the Big Bone BBQ. 

It's good news when you enter a restaurant for the first time and there's a line up  for take-out .   This place is small, impeccably clean and has good service.  The Big K's platter of fall off the bone tender ribs, wings, fries, cornbread, beans and cole slaw was huge and even he, the man who eats dinner for four, almost had trouble finishing it off.   My pulled pork sandwich was sublimely tender and packed into in a fluffy large white hot dog bun, which I thought initially off-putting but then added to the taste experience in only a way that some thoughtful  food combinations can.  Fries are the crispy kind that my Dad preferred (and so that's my reason to appreciate them.)   Go here with a big appetite and be prepared to lick your fingers."}
{"text":"Small, but with a second room for extra seating. Great fall off the bone ribs. Tasty wings and sauced. Good quick service. Take-away available. But we were here for the ribs and wings and weren't disappointed. Heck, even the little raspberry candies at the checkout were nice."}
{"text":"Just ordered from them off of Uber Eats. $27 including tax and delivery fees. This is the bbq ribs and fiery honey garlic wings. The fries are crispy and taste great, the coleslaw is bland, corn bread had a corner missing which I'm hoping wasn't a bite, nonetheless it tastes stale. Also came with beans which I don't eat. The ribs were Ok, sauce on the wings tasted good and not too spicy. Also asked for a side of ranch which they forgot to include. Overall.. 3/5"}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian you can stop reading now as there's nothing here that will appeal to you and you're certainly not the demographic for BBQ restaurants.

Now, if you're a carnivore, read on because the boys at Big Bone BBQ know how to do it properly.  

At the time that I write this, I think the restaurant has been open for 2-3 weeks, and I've eaten there, oh, I don't know...8 times?  Yes, it's near where I live (Aurora), but having said that, I'm the type of guy who will travel for good eats, and I'm just happy that I now don't have to travel far for great BBQ.

Now, this is what BBQ is supposed to be, a small, unassuming location with nothing fancy about it.  On your table you'll find a menu, a roll of paper towel, a bottle of BBQ sauce, a bunch of wet-naps and well, that's all there should be.

I haven't tried everything on the menu, but what I have tried has been fantastic.  Messy, sticky, BBQ deliciousity!

Everything that I've tried has had their signature sauce on it and that sauce is great.  I've had the pulled pork sandwich, full rack of ribs, smoked wings and fried wings.  

The meals are served with your choice of baked beans (made in house), coleslaw, cornbread or french fries.  All are excellent sides to the meaty main course.

The smoked wings are really flavourful and I'd definitely recommend them.  

The pulled pork sandwich is so succulent and tender, served on a fresh roll.  This is not a sandwich for the meek...it is big, and it can get messy...but it's sofa king good, and a meal by most standards.  Made from a big smoked pork butte, it's got all the flavour you could hope for.

The ribs are really what I like though.  You simply cannot get this job done properly without a proper smoker, a great rub and far more hours at your disposal than most people are willing to invest in order to make them at home.  They use pork side ribs which are nice and lean.  A full rack is a killer meal...you need to have a big appetite to do this single handed.  Luckily, I've got what it takes to get the job done.  I'm 7 for 8 at eating everything I've been served...I really over did it on one visit...but that's my problem sometimes.

The guys who own the restaurant (brothers Tim and Lee) are truly great people who actually love what they do, and it shows in everything they prepare.

The service is excellent, the portions are very generous, and the place is exactly what they set it up to be...a proper BBQ joint.  They've also assembled an excellent bunch of combos that allow you to try a few different items without having to order full portions.

There's no liquor license, they take cash or debit and there aren't a ton of tables or seats.  

Get in, get stuffed, get out.  I'm sure they could carry you back out to your car too if you needed.  I'm 8 for 8 on making it back to my car unassisted...we'll chalk that up to experience."}
{"text":"Attentive servers, quick service and amazing fried wings. Reasonable price for both food and drinks. They also have Mondays special, dine in or take out. I would definitely come back for their wings. They give generous portion of pulled pork as well. As for the ribs, i found it a bit dry and I would say the ribs from other places like st. louis were better, but I would still recommend to any wing lovers."}
{"text":"I've been to the Newmarket location before, so this wasn't exactly the first time I had ribs at Big Bones. This time round the ribs were really dry, while the corn bread were hard and not as fresh."}
{"text":"One of my favourite critics (for video games, not restaurants - but the logic still applies) recently mentioned that the most important thing, when reviewing anything, is to keep the consumer in mind - emphasize what brings value to the consumer. So from here on out, that's exactly what I'm going to try to do. I mention this because I'll read some very tedious remarks regarding their restaurant experience, i.e. someone will knock off stars because they couldn't \"access the wifi\" (um, how about you entertain your own kid for 30min and not toss blame around like confetti). A restaurant is meant to provide you with food cooked properly, and an enjoyable atmosphere, and to do that consistently every visit. that's literally it - anything else is just personal preference that really has no weight when keeping the consumer in mind. 

My friend and I went on a tuesday night, so even though the place is small, it wasn't packed. My friend had made a reservation, which i think they took as a formality only - this is the kind of place where you seat yourself.

I like to keep my commentary on service short, unless it's terrible - then I'll illustrate how bad it was. The service here was great! Polite, attentive, and fast, which is everything service needs to be. They confused my order with a different (but similar) combo. Mine didn't have pulled pork, but more ribs. They brought me out one with pulled pork. And when I told them, they just gave me more ribs. Free food? this is customer service I can get behind. At other restaurants I've been at, a wrong order could mean the manager brings out your order and profuse apologies as if they just hit your dog with their car. I prefer relaxed attitudes and not having a fuss made over me..... this commentary on service was meant to be short.

Seating wise, the place itself is a lot more comfortable than it looks at a glance.

The food was great. Even the throwaway items like fries were good (sidenote, I can tell they either just changed their fryer oil, or do it regularly - good on you, big bone!). I think it's kind of a shame that the beans and coleslaw (which lacked the blandness that can sometimes be found in a small side) are so overshadowed by everything else. But it's a bbq place, that's how it ought to be.
The pulled pork was rich and smoky. The ribs were tender, fall-off-the-bone, and flavourful. Nicely trimmed and not too fatty. The wings were succulent and had a nice deep flavour that only smoking/grilling can do to chicken. I hate bbq sauce that is overly sweet, so I was thankful to find none of that on anything. I got some roadhouse hot sauce on the side, rated 4 stars on their spicy meter. I would have put it at about a 2-3, but that's just my personal palate. I DID appreciate that what was called \"spicy\" was actually so. I think having a decent spice profile, for a bbq joint, is pretty important.

My friend kept raving about her honey garlic wings. My dislike for sickly sweet sauces keeps (as mentioned above) keeps me away from honey garlic. I had a taste... her enthusiasm wasn't misplaced. 

Big Bone, keeping true to their Memphis roots, keeps the portions, uh... let's just say \"American\" sized. Which means you'll be full and be leaving with a box for tomorrow's lunch. 2 people: 2 combos, onion rings to start, 3 beers, came to just under $60 (before tip)
Considering how delicious and fresh everything was, plus lots to take home: that's an amazing value.

I'm keeping the rating at 4 stars because the one thing I can't judge right now, is consistency (which is vital). I plan on going here a few more times, and if each time is just as good, I'll give them the 5th star.

In any case, after the amount I ate, this morning's breakfast was a grapefruit and a glass of water."}
{"text":"A popular spot with a constant stream of customers, most people tend to opt for take-out as there are not many tables.  It's totally an option though - you can grab one of the eight or so tables that can fit 2-8 people depending on the table you get.  There's also a tin bucket provided for the discarded bones to be used only after you've picked off all the meat and licked off all the barbeque sauce like some primitive Neanderthal.  Well, a suburban Neanderthal. 

That signature pink smoke rings so highly sought after by BBQ aficionados are a hit and miss.  Sometimes you'll see it, and other times it may have been a little overcooked and it will be difficult to see any other colour than brown in the dried ribs.  It's OK though, because the prices are pretty low so you can try again with another batch the next time.  Ditto for the cornbread, of which I had a pretty dry sample of the first time, but have since had moist loaves.

Chicken wings are worth getting and I recommend the fried version which has the magical ability to allow sauce to cling onto the wings.  Yum."}
{"text":"I remember coming here roughly 2 years ago, and it's just as good as it was back then!!

I've never dined in restaurant, so I can't speak for the service. Though, the cashier experience I've had is nice. I don't know if it's owned by a couple, or family owned, but they are very warm and welcoming. Almost very appreciative that you have come by to spend your hard earned money in their restaurant!!


I don't go to a lot of BBQ places, so I don't have a lot to compare to. But I don't really have any complaints about Big Bone, it's good BBQ from what knowledge I know! Awesome wings, baked beans, ribs ... The corn bread is eh, but the rest is great!

I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're ready to get your meat on, then this is the right place. My boys and I came in on a Sunday during lunch and it was not too crowded.

Ordered a pulled pork Sammie while my friends shared a Big Bone combo (6 ribs, 1 lb wings any style), each with sides. Food took forever, but distracted ourselves with the Olympic hockey match that was playing while we waited. 

Food portions are coma inducing, so figure about $9-10 per head plus drinks, and you won't worry about going hungry. Finished the huge pile of pulled pork but wish I substituted the fries for some corn bread. 

Owner seemed easy to get along with, say hi to him the next time you drop by."}
{"text":"One thing's for sure about this place: Nobody will every go hungry when ordering from here!  Today they offer their Monday Mania special, and for $25 plus tax you get a full rack of ribs, a pound of wings, and what seemed like about two pounds of fries. A crazy amount of food for two people, but we gave it our best shot - and still have some leftovers for tomorrow. 
First things first: the staff are great here. I called well over an hour before they even opened today, and not only did they answer the phone, but they gave me advice on wing sauces, as well as a tip on calling in my order well in advance to ensure it would be ready when I wanted it. I followed the advice, called in my order around 3:30pm, and it was waiting for me at 6:45pm on the nose, just like I asked. 
As far as the food goes, it was good, but not all amazing. That said, the ribs were first class. Tender, meaty, and absolutely delicious. The wings were tasty, but in my opinion a bit overdone and dry. Fries were just frozen Crispy Coat. Nothing special there, but good nonetheless. Cornbread was plain and kind of dry too. 
I'll be back to check out Monday Mania again, just to see if I caught them on a bit of an off day today. Still a great meal, but not as over the top amazing as I've heard from others"}
{"text":"Great ribs and wings at a great price.  Family style orders and substitutions are accepted! 

Smoked wings are great,  but they also have 25 flavors of fried wings. 

It can get busy in here but be patient it is worth it to wait -- good ribs take a long time :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was with a group of 5. Right when we walked in, the staff was super friendly and greeted us. 

We got party pack #3 that was $70. It comes with 2 racks of ribs, 2lbs wings(2 flavours), basket of fries and an appetizer plate that came with Coleslaw, Beans and I think Corn Bread. 

I liked how it comes with a plate of appetizers. I wasn't really a fan of the corn bread, i've never had it before, but overall it just tasted hard and dry. Which could be what it is, but it's not something i'd eat again. 

One of the flavours we got for the wings was the honey garlic, and by far it was the best honey garlic i've had. The woman working there was super helpful while we were choosing our flavours. Some of us liked spicy and some didn't, so she suggested she could put the spice on the side for us! Perfect! 

As for the main dish, the ribs! In my opinion it was just slightly dry.. and hard to rip off the bone. But overall, everything was still delicious and we all had a great time."}
{"text":"I've been here few times and find that they are pretty consistent, the pulled pork sandwich was huge enough to feed two small person,  mildly smoked, good favorite. BBQ wings were juicy, moist and perfectly smoked for me because I dislike strong smokey favorite. Cornbread, coleslaw and baked bean were all good and well balanced. There is one thing missing is the free refill sweet tea."}
{"text":"Great bbq! Had the 1/2 rack of ribs with 1lbs of wings combo.  Both had incredible flavor! 
The ribs just fell off the bone.  
Bbq sauce that came with the meal was awesome too.  The portion was also large.  Absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"A seriously underrated wings place tucked away on Bullock Drive. Came here for Monday Mania - $25 for a full rack, fries, pound of wings - a great deal anywhere.  Apparently their full racks get sold out quick, as we got there around 6:30 and we're told there were only two racks left. 

Ribs are fantastic here, just the right amount of sauce. The meat comes right off the bone which is my favourite. There are a few flavours only for the wings, and while the wings are nothing special the Monday Mania meal is just right for two people. 

A lot of people get take out here rather than eat-in, which is a shame because they actually have a quiet patio! There's nothing in the area so there's no view, but it's still great to eat outside on a nice day. 

The only downside is they have bottled beers only and closes early (9pm). Otherwise this would be a great hangout at night with above average ribs."}
{"text":"There's a southern bbq joint in Markham?! Whuuut?! When?! Where?! No need to wait for a ribfest... Srrrrriously!?

Called for a pick-up so the whole family can have a taste. Luckily, it's only a 10 minute drive from my parents' house.
The restaurant itself is small and simple, 2-3 booths and 6-8 tables, but they have a decent size patio. It wasn't packed since I was there around 5pm but they had a huge line-up of pick-up orders. Service was quick, polite and all smiles.

I got 2 orders of the Big Bone combo and a Pulled pork platter:
2 half rack ribs - it's what they're known for and it doesn't dissapoint! Soft and fall off the bone, great bbq sauce
1/2 lb. Smoked chicken wings - it's ok, nice to try once, doubt I'll get it again
1/2 lb. Hot creamy parmesan wings - good and spicy, could use more parmesan tho
1 lb. Bubba's medium wings - good flavour but needs more spice
1 lb. Pulled pork - So flavourful and juicy! The bbq sauce is on point
Onion rings - typical but a good
Fries - tastes like cavendish/costco fries, which I like
Coleslaw - decent flavour
Beans - tastes like canned pork n beans, it's ok
Cornbread - a tiny bit dry, better to eat with the pulled pork
The sides were simple and complements the meat well. You can make substitutions for the sides at no additional cost which was nice.

All this food fed 6 adults and 3 kids so it's great value for the quantity and quality you get. We were all full and very glad there's a bbq joint in the neighbourhood. Big Bone BBQ is a real winner! Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Mondays is the best day to come here. 25 bucks gets you a huge serving of fries or a salad, a full rack of ribs and a pound of wings. And everything tastes great. And this monday mania special can feed up to 3 people. But of course if youre someone like me then it only feeds one person :) im basically garanteed to be satisfied everytime i come here. I also want to buy one of those tshirts they got."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday lunch right when they opened at noon. It's a little place but the food was amazing. Their portions are HUGE. And I mean hugeee. Me and my girlfriend ordered the big combo and the pulled pork combo. We didn't even finish one of them and had to pack it home. 

We really liked all their food. The pulled pork were good, smoked wings fell right off the bones, as well as the ribs. The fries were actually really good! It was crispy and fresh, and again huge portion. 

They were really nice about letting us substitute one of the fries for Caesar salad (even gave us more salads instead of the coleslaw). The price is also extremely good for the portion! Around $55 after tax and tip for the two, and we probably will get 4-5 meals out of it lol."}
{"text":"Monday Mania special cannot be beat.      1lb wings, 1 rack of ribs and fries or onion rings. Be patient when dinning in, lots of take out for the Monday special.  When you do order, the food comes fast."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Markham! This restaurant delivers more than what you pay for. Their Monday combo comprising of fries, wings and ribs is by far the best deal in town when it comes to ribs. It's enough for three to four people and it comes up to $25. The meat on the ribs fall right off the bone and there is the perfect amount of sauce on the ribs. Their ribs are better than some of the places at the Markham Ribfest in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've order from Big Bone multiple times on uber eats and it's freaking fantastic. The food portions are insane and soooo filling, I love their sauces but a personal favourite is always garlic / Parmesan. The wings are always going to be a favourite for me. The fries are so good and crispy without being overly salty. I would also recommend adding some garlic bread to the order because even though it's a lot of food it's always good to have left overs for later."}
{"text":"After reading reviews and their website which promises authentic Southern BBQ (I am originally from Alabama), we made the trip from Pickering to Markham to try them out.  It wasn't worth the drive.  When you walked in the door, you didn't smell smoke and any good BBQ place definitely will.  When we sat at a table, the only condiment besides salt and pepper was ketchup, and any good BBQ place will have extra sauce (sometimes several flavors) and hot sauce on the tables.  I ordered the pulled pork platter and my husband ordered the rib and wings platter.  These came with small servings of coleslaw and beans, a slice of corn bread, and a heap of fries.  The fries were excellent and probably the best thing on the plate, with a crispy coating and well cooked. The coleslaw was horrible, some of the worst I have had.  It was basically just shredded cabbage mix from the grocery store with mayo mixed in.  The beans were just beans and needed some help.  Some extra BBQ sauce or spices would have gone a long way towards making them better, but I could at least eat these while I couldn't finish the slaw it was so bad.  The cornbread was a bit dry and was served cold with no butter or anything.  I brought mine home, warmed it in the microwave and buttered it and it was good then.

Now on to the meat.  The pulled pork was pretty good, but needed a bit more smoking.  The problem was the sauce.  Their \"signature sauce\" which I had to ask for an extra little container of since they don't have it on the table is awful.  Very ketchupy and red.  My husband said it reminded him of the cheap Kraft BBQ sauce from the grocery store.  I thought it was more like that red, sticky sauce on the ribs at a Chinese buffet.  Either way, that isn't BBQ sauce.  Ketchup should never be the main flavor you taste!  I tried my husband's ribs and they were OK, but not cooked long enough to fall off the bone.  They were barely brushed with sauce so pretty dry, but given how bad the sauce it that may have been a good thing.  

All in all, it was a wasted trip since I can get better BBQ at Pig Out and Horn Dawgs here in Pickering.  Definitely not going back.

PS:  One of their flavors of wings is \"Alabama Slamma\" and I asked what flavor that was since I am from southern Alabama.  It is honey garlic and hot sauce. We don't have honey garlic down there except in Chinese restaurants, so that name is totally bogus."}
{"text":"Not much of a dining room so we've always found take-out to be the best option - though the staff seems very friendly so suite your taste.

On the grand scale of BBQ this place is pretty good; the ribs are cooked well, the pulled pork and brisket are well sauced and moist, and the wings have a great smokey flavour.

I can't guarantee it's the best BBQ of your live but I can promise BBQ lovers won't be disappointed.  We often order it when we have company over and don't want to cook; their combos are a good size to feed multiple adults and we've had lots of over-stuffed stomachs and never anything left over."}
{"text":"After a round of golf, what better way to refuel than some good ol' barbeque? Big Bone delivers with a knock out punch of flavour and service! 

As a fan of Memphis Grill, I was pleased to find the food here just as delicious with the same down-to-Earth servers. I homelier feel. 

I had the BBQ Chicken sandwich which was very very delicious, not dry at all, and the bbq sauce was excellent.

It's a little out of the way for where I live, but if you're ever in the neighbourhood, Big Bone BBQ is a gem that shouldn't be missed!"}
{"text":"Poor food quality tonight....tough ribs and rubbery wings....not happy and doubt I'll be back for awhile"}
{"text":"The portions are huge! The food was not necessarily bad, but I wouldn't say it amazing either."}
{"text":"This restaurant made me so happy today. It was my first time going here. We were greeted by the friendliest waitress(she was a pretty, tall lady with long brown braids). I ordered the mini combo which included 4 pieces of ribs, cornbread, fries , coleslaw and 1/2 lb chicken wings. It was only 16.99 and a HUGE portion! It was beyond delicious. The ribs are smoked for 24 hours so they are so deliciously smoky and tender. The wings are so big /juicy and cooked perfectly. I suggest the fiery honey garlic sauce. All the staff members were really nice. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Had their classic poutine and the brisket. Big portion for their poutine and it's good. Their brisket is alright but could be more tender,  but their sauce is good. May come back next time for their rib which I heard it's good."}
{"text":"This place is quite good if you're dying for some meat - however, if just for wings I'd prefer All Stars or something and if just for rubs, probably Montanas. The place is quite small and seating is not exactly comfortable. Food is usually ok except for some dryness in their ribs."}
{"text":"Short and Sweet, unlike the food here which is big, loud, smokey and wonderful.. One might even say it's \"Ribbed For Your Pleasure\"

The magnificent, glorious Edwin A, organized a UYE earlier this week and I gotta give it up to him, this one was a blasty blast! We rolled up in groups for the $25 Monday Madness special... before rolling out the door too full for words. 

The restaurant itself is a touch off the beaten path (thank goodness for GPS), but the trek is well worth it. Staff are incredibly friendly, and courteous, and the smell permeating from the doors and into the parking lot is enough to make the most dedicated vegetarian reconsider their life choices (maybe not... but the smell is epic).

Plenty of seating and more to come as they are currently building a private/semi-private party room around one side, so keep this in mind if your group wants to Pig-out or go HOG-wild!

Monday Madness is simple and yet devastating: 1 Full rack of ribs, 1 lb or wings (I STRONGLY encourage you to do the slow cooked smoked wings), and an ungodly portion of fries. All this for $25 (tax included). 

Easily a 2 person, sharable portion, no questions asked. Many did this, but several of us took the gluttonous road less traveled and attempted to not only take on the madness solo, but timed ourselves because we have little shame. 

After 20 or so minutes I had only worked my way through a handful of fries, half a rack of ribs and most of my wings. TAP OUT! I was uncomfortably full!

They have an extensive menu of BBQ options, and I'll be back to visit this place again.

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Food great. Been few times.

Asked about WiFi. Waitress said they have but

Password is long and complicated.

Never bothered to follow up & get it for me. Wanted it so my little boy could watch show while I chilled."}
{"text":"Their Monday special is now plus tax, huf it is still very cheap for the deal. Other addons are very cheap and delicious"}
{"text":"Smoked wings and garden salad, since the fries come in frozen...

The wings were terrible... flabby and no real smoke taste. The BBQ sauce made it worse, liquid smoke and artificial flavours. 

Unfortunately they can't compete with the quality and taste of Buster Rhino's. 

The service was friendly and prompt but unfortunately that can't make up for a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place because I read the reviews and was really craving barbeque. This place is overhyped in my opinion or I caught the chef on a bad day. 

The service was nice but the food was bland and mediocre at best. I ordered the Elvis and when it arrived at the table, the platter looked so amazing. Sadly, as I tried the rib first, it was tough and not fall off the bone unlike what a reviewer said a week ago. The ribs also lacked flavor. I don't usually like overly flavorful things but these ribs were really really bland. 

The pulled pork was okay, kinda tough but the sauce helped cover up that a little bit. The wings were the best thing in the platter. It was the only aspect I liked. Cornbread tasted bland while the beans felt just like eating canned beans. 

I really had high hopes for this place since I saw so many rewards on the walls as well as a packed place on a Sunday night. Not a next time for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ restaurant.  I've eaten at many restaurants in the south, and this place is on par. Go for the Elvis Combo!   Very nice staff too.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would! OMG this place is everythaaaaaang!!! From the cornbread , to the fries- which are the best I have ever had annnnnd of course the RIBS!!! SPECTACULAR!  The best ribs I have had in my life."}
{"text":"AWSOME & Authentic . Great food and good prices for the food and the portion . I would recommend this little restaurant as a great go to for friends going out for a bite of BBQ . Liquor lic. Also .."}
{"text":"I was sooooo excited to try this place out, since there are virtually no bbq rib places in the GTA that I know of that aren't part of a franchise (ex. swiss chalet, montanas etc.). First off, I'm going to tell you to come on a monday so you can order the monday mania special for about $25. With the combo you get a FULL rack of ribs (which is pretty much already worth the $25 if you just ordered that), PLUS a pound of wings, and a choice of fries or salad. The ribs themselves were ok, not mindblowing, but surely better than what I've tried in the GTA thus far (not that there's much to compare with in the area). The ribs were not tough, and came off the bone relatively easily (not fall off the bone though), and the bbq sauce was alright. We tried the gar par wings, and everyone loved it, fries are also very nicely fried. Overall, I really enjoyed the food here, and will happily visit every monday if it is convenient!"}
{"text":"I love the smoked wings. It's like tasting the best of Memphis without the road trip or flight. Brisket is consistent and pulled pork is satisfactory. The restaurant itself is not exactly the place you go for a hot date but for a quick lunch or take out is a great treat. Prices could be better but you do get a real southern US treat. Keep in mind the tradition of the food is more Bible Belt flavoured than Texan. 

Regardless if this could be moved into a better location with a nice bar and better seating - this business would have tremendous potential."}
{"text":"Came back for the Big Bone Combo: 1/2 Rack of beef ribs, 1lb of wings for $20.25. The 1/2 rack equated to 7-8 huge pieces and the wings were sizable as well. This combo came with crisp fries, the standard coleslaw (this time without any purple or carrot), and the unreal bacon baked beans with molasses which are probably the best beans I've ever had. 

The ribs were slightly dry, but the flavour (dry rub) was impeccable, with a big bowl of their house BBQ sauce on the side they were finger lickin' good. The smoked wings were incredible, sizable and smoked perfectly boasting grill marks. I got hot creamy parmesan sauce on the side which was runnier than iI thought (a good thing) and was very tart, and I love sour. 

The service this time around was also significantly slower than the time before, nonetheless not enough to stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to eat. I have been here several times and have never once had an issue with service and the food is always amazing. I would HIGHLY recommend everyone try it."}
{"text":"Friendly faces everytime I walk in to this place. The best in town is the Monday mania deal $25 for 1 rack of rib, 1lb of wings and large fries. And this deal is all day long. Best time to go is before 5pm.  After that, it will be crazy busy. The food quality is always good,  tasty juicy ribs. They are like St. Louis cut ribs, meaning more meat on the bone. Signature BBQ sauce is my choice on the ribs.  The wings are huge, I like em deep fried and the backyard BBQ sauce. Fries are the same you get from Costco so nothing really special. Take out or dine in. Prices are just right for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"This is our second time visiting for dinner!! This place is awesome great value and the servers are fantastic! They always make suggestions to help provide great value!! Love that! They are definately looking out for their customers as opposed to the bottom line."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

It's about time Markham gets a BBQ restaurant. Located just east of the Loblaw's / LCBO on Bullock. Lot's of parking in front of the restaurant and a good amount of seating inside. Lot's of people were stopping by for takeout. 

I visited during opening week so I Imagine they still have some kinks to work out. When we arrived, no one greeted us and we were not sure if we should sit ourselves or order at the cash first. After standing at the cash (and being ignored), we sat down. No one came to serve us at the table either. I finally got someones attention and asked how we place an order. They apologized and said they didn't see us.     

I only raise this point as I hope they use the feedback to improve since their food is amazing and I want this place to be a success (so I can keep coming back). Once we finally placed our order, the service was great.

We tried the Elvis combo (mixed platter) and the Brisket sandwich. The ribs were excellent with lot's of meat and smoked perfectly. The pulled pork and beef brisket were also very good -   great smokey / tangy flavour. The cole slaw made for a good side and the baked beans were a standout for me - love the chunks of pork in there. Fries were average at best but who cares - this place is about the BBQ.

Prices are on the low end for what you get... both quantity and quality. You can get a large delicious meal for about $10. 

I will return again when the next BBQ craving kicks in. All the kinks should be worked out by then.

{"text":"For many years I've longed for good southern BBQ in Markham. Sure, we have a respectable ribfest once a year, and you can get decent pulled pork and wings at a number of pubs, but what if I want a proper rack of ribs in January?

Ever since I noticed that this restaurant had opened, I've been dying to try it, and the positive Yelp reviews have only furthered my lust for proper Southern BBQ. It's been a very busy month so it took until today for me to make the trip (it's only a five-minute drive!).

I must say that this place delivers! This is very respectable BBQ.

I had the \"Elvis Combo\" with fiery honey garlic wings. The fries and cornbread weren't great, the beans and coleslaw were merely adequate, but this meal packed a punch where it counts! The pulled pork was phenomenal -- the sauce was amazing and it had just the right consistency. The ribs were also fantastic, with falling-off-the-bone meat and a delicious \"secret recipe\" sauce. The wings were also impressive. They were quite large and had just the right mix of honey and heat that the name implied. I will return to sample some more flavours of wings, but this one was certainly a winner.

In terms of the restaurant itself, it's nothing special and it's pretty small, but it's what you'd expect from a BBQ joint. There's a small selection of bottled beer and a large TV tuned to sports, but this isn't really somewhere you'd go to watch the game with your friends.

The service was very friendly and helpful.

There appears to be a small patio out front as well, but this has yet to open.

It was pretty busy today, and I hope this is a sign of things to come because I want this restaurant to do very well!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! 

I visited on a Monday night at around 8pm. Since this place closes at 9pm, it was probably passed their busiest traffic and there were quite a few empty tables. I got a table for 2 and the server immediately offered to clean a table for 4 for me and my brother, and said that it would be more comfortable if we could enjoy the wings with a bigger table. 

We ordered a Monday special with wings and a full rack of ribs and a side (can be Caesar salad or fries) for $25. The portion is huge. If I weren't super hungry and ordered fries instead of a salad, we probably wouldn't be able to finish everything. The flavors were pretty good and I like how the meat was not too salty. The salad was very fresh and I love the real bacon bits!

The atmosphere is alright. It feels like a family style restaurant, nothing fancy but good enough for having wings and drinking beer with a couple of friends. Would definitely come visit again!"}
{"text":"We ordered the mini rib platter comes with 1/4 rack of ribs, 1/2 lb. of wings, some fries, cornbread and baked beans.  The portions were not generous, the wings ok, the ribs were overcooked(fibrous), and the fries were scant, and the beans, maybe 2 ounces?  Even Swiss chalet's ribs are better, at least tender and fall of the bone good.  I expected better than store bought ribs(  M and M meats) are the best. fall of the bone ribs!  Not worth the 16.95 price,  Maybe it was a bad day for the ribs?"}
{"text":"I brought a friend up here recently that was starved for BBQ due to the inclement weather this time of year. We picked up takeout and he was thoroughly pleased, so much so that he brought his mother up when she was visiting in town.This is \"the\" place for BBQ in this area and most people really enjoy whats on the menu,  I dont eat here often myself as I judge competitive bbq throughout North America and my taste buds are somewhat jaded when it comes to this style of food. I will say however that it is the best I've tasted North of the Border and well worth a visit to this fine establishment."}
{"text":"Tastes great, large portions, good prices, and amazing service! Will be back!

Tip: The restaurant is quite small (seats maybe 40?) so come for an early or late dinner to avoid the wait, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays, or just get takeout."}
{"text":"They have Monday special mania here! Rack of ribs plus chicken wings plus coleslaw plus tons of deep fries for only about 20 bucks! Well worth it! Just thinking about makes me go back this coming Monday! Love the staff here, they are very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came here while waiting for my car to be fixed nearby. Had some excellent ribs and wings. Good portions for the price and good services.

Quality: 8/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 7.5/10. Overall: 8/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"Service was terrible last time I was here. It took more than 10 minutes of standing around before we were seated, even though there were many seats available. The Monday deal is pretty good for price but in terms of quality, many of our ribs were burnt, as well as the chicken wings. 

I really don't like eating burnt meats. There are definitely far better places to get ribs."}
{"text":"This is another place that is worth writing a review.

Not taking away their food quality credit, I must say it is hard to find out this restaurant unless you are specifically looking for it. You would not expect where it is located, especially a wings and ribs place. It is located in the industrial plaza.

Anyway, ribs are decent. You can of course choose from many different flavor options. Apparently they have been on the ribfest many times so they definitely know what they are doing. They also have different party rack options that are suitable for 5, 6. 7 or 8 people. But please, pace yourself. Dont over order.

Space-wise and general interior design isn't the greatest but hopefully thats not what you are looking for when coming to Big Bones. 

Lastly, I can tell you that you can order poutine as well."}
{"text":"Best barbeque joint in Markham! Super friendly staff who are eager to give you honest recommendations if you're not sure what to get. All the barbeque is made on site and tastes fresh, and is never dry no matter what you get - ribs, pulled pork, chicken wing etc. They offer a variety of chicken wing flavours, with flavours as mild as honey garlic, to their spiciest one, 911 Inferno (definitely worth trying)."}
{"text":"Food here was pretty great. Friendly staff, cool atmosphere for an itty bitty place.
Had the potato soup which, batch of smoked wings, and a batch of ribs. 
Soup: very awesome, nice chunks of potato and perfectly creamy base.
Wings: not as smokey as expected and asked for well done which they were not.
Ribs: perfect, fall off the bone
Service: very accommodating. 
The only reason for giving 3 stars is the oopsie at the end of the meal. My bf took off his jacket when we sat down so not to slobber sauce on his ridiculously expensive custom hoodie from LA and as our server quickly left with our empty plates, he drizzled bbq sauce aaaall over the above mentioned hoodie. 
Will return making sure we wear something we don't mind getting sauced on!"}
{"text":"Not my favourite BBQ joint in Toronto (this goes to Smoque N Bones), but definitely great for what is nearby in Markham. The ribs are tender and I adore the  chicken wings (honey garlic and hot sauce). The French fries taste similar to costco fries. 2/3 times I have been there, they ran out of coleslaw :( But I survived."}
{"text":"I came here expecting the ambiance to be a little more upbeat, but it was dark, quiet and a little try. Other than the atmosphere, the service was friendly and the food seems to be a hit or miss. 

Between my friend and I, we ordered half a rack of ribs with fries and two pounds of wings. 

The ribs were disappointing imo. The meat wasn't very tender and you had to rip the meat off the bone with your teeth. Definitely not the fall off the bone type. It had a great smokey flavour and the sauce was sweet but not overwhelming, but I don't think I would order this again. The fries were those delicious crispy costco fries. Yum!

For the wings, we ordered one pound friend with honey garlic sauce and the other pound was original smoke. Both wings were absolutely delicious in their own way. The honey garlic was perfectly sauced and crispy on the outside. The wings were also really meaty. The smokey flavour was unexpectedly good. I usually love my chicken fried so I didn't have high expectations for these wings, but I'd say I loved it equally as much as I did the honey garlic. 

The sides of coleslaw, beans and salad were just ok and the corn bread was terrible. I wouldn't recommend it. 

I will definitely be back for the wings and fries."}
{"text":"Found this place online and decided to meet some people here for lunch.  Then I mentioned our plans to a friend who said the food was out of this world.  Really? I asked myself. They're pretty hip, so it's surprising they're that passionate.  Yes, it is that good.  I could not finish my meal!  Everyone was happy, and the couple we met there have been turned into converts, as have the others we told about our meal to later in the day.  What are you waiting for?  Stop reading this review and go now!"}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer at this location and it makes me sad to report that the proprietors have become both arrogant and condescending. 

On Monday night my father in law and I dropped by a little before 8pm to order the Monday special. I should note that most of our visits are on the weekend at full price.  As soon as we walked in the lady who runs the place informed us that they had no ribs. When we asked what they could substitute for the ribs in the special she replied by saying 'nothing, we don't apologize for running out of food. It means that we were really busy and had a great day'. All I can say is wow.

This is a rib joint, right?  The fact that they run out of food so early in the evening is gross mismanagement at best, or misleading advertising at worst. However, what has earned them one star is the poor customer service and patronizing attitude.  

There are plenty of good rib places out there. Highly recommend Memphis on Islington north or 7.  Needless to say, nor me or my family will be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome bbq! The place is pretty small so if you wanna eat with a large group, it's best to call in before hand and get take out. Great staff and great decor."}
{"text":"This is the best place for BBQ in the GTA! I've been going here for years and it has never disappointed. The owners and staff are super friendly and make you feel at home. Great food awesome people. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"My quest for the ultimate BBQ in the GTA continues.  

It was all... Ok.  Everything was a bit dry.. Had the combo thing with various meats.

Meh?"}
{"text":"I come here for their Monday special. Full rack of ribs, 1 pound of wings and fries for $25 (tax included).
The portion is huge, it can easily fill 2 people (with leftovers)!
They have a good selection of wings flavour. Wings are saucy and the fries are crispy. 
Ribs can be a bit dry sometimes but nevertheless still flavourful 

It is a good take-out joint where you can enjoy it in your home on game nights. There's also a  good amount of seatings that I imagine filling it up quickly on game nights."}
{"text":"3.5/5 

Stopped by with a coworker for lunch, on a Friday round 12:30. There were a few groups sitting but tables were available. Ordered the mini combo (3 bones of ribs + 1/2 pound of wings) while coworker ordered the pulled pork platter (1lb). The signature bbq on the wings was very flavorful. The ribs were alright, with the smoky taste being very evident, although the meat could have been nicer off the bone. Highlight for me was the pulled pork, the BBQ flavor was good and the portion was insane. Both came with fries, beans, coleslaw and some type of sweet bread that was good when mixed with the sauce.     

Good value for the price (around 20 when its all said and done). Service is friendly and good, noticed that many of the take out customers seemed to be regulars. Would like a bit more lightning and a more updated seating area (seats are also a tad tight) but that is separate from the food."}
{"text":"Can be hit or miss with the ribs but more often then not they are pretty darn good. Smoked wings are different but good. Coleslaw, corn bread and beans are all good. Fries are great but get soggy if you order them for take away. Wasn't impressed with the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this restaurant and they didn't disappoint me again. We purposely came here on a Wednesday for their beef ribs and it was definitely tasty. I loved the barbecue sauce. The meal came with corn bread, coleslaw, baked beans, and fries. I did share my meal with my husband and it was just enough for both of us :). I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! The location is not very obvious so it's easy to miss, but the food is delicious! I had the pulled pork sandwich, and it came with a generous portion of salad, with cups of coleslaw and beans as well. The pork was so tender and had just the right amount of sauce. You really get your bang for the buck here!"}
{"text":"Have driven past this place many times snd finally decided to get some lunch while my car was being tended to next door. It was a very early lunch & the place was empty except for a few ppl waiting for take out. We got the pulled pork sandwich & 3 bone lunch combo. The Pork & Ribs were really nicely flavored and prepared very well. The Fries reminded me of Costco fries but I've always liked them so. The coleslaw & beans were decent, not really a huge fan to begin with so. The corn bread was a negative however, too dense and grainy. Both of us really enjoyed our entire meal otherwise and will definitely be back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"They have a bunch of chain restaurants ... and there amazing. Smoked food. You get way more than what u pay for too. Which I love ;) really good. Def will be going back. Under $20 you're leaving full"}
{"text":"Big Bone has great BBQ. From the ribs to the brisket the food is great. Monday take out deal is great. Eat in service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight at 7pm. We had to wait around 10 minutes for a table. The place has not many tables at all. Which is a shame as most people get takeout. 
We ordered #4 party pack - consisting of a full rack of ribs, 1 lb of wings, 1 lb of pulled pork, beans, coleslaw, cornbread, fries and a tub of sauce.
Two kids burger meals, potato & bacon soup and an order of onion rings. The food was plentiful and tasted great. Our ribs were a bit tough and not fall off the bone at all. The corn bread was too dry for me. I think that my favourite was the honey garlic chicken wings. They were nicely flavoured. I would have liked to try the spicier flavours but one of my kids does not eat spicy foods. 
Service was ok, needed a water refill but the ladies were too busy serving the multiple take out customers.  I will definitely return for the wings alone. We packed up 2 boxes to take home, but we did order a lot for 2 adults and 3 kids. 
They have a Monday special for only $25 inc tax and that comprises of a full rack of ribs, 1 lb of chicken wings and a large fries or salad. Good place to go for meat lovers."}
{"text":"Great ribs and wings. On Mondays u get a really great deal with their Monday Mania special.  I found the ribs sauce at this location is a bit more sour compare to the Newmarket restaurant.  The Newmarket one is a bit more sweeter.  Don't get me wrong both is very good. Guess it's just my sweet tooth.  If you order wings, get the smoke ones.  Way better then the fried ones.  If you are in the mood for ribs or wings, this is the place to go.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is our usual spot when we are craving for some ribs, always good service. Newly renovated patio and extra room, give it a try.

$70 party combo = 2 full racks + 2 lbs wings + fries + beans + coleslaw , love their ribs and must try the Texas BBQ sauce for your wings 

$7 onion ring basket - crispy with dipping sauce on the side.

This was Enough to feed my family of 5"}
{"text":"I came again last week for like the 7th time and as I was checking in Yelp I realized I didn't actually review this place yet. Holy smokes! (pun intended) 

I highly recommend coming with a bunch of friends to share one of the party packs. You'll get a bunch of sides and a bunch of proteins. The ribs are not fall off the bone because they're smoked (so they have a bite) but they're extremely juicy and moist. You're usually given a bit of extra bbq sauce on the side but if they forget to give it to you, you can ask for some to dip your meat. The smoked wings are also really delicious and pretty big. Pulled pork is also quite awesome in house (make sure you don't order it for takeout though because it wasn't as tasty). The brisket was the least impressive. Actually it was disappointing tbh. Gave it multiple chances as my friends and I got it on different occasions and it was dry every time when it arrived at the table. I would stay away from the brisket.

The coleslaw is above average, the cornbread is good if they give you a batch straight out of the oven, the fries and baked beans are average.

Arghhh, forgot my waitress's name the very first visit (so I can't name drop her) but she was the friendliest lady. Service was very good on subsequent visits as well but first time leaves the best impression obviously. 

Finger licking good indeed."}
{"text":"We get take out here on Mondays once every few months as a very special treat.  25.00 for awesome fall off the bone full rack of ribs, we get the smoked wings ( non breaded ) and a huge house salad with a great house dressing. It's enough for 3 carnivores plus left overs to take to work the next day for one of us ( me usually being the lucky one ). Love it and can't beat the Monday night deal.   Which reminds me Monday is just around the corner !"}
{"text":"Wow!  The rating is for customer service, not the quality of the food, i haven't gone and wont.  Recommended to go to this place so I went to their website to check their hours and see if they were open for lunch.  Couldn't easily determine this info so I called the number on the website which rang a few times and went to an automated voicemail that hasn't been setup yet.  I sent an email to the site asking if they were still in business in newmarket as the phone went to a dead end with no information on and the response was.  \"That means we are really busy, not out of business\".  No info on their hours, or \"sorry we were really busy\".  Won't be going here."}
{"text":"decent hidden away place     large portions of good bbq, come with an appetite for sure.   One note is both visits, the kitchen staff are snacking on food as you can see into the kitchen."}
{"text":"Quote from 7 year old. \"I loved this so much. Food was very good and the chef was nice.\"  We hit this for a son and father lunch during a trip to Joyride 150. Great way to spend an afternoon. Smoked wings were great. We split the big bone combo and had a hard time walking out.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Thinking of BBQ on a Monday night? Head to Big Bone for their Monday special: $24 bucks gets you 1lb wings, 1 rack of ribs, and fries! Enough to feed a couple of hungry people and then some!

I try and not go here too often cuz let's face it, this is strictly indulgence and it will go straight to the hips! The smoky flavours are amazingly good, the ribs really nicely done, and the sauce selection for the wings enough to please anyone! On this visit I enjoyed the jerk sauce and it was pretty good! The ribs are the highlight, they will leave you finger licking with each bite! 

Okay enough already, my mouth is watering just writing this review!! Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"I stopped by this location instead of Memphis BBQ in Woodbridge.  

This place has a lot more seating and there is a big screen TV if you want to watch the game.  

The service was excellent.  My server was very nice and directed me to their specials.  I ordered 2 lbs of breaded wings with their signature sauce.  The server offered me a drink while I waited.  I had just started to check in on my Yelp app when the food arrived.  

My daughter devoured her stack of wings.  It says a lot that their signature sauce is also used on their ribs and pulled pork.   The trophies on the mantel tell you that this sauce is a fan favourite.   Along with their wings we had some onion rings.  I love thick cut rings but these were thin cut.  Tasty but not my fav.  

In Winter they offer potato soup which on a cold day like today went well with our meal.  I appreciated that they use real bacon and not fake bacon bits.  

It was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"If you really like ribs, don't look anywhere else, until you try Big Bone BBQ. After the first visit to Big Bone BBQ I am already a fan. I was a regular at the Toronto ribfest for the past 5 years until I tried Big Bones ribs. I don't have to wait anymore for the ribfest and I don't' have to stand in lines (OMG, those lines kill) and I don't have to hunt for the table and sit right under the blazing sun, Thank you, Big Bones. Meat melts in your mouth.Service is good, I would say really good for a tiny place like that. It is quite a drive for me, coming from Yonge/Sheppard area, but I would absolutely use them for lunch or take-out. Ribs, fries and pulled pork are great, wings are not that good, but, look at the name - don't eat what they don't specialize in. Absolute success!!!"}
{"text":"Once again the vortex of the franchise world has claimed another victim.
New ownership. The new boss talked about the reno and how it was much needed. Well the second I walked in and didn't see James- the big black dude who knows his BBQ, I knew we were in trouble.
I was assured the recipe was the same, so I gave their Monday mania a shot.. They needed some time because they were waiting on a rib delivery ??!!. So we waited and eventually grabbed our box of food to go.. I will say the lady behind the cash was very friendly.... But as soon as I got in my car.. The smell was different.. Usually the smoke from the ribs and wings would permeate the air in my car... This was a good thing... Not tonight .. A different smell... Kinda porky but definitely not smokey.
Then as we opened the box and dove in, right away the tenderness was a serious issue.. Like I expected, a short cut was taken and the ribs weren't smoked long enough which gives them their uber smokey flavour but more importantly their tenderness.. I'm sure they will still do well because most people are cheap and you can't beat their $25 deal but if the ribs go downhill along with the fact they serve frozen fries and barely edible coleslaw tsk tsk tsk.
This isn't a Tim Hortons, this is a BBQ joint and having a BBQ master is a REQUIREMENT for a place like this so the tenderness and smoke level can be tested before the customers take their food home.. Anyways I'm done and won't be coming back unless they bring back the rib meister-James."}
{"text":"YUMMY! Was craving ribs and saw them on yelp and decided to give it a shot on a Monday to try their Monday special ($25 : Full rack of ribs, 1 lb wings, fries, onion rings or salad.  My bf and I really enjoyed it.  And thank god we came when we did.  5 minutes after we were seated the restaurant had a huge line. 

Our ribs weren't dry but not as saucy as I usually prefer so I just  asked for extra BBQ sauce which made them perfect. Their spicy honey garlic (for the wings) is not spicy for me. So if you like spicy get something hotter then a 3 star heat.  The flavor was still great though!  

We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I was checking the new business openings sections on Yelp and noticed a Southern BBQ restaurant opening in Markham and I thought I definitely have to try it out since there are no Southern BBQ restaurants in Markham and definitely something different than your standard fare of Oriental cuisine.

I ordered the mini combo ($14.75) which consisted of 3 bones of ribs, 1/2 lb of wings served with fries, coleslaw, beans and cornbread. 

The coleslaw was nice and creamy and the beans were decent and with a nice tang of sweetness. The fries were average. I had the fried wings coated with their signature BBQ sauce, it was definitely above average, in my opinion, good wings are hard to find in Toronto in general. As others have mentioned, the main highlight was the ribs, the meat was tender and fell off the bone and it had a nice smoke to them. Also the ribs had a fair amount of meat on them and minimal fat, nothing worse than eating ribs that are completely fat and no meat. 

The place is small but very clean and the service is very friendly. It's definitely a great addition to the Markham area. Whenever I'm in the area and craving for good southern BBQ, I'm heading to Big Bone BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is every meat lovers dream.  I am a huge meat lover and let me tell you this is the place to be.  Not too sure which place has dry ribs and pulled pork that tastes like leather.  Deff not the Big Bone.  I have been to the restaurant multiple times and never been dissappointed.  The ribs are super tasty and tender the smoked wings are insane.  The beans i can eat of a pale of them.  The fries are very crispy :).  I dont like corn bread so I cant rate that.  The service is also grate food came quick and HOT.

Too all the meat lovers BIG BONE is the place to be"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and awesome food! The value for money is very good. Love the ribs and smoked wings; the fried wings are good too. I normally get the big bone combo and one minor complaint is not enough corn bread and coleslaw included. Haven't tried the pulled pork but I'm sure I will as I will be coming back for many years to come."}
{"text":"Markham is a sexy city. Haha jk. When do you hear those 5 words ever. Just look at its suburban population, flat landscape, and lack of arguably the sexiest type of food ever: BBQ. Not Korean BBQ, the good ol' fashioned, American, backyard, beer belly style BBQ. Big meat, big sauce, big flavour. In walks Big Bone holding a spatula and hollering, \"I got yer back, neighbor!\"

Located sneakily beside the giant Loblaws, you'd think this place was a little take-out joint. Nope, it's got a fully functioning restaurant inside with a surprising amount of seating and someone actually taking orders. I'm sure I'll take advantage of this one day, but on Superbowl weekend, we decided it was entirely appropriate to get take-out. (Actually, it was just a coincidence). 

We got Party Pack 5 which included 3 racks of ribs, 2 lbs. of wings, 2 lbs. of pulled pork, cornbread, fries, baked beans, and coleslaw. We also threw in 2 salads to make ourselves feel better. At a total of $140, we fed 8 people with leftovers! 

The ribs were of the chewier variety, not the fall-off-the-bone type, but it had great smoky flavour. The wings were fried perfection. We picked Dry Cajun and Hot Creamy Parm, and both were wiped out before half of the guests arrived. Fashionably late doesn't cut it when there's BBQ on the line. The fries were Costco fries and were understandably a little soggy after the ride home. Surprise favourites of mine were the baked beans (sweet and hearty) and cornbread (nice and dense). 

With the significant lack of American BBQ in Markham, Big Bone must be cherished and enjoyed as frequently as possible. You can now host your very own Markham Ribfest wherever, whenever you want! Oh, but you made New Year Resolutions to eat healthier? Well...it's ok, you gave a good effort in January.

{"text":"Ordered Big Bone from Uber Eats for dinner and my boyfriend and I were definitely not disappointed. Dry rub cajun chicken tenders were amazing with their ranch sauce, and their Southwest Poutine was delicious and came with nachos, which was a nice surprise. My boyfriend is from the south  (Tennessee) and he loved their cornbread, which he said tasted very authentic. Food was so good that he's said \"I can't wait to eat the leftovers\" about 5 times now. The only thing we were slightly disappointed in was their chubby garlic cheese bread which was not very garlicky but good nonetheless. We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Great. I love the ribs. I wish they had more of a selection of sauces for the ribs (they do for the wings). Affordable and you get a lot with the full rack."}
{"text":"In my opinion, they have the best wings and ribs in town. Whenever I have a craving for chicken wings, this is my go to place!"}
{"text":"'My updated update'  thank you Nick and staff  for taking my food allergy seriously! 
We have a received a call back shortly after my updated review. And management has reached out to clarify the misunderstanding, It was a very nice apology. We were offered a credit from the order taker,  For when we are back in the area. We appreciated the gesture. And hopefully it will be followed through with, Thank you on Their end."}
{"text":"What's with all the positive reviews people?!  I was excited to try this place since the reviews were so positive but my experience with this joint was horrible. The tables, chairs, washrooms, and dishes were all dirty, sticky, and just gross.  The sides were among some of the most bland and dry sides I've had anywhere. The wings were on par with any wing joint out there. Not any worse but definitely not any better.  The pulled pork is really dry and mushy but they drench so much ketchup flavored BBQ sauce on it that it makes it possible to swallow it down.  And the ribs, which is what I was most looking forward to, is dry and meatless. It's pretty much all bone, barely any meat on them at all."}
{"text":"Called up BBB for a company event and they came through in a big way.
Not only did they open earlier to accomodate, they also made some changes to the food platters so it held better for travel to the work place.
Excellent customer service and the food was fantastic. Ribs had breat smokey flavour that wasnt' as apparent before. The pulled pork, Wings and baked beans were also great. My only gripe foodwise was that the cornbread was a tad on the dry side but i think it could be due to the fact that this was picked up early and they had to make it earlier or the day before."}
{"text":"BB BBQ has always been a destination for me to try.
It never came to fruition as their sister branch is closer for me. 
Memphis BBQ in Woodbridge was satisfying enough as is.
Much much more convenient than driving to Newmarket or Barrie.
Secondly, I've always heard about that Purple Pig Smokehouse.
The one that closed before I had the opportunity to feast.

Situated in what used to be a Greek Family restaurant,    3.5'd
I had a hard time getting the Greek out and BBQ house in.
Although the decor isn't my bone of choice, I like the Meal.
The similarities with Memphis is easily recognizable.
Menu for one is identical and even the Meal itself served.
This means consistency between the branches, very nice.

Mini Combo($14.75)
3 bones of ribs, 1/2 lb of wings
----
Perfect amount of sauce as you'll found little to no drippings at the bottom of plate.
The BBQ sauce is well balanced, not overwhelming sweet.
Beans had small chunks of BBQ Meat great to dip Fries.
Smokiness brings out the savoriness of all the Meats.


The Fries are batter ultra-crispy variety, you can find elsewhere too.
The Slaw was quite soaked as I let the liquid drip off first.
I've got to say the Cornbread is a second thought.  Basic recipe type.
I was full beyond believe for the Lunch that I left some Fries untouched.

As much as I like the Smoked Wings selection, I won't ever get it alone.
Flavours there but when smoked with the small sized Wings, it's not filling enough.
That's why it's good to eat along with the Combo as a snack.

Welcome to Maple."}
{"text":"Ribs were a little on the dry side? And needs more flavour inside as well. The wings were good and cripsy and the salad they substituted the fries with was pretty big. Onion rings were okay.. Would pick Harvey onion rings over them though."}
{"text":"We went to Big Bone BBQ for dinner. I ordered the  Elvis combo which came with half a pound of wings, 3 ribs and pulled pork. It is a lot for one person and you will probably have leftovers. It comes with cornbread, fries, coleslaw and beans as well. 

The ribs were pretty good (meat comes off the bone). The wings come with sauces on the side and were really good. Everything else was just okay. I really liked the fries. This is good value for what it is. 

There's decent seating for groups. I would probably return if I have a ribs craving. There were some mixups with our orders but it got resolved."}
{"text":"By far the best wing and rib place in Markham. I came here a few times already . The combo options are great for variety. The ribs are tender and juicy. Would recommend this for a game night or even a late night snack."}
{"text":"Came today for a birthday with a party of 5. Staff was very accommodating when we were trying to hide the cake from our friend, and brought it out after our meal. We got the party tray #4 which came with a rack of ribs, a pound of wings, a pound of pulled pork, coleslaw & beans, and large fries/onion rings. Food was very good, ribs were delicious, basically falling off the bone and large portions. Pulled pork came with BBQ sauce on the side, and very flavourful. The waitress was nice enough allow us to split between 2 flavours for the pound of wings because the restaurant was slow for a Tuesday evening, which they don't usually do. We chose the creamy parmesan and the original, which were both delicious. The waitress would frequently stop to check up on us which I appreciated, and was very flexible with providing us cutlery for our birthday & when splitting the bill. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Big Bone as it is a bit closer to my house than Memphis and it did not disappoint 

75% of the Ribs had more meat on them than I have ever got from Memphis which was great. The Ribs themselves were very smokey flavoured and the sauce here does not seem to be as good as at Memphis but it was still very tasty. 

Coleslaw and cornbread were comparable."}
{"text":"So I had heard nothing but good things about this place. So being a foodie led me to try this place out for my self and boy oh boy, I was not let down, this place is the perfect bbq joint, where their main focus is to serve up a nice eat. The place looks like a beat up and going out of business joint, but that's not significant since this place is all about the bbq and focus mainly on food. I had the signature smoked bbq wings, and I can officially say they were the best wings I've had...ever.  Even the fries that are served with the wings were freaken amazing, well crispy like none I've ever had at any wing joints. Would i recommend it to anyone, he'll f****n yeah !!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my confusing reviews that I have to write about because there were things that were great and some not so great. To start off, the waitress that worked their that night was really friendly, attentive and quick. She tried to help us while having other tables to clean and customers to attend too, so I appreciated that a lot. When it comes to the food, I ordered the big bone combo which consists of half rack ribs, fries, smoked wings, coleslaw and beans. The ribs were definitely amazing, much tastier and succulent than any other places by far. The only disappointing part was the rest of the food did not live up to par. The wings were cold and taste funny (not good). The fries soggy and cold. I also had a gravy and I was expecting it to be great because they said it's homemade and not the powdered mix in hot water gravy.... I was not amazed. My boyfriend got the pull pork combo and the pull pork is definitely decent, I don't mind ordering that if I come back again."}
{"text":"I usually get the Monday special which includes a rack of ribs, chicken wings and fries.  The cornbread here is delicious as well.  The ribs and the chicken are both excellent and their bbq sauce is awesome.  I always enjoy my meals there and for $25 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Me and my BF love going to ribfests in the GTA. But where would we get our BBQ fix during the colder months?? Big bone bbq!

This place has huge servings! All of the items we have tried have been impressive, except for the fries, but that's just a side, right?

Their sauce is great, ribs, pulled pork, wings, corn bread. Everything is delicious.

This place is always busy especially during dinner, but a lot of the customers are take-out customers.

This is my go-to BBQ place and will remain to be so.

{"text":"Finally got a chance to try the food here and we were not disappointed! We got party pack #4 - full rack of ribs, 1lb wings, 1lb pulled pork, 4 slices cornbread, baked beans, coleslaw, large fries and an extra tub of BBQ sauce. We had enough food for 4 people easy. The ribs had a good texture, some bite but still tender and the smokiness came through beautifully. Chicken were good, nice and crispy - and I should also mention they have a TON of flavours for the wings...everything from sweet to spicy, creamy or dry rub. Pulled pork had some nice flavours but didn't pick up as much smoke. Fries are fries, nothing special but i guess it goes hand in hand with most take out meals. Beans were good. The cornbread had a slight sweetness and good crumble. Coleslaw is nice and creamy with a slight tang, my husband loved it!
All in all, we definitely come back again for the ribs! Great prices, quick service and you are guaranteed to be full afterwards!"}
{"text":"Always a treat going to Big Bone, AMAZING smoked wings, UNREAL ribs, and a great laid back atmosphere with quick and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"This place is finger licking good.  I cannot believe that I haven't been here before.  The staff are friendly, the food is perfectly smoked and flavored.   An absolute MUST try in the maple/ Vaughan area. 

Plus the prices are very fair, and portions are large."}
{"text":"I've been here 2-3 times now and I always enjoy it. The smoked wings are amazing and the pulled pork and ribs are popular too. This place is out of the way and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I was up in the neighbourhood and I decided to try this place out.  It's located in an industrial unit off the major road but it's not hard to find.  
The waitress said I could sit wherever I wanted.   I picked a seat facing the tv so I can watch the baseball game. 
I ordered the mini combo; three ribs, half pound of wings, fries and beans for the sides. 
When my food was delivered to the table I thought the waitress made a mistake with my order.  The plate looked huge with way too much food for what I ordered.  I asked her about it and she said there was no mistake.   Wow, I sure got a lot of food for $17.  
I ordered the wings fried with Cajun seasoning although you can also order them smoked.   The wings were real good as were the ribs.  The sauce on the ribs was a nice blend of tang and sweet.  However I found the ribs didn't have a lot of smoke taste.   The beans were also nice.  
I couldn't eat all the food and ended up asking for a to-go container for the leftovers.  
I would defiantly come here again !!"}
{"text":"My brother first introduced the family to Big Bone BBQ and Wings a couple of years ago. In the 4-5 times I've eaten there, their ribs and wings have generally been consistent in quality and flavour.

We usually order the big bone combo which comes with a 1/2 rack of ribs and a pound of wings. While the ribs are not fall-off-the-bone, they are meaty and moist and have enough sauce to make them flavourful. We usually get the honey mustard wings, which are lightly breaded and crispy and come slathered in lots of sauce.  

The combo comes with coleslaw and baked beans as well as cornbread. I prefer more of a vinegar based coleslaw than the mayo based coleslaw that is served, but the presence of a bit of vegetables is a welcome interruption from all the meat and fries. The fries come lightly breaded and remained crispy even to the end of our meal. Was a little disappointed in the cornbread this time around as it was a bit dry in texture and lacking a touch of sweetness that I prefer.

Despite the small critiques about the cornbread and coleslaw, the ribs and wings combo provides fairly good value for the money ($23.95) and comes with a lot of food.

{"text":"We ordered using Skip the Dishes so I can't comment on things like Ambiance, Table Service or Wait Times in this review.

What I can say for a fact is the food we got was delicious. My wife got the Pulled Pork Sandwich which she found to be amazing. Just the right amount of sauce and the meet was tender and flavorful.  I had the mini combo which consisted of a half pound of wings and three ribs and I enjoyed every last bite. The sauce was just right and everything was cooked the way I like it. For sides with had baked beans (excellent) coleslaw (excellent), fries (good but not amazing) and garlic bread with cheese (meh). 

So bottom line for me is everything that should be good at a BBQ place was really well done. I would likely sub the fries for more of one of the other sides next time. As for the cost...very happy with the price I paid for goods consumed."}
{"text":"I had a long chat with the BBQ chef and he is well trained and versed in good old BBQ

They have over 20 wing sauces from Signature to dry cajun to hot thai to hot creamsicle to the murderer of 911 Inferno

But its not just the wings they are a Memphis style BBQ joint , sauce is sweet tangy and BBQ has very good smoke flavor. Don't wear nice clothes to this place because it can get smokey if you are having a sit down dinner.

Best deal is on Mondays where you get a full rack of ribs, 1 lb of wings and a large fries or salad for $25 smokey bucks which is like $15 bucks off regular

The menu offers a great selection of your usual salads, obviously ribs and wings, variations of in a sandwich format or burgers, fries and a special piglet menu for the little pigs in your farm

The wings can be ordered in two ways. Their original smoked which are marinated for 2 days then slow cooked in the smoker, tossed in the BBQ and then glazed in sauce

OR

Fried wings that are coated in a 10 spice mix and fried and are served up plain or with the various sauces

The ribs and pulled pork  and beef brisket is slow cooked in the smoker for over 4 hours

These guys rate up there with the Tennessee rat hole BBQ joints but we get the experience here locally"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in for some Big Bone. Wasn't disappointed. Super friendly staff made our lunch take-out \"picnic\" a snap. Wasn't cheap though: 4 or us ate our fill for $70."}
{"text":"I was looking for the 6 star button. First off it tastes great. And the portions are more than enough. What a great feed. If you had to pick a bone....sorry.... it's a tiny restaurant and only seats 20 or so. ALOT of people come and go for the take out.  It's great. You won't be Disappointed ."}
{"text":"My friends recommended this place for a lunch date so we went and I was expecting good things. 

We went on a Friday for lunch so when we got there, there was only one couple eating in. We were able to sit down and order quickly.  The interior isn't anything amazing - a simple storefront where right when you walk in, you're faced with the counter where you order and to your left is most of the seating area - tables and a couple of booths that, in total, seat max about 15-20. But you aren't here for the atmosphere - you're here for good eats.

I ordered a mini combo ($15.95)- 3 bones of ribs, 1/2 lb of wings, fries, coleslaw, beans and cornbread. When it arrived, I wondered how I would finish the meal but, after the first few bites of the ribs and the wings, I knew it would be a delicious challenge. 

The sauce I got on the wings was their Signature BBQ. I think this was my favourite - crispy, juicy, and big in flavour, I had to pace myself from finishing all of them at once. 

The ribs were good - nice, soft, and tender. While not exactly fall off the bones, they were delicious and seasoned and rubbed with a good amount of spices and sauce. The ribs actually reminded me of ribs my family would make so I was expecting something different from Big Bone - something that couldn't be duplicated. However, their ribs are still delicious and I would recommend them. 

The sides - fries, cornbread, beans, and coleslaw were all really good. Fries reminded me a bit of Costco fries, the cornbread was a bit bland and drier than I expected, the beans were sweet and delicious though might not be for everyone, and the coleslaw was yummy - not too sour but light and creamy. 

It was definitely a great experience and I would come here again and will recommend it to friends and family. The best part about the end is that, although you'll end up consuming a huge amount of food, you aren't left with a greasy and bloated feeling.  I especially loved their wings and coleslaw (which I usually do not find myself liking). Big Bone has a Monday special where you can get a rack of ribs and a pound of wings and one large side for $25 - a great dinner option for the fam! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Big Bone BBQ serves up solid BBQ at a fantastic value. I did not expect to be anywhere near that full when I came here and I am quite satisfied at this elusive BBQ joint in Markham, so kudos for big bone for being a respectable BBQ option in the area. 

Came here with a friend and we both ordered a mini-combo as it comes with just about everything you would want, and the southwest poutine/nacho hybrid side. That was our first mistake, getting the same thing. Second, we didn't know how food was in the 'mini-combo', oh the irony! Half a pound of wings, three bones of ribs, corn bread, an absurd amount of fries, and beans. We ended up finishing everything but the fries but I am pretty sure you can share the mini-combo! Three, we didn't need to order the fries. Actually, no one needs to, especially with the amount they give you! More on the fries later. Four, don't get the same side, i.e fries. 

Food wise, the BBQ portion was definitely satisfying. The smoked wings were my favorite of the two. Big flavourful wings and their BBQ sauce was fantastic. It was not too sweet, yet had the right tang to it. The ribs were also good but could have been more fall off the bone tender. They were pretty big as well and were as easily smoky and tasty as the wings. So I approve of the BBQ here!

The corn bread, beans, and the coleslaw were all pretty standard. The fries I have the biggest issue with. I am almost certain these are the (frozen) crispy Costco ones which I am not a big fan of at all. They're overly salty and simply lack potato. I wish they would have their own fresh cut fries, it would make a world of a difference. And given how much fries we had, it feels like such a waste. Luckily my friend took it all home (hopefully he finished it). I shouldn't be talking this much about fries at a BBQ joint though so my apologies. 

The southwest poutine/nacho side was interesting. It was essentially a regular poutine topped with red onions and jalapeños with a side of nacho chips and sour cream and salsa. It was simply too much fries for us and overall it was nothing special, at least it didn't cost much."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night. It was relatively slow. The food was not bad. Their pulled pork is no good. Their burgers are good, the brisket is absolutely amazing. I think you really need to come and enjoy this diner during their peak hours, when it's busy to be able to feel the full ambience and experience of eating at a diner serving hearty comfort food. All in all, it was not bad. I will find time to go again during the weekend to finalize my review."}
{"text":"My hubby & i are huge fans of ribs, so we were super excited when this place first opened.  We used to be regulars at the Markham Ribfest, but once Big Bone BBQ opened it became our fav place to go. Ribs all year round - what's not to love?! Plus better than any of the ribbers we tried at the last 4 ribfests we've been to!

Just had BIg Bone BBQ 2 nights ago after not being there since last Summer and they did not disappoint! 30 minutes before closing and everything was fresh and NOT like it had been sitting around on the bbq waiting for someone to order. Hubby & i split a full rack and a brisket sandwich and we still had leftovers!

The full back of ribs - HUGE, meaty, juicy and their bbq sauce & seasoning is so delish! A full rack is enough for 2 to share with 12 pieces.

Brisket sandwich & the pulled pork sandwich - Good amount of meat on these sandwiches and their delicious sauce & seasoning on a perfect sized bun for these sandwiches makes it difficult to decide on which to get!

Don't get excited over their fries. They are crispy fries, frozen, definitely not fresh cut. But if you're heading over for their fries, then you're going to the wrong place! Their meat is what makes them a hit! Oh...and their baked beans are out of this world. Also not a fan of their coleslaw, but the sides are not what takes me there, it's the meat!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 6 stars. Ever since I first came here, I have been totally addicted. I just can't stay away.

They have an awesome menu, great chefs, and really awesome staff.

I cannot get enough of their coleslaw. Eat a large order to my face everytime I'm here. Then there is that brisket sauce. I'm in BBQ heaven.

Try this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So far this has got to be my favorite place for ribs in Newmarket. Plus you get a monster serving with your order so its well worth the money to eat here. Last time I called in my order and they had it ready for me in 5 mins (and I ordered alot., I binge eat lol) so the speed of getting food to belly = win.... Go here."}
{"text":"The only thing missing from real Texas style BBQ is: white bread, pickles and onion slices. And blackberry cobbler homemade. 

Otherwise awesome.

A model for BBQ is http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-salt-lick-bbq-driftwood"}
{"text":"I got the ribs I wanted. In my last review, the only negative was that the ribs were a bit in the tough side. Not so this time!!

I ordered a half rack and wings combo (mistake since I was not THAT hungry). The ribs were just as tender and the Ribfest guys, meaning I don't need to wait until next summer for a good mess of ribs. 

The lemon pepper wings were also a win, crispy, salty, lemony, peppery all in perfect balance. 

An extra star is justified as Big Bone moves into my list of the Big League!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few co workers for lunch because i saw the reviews.  Well...you are all right this place was so good.  Every single thing on my tray was to die for and this place is a must go if you live in the area and like BBQ."}
{"text":"If you're too lazy to BBQ yourself, check this place out!! The fries and ribs are my fave and the corn bread is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price!

Usually go for the affordable dinner - $9.50 for a 3 bone rib dinner.  It's plenty of food.  Includes the ribs, cornbread, coleslaw and fries!

Ribs:  Solid!  Better than few.
Cornbread:  bland :(
Coleslaw:  dry
Fries:  Plenty and tasty

The waitresses were friendly.  Small place with maybe 7-8 tables.  

I have been here twice and will be going again when that rib craving comes."}
{"text":"For 16.95 you can get ribs, fries, wings, slaw and cornbread which to me is a pretty good deal. If you're looking for a good meat or barbecue fix this is probably the best option in the area. It's not the greatest freshness but I did go in towards the later hours of service and you can tell they were rushed but I definitely would go back!!"}
{"text":"Quality:4.5-5/5 for Canada, some of the best BBQ I've had up in the north. 
Service: who cares (slow) when food is that good. 
Quantity: good/fulling. 

Pulled pork and alabama slamma wings were excellent. 5/5.
Beef brisket: soft but I've had better and sadly, would not recommend it here.
Ribs were fantastic 4.5-5/5. Soft and falls off the bone. Saucy so expect to get messy. 
Comparable to some of the best BBQ spots I've had in southern USA.
Sandwiches came with southern/sweet beans and coleslaw w fries or onion rings for roughly$10. Good deal. 
I will definitely be back. 
What a rack!!"}
{"text":"After all the raving reviews, had to try this place and a big plus is that its close to home for me..=D

finger lickin' good ribs..yummy...ordered the Elvis combo and shared with family member. It was alot of food and 2 of us had a hard time finishing it. I think maybe 3 people would work better. We were the only ones there and the owner were extremely nice that they gave us 3 more rib bones extra for FREE.

The ribs were really good, marinated with the signature BBQ sauce, meat was cooked just right where it was easy to remove from the bone and meat was tender...

pulled pork was quite good as well, I can tell they soaked it for a long period of time.

chicken wings were a bit overdone I think, smoked a little longer than anticipated and they covered it fully with the sauce to try and make it better but the wings weren't juicy....

cornbread and fries were alright.

All in all a solid 3.5** for food, service was good rounded up to 4...It alot of meat....I'm not a carnivore so it may be at least a month of 2 before I come back."}
{"text":"I think a lot of reviews sum it up pretty accurately: \"just okay\". 

We ordered beef brisket sandwich, which comes with a side of fries, coleslaw, and beans. We also tried a lb of the smoked wings, which also comes with a side of fries. The best way to describe it is not bad but definitely not good. But I guess you shouldn't try to find good BBQ in Markham.

The best part of the meal was probably the fries. They taste like Costco fries, and I really like Costco fries."}
{"text":"Terrific pulled pork sandwich. 
Decent price and quick service. 
Interior is ugly, food is good!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went for the first time on June 30. We sat down and I noticed that other customers were showing up to pick up their orders and most had big smiles on their faces as the left. I knew I was in for a big treat!

The waitress recommended the combo for the two of us and it was the right amount for my partner and me. The ribs were really tasty and the meat nearly fell off the bone. The BBQ wings were uniquely wonderful as well. 

Service was great and the wait staff friendly. The bill came out to I around $30 with tax and tip but without alcohol.

I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews but this restaurant really deserves it. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on yelp and I had to try Pitt his place. I have travelled a lot in my life time and have eaten in some fantastic places in the southern United States. This place raves them all melt off the bone meet smoked to perfection. I had the ribs and wings combo and the amount of food and taste was amazing. The sides and corn bread was something I didn't expect and again I crawled out of the place filled and a big smile on my face. For all the you got to eat here places in Newmarket this is one of them that should have been on Tv. Don't let the location or the smallness of the restaurant fool you this place has amazing food."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant.  Does not hold big parties.  Ribs although tasty not the best I've had.  Service when I went was awful.  The owner took full blame for the servers mistakes.  Wings are decent.  Would give it 4 stars if it was a bigger venue that could hold more people.  Eating in is stressful.  Great for takeout though!  The fries suck."}
{"text":"Wings were salty as hell, ribs were takeout but the amount of oil was like a half cup in the container! Pulled pork was tough as leather! Not impressed and will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. Haven't had a bad meal there, ever. Everything on the menu is good. I recommend the pulled pork and the brisket.  For an interesting change, try the smoked wings.  Owners are friendly and so are the staff. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A nice place off from the main streets - I liked it as soon as I walked in. Had the full rack ribs and 1lb wings combo. We couldn't decide on one sauce to toss the wings in so the lady suggested that we have the wings served plain and she'd give us three choice of sauce to dip on the side. It wasn't completely \"fall off the bone\" really good but I still enjoyed it. The wings were crisp and well done."}
{"text":"Concealed in an industrial area where streets are lined with Chinese car repair shops. This place is definitely not screaming barbeque goodness. However, that is far from the truth; very far.
This is yet another location for this pretty recent chain of barbeque joint that have invaded southern Ontario. I have visited their location out in Milton and the quality of their food is replicated quite well here as well. I still remember a number of years back when they were one of the staple ribbers at the many annual rib festivals that I attend to every year. I guess they have made it big!
Smokey, juicy and flavourful describes their ribs. While not quite fall off the bone as I like my ribs they are definitely tender. The wings are crispy and delicious but I wish that they went a little heavier with the seasoning. The fries and coleslaw is good but not spectacular or anything.
All in all a great barbeque joint with amazing prices (especially Mondays). This is definitely a place worth many revisits especially considering the fact that your options are limited (Markham isn't exactly known for an abundance of barbeque restaurants)."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout with my friend and we split the Beef Brisket & Pulled Pork Sandwich. I preferred the Beef over the Pork. I thought the Pork was way too greasy, the oil was dripping down my hand when I was eating it. I enjoyed the Beef Brisket more so, nice and moist and very tasty. The portion was huge. Mine came out to be $11.25 cuz I also ordered onion rings instead of fries. Pulled Pork with Fries was $9.25.  I didn't finished mine and had leftovers, 2 girls can share 1 portion. I would go back again to try their other items."}
{"text":"$25 Monday Mania!

I was reading so many great reviews that I got really pumped up for this place, saying this is rib fest worthy.  I don't know, I've had some at a golf club place and had it better. 

The wings were tasty, we got the garlic parm. I like the drizzled sauce and parm cheese. The wings were cooked well. They said it's medium spicy, but it's barely any spiciness to it. I guess if you're very sensitive to it, then it could be considered medium spice. 

As for the ribs, I'd say I'm disappointed mainly because I thought so much of it. I found it pretty dry and almost rubbery. The food came very fast, so I don't know if they made a bunch and just heated it up for us.  Maybe we just got a bad batch.

The staff were great, very friendly. It almost didn't feel like a franchise because they were really down to earth. Great people. 

Overall, it was a filling adventure for a very good price. If I'm in the area on a Monday, I may come back."}
{"text":"Shared the Monday Mania special with boyfriend: $25 for 1 rack ribs, 1 lb wings and side of fries or salad. Tax included. We also ordered a loaf of cornbread for $6. 

Wings - Dry Cajun with side of honey garlic sauce (..'cause I couldn't decide if I wanted dry or saucy wings...) I like the coating - nice and light. Good natural flavor, but it wasn't spicy.

Ribs - I like the sauce and smoky flavor, but some meat a bit dry.. could use more sauce! Great with the honey garlic sauce too. 

Fries - personally dislike fries with a coating.. 

Cornbread - needs work. Didn't taste like cornbread and edges were hard/dry. Actually tastes a bit better microwaved the next day.

Just  a simple, no-frills decor place and offers take out too. Suprised to find full-house with lots of families. My first time at a ribs restaurant so I was pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"worth giving a try! food was filling. I ordered alot.. got pulled pork lunch special ($9) upsized to poutine. i split this lunch with my sister and it was good portion.

I ordered extea for dinner 3lb wings..i found the flavour wasnt anything different rhan what I could get at fortinos..but it was good none the less. The thai wasnt spicy like we hoped but the flavour was good enough.

We got the beef ribs (full rack) flavour was yummy. it doesnt fall off the bone bexause its not pork for those wanting the falling off the bones effect lol.. but thats why u need to know when to go in and get the pork ribs.. (which wasnt available this day). but it was alot of food. they were nice enuff to give us alot of fries..small beans and cornbread. 

the beans are a little sweet..but very delicious. I enjoyed them. The cole slaw is tasty as well.

in all.. its a nice to trt and see what flavours are for u. I will be coming here once in awhile..not for the wings (maybe i should have ordered a different flavour?).

but ill come for the pulled pork, beans, fries and ribs. In all it was still delicious."}
{"text":"Big Bone BBQ is pretty good, wings, ribs and other stuff all above average and the price point is great too. 

Food - 4/5: my girlfriend and I got the Elvis, which had wings, ribs and fries. We for spicy honey garlic which was pretty good. My only complaint is that when asked if we could have 2 different flavours for the wings (making it a half lb each) they were unable to accommodate that request, even though they have half lb wings on the menu. The ribs were good, not too saucy and sweet, however they were a bit dry and over-charred. The fries were also good. 

We also ordered the pig skins - pulled pork and cheese on potato skins and those were amazing. They were definitely the highlight of what we ordered. The exterior of the potato skin was nice and crispy, but the interior wasn't dry at all. The pulled pork was also lightly marinated, which is nice as most places usually drown it with sauce to the point that you are unable to tell if you're eating pork or beef.

Service - N/A: we got takeout so this isn't applicable. However, if you plan on dining in I think I would recommend calling in advance or having a reservation as I noticed there were not too many tables available."}
{"text":"\"Finally a good BBQ place that you don't have to wait for a Rib Fest to get\"

They have a great monday special. Go there for that.

You can't get quality barbecue that they offer anywhere else unless it's at a ribfest. Very happy to give them a very good review. This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"So apparently I can only provide one update on yelp (which I find as a big downfall - but whatever. 

Arrived just after dinner time. Was politely and quickly greeted and seated. 

Was informed on the Monday night special. Quite frankly I forgot it was Monday (Thanks goodness). 

Had a brief look of the menu and I said f' it. Let's treat myself to a pound of wings and a full rack of ribs. 

Once I pleaded the order - a huge rack of ribs, a pound of wings, and a humungous basket of fries arrive. 

The smokiness on the ribs were amazing. They were authentically smoked (hopefully out back). The songs were stupidly good. Nice layer of smoked, crusty goodness. Think about it. 

The fries were nicely cooked - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside ~ think Costco. 

The staff were super nice and friendly. They were there all along providing excellent service. 




----/-------/--------





So the last time I came here I ordered take out. I thought that maybe the brisket I rode red was too tough for the chew but this time I ate in. 

Look - smoking brisket is a fine art. It takes time, a lot of failures and a lot of mistakes. 

The brisket in my opinion has not evolved since my initial order several months ago. 

The bread that it is served on is ok at best. Thick, overpowering, and doughy is how I would describe it. 

The brisket - unnecessarily doused in BBQ sauce that is not required when having an amazingly made brisket. 

There were no burnt ends. The meat was unnecessarily drenched in sauce. There were no charred bits and there was really no smoky flavour. 

While - at the same time, the baked beans had a nice fresh smoky char to them. 

I don't think the brisket is as fresh as they claim. There are much better BBQ places but unfortunately they are far away. 

This place is a 3/5 if you ask me. But the food is still edible."}
{"text":"Can barely type... body saturated with protein... floating up to that big flavour train in the sky.... Seriously folks! What a meal! Our first outing here was a delight. What didn't we order? Not much. Had a half-rack of ribs... excellent. Pound of wings, half smoked (stellar - YOU MUST TRY) and half fried (just as I like them) - huge pieces and the house BBQ sauce. Then I just had to have the Fantasy Burger. Smiles everyone, welcome to Meat Island. Great burger bun surmounted by gigantic patty, bacon, cheese, and a mound of pulled pork. For all I know there could have been a few other choice cuts tucked away in there. SWEET JUICY GOODNESS!!! Fries were nice. Baked beans great. Slaw good. 

All in all our $35 order could have easily fed 3, maybe 4. Instead of, errrr hemmmm, the two of us. 

Really nice folks to chat with while your order is cooked fresh for you. 

The family and I will be heading back for more - soon and often I hope. Have to try the onion rings and brisket and..."}
{"text":"Ordered one of the party packs one rack of ribs, 1lb of wings and 1lb of pulled pork added another lb of wings. Wings got the Signature BBQ and Golden thai fried wings. The ribs was a bit dry this time but the BBQ sauce is always good. The signature BBQ wings was so good, you get that good smoke BBQ taste highly recommend. The golden thai was pretty good. The pulled pork not my thing but it was good."}
{"text":"Big Bone BBQ & Wicked Wings - the name says it all! The ribs are big, juicy, and tender. They're actually better than most that I've had at RibFests! The wings are wickedly good, especially the original smoked flavour, my personal preference. The pulled pork is also quite good.

Their Monday Mania special includes a (huge) rack of ribs, a pound of wings, and a large order of fries. Unless you're a competitive eater, do not attempt to finish this on your own! At $25, including taxes, this is a fantastic deal!

The staff are really friendly and the service is good. Their menu also offers a variety of sandwiches, salads, burgers, and appetizers so don't just wait for Mondays to come around."}
{"text":"I ventured out to Whitby on a shopping trip and was happy to come across Big Bone BBQ & Wicked Wings, a restaurant I'm familiar with from their Markham location. I was one of only two diners at the time. Maybe I missed the lunch rush?

I ordered a pound of the Original Smoked Wings (my favourite) with fries and coleslaw. It arrived fairly quickly and tasted every bit as good as I expected - cooked just right without being too smoky. Yummy!

The staff were very friendly and the service was very good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Authentic, amazing ribs.  Smoked wings are better than any dedicated wing place.  

Fries are great, but other sides can use a bit of work.  I'm not fond of pulled pork with bbq sauce, but that's my personal pref.

All in all, great BBQ."}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled pork platter and 1lb of honey garlic wings.

The amount of pulled pork was huge and liberally sauced. The sauce itself was sweet, but one note and the pork lacked any discernible smoky flavor. The included slice of cornbread, slaw and beans were small and the Caesar salad could've used bigger bacon pieces. Make no mistake, the emphasis is on the meat and I'm grateful they piled it on.

The honey garlic wings were medium sized, sweet, but not so garlicky. We managed to polish them off despite the lack of garlickiness.

All-in-all, I'll be eating here more often, especially since their Monday and Tuesday specials look good."}
{"text":"Ribs were great!
Fries were great!
Wings were decent.
Pulled pork was way too sweet and pretty meh."}
{"text":"I was craving wings so a friend took me here. Place is pretty small-ish, with surprisingly cute bathrooms in the back! (Hehe.) Staff were friendly and attentive. We ordered the big bone combo to share (1/2 rack ribs, 1lb wings, fries, coleslaw, beans and cornbread.) The ribs here are SO GOOD. Smoky and saucy and tender.. meat lover's heaven. Loved em. We got the wings with the Fiery Honey Garlic sauce because I couldn't choose between sweet and spicy, haha. It was a great compromise; this sauce is really great and the wings are pretty good. Everything else in the meal is forgettable. Fries taste like the came from freezer bag, beans from the can & slaw from the tub. The cornbread I feel is probably made on site but not sure; it's decent. I just wish their other sides stood up to the quality of their ribs and wings! But it's small potatoes: this place is awesome. Will definitely be back if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. I had been dying to try it out for months and finally went. Had the Monday Mania Special for $25. Awesome value. You get a tone of food. 1lb ribs, 1 lb wings and a huge amount of fries. 
The fries were awesome. Couldn't stop eating them. Thank goodness for that, because the ribs and the wings were....meh.
The ribs were ok. Nothing different than what I could do at home. The wings I got were good. Not great. I had the Spicey BBQ flavor. My husband had the Hot Creamy Parm flavor. Those ones tasted really weird to be honest.

Overall, we didn't hate it, but we were both very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good prices especially considering the amount of food you get.  Ordered a mini combo, nothing mini about it.  Loved the ribs and wings, the sauces were great.. even the coleslaw was fantastic.  Definitely will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for a wonderful, smoky, brisket sandwich.  The cornbread is pretty good too.

I've tried several places that serve smokef brisket, and many that claim to.  This one is the perfect choice for quality, taste, quantity, and price.  Around $11 for the sandwich, fries, and two sides.

Wonderful!  I would take a photo but I was starving and have already finished most of it.  Couldn't finish it all though in one sitting."}
{"text":"I wish I had pictures to show massive amount of food you get. My husband and I split and Big Bone Combo (1 lb. of wings and 1/2 rack of ribs with 3 sides-free to sub) We did a double order of fries with baked beans. Way more than enough for 2. We forced ourselves to finish, but still couldn't. We finished about 95%. It's definitely a place to go, if you want your monies worth and good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today! Not at all what we expected, dining area is weird but who cares because we had INCREDIBLE food and INCREDIBLE service. We would go back in a heart beat for sure. Get the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here every opportunity I get to come to Whitby and each and every time is a great experience. I usually order the BBQ chicken sandwich and it's always amazing. I rotate my sides between fries or caesar salad. Alongside one of those choices comes some coleslaw and beans, but you can swap either of those out for a slice of cornbread. Asides from that service is always great and friendly. The staff is always more than willing to answer any questions you may have, or make suggestions if need be. I would definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Massive portions just like i remembered. Both pulled pork sandwich and beef brisket sandwich came with fries, baked beans and coleslaw. The baked beans were excellent with a hint of sweetness. The fries were so crispy and felt like it had a battered layer of extra crispiness. Haven't had good fries like these in a while. The beef brisket was good but I felt the sauce overpowered the flavour of the meat. The pulled pork had so much meat that you could have taken half the meat out and put it in another sandwich and make 2 sandwiches. $9.95 for each meal is a great deal for all the food you get."}
{"text":"amazing, amazing , amazing , amazing , amazing  $25 for 1 pound of wings, full rack of ribs and fries wow! and the ribs were big dam i'm full.................."}
{"text":"First-rate BBQ ribs in Markham

We usually order the Monday special for take-out rather than eat in. You get ribs, chicken, and salad for a great price. The ribs are smoked long and slow and fall off the bone but still moist. Occasionally they are dry so it is not always consistent - but BBQ food can be this way, risk is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is THE place to beat the Monday Blahs!!
 
Why you ask? 

Because this place offers the Monday Special, which offers some pretty good value for those of us that have carnivorous tendencies. 

Bad day at work on a Monday? 

No problem! Nothing like a big giant platter of meat to solve your blues. The Monday special is 1 lb of wings ( you can choose any flavour, but I would highly recommend the smoked wings (saucy, smokey and tangy barbeque sauce)) and a full rack of ribs in their signature barbeque sauce, along with a choice of fries or salad*. The price is a pretty wallet-friendly $25.00 with taxes already included in the price

The people here are pretty friendly every time I've come here and it's pretty easy to get in contact with them over the phone.

There are other offerings on the menu, but I find that it is VERY hard to beat the Monday Special for value and food.  I usually order this for lunch and split it with a few other people, just so I can spread out the nap that comes with the aftermath of eating all that meat.

The quality is pretty good, I haven't had a miss when it comes to the wings and ribs; although the fried stuff (since I usually get carry out) does get soggy during transportation. So if you are getting carry out, I would recommend ordering the salad (their Caesar salad is quite good) as your option."}
{"text":"The ribs are worth the trip.  Great customer service, juicy, sweet and meaty ribs.  Best I have had in the GTA, really (and I like to eat ribs when I can).  I hear from the owner that the trick is in the smoking.  Whatever it is I want them in mid-town soon.  Great food, good service - beats the city by far/"}
{"text":"Helloooo Smokey Goodness! 

I came to Big Bone BBQ last night with a group of friends. I'm still full from last night's dinner. I probably ate more than enough. Their portion sizes are huge. 

We got the NASHVILLE NACHOS, BBQ CHICKEN SANDWHICH, CHICKEN CLUB SANDWHICH, and PARTY PACK #2. There were 6 of us and we paid about $17 after tax and tips and a drink so really reasonable. 

The nachos appetizer was HUMONGOUS. It was $12 and came with sour cream, salsa, jalapeno peppers, cheese, and lots and lots of pulled pork. The pork was slightly sweet and delicious. 

I didn't try to the sandwiches but my friends enjoyed it. I only came for the meat! :P

The party pack #2 came with 1 Full Rack, 1 lb Wings, Beans, Coleslaw, Cornbread, Large Fries & Tub of Sauce. It says it would feed 2-3 people but it actually fed 4 of us. We are girls, but we can eat! The ribs is fall of the bone good and smoked in such a lovely way, I just want to savour the smell. We skipped the fried wings and opted for smoked since that's what they're famous for and it was mighty good! 1 lb = 9 pieces

The cornbread tasted okay. The texture is more pound cake than traditional corn bread and the beans were a bit too sweet. Coleslaw was fresh, crunchy and delicious. And the fries platter that came with the meal was HUGE! They taste like Costco fries which we love. 

Few things to note:

- Place closes early - at 9 pm every night. 

- You can get dipping sauces on the side so if you want, you can get your wings naked and then get some of the sauces on the side so you can dunk them in and try a bunch of different flavors at no charge! SWEET!

- The service is super friendly! And the vibe is great. 

- The place itself is kind of small. You really only want to come in groups of up to 4. We had 6 so we waited a bit until we got two tables combined. Most people come in to get take out."}
{"text":"I was nearby so thought why not. I ordered two beef brisket sandwiches and one pound of wings. I thought the food was average nothing  special compared to adamson bbq. The wings I found were too sweet and their brisket was really sweet as well since I tried really good authentic Texas bbq to be frank I was really disappointed since being four stars on yelp I decided to try it. Overall it was under par for me since I had really good bbq such as stockyards and adamson bbq"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, huge portions and the ribs and pulled pork taste great! We ordered two dishes to be shared by 3 and there were still leftovers. I recommend the combo with ribs and wings."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner on a Saturday night.  The food was delicious, we shared the potato skins with pulled pork to start, then shared wings with fries and the pulled pork sandwich.  The portions were large, prices were reasonable.  Service was a little slow, but still attentive.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been there almost half year ago, wasn't very memorable for me honestly.  Good portion size tho."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Big portion fair price.  The Monday's Special is excellent.  Be warn the Party pack is so big we usually half the suggested portion."}
{"text":"I'm from California I was looking for a good place to try . First of all customer service was really good I like good customer service ,second of all my order didn't take that long even though it was crowded and third the food was great , The meet was very tender the sauce was great. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone I will be back"}
{"text":"Whether it's deep fried or grilled, Big Bone BBQ never fails to impress me. I love the home-y feel when you walk in, the small yet always crowded seated area and the line out the door! It smells wonderful and tastes even better. I opt for the country club with a caesar salad. My boyfriend loves their fantasy burger (doctor's note required) and fries. The beans and coleslaw are a nice touch. The service for take out & dine in is great. Just expect a longer wait time during lunch and dinner hours. 

Trust me, it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"I heard about the Monday special - Full rack of ribs, 1lb of wings and basket of fries for $25 incl tax.  And reading the reviews, i had to try it.

I ordered it for pick up for 4:15pm. Wife picked it up, and dug in around 4:30pm, yes early dinner on mondays.

The ribs were dry and tasted very smoky. Wings were ok. Fries were ok. Wife and kids did not like the ribs at all.  Tasted like they were re-smoked from the day before...
So was not happy at all. Too bad, i had a craving for some good food. 
Take a look at the pictures and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Decided to try Big Bone BBQ for lunch. We were well greeted by the staff and they did not rush us to decide what we wanted. I decided to have the Elvis combo and my wife had the Mini combo. Both combos come with coleslaw, beans, cornbread and fries. My wife substituted onions rings instead of fries at no extra cost.
The food was delicious but the portions were a lot bigger than I expected. We had leftovers to bring home. Next time we will share a combo. The price was reasonable, considering the amount of food we got. Will definitely return and maybe have takeout next time since it's close to home."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is not pulled pork. Beware. The wings are tasty but really small. St. Louis are larger. Speaking of which everything is Kansas that, Texas this.. anyway, if you live in the area I recommend take out. Not only you save on the tip but also the service is spotty and the dining room really sad. To top it up at 8:30 they put up the chairs on the table to signal they are closing down. Yes, you read that right. EIGHT THIRTY."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch for 4.

I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. The creamy parmesan chicken wings didn't have much taste and the wings weren't juicy. The Caesar salad was pretty small for $7.50, since the bowl was so shallow. The pulled pork I thought was just average. I've seen better. Their menu is riddled with typo's throughout. The menu's have so many combinations and platters everywhere that it also gets quite confusing.

Service was lacking, we had our water refilled once and the waitress left before anyone else could ask for their water to be filled.

They're in an industrial area with lots of parking."}
{"text":"Finally tried Big Bone BBQ this past weekend after hearing tons of friends and family talk about how amazing it is. Small restaurant, simply furnished. Smell of smokiness throughout. Friendly staff. Ordered the onion rings starter and the combo meal with wings and ribs done in original sauce. To be honest, I think after all the hype, I had my expectations set too high. Don't get me wrong - it was tasty, fresh, and huge portions. But my ribs were not fall off the bone - not sure if this is the way Southern style ribs are supposed to be - or if I just got a bad batch of them. I pretty much had to knaw my way through the meat. Wings were alright. Coleslaw and beans were mediocre, nothing to write home about. I would probably come here again and maybe try a different sauce on the wings? And hope that my ribs are a bit more tender."}
{"text":"After visiting Nashville, I've been forever on the hunt for good bbq. Went here one day and the whole family got the pulled pork burger. I must say I quite enjoyed my meal here! Juicy and not dry and this place had a great grungy feel that BBQ places should have. I'm surprised I haven't heard more buzz about this place! Give it a go!"}
{"text":"We live  5 minutes from this location and used to order every few months. The last few times the food has been ok, not great, but decent enough for us to keep coming back. Today, we ordered half a rack of ribs, beef brisket, fries and corn bread. Every Item was awful! Soggy fries, dry and flavourless ribs, brisket was very tough and the cornbread was very  dry and tasted stale. I think this place has gone downhill. They really need to change something in order to compete with all the new restaurants in the area. I would love to support a small local business, but we will not be ordering from here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place.

As soon as I saw there was a BBQ place near me I was really excited. The ribs were tough and hard to eat. i will give credit to the sauce though that they slap on it. But it wasn't the BBQ I was expecting.

I did have the wings and they were OK at best, Good fry on them and a decent sauce. nothing to write home about though.

I might give them another try, but I'm not going to be going there any time soon."}
{"text":"Once you have the ribs here, you won't go anywhere else! Great prices for the quantities, and (other than the cornbread) everything is always great! Made a recurring customer out of me!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for one of those hole-in-the-wall type places that you wouldn't expect to be amazing, this is for you.
The portions are huge, the food is great, and the service is excellent! You wouldn't want to eat here every day, but when you're looking for a pile of great quality BBQ, this is the place."}
{"text":"Came here for the Monday special. $25 for a full rack of ribs and a pound of wings, and a huge basket of fries and salad. I had to share it with a friend otherwise I would pass out eating so much.

I like the ribs, juicy and huge! The wings are okay. The value is very decent for this monday special. The owner actually gave us their pull pork to try out. It is actually really delicious. I saw other people ordered their pull pork sandwich and that looks good. I would do that next time if I come by.

This place is actually in Markham. If you are someone who does not have a car, then hopefully some greasy finger friends you have can bring you there."}
{"text":"Love this place when I'm in town.   The mini combo is great as you get a lot of food.  The ribs are incredible, cooked perfectly with delicious sauce.  The wings are huge! The beans, coleslaw, cornbread and fries are delicious.   If you are a pulled pork fan then this place is a must-go!  I can't understand why anyone would go to a place like Swiss Chalet for ribs when Big Bone BBQ is nearby.  Must try for the fans of ribs, wings and/or pulled pork!"}
{"text":"The space was a bit cramped. If you have a large group, make sure you either come early or later. 

I definitely liked the portions here. They were practically American size. I ordered the Honey Garlic wings and it came with a lot of fries. The wings were alright but definitely not the best I've had. It was as expected. 

Service was good."}
{"text":"This is a small little place that serves really generous portions. We came as a group of four and ordered the meal for 3-4 people which included two rack of ribs, two pounds of wings, large fries, coleslaw and beans. The meal came out to $68 for four people which is pretty reasonable.

The ribs were the best of everything we ordered and I'd say this what this place is known best for. Meat is tender and slides right off the bone. The combination of the smokiness and barbecue sauce were great.

The fries were also really good. Very crispy and full of flavour. I'm guessing they are fried with the oil from the meat. 

Wings were OK. The wings themselves were fairly small but the flavours were ok. I'd still prefer Wild Wings over Big Bone.

The coleslaw was very bland. It also took in a lot of the odors and taste of the fridge. Wasn't pleasant. 

The restaurant itself is pretty beat up. Don't expect nice interiors and atmosphere when there. It's really all about the ribs lol."}
{"text":"Can't count the number of times we've ordered from this little place. Smoked wings and ribs are meaty goodness. I'm not even a baked beans or cornbread gal, but I can't stay away from Big Bone's. Oh yeah, the BBQ sauce is also ridiculously great for dipping. Fries are mehh, but I'm not a big fry person. I only like Mickey D's or NY fries. Newmarket location is not much of a place to dine in. We've only picked up orders, but happily  served 4-20 people."}
{"text":"My all time fave place for ribs in Markham! Originated from the Rib Fest, I'm so glad that they finally opened their own stores (3 and counting I think) :D! The meat seriously falls right off the bone and the rub is fantastic!!

Big Bone is tucked away in a small plaza right behind LCBO on Bullock Drive. Small cozy restaurant with wooden tables and chairs. Staff are very welcoming. I enjoy coming on weekdays... less crowded. You order at the counter whether you are dining in or taking out... and they will bring the food to you.

I always order the Big Bone Combo or the Elvis Combo. Great deal :) Both comes with ribs, chicken wings, fries, coleslaw, and cornbread!!! The only difference is Elvis combo also comes with a slab of marinated pulled pork meat #yum #carnivore lol.

I would highly recommend this place for all you meat lovers if you want some good quality, house-smoked, and satisfying BBQ ribs!!"}
{"text":"5/5 hands down! The value, quality and service were fantastic. We ordered the full rack of ribs dinner, which were delicious; great smokey flavour & tender. It included fresh coleslaw, beans, corn bread and fries (but we substituted for onion rings)

We also ordered the 1 lbs wings-honey garlic flavoured, which also came with fries. The wings were great. This was definitely a huge meal for 2 people, so be prepared with empty stomachs!"}
{"text":"Admittedly closer to a 3.5 star, but I'm definitely going to have to make my way back to get through a little more of the menu. Tried the pulled pork sandwich, and it did not disappoint! It was tender, juicy and full of flavor. The value was also notable, getting a hefty sandwich, fries and a drink for $10."}
{"text":"Ordered one of their party packs for when we had company over on a weeknight, and it was decent, but not groundbreaking.

We called ahead to make sure they had time to put everything together, and it was all ready by the time we got there to pick up. The food was packaged mostly in styrofoam containers, and everything was separated.

The ribs had a bit of bite, which is how I prefer them, but could have used more sauce. The pulled pork was quite dry, and the wings were nothing special. The house BBQ sauce was disappointing, tasted like something you could get from the grocery store. 

All in all, it was a lot of food for the price. I might go back if I'm in the area and wanting a quick BBQ fix, but definitely not dying to have it again."}
{"text":"Fantastic wings. Great find when looking for good food. Very hospitable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Big Bone has become my preferred wing joint in Whitby after our most recent experience. We called in an order of wings for dinner tonight. We had gone back and forth about whether to get the smoked wings or fried wings and decided on two orders of fried wings, two different flavors, fries and one slice of cornbread (for me). They were busy but quoted us about 25 minutes - the best part about this place is the location. I don't have to go far to get my wing fix so not only is it a shorter trip, but the food stays hot.

When I chatted with the guy on the phone and started to place my order, he asked me whether we were doing smoked or fried. After a bit of a chat, we decided to go with 1lb fried honey garlic wings and 1lb of their smoked wings in their house bbq sauce, fries and cornbread. He really sold me on the virtues of the smoked wing so we had to try them again - nice to see a business passionate about their signature product.

When we arrived, there was a bit of confusion with our order but it got sorted out pretty fast. We didn't wait more than a few minutes before our food was done. When we left, I asked my hubby to check to make sure my cornbread was in there and unfortunately it wasn't. I went back in and asked for it and the guy felt bad and gave me a whole loaf! 

After this meal, we're really torn as to which wings we liked better. The smoked wings were deliciously smokey and they've been finished on the grill so they've got that grilled taste/grill marks and char and their house sauce is great. But the fried wings are equally as good - nice and crispy and just the right amount of sauce. I think we'll have to stick with this order of half and half because I'm sure I'll regret it if we didn't get one or the other. The only complaint I have is that the smoked wings could have been hotter. 

I'm a big fries girl, anything goes with fries, and I reeeeeeally like these fries. They're the kind of fries that are delicious when they're hot, but you can keep eating them even after they're warm or even cold. Great to grab any leftover wing sauce off your plate.

And then... there was the cornbread. Oh my.... this cornbread is incredible. Thick thick thick slices, the top is sprinkled with just the right amount of sugar... slather on a nice thick layer of butter and I'm in heaven. I could seriously eat this stuff for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'm soooo lucky that I got a whole loaf to enjoy!! I think I'll make  point of stopping in just to get the cornbread from time to time.

Overall, excellent visit and its definitely cemented Big Bone as our new local wing joint. The staff here really care about their product and your enjoyment of their food. Really like the vibe we get when we go in - we'll be back!!

***Big Bone Cornbread Hack*** The guy behind the counter suggested this and we're probably gonna try it (if I don't eat all the cornbread first)- use the leftover cornbread for french toast!"}
{"text":"If I was one of those people who could eat whatever they wanted and never put on weight,  I'd live here!  

I am amazed by the portion of food for the cost and how good it taste.  Every time!!!! 

If you've never been here. Try it on a Monday, no one wants to cook on a Monday anyways so go grab their Monday special I think it's 1 lb of wings and ribs and fries for $25 tax in (don't quote me though because I like to order a bunch of stuff.... no matter what it's worth it).  You won't regret it!!! The only thing you'll regret is not ordering more on Monday to get you through the week."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworkers. It wasn't busy when we got here around 12 (which was awesome). 

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which is surprisingly humongous and worth it compared to the price. Came with a lot of fries and two sides - beans and coleslaw. 

The pulled pork sandwich is literally pulled pork in a bun. I ate the pulled pork separately from the bun as it gets quite messy when I eat it together! The meat was flavourful and delicious, marinated with BBQ sauce. 

The service was decent, the waitress came to check up on us a few times."}
{"text":"Ordered a party pack 5 for my party on a Friday night. And WOW! It was just a glorious amount of food. For $123 with tax included, you are looking at a huge portion. I honestly have to say I got a great deal. We had pulled pork (9/10), ribs (8/10), and chicken wings (8/10), a giant box of fries, 2 containers of coleslaw, beans, and one container of sauce.  I called in to order this party pack one day ahead of time, although the lady on phone said that I didn't necessarily have to but it's preferred. Just a note, my fellow yelpers! I will most likely return and enjoy some more bbq."}
{"text":"I went here twice in one week because I love BBQ and this is the only place in Markham that I know has it. Otherwise, I would have gone to Stacks.

The first experience was good, I ordered the Elvis Combo, which consisted of 4 ribs, half a pound of pulled pork and half a pound of wings. They usually give you cornbread, coleslaw, beans and fries but the great thing about this place is that everything can be substituted including the cornbread. So, I substituted the fries and beans for onion rings and the cornbread for another coleslaw. The portion was huge and most of my friends were unable to finish their food. Not me, I'm a fatass and I finished it both times.

The food was not cheap, I paid around $27 with tax and tip included. I think that's average price for BBQ food though.

The second time I came here, I wanted the Elvis combo again but this time I wanted to try the brisket so I asked if I could replace the pulled pork with brisket and just add another 2 dollars to the bill since the a la carte section showed brisket being 2 dollars more than pulled pork. I guess they didn't want more money or it was not worth it for them because the chef did not want to do it. I was standing by the counter as the waitress asked. Speaking of the waitresses, they are very attentive and check up on you once in a while."}
{"text":"Great food great service as always they are always busy but always worth the wait food is always fresh staff is happy and smiling"}
{"text":"Ribs are great. Get the combo # 3. 2 racks ribs 2 lbs wings. Wings are either smoked or lightly deep fried. Not overly breaded. You get coleslaw beans and cornbread. Great value for the money. Good selection of different sauces for the wings. They have about 6 or 7 beers available. Pop is just in cans. Likely the best bbq joint in markham. Good for both table service or take out."}
{"text":"Each year Toronto Life Magazine puts out an Eating and Drinking issue that is comprised of hundreds of restaurants.  They also include restaurants that are out of the downtown core, Big Bone BBQ just happened to be one of those places.  Chain BBQ joints are seeming to be popping up everywhere, so when an independent, and authentic one opens up, you know that i will be going there.  Wings are one of my top 10 fave items, and after watching so many episodes of DDD's, i had being dying to try smoked wings.  They were absolutely delicious, they were smoky without being spicy, my only complaint is that they weren't that hot, temperature wise.  To contrast the smoked wings i opted for a deep fried and sauce wings.  They have over 20 sauce options, we chose the Kansas BBQ, it was slightly spicy and vinegary.  If you order two lbs of wings you pay $18.90, plus you get fries as well.  I have had fries at probably over a few hundred restaurants, and these were probably the best fries that i have tasted.  They were so crispy, and salty, and even though everyone was so full, we kept on going back for the fries.
Being from out of town i wanted to make sure that they were open before i committed to the hour plus drive, unfortunately their hours are not posted their website.  A fellow Yelper mentioned this as well, it is a simple fix and i hope that they add the information to their website.
Overall, even though Big Bone is located in a tiny strip mall in New market, you would swear with the food that you were eating, that you were in the south.  I love the food, and i cannot wait to come back for some more good BBQ."}
{"text":"The service was good we did not end up waiting to long for the food. 

We had the ribs and 2 lb of wings. The ribs where all fat and not that good but the wing where average we had honey honey garlic and signature BBQ the best was the French fries."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located on Bullock Dr and McCowan Rd. Tucked away from the main roads, but still easy to find because of the bold sign and hilarious motto - \"Everybody likes a nice rack.\" 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
The staff are very down-to-earth, funny, and personable. We had trouble flagging down a server for our bill, but we knew they were very busy because we visited them on Victoria Day. 

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
The wooden chairs and picnic-esque tables made me feel like I was at an actual outdoor BBQ while staying inside, and away from things that can trigger my allergies. 

[QUALITY] - 5/5
Rack of ribs was high quality and barbecued beautifully. Wings were also high quality and tender. Salad on the side was fresh. 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- Monday Special (includes 1 rack of ribs + wings + 1 side dish) - $25.00: the highlight was definitely the rack of ribs - charred to perfection, and paired with sweet and savoury sauce. Wings were also saucy and delicious, but not as phenomenal as the ribs. For the side, we opted for a refreshing salad. You can also choose fries or onion rings. 

[OVERALL] - 5/5
Definitely worth the value, and the best place for mouth-watering barbecued ribs in Markham. I would definitely recommend Big Bone BBQ & Wicked Wings for their Monday Special (available on Holidays)!"}
{"text":"A BBQ gem in Markham! Its my usual go to place if i'm craving ribs and wings.  I usually order take out, 10-15 mins my order is ready for pickup!  Fall off the bone ribs, crispy fries. Hot garlic parm wings is my favourite so far."}
{"text":"First time -pulled pork nachos were good. Second time smoked wings were good, pulled pork nachos were very disappointing; no consistency in quality.

Third and LAST time...

The owner wasn't there today - the girl at the cash didn't seem to careless. Ordered a party pack - got home to find the coleslaw was missing as was the sauce for the wing. And as the pulled pork contained was weighing down on the fries container - they were squished and soggy. The corn bread was stale and the beans tasted like they were from a can. 
Waste of $50.

Next time we'll make the drive to KW to Lancaster Smokehouse or Greg's Hickory Pit in Buffalo."}
{"text":"Yum yum. I love the chicken wings here. The wings are smoked for 2 days and taste amazing. The sauce on their smoked wings are the best. Even the fried chicken wings are excellent. Their French fries are the best ever with huge portions. 
The only thing I don't like is the long lineups some weekends when it is difficult to get a table. The place is very small with limited"}
{"text":"This is the best comfort food, Newmarket can give you. Their food is so delicious and always fresh, I never had any complaints. The prices are reasonable and you get a lot of food for what you are paying. I usually get the mini combo which is more than enough food for one person, I always end up sharing with my mom. My boyfriend always gets the big bone combo, which always has toooooo much food. He always thinks he can finish it but always ends up having left overs. 

Ribs: I love the ribs, just the right amount of fat and fall off the bone meat. I love it when they are a bit more saucy but they are still as good the way they are. In the mini combo, there's about 4 pieces of ribs. 

Chicken wings: My favorite go to sauce is Creamy hot parm but I was super disappointed that yesterday they ran out of the parm sauce so instead I opted for fiery honey garlic which is good too but the hot creamy parm is everyone's favorite. 

Fries: The fries are always piping hot and fresh when I pick up my car. I live 10 minutes away and was surprised that the fries were not soggy when I got home. They were still crispy and hot.

Sides: The combos usually come with cornbread, beans and coleslaw. I always substitute my cornbread for a side of gravy instead. I'm just not a fan of cornbread. Plus the fries are amazing with the gravy. 

This location fairly gets busy during 6-8pm, if you're calling in, it can still take up to 20 mins because the place gets so packed. Still very worth it. The staff is amazing too. They're always happy and I never had a grumpy server cash me out. 

If you are looking for some good wings, ribs or fries, come here. Can't wait to try other things they have on the menu.

TIP: If you are planning to take out food, ALWAYS CALL ahead and arrive a couple minutes early. Save yourself time from sitting on the stool for a long time and watching people eat their food while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Big Bone Combo ($23.95)
This is supposed to come with 1/2 rack of ribs and half lb of wings, but I wasn't feeling for wings so I asked if I could have had pulled pork instead. The cooks were kind enough to agree! The ribs were really good. The meat was really tender fall off the bone kind. The pulled pork was a little dry and really relied on the sauce - I kinda felt like I should have stuck with the wings (the wings look really good!) But there's always next time! Comes with a side, I choose onion rings. They were so good!

The Texan Poutine ($11.50)
Poutine topped with 15 hour smoked beef brisket. The beef brisket was really really good! The meat was super tender and flavorful. The fries were extra crispy. Loved this poutine!

Food was food and the staff were friendly.
Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Wow - smoked wings - awesome; fall-off-the-bone goodness. Fried wings - awesome. Ribs, finished on a grill for a flavourful char. Fries, slaw & corn bread - all done up right as well."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and after a Monday night game of \"what do you want to eat?\", finally did. 

We called in ahead of time for the Monday special I've heard so much about. For $25 including tax, you get a full rack of ribs, fries and a pound of chicken wings (roughly 9 wings). The girl on the phone was very friendly, and informative and was kind enough to let me know they have 30 flavours for their wings.

We were told the order would be ready for pickup in about 10-15 minutes, however we came a bit later so I cannot fully confirm the speed. The restaurant itself is inviting and the decor is rather nice, however this place is small. Large groups will probably have a hard time getting a table.

The fries were more chewy than crispy, kind of like curly fries. However fries are fries, and I love curly fries as much as super crispy ones. 

For the wings, we chose mild honey garlic (not my choice). The flavour was decent, and the wings were good, yet nothing overly outstanding about them. Perhaps if we chose another flavour with some spice I would have been a little more satisfied. 

The ribs are a bit of a wild card for me. The ribs are big, the flavour is excellent and they smell and taste SO SMOKEY. However I would have liked a bit more sauce on my ribs. Some of them were a little dry, but the ones with sauce were very tasty. Also important to note, these ribs were not fall of the bone and juicy like you would expect. That was a bit of a let down, but the flavour was definitely on point.

Overall I'd give this place the higher end of 3.5 stars. The flavour was good, and for the price and portion you're getting, you really can't complain. If those ribs had more sauce I probably would have bumped up my rating to a full 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great little barbeque place on Bullock Dr! Would never have known it existed until I started going to the gym next door (oh, the temptations lol). It's just east of the Loblaws & LCBO plaza on Bullock Dr. If you pass Laidlaw Blvd, you've missed it.

Limited menu but got all the BBQ essentials with great prices and portions.

Highly recommend the beef brisket sandwich! The ribs, pulled pork, and all the sides are worth a try too!"}
{"text":"i absolutely love big bones. i've only come for their infamous monday rib+wings+ side combo for $25 and it is always on point. it's gonna be busy for sure so they wait might be a bit but i usually call in ahead of time for pick up and it's not too bad. combo is to feed 2-3 people."}
{"text":"This would be my third time to Big Bone but just haven't had the chance to write a review. This time around when I went with my boyfriend I noticed there was a change in ownership. The couple that worked there the cook and the waitress were super nice. We went at 11:30am and it was empty maybe because they just opened at 11am. We did noticed while eating there was alot of people that  ordered through ubereats. The uber guys kept coming in to pickup food orders. The waitress took our orders and suggested the Elvis combo so that you get a little of everything. My boyfriend got the Elvis combo which comes with fries, ribs, pull pork chicken wings, corn bread, coleslaw and baked beans.  I ordered the big boned combo with ribs, chicken wings and all the other side items with onion rings.  I don't like pull pork so this combo was perfect plus you also get more wings and ribs than the Elvis combo. It was a lot of food! waitress recommended the naked wings smoked and plain. We tried the plain and the glazed and liked the glazed better. The smoked wing was great but it was plain and no taste. I would give this place a 5 star since the ribs and the wings were good ( wings were a little tiny thou) and the service was amazing.  However a few negatives - the pull pork my boyfriend said tasted old and tasted like it was sitting out for a while. The coleslaw tasted like it was expired the cabbage tasted funny. Also the cornbread was very stale and the wings were tiny. If all those other items can improve this place will definitely be a 5 star!  I felt like the food was a lot better with the old ownership."}
{"text":"One of the fully fledged BBQ joints in the Markham area. Doused in a sea of Asian restaurants, Big Bone BBQ is nice to see for a change.

Today's order was the Party Pack 4: 1 full rack of ribs, 1 pound of wings, 1 pound of pulled pork, beans, coleslaw, cornbread, and fries (we opted for onion rings instead).

The ribs are sauced pretty sparingly but the ribs themselves are pretty juicy. There's a bit of tug and give when you pull the meat off the bone, but that's normal.

We got our wings dressed Dry Cajun style: fried wings with their Cajun seasoning. They were juicy as well, but most of the seasoning fell off. Despite them being 'dry', I would've liked if they adhered to the wing somehow.

The pulled pork was lightly pulled - there was still a lot of big chunks we had to pull ourselves. It was a bit on the saucier side and pretty sweet. Probably my least  favourite. 

Baked beans were fine, nothing special. Coleslaw weren't that great. And the cornbread felt a bit like a cake, but pretty dense. Flavour was nice though.

Overall, I've had better, but a decent spot if you're looking for BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food with great prices. Would of got 5 stars if not for the one bad experiance i had. We ordered wings ribs and pulled pork and it was very badly over salted and seasoned. This was again a one time thing because after that i have gotten amazing meals from this place. I highly recommend Big Bone BBQ"}
{"text":"Being up in Markham, I find it tough to get good BBQ. The options seem to be either driving downtown or waiting until the Ribfests come by so I was happy to hear about Big Bone BBQ. We had 8 people over at our place for dinner so we decided to get their party pack 5 for a Sat night.

Decor/Location:
- The restaurant is located in a small industrial strip plaza a few buildings down from the Loblaws at McCowan and Bullock. Not tough to find but it is in an odd spot.
- Inside, it is a very casual atmosphere where you order at the counter and grab a table to eat. The Markham location probably sits about 15 people
- The staff were very friendly

Food:
- We ordered the Party Pack 5 which says it is for 6-8 people
- Wow - the shear quantity of food for great. Even though it says it is for 6-8, you can easily feed 10 people no problem.
- Ribs were a tasty dry rub and soft - the meat didn't completely fall off but the it was very soft to pull with a nice burnt crust on top. I eat the ribs with and without the sauce as both were excellent
- Fries were crispy and freshly made
- The coleslaw and beans were good complements to the meat
- For us, the highlight was the pulled pork. Very tender and sweat - great to eat by itself or in a sandwich.
- We were a little disappointed in the wings which we ordered as honey garlic and alabama slamma. The honey garlic flavour didn't seem strong enough but the other was not bad. 

All in all, great BBQ place and we will certainly order again. We'll have to give the wings and the brisket a try as well. Otherwise, ribs and pulled pork are awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow! It was my first time going here. We ordered the chicken fingers and French fries combo. At first it looked really good, but once I tasted it I knew I would be going back again.
The staff were all outstanding.
Thank you for such a great experience."}
{"text":"[Good]
Food - Ribs and wings always consistent here whether it's takeout or dine in.  Get the original smoked wings for a nice change on typical wing places.  You owe it to yourself to try it if you're a wing person.  You can always get sauce on the side if you want.

Specials - They have really nice specials on I believe the first 3 weekdays.  I think Mondays are the best with a full rack and a pound of wings for $25.

Service - Whether eat our or dine in, service always friendly.

[Worth it?]
Yaaaaaas!  Especially on Mondays.  Even at regular prices, the BBQ is good here and is always worth a visit.  I'm so glad I don't have to travel that far to get good BBQ."}
{"text":"EDIT 
Monday special 

Went there for lunch one day and ordered their ribs and pulled pork. The food was alright but wasn't worth what we spent. Ribs were too dry and didn't fall off the bone. This did not meet my high expectations."}
{"text":"IF ONLY THEY HAD A LOCATION IN SCARBOROUGH!!! 

I loved this place when my family and I visited. There was a lot in one order, and for a good price in my opinion. The wings were delicious, and the fries were good as well!

The only thing I did not like was how this location was quite small, but maybe their other newer locations are bigger. But I would definitely recommend it, and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here for the Monday special. 
Was told it was going to take 20 minutes due to the lineup of orders so we left and went to Walmart for a bit and came back. I think because we left the store they thought we didn't want our order anymore and cancelled it. When we cleared up the misunderstanding they made our order ASAP and gave us a discount even when we refused, which we allocated to the tip jar up at the cash register.
The guys who work there are so great despite the crazy amount of orders.

The ribs were tender and fall off the bone, they could have used a bit more sauce though. The wings were okay, as were the fries. Definitely coming back for more ribs and to try out the pulled pork."}
{"text":"I've been maybe 5 times now and am a big fan of their ribs and their smoked chicken wings. Service is laid back, and friendly. The ribs are better than a lot of places I've had including the joint on Islington/Hwy7. If I'm in the mood for an unhealthy but wickedly delicious meal, this is where I would go."}
{"text":"Welcome Big Bone to the neighbourhood! 

I am just so excited to have real BBQ from now in Markham. No more driving to the West or waiting for the rib fest. 

Nice diner style set up with friendly staff and of course the smell of meat and BBQ sauce. 

3 Bone Dinner ($9.95) that's includes fries, cornbread, coleslaw and beans made me a happy camper!! 

1 2 3 4 bones... Must be magic!! Thanks guys.. 

Finger licking good!!!!!!!!!

Nice patio out front!! I can now dream of Summer... BBQ and Beers (they do have domestic bottles available)"}
{"text":"Mini Combo ($14.95) at Big Bone BBQ is not MINI, I was so stuffed after having that for lunch.

3 to 4 Bones (Not fall off bone tender but not dry and have great bite) 
Original Smoked Chicken Wings 1/2 lb (juicy and tender)
 or 
Smoked Pulled Pork (Soft and just have the right touch of BBQ Sauce)
Fries (Crispy and Lightly seasoned)
Coleslaw (Homemade, the sourness balanced out all these meat)
Beans (more BBQ and Meat)
Cornbread (I ate that as a pound cake, dessert anyone?)

All \"Smoking\" delicious! 

I like how the meat were not soaked in BBQ sauce as sometimes that can be quite overwhelming. .

The Cook/Waiter/Cashier is super friendly and nice. Always checking on us and making sure that we have everything we need.

I still full... I think I am ready to take an afternoon nap.... dreaming about pigs...and chickens....Big Guys eating Racks of Ribs....

Maybe I should have ordered the Monday Madness ($25) that includes 1 Full Rack and 1 lbs of Wings plus Salad or Fries... Maybe next time...... when that Pink Pig calling my name or My Yelp Friend calling me for lunch?! Whatever!!!"}

Will BE BACK"}
{"text":"So glad Markham finally has a decent BBQ place!  If you decide to visit, you have got to try their Smoked BBQ Wings - soooooooooooo good!"}
{"text":"A great place for ribs and wings if you've the appetite! Servings are hearty and the fall-off-the-bone ribs are succulent. I got the Elvis combo durning lunch and had to take some to go because I couldn't finish it all! The Elvis combo hits up each of the major offerings including 1/2 lb. of ribs, 1/2 lb. of wings, pulled pork, cornbread, coleslaw, fries, and beans -- just like ribfest does it. I had an urge to order the Caesar salad as it looked pretty amazing, but managed to hold off on that craving.

This location is small (about 12 tables and seats 24-ish) so don't b surprised if you have to eat in the car. It was pretty packed on a Friday afternoon. I'm certain it's a local favorite!"}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, we were so stoked to try this place out...so 3 of ventured out on a cold winters night to try some BBQ smoked food. To say we were all disappointed would be understatement. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't dreadful...we were just expecting so much more based on the great feedback.

I ordered the Elvis - 5 wings (Jerk style..which they rate as 3 on a heat scale of 1(mildest) to 5 (hottest)..they were more a 1 (very mild)), 1/2 lb pulled pork (excellent) 3 bones of ribs (eh...I've had better..but they fell off the bone which is a plus), coleslaw, baked beans (too much molasses), cornbread (not impressed at all with this) and fries (awful). It's a lot of meat for one person but at $19.95 a real deal. Would I order it again....you betcha !

2 friends ordered the 1lb of wings...both Kansas BBQ. They came with fries a well. Both said that there wasn't enough sauce on them but that they were OK. Would they come back for wings here again...both said no.

Décor on the inside is very minimal. I think it's more of a take out joint than a dine in place. There are perhaps 5 or 6 tables of 4 each....so seating could be tight on a Monday night (when there is a great special).

The million dollar question....would I go back. If in the neighbourhood again I might...but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Go here once a month ore so... have tried everything. Pulled pork is almost as good as mine from my smoker.. and the ribs are delicious. Love the smoked chicken wings..
Wish I could figure out that amazing sauce..."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for so long and glad I did! Didn't realize it was affiliated with Memphis BBQ in which I've already tried. 

Loved the Elvis Combo that came with 1/2lb of wings, 1/2 of pulled pork, 3 ribs, coleslaw, fries and cornbread for $18! What a deal! My doggy bag was a whole meal itself!

Great portion, good variety of wing flavors, ample parking but limited seating. They do have a patio on the other hand so seating is much better in the summer! 

Food does take a while to come when it's a full house however it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for BBQ ribs and wings, so off we went to Big Bone BBQ. This location is located in a quaint strip mall on Eagle street, somewhat off the beaten path. Inside were wood tables covered in a plastic table cloth and wood chairs to match, seating space is similar in size to other BB BBQ's. Parking was ample and we had no issue getting a table for 5 on a Saturday at 6pm.

The say never order hungry.....We went to town and ordered a party pack with Wings, Ribs, and added Brisket. It also came with a tub of sauce, fries, coleslaw, beans & corn bread. A venerable feast !!!

I was impressed with this location, everything was well cooked, arrived hot, ample sauce on the wings. Flavors were good and you get to choose the sauce on the wings (can't blame myself for bad taste there). Food arrived somewhat spotty, but, not an issue for us, as we started to eat one item that was served, another arrived shortly thereafter. Overall, I enjoyed the service, meal and cleanliness of the restaurant (comparing to other locations). 

At the end of our meal, we settled the bill at the cash and off we went with a couple of Styrofoam containers provided to us for leftovers (pack your own). I would definitely return as I like the food and the casual atmosphere without having to wait long line ups and all the frou frou of most rib and steak places."}
{"text":"We decided to have supper here with friends, the décor is uninspiring with old chairs and tables, fake tree in the middle of the room and dark old tiles on floor,  the greasy beaten looking small dining room and halogen track lights are not creating \"that\" want to dine-in ambiance. Overall appearance is somewhat dirty and dilapidated. 

Now the main event, the food sings a different song. Ribs are fall off the bone and tasty, wings crispy and plump, pulled pork was tender and the added sauce lets you add more flavor to your liking. Fries, cornbread, coleslaw and baked beans for sides were a great compliment. 

I would return, but would prefer if they cleaned the place up which would give it the 5 star experience they probably deserve. I'd say take out is the way to go here, but I had to discount points for the appearance as I could not overlook it."}
{"text":"I had the Big Bones Combo and I must say, the ribs were top tier, while the wings, eh not really.

Many backyard BBQ-ers like their ribs `fall-off-the-bone tender' and will complain that Big Bones BBQ don't make them in said tenderness. However, I'd like to ask you to give a chance to ribs with a bit of a chew. They are just as good.

In terms of flavors, the ribs were nicely seasoned, with dry rub and sauce, which brought out just enough flavor without overwhelming the pork taste of the meat. 

As for the wings, my friends and I tried different flavors: dry cajun (4/5), honey garlic (4/5), kansas city BBQ (3.5/5), and honey mustard (2/5). 

Although the dry cajun wings were good, I think it might only have been relative, because it was the only one that wasn't drenched in sauce. As far as how the flavor goes, it's not tasting very cajun. 

I'm also not sure what happened to the beef brisket, but it was cut in slices so thin, and totally bathing in BBQ sauce that we didn't really taste the beef, or the smoke, or anything that you were supposed to.

The fries were excellent: crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside.

But yeh, decent decor and friendly service, I had a good time at Big Bones BBQ."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and thoroughly enjoyed it. Always packed. The quickness of cleaning the tables between diners isn't what it should be. I'd rather wait 2 more minutes for a clean table than to be seated quickly at a filthy table. My daughter always gets the chicken sandwich, she loves it so much. The wings and ribs are good and the glazes and sauces are delicious. The cornbread is decent but the only loser is the coleslaw. If it doesn't come close to my homemade coleslaw it doesn't cut it. Theirs needs some celery seed or more seasoning. It's quite bland and comes across as an afterthought."}
{"text":"Oh yeah.  This was good.  Would have given five stars but they were out of ribs.  Had the pulled pork and hubby had the smoked wings. Awesome flavours on the meats and the sides were good too.  Service was great and we didn't have to wait too long for the food.  Prices are good and you get a lot of food.  Noticed they have a patio...will be back cause I got to try the ribs!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times for both dine in and take out. Their specialties are ribs and wings. 
My hubby and I love the Monday mania, 1lb of wings, one whole rack, and large fries for $25. It's a steal.
I like the smoked BBQ wings while my hubby likes the hot creamy parm.
The fries here taste like costco fries"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant; we get take out here once in a while. This location is great for us as hubby works close by and can grab take out right after work.

Ribs here are slightly better than the Markham location IMO; falling off the bones. 
Monday Mania is a steal: $25 (tax in) for one rack, one lb of wings (many flours to choose from), and a large fries (or a salad)"}
{"text":"Heard so many great review about this place, finally had a chance to try it. Monday special is the ! Fall of the bone ribs and the wings is a must try! 
Reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal!! My husband I just flew in from Chicago and we needed lunch. We found  Big Bone BBQ on Yelp. As soon as we walked in, they lady's at the counter greeted us. The place was nearly empty. 

I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & my husband got a burger.  My pulled pork sandwich was so yummy!! The meal came with fries, beans ' coleslaw. The fries were hot & crispy, the beans were great and the coleslaw was good. Unfortunately my husbands burger wasn't good. It reminded him of  his terrible school lunch's. 
Service was great & speedy. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"A solid, fulfilling, delicious meal. 

If you're hungry for some meat, wings, and fries, look no further in Newmarket! 

A great spot for a fulfilling meal with reasonable prize. The size portion is also great ( as shown in pic ). Most importantly, service is great and staff are all friendly. 

Oh and did I mention about those beans on the side dish , don't underestimate them, they are 9/10 delicious and home made in the restaurant! Have to try them with whatever you order! 

Definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and meat. I'm not a huge barbecue expert but it feels miles ahead of your regular Ontario rib joint. Portions are good, you can get a HUGE amount of meat for $20 or even $10. The fries are also standout."}
{"text":"Pretty solid BBQ here. These guys take grilling seriously. Been here on several occasions and they do not disappoint. 

Unfortunately, due to it being so unhealthy, I have to limit my visits :( however, if wings or ribs are what you're after, this place (especially in Markham) cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I went on a very busy Friday night. The tables were all filled and people standing against the walls. We decided on take out and went to wait in the car. After 20 or so minutes we went back to find that the power had gone out. We asked if our order had been made yet. It wasn't but there were ribs and smoked wings that were still warm.
The lady gave us a few extra bones for our ribs for the inconvenience and instructed us how to heat the ribs and wings in the oven at home along with a container of the BBQ sauce. She also gave us a whole loaf of cornbread and was extremely apologetic.
The customer service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Not sure whether its because I dropped by on a busy day ( I picked up the Monday Deal ) but the ribs that I got as part of the Monday Special was not tender at all. I wondered if they ran out of their slow cooked ones and provided customers later into a night with ones that didn't get enough cooking time.

Even though the ribs were not tender they did taste good. Likewise with the fries and wings."}
{"text":"Came out early on a Saturday. We were a group of 8 people. I think we might have had a reservation, I'm not 100%.

So this place was a bit of a challenge for me to find. I drove into a couple of wrong plazas before I came to it. Its next to the markham food bank, which made me me all sorts of shades of guilty for spending money at a restaurant

Thers a smallish parking area in the front of the plaza. Free parking, with more on the sides. 

The place is really small, not a lot of in restaurant seats. More than in Newmarket thought.

First off, this place does not look like your typical BBQ joint. It looks like they either kept the furniture and decor from whatever place was there before, whatever tacky place. You can tell this by the dirty cushions and desperate need for touch ups on the walls.

There's a big take out business here and there was always a large group of people staying around watching you eat. There's no other place for them to be besides just right there watching you. 

There was one waitress tending all the tables and the cash/ takeout. 

She didn't write anything down and of course got the order wrong. It was mostly right though. Funny thing is, it took 10 minutes to get her attention ( we timed). She kept zipping around taking orders, and delivering food, but refused to make eye contact. She went past our table 7 times, and nothing. Someone had to go up to the cash to ask.

The food. Ribs were great, (very very fatty though) loved the wings and poutine and slaw. The pulled pork was really dry. So was the corn bread. 

Would recommend the ribs and wings. Pass on the pulled pork!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and frequently crowded with people waiting for take out, which is a good sign that the food is worth the visit.

This place is small, it seats maybe 20 people. If you coming in, you need to be prepared for the chance there might be no seats and you will have to take all that delicious meat home!

Note: your hair and clothes will smell like all that smokey BBQ goodness.

I like to get the ribs and wings. Thick juicy ribs covered in a smokey BBQ sauce, and plump meaty wings smothered in one of any number of fantastically tasting sauces. The pulled pork isn't my favourite but actually, I'd still eat it. It's still pretty good! I know its the fave of some of my friends. Yum.

When you order meals, you get sides, fries, beans, cornmeal muffins. Yum.

If you want you can buy a salad, they have it on the menu. But honestly why would you want to? Bring on the meat sweats!!"}
{"text":"Yummy pulled pork! The Elvis combo had a delicious assortment with enough food to feed two and have a little leftover for a lunch sandwich! Will definitely recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"The very best pulled pork I've ever had... unbelievably delicious!! Everything here is great... Ribs, Wings both smoked to perfection.... quality fries and onion rings... seriously just stop reading this and go there NOW!!"}
{"text":"Very good... as expected.
Restaurant setup is sort of odd... you basically walk through a packed small dining room to get to the 'pick up desk'.  They advised when I was picking up that they were out of corn bread... and offered me a different type of bread... fine. 
Would come back for the ribs and wings (smoked... very good).  
Think I could leave out the beans and pulled pork though.  Both were way too sweet for my liking.  That might just be a personal preference, but found the pulled pork overly sweet for sandwiches.  
Would go again... but just get ribs and wings."}
{"text":"Mmmm-mmmm delicious!!! Easily my go to spot for a BBQ fix. The ribs are soooooo tasty and tender but don't fall off the bone, which i love!!! They have a great variety of wing flavors to choose from but on this particular meal we got the spicy parm which was nomnuts too. It reminded me of neros epilogue from wild wings... Not quite as amazing but still great tasting! The only thing i was not a fan of was their cornbread. It was super dry and cold and just not as great as some i have had in the past. The ribs though... Best part of my meal and would come back just for it!!!"}
