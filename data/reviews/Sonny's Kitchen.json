{"text":"Went at 7am. Staff pleasant and prompt. Thought the breakfast skillets we had were tasty and plentiful. And as an added plus the server was generous with coffee refills.
Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I really think that diners should be as expected. They don't need to be spectacular, but they should at least tolerable. I didn't care for the breakfast. I also went for lunch on a weekend. It wasn't busy at all. The cheeseburger had super thin bacon that tasted microwaved. Our food was just lacking flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious food! They offer a huge menu, breakfast any time. The place is always busy and they do a great job getting you seated and getting your food to you fast. I always order an omelette with hash browns and flapjacks. Staff is super nice. Family owned. Try the pies too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Very happy to have a good breakfast spot in Oregon! The service could not be nicer - a family run business. I loved seeing the owner out assisting his employees in bussing the tables and checking on customers. 
My husband had an omelet and loved it. He was thrilled that, besides the hashbrowns or American fries, you can get either toast OR pancakes with it. I had the country fried steak with hashbrowns and very yummy rye toast.
Coffee was good and they kept it coming. I saw some lunch food come out while we were there as well and it looked really good.
This kind of restaurant was desperately needed in Oregon. A new version of Oregon Family Restaurant. Now, if they just put a Greek omelet on the menu I'll be thrilled!
Also, I want to note that it was Wednesday after Christmas and they were EXTREMELY busy, so it was quite impressive that they were still friendly and quick. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed their food! It was so delicious and the staff was very helpful the whole meal. We went for dinner but I hope we can try the breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"Typical diner food. Typical diner menu.  Wife had a burger and I had a breakfast scrambler. Both were good and the portions were fairly big. The service was good.  The standout of the meal was the onion rings.  Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I was eager to try out the new restaurant in town, so when my husband suggested it one Sunday morning I jumped at the chance.  We came in through the front doors and was seated after a minute or so of waiting.  It was surprisingly busy for 8:30 on a Sunday.  

We waited a few minutes for our waitress which was fine, it gave us some time to look around and take everything in.  It was rather loud, but the way the room is set up (basically one big room with very high ceilings) it is inevitable.  

I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of hash browns, my husband ordered the chicken fajita skillet, and my daughter had the Mickey Mouse pancake.

We only had to wait about 10 minutes until our food came out.  I was pleasantly pleased with the generous amount of gravy on my biscuits and gravy.  The gravy was good and the biscuits had a bit of sweetness to them.  My husband liked his meal and my daughter loved her pancake. 

We will definitely be back!  It is rather loud during busy times but not much they could really do about that.  I do wish they had some sort of coloring crayons or something for kids while they waited.  Out total came to about $30 after tip, which is pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get.  Overall great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This is exactly the kind of place Oregon needs.  My wife and I visited one evening after shopping all day and didn't feel like cooking.  They have diner comfort food which is exactly what we wanted.  Food was really good.  No alcohol though which is fine."}
{"text":"I am beyond excited that this place opened up in Oregon. Breakfast all day is my jam. 
It's a cozy little place, yet surprisingly spacious. It feels like your dive neighborhood diner and brings all the comfort food. 
I opted for the veggie skillet and was very pleased. The inside reminded me of your typical diner veggie mix. Diced onions, diced peppers, those canned mushrooms, but I was pleased with the addition of broccoli. The eggs were a bit over, I noticed this with many of the scrambled eggs in my group. Still very tasty though. 
I shared a plate of pancakes eith someone in my group and these were delicious. Like fluffy, sweet, pancake clouds. I could eat them all day.
Portion sizes are hefty. I had leftovers for another meal, which reheated well. 
Wait staff was nice and attentive. Service was very prompt."}
{"text":"Great interior design. Super cute and country. Good food also. I got a BLT and it was yummy. My husband got a burger and also enjoyed it. Solid place. We also both got pie and the pie was 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Our first time here was a great success! The hostess was happy to welcome us and gave us our choice of tables, then once we were seated she asked once more to confirm we were happy with where we were (right by the front window in the sun, it was bright and warm and by the end I was pretty toasty but it was worth it). 

Our waitress was courteous and prompt, and although they were busy and have a \"Help Wanted\" sign in the window we didn't feel neglected. This place is clearly a favorite for families too, we saw several tables with multiple generations on a Sunday morning.

The food arrived at a reasonable time and was outstanding, we were both members of the clean plate club and that rarely happens, for me at least! I got the Sonny's Special (French toast, eggs, bacon) and my husband got the Belgian Waffle with bananas. Oh and very good coffee too, I can't recommend using the flavored creamer from the table but it's nice as an option--next time I'll stick with either black or the plain creamer. We will be back, and likely with relatives next!"}
{"text":"Love being able to give some love to a hometown local establishment! More so as a diner themed place as well! I just love diners for some reason! 

As a newly owned joint in town thats actually owned by a family that also owned a long standing and super popular restaurant called North Side Inn in Madison, I knew this place had a good shot of being impressive. My folks and my relatives who have dined in for multiple meals had high praise as well so I went for it and took my folks for dinner on a Saturday night about 7pm. 

Glad we did! This place as a legit diner feel, warm, cozy, at home feel thats very welcoming. Not a hard core diner feel but a very open and laid back feel just the same. I like the holiday decorations they have up inside as well.

They offer the full menu all day which I love! Waffles and biscuits and grave I think were the only items not available after 2pm if I recall right. I love a place that offers breakfast at dinner time!

I went with a rib sticking selection of smothered chicken breast with mozza, peppers and onions and then a double side pick (you get 2 side options with entree plates) of American fries. I also got the beef and veg soup cup.

For $16 this was a big meal and a delicious one at that! Server was kind and accurate, meal came out fast and my folks were as pleased as ever with their new selections as well. Portions are legit and prices are on point. 

So happy to see a place like this under such good management with such a expansive made from scratch menu with great prices just a mile from home now! Morning, noon or night I know when I come home to see family, I have a place to take them out to for good eats right here in town now!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few more times since my original review, including dinner.  The kids love it because breakfast is available all day and they can get the Mickey Mouse pancake with chocolate chips.  I love it because of the variety.  They have something to satisfy any craving. I've tried their burgers, lasagna, chicken stir fry, and omelets (the kids aren't the only ones that like breakfast for dinner) and have been happy with everything.  Next on my list is their fried chicken.  As before, the portions are generous, prices are fair, and service is great."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Sonny's. I had the Classic Eggs Benedict and it was great! The poached eggs were done perfectly! The hash-browns were nice and crisp! My husband had eggs over-easy, bacon, American fries and sour-dough toast.  He also liked his breakfast. The waitstaff was friendly, attentive and kept our coffee filled. We will be going back!

We also went back for lunch and had an appetizer of cheese curds and cheeseburgers for our entree.  It is nice that besides nice crispy fries it also included soup!  We had beef barley and cream of spinach and both were great!  For a small charge, I switched to onion rings instead of fries and they were also very tasty!"}
{"text":"I was there a few nights ago, super friendly and welcoming staff. Food was great! The only thing I would change is get a subscription to a radio so that commercials don't play."}
{"text":"Quick review: Try the French toast with cinnamon bread. It was really good! It's a lot of food though. I'd recommend you share with a friend or a loved one."}
