{"text":"Nice addition to the neighbourhood if a bit pricy for a slice! had the margherita and the veg option both were great and not overly oily. Reminded me of the pizza I had in Europe. Staff were very friendly and the venu is cute but too small to actually eat there."}
{"text":"nice quality ingredients. rad vibe. good tasting sauce. but ny style does *not* mean paper thin to the point of being crunchy 3/4's of the way up the slice. a liiiiittle bit thicker and a price drop to 3 bucks flat, taxes in-- and we'd be talking..."}
{"text":"Pizza was OK; ordered two slices and the pesto with cheese was very dry.

One thing that ticks me off is the fact that I simply do not understand the 1.00$ additional \"non-tax\" item that is also taxed in the transaction. If you advertise your slices at 3.26$ +tx why add this fee without advising your clientele?! The issue here is not the dollar value but rather, the principle behind this scheme that is completely dishonest in my opinion. Considering that I tipped the cashier and took it to go, I am a little disappointed. 

Please explain..."}
{"text":"Best sliced pizza in Montreal! I've been on the hunt for 5 years, and this is IT"}
{"text":"Amazing slice! Just what you would expect from a true New York slice. Worth the trek! If you want a nostalgic trip back to New York, head to Adamo!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. I do love a thin crust!! Can be a bit dry better when you eat it there. Closes at 9 pm and Sundays. DUMB!!"}
{"text":"This Pizza is actually very good and it has this unique style that makes it special but its very expensive. Yes, they give you big slices but its very thin and it doesn't have a lot of toppings in general. Plus the place is very small and doesn't have tables or chair to sit on so if you plan on ordering a big pizza and eating it there with friends you won't be able too. I personally think its not worth it."}
{"text":"Probably the only edible pizza by the slice in the city. Reminds me of New york style pizza which I love. Nice simple thin crust pizza, I can see some people not liking it because it takes a good 3 slices atleast to be satisfied and at 3.50$ a slice it adds up but most of the pizza in this city is disgusting so its nice to finally have one that I can eat."}
{"text":"To get this pizza, you better have a door and table that can handle its size. 
Yep, it's huge! And thin crust too. Love the tomato with boconccini plus fresh basil. Simple and very tasty.
Good thing that Adamo is not near my place or else I'll have pizza every day!
That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I like thin pizzas, but it has to look like a pizza and not a crepe. Adamo's crust is so thin it's almost see through. The sauce tastes is a bit too sweet. Considering how much they charge, I was expecting much tastier and/or filling slice."}
{"text":"Adamo is situated in St. Henri. Near Rustique Pies and other well known restaurants. Walking distance from St. Henri metro. Owned and operated by Tony Campanelli. He's the  same owner of Campanelli. I was looking forward in trying this pizza joint, sadly my eyes, palette, and wallet were not not at all pleased. Here's why.. 
To begin with, parking is a true challenge! Either it's reserved for residents only with permits, or there is no space to park. Let's not forget orange construction cones everywhere as well. 
As I walked into Adamo, I was taken by surprise as to how small and compact the store is. I say the store mainly because there are no tables or chairs to eat. You're surrounded by big bulky bags of flour and and cans of tomatoes. Along with a small fridge and a TV. That's right! You either order for take-out or you eat it on the dusty sidewalk. Of course that's if you can park! 
I had in mind to order a whole pizza to share with friends. The lady at the counter told me that was not possible. I was only allow to purchase the pizza by the slice. No whole pizza?! It had begin by a whole pizza in order to be sliced, no? Anywho. 
So I ordered two slices $4.00 per slice. Ouch! I still wanted to try it. My curiosity took over my wallet. 
So I ordered the tomato and cheese. Along with the cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil.  
The slices of pizza were nicely warmed up, upon ordering them. That was nice! 
As for the pizza slices.. Thin as a paper plate, dry, and quite tough to chew as well. The pizza with the cherry tomatoes had two squished tomatoes, three thinly sliced of basic and a dash of cheese. I'm not into oily and extreme cheese pizzas, but I do like to taste each ingredient. 
The tomato and cheese pizza was just \"Ok!\" I certainly won't brag about it. The canned tomato sauce had a nice taste. As for the cheese? No taste and very little melting factor. Bonus point for not being oily. Yet once again, it was dry!  
It's safe to say that I don't plan to return to Adamo anytime soon. With the combination of parking being a challenge, pizza being pricey, along with bland and dry. I will continue to visit many other wonderful pizza parlours throughout our city."}
{"text":"Honestly it seems that I can't get enough of Adamo. It is the closest thing that we have to NYC pizza in Montreal. Thin slices heated quickly up in the oven when you order them in a small pizza shop. 

Adamo is really a takeout spot. There is only seating inside for 4 along with additional standing room at the counter. In the summer you can sit outside the shop on some benches or enjoy your pizza at the nearby park or on the edge of the Lachine Canal. 

Because the pizza is so thin it gets cold pretty quickly so you may need to heat it up when you get home. The thin slices also mean that they lack structural integrity so you've got to use the folding technique to avoid ending up with a stain on your shirt. 

Adamo offers a variety of different pizzas and can make you a pie to order if requested. My favorite by far is the Basil as it is prepared with its own unique tomato sauce which I think gives it an excellent sweet yet tangy flavour which I really enjoy. 

Cash or interac only.

Oh and of course there is a Foosball table!"}
{"text":"I went there today as I was in the neighbourhood. I ALMOST DIED when I bit into the tomato and Boccocini slice. It is that good. It's basically equivalent to a good orgasm. I felt great for about an hour afterwards.  I cannot remember the taste of any other pizza I have eaten in my life now-- I can only remember this one. I can't write any more about this place or I will end up having to go back there, as in right now. The memory of their pizza is too powerful."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  There isn't any seating, it's best to get your pie to go!"}
{"text":"If you loved hanging out at Eurodeli, back in the good 'ol days, you'll taste the pizza and feel you're home again. Standing pizza place by the slice- yum!"}
{"text":"Adamo is one right here in Montreal in St. Henri, serving the classic thin New York style pizza, the only one that I could find in Montreal. And they do it pretty damn well. It has to be one of my favourite pizza places in Montreal - one of them that does it right!"}
{"text":"True New-York-style pizza.  If you like this style of thin-crust pizza, you'll love Adamo.  If you don't, you won't.

Pies are huge, they hardly fit in the box.  Three types on offer.  Currently only takeout."}
{"text":"Great thin pizza, more on the New Haven side than a New York slice. Salty cheese flavor. Good vegetarian option. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! The crust is the best part, thin and crunchy. Just perfectly cooked. Only thing I did not like about this place was they did not have AC. It was boiling hot in there . I would not go out of my way just to get pizza here but I would definitely come back if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"In Saint Henri, on notre dame street, there so many restaurants that I am slowly but surely trying them. The latest addition in my list is Adamo. 

My little sister's classmate family owns this special pizza place. It's a very small resto; it better you take your food to go out. There is one large table, a family was occupying it. 

There is so many sorts of pizza. I took one slice ricotta and spinach . Oh my, it was the biggest slice ever. The pizza is super fresh. The dough is vey flat. The pizza was absolutely very tasty. 

I definitely recommend everyone to try a slice or two or even take a box at home."}
{"text":"Biggest slices of pizza I've EVER had. Although thinnest too. I had one slice per meal and it was plenty. At 3$ something including tax, it's an amazing deal. 

They had special topping like pesto, which was very rich, although it was meatless. The pizzas were also kind of dry and were not warm when I bought it. At least they weren't oily. They were also a bit hard on the teeth. The most efficient way to eat it for me was to fold it in half.

Would've been better also if there were places to seat. But bonus points for glass bottled coke and sprite. Overall, still really enjoyed it, but I would rather try all the other good restaurants around next time instead."}
{"text":"I'm back to review again because I think after flip flopping from 2 starts to 4 stars I will have to settle finally on 3 stars.  Restaurant's been open for about 6 months now and they've added new pizza topping options which is amazing, but the bummer part is that they're closed by 8pm every night (sometimes even earlier) and they're not open on Sundays. I am hoping that will change by the summer because I really do love their pizza and I have def woken up on many a Sunday morning craving a good hangover slice."}
{"text":"Great pizza if you're on the go. For $3.75 per slice, it's actually really affordable considering how big each slice is. For my full review, check out: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/10/25/craving-a-slice-of-new-york-style-pizza-but-you-live-in-montreal-adamos-is-the-answer/"}
{"text":"Great, cheap, huge pizza. Hip pizzeria in a hip neighborhood. Great staff too! No place to sit down. It's a take away joint."}
{"text":"Pizza! Just pizza!! But such delicious pizza!! Come one, come all! Oh, wait! Don't!! I won't be able to wait any longer in line before I get my fix of this great pie!! Namaste"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the city. I stumbled upon this place when walking through st Henri. After getting my first slice (I had the basil which and it was amazing) and finishing it 2 blocks away I turned back when I felt the overwhelming need for another. The second one I had was the calabrese and it was also incredible. 

I've spent a long time looking for the best pizza in the city and I'm confident that I've found it. Slices are huge, dough is the perfect texture, staff is friendly, and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. This is the closest thing you'll find to New York pizza this side of the border."}
{"text":"It's pretty basic in-a-pinch type of snack. Price with tax for pepperoni or basil is $3.75. Guys, you're going to need 2 slices: thin and light on toppings. It's as advertised: New York style. If you live in the hood it's good to have another low-price place to eat - but I'd like to see something a bit more wow to repeat the performance. Thumbs up to owner Tony for keeping St. Henri moving in the right direction."}
{"text":"I have never been so bored by a slice of pizza. It is about 20% less disgusting than neighbourhood pizza joints,  and about 50% more expensive."}
{"text":"Tu aimes manger des grosses parts de pizza ?
Tu aimes manger dans un parc avec des bancs, des chiens fous, des écureuils et des pigeons ?
Dans ce cas là va prendre à emporter chez Adamo et va manger dans le parc à coté en espérant qu'il fasse beau.
Arrete de lire cet avis et vas y, plus vite que ca ..."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza sold by the slice makes for a great, quick lunch. Numerous options make it difficult to choose but well worth the hard choice. Not a lot of seating as this is mainly a take-away joint, but there are benches outside on the sidewalk so don't let that be a deterrent."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say about Adamo? The space is small and offers limited seating, the line can be long but the pizza is damn good!! 

I waited in line on a Friday for lunch at the chance to finally savour a piece of their pizza. Finding a spot that offers pizza by the slice these days which is as good as this one is nearly impossible

They offer a classic toppings like mozzarella and pepperoni but I opted for the rapini and ricotta. Service was super friendly and efficient; we even got chatting about the pizza process which you can see unfold as you place your order behind the counter. Within minutes I had my food, headed outside to the public bench, and settled in for my first bite. The crust was perfection; chewy, thin but substantial enough to hold the flavourful toppings, and the slice was huge! Grabbed a soft drink in the bottle (classic goodness) to wash it all down and I was one happy lady! All for 6$?! It just doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews here, I had to come give this place a try. I just moved in and while Domino's is always a good choice, you really gotta keep it local. 

I love that you can find a great slice at this place. You definitely need two slices to kill your hunger. I tried the pepperoni and it was extremely tasty. Good sauce, nice cheese and the crust has a nice cracker meal taste to it. 

I'm so glad to be living in such a cool neighbourhood and now when I have friends visit, I know where we will go to fill the void. Adult beverages at La Drinkerie, then up the street for some killer 'za."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza joints in town. Every time I come they have some great music playing giving the place a great vibe. Not too many spots to sit down and eat. There is also a couple of stand up counter spots for you to eat your slice but the park not too far away also makes for a great option. They only have one size pizza and they are huge. They only have one price too. No matter what you get on your pizza. Whether its by the slice or the whole thing. And that sucks for me because I usually like to stick with the basics and go with a cheese pizza, which is usually cheaper at any other place. But the pizza is so good you can still catch me walking out this place with that huge box once in a while."}
{"text":"Great place, huge pizza, good taste. The calabrese is so good. Never try a slice that I didn't like :) Go try it !"}
{"text":"Only NY style pizza in town. Close at 8pm, no delivery, but people line up to get take out from this pizzeria! Family recipe! Anything with their tomato sauce and basil is my favourite here! The Hawaiian is great too. You should really try each one, you will see!"}
{"text":"Generally speaking, Montreal has a problem with pizza by the slice: it's heavy, it's bland and the crust tastes like cardboard. But then there's Adamo. 

With its thin crust, beautiful tomato sauce and fresh toppings, Adamo is the way pizza is meant to be eaten. Sure, if you're hammered after the bars, you can make a case for the other stuff, but if it's mid day and you want a satisfying slice, this is really your only option in town. 

I opted for Hawaiian (don't judge, it's delicious), but every option looked just as good. And did i mention that it's only $3.75 a slice? Standard, but given the quality, you're getting way more than you paid for. 

Don't waste time with a sloppy slice. Next time you're craving a quick pizza, you know where to go."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE pizza :) various styles of pizza and various toppings , my love for pizza knows no bounds ! So when I heard about this place I was very excited to try it. This is a tiny little hole in the wall that serves New York style pizza-very clean inside with an authentic rustic feel. The restaurant itself is not a sit down type of place there is only a few seats inside. BUT if you go in the summer time they have a little bench outside or else you can grab some slices to go and eat at a picnic table in the park closeby. The pizza slices are huge and thin crust and not overly oily/greasy. They definitely hit the spot if you're having a pizza craving and 1-2 slices are more than enough to fill you up ! Service was quick , no frills and efficient. We tried a pepperoni and cheese slice and a meat lovers slice. Both slices were tasty but it wasn't necessarily the best pizza I've had. My three star rating is not because the food wasn't good because it was. it was more because while i enjoyed it , I wasn't blown away by it. the prices are ok and the service while efficient could have been a little bit friendlier and more welcoming. Also the fact that there isn't really any indoor seating also is a factor during the winter months. All in all I did enjoy it and would encourage any pizza lover to give it a try because I think the food was good , they just had a few points they could improve on. It wouldn't be my number one pick when I'm craving pizza BUT like I said I did enjoy it and I would like to go back and try some of the other slices."}
{"text":"Le verdict des lecteurs du journal Cult est tombé: c'est la meilleure pizza de Montréal!

http://cultmontreal.com/2018/05/best-of-mtl-2018-food-drink/

Pour ma part, j'aurais inversé les positions #1 et #2 car j'ai préféré la pizza de chez Magpie, celle avec les boulettes de viande *___* Naturellement, elles se comparent mal, c'est juste deux styles différents. Et puis, celle d'Adamo n'a pas de rivale dans son genre, à moins d'aller à NYC. 

Pizza hawaïenne, un peu relevée, avec de l'huile épicée, ouh la la!

Récemment, ils ont fait l'ajout d'indications plus claires pour diviser le comptoir des paiements de celui où les commandes sont remises, je pense que puisque le local est petit et la file longue, ça va adoucir le fonctionnement.

La vie est dure, je passe devant chaque jour au retour du boulot en route vers mon domicile..."}
{"text":"Probablement la meilleure pizza croûte mince de style New-yorkaise en ville! Le concept est très simple, on y vend des pizzas à la pointe (environ 4,50$) ou entière (environ 25$ pour 6 pointes) avec quelques classiques aux menus ( margharita, marinara, pepperoni...etc) 

On goûte vraiment la différence au niveau de la qualité des ingrédients. On est loin de la grosse pizza sale de quartier avec 2 pouces d'épais de fromage..... que j'aime autant, mais qui est dans une autre catégorie!

L'endroit est petit avec quelques tabourets pour y manger sur le pouce. C'est préférable de prendre un take-out à mon avis!

J'y retournerai pour sûre!!!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest: Pizza by the slice joints usually suck. Outside of being a quick option after a late night out and needing some grease to sober up, the quality of pizza in these establishments generally leaves to be desired which is too bad because the concept is a worthy and useful one. Being able to grab a great quick slice of pizza while walking around is a great addition to one's neighbourhood. Over the past few months, there was indications that within St-Henri, a pizzeria was coming and bringing by-the-slice with it. On its own, not necessarily that exciting but when I heard that Tony Campanelli, owner of the wonderful cafe/store of the same name, was doing it.... well now you have my attention. Adamo opened up a couple of weeks ago so I passed by a couple of times to see how the pizza stacks up.

Adamo is a pretty simple place - a walk-up counter with drinks and pizzas ready to grab, a little bar to eat at there if you wish and the open kitchen behind for all to see the magic at work. The boxes of tomatoes and bags of flour add a nice rustic touch in the front of the room and the addition of the TV and the foosball table make the space have a more communal feel despite the lack of seating space. The pizzeria already feels like part of the St-Henri community after only a few weeks. Part of that is Tony's presence. Every time I have been, the place is busy and people are chatting with Tony and the rest of his friendly staff. You always get a nice hello and small talk from the staff. You don't feel like you just need to order and get out as fast as possible. That is greatly appreciated.

Pizza-wise, Adamo does what you would call New York-style pizza - as thin as possible and not too overloaded with ingredients. The individual slices are huge - the kind of slices that you fold in half to properly eat with one hand. The key there however is that despite being folded in half, the pizza holds up on its own, no limp crust here. Adamo nails that perfectly so far. The crust isn't too tight either which is nice. At the moment, there are 3 options - Mozzarella, Pepperoni and Basil - with one Pesto special available at times. Having tried all four, they are all solid. The base tomato sauce has a nice tang to it, the pepperoni has a nice kick, the cheeses are all gooey and plentiful and the pesto was very fresh. My one complaint would be that the basil pizza didn't really have enough basil on it.

Adamo is the best by-the-slice joint you can find in Montreal right now. Tony and company do it right all the way around so far and add to what is a great strip of Notre-Dame in St-Henri just by the Park. I needed a good pizza place not too far away from my new place.... and Adamo will do very nicely thank you.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Based on my personal experience on Friday evening around 730pm.

I called ahead for my take out but when I got there, I couldn`t just pay and pick up so I had to wait in the line (15~20 ppl in front of me). 
I live 7 mins away by car and by the time I got home, pizza was dead cold. I didn't taste much (hence my review)

I guess, it's best just go there and eat it or wait over there instead of calling ahead. 
30$ for cold pizza just did not please me. 
I'll eventually go back and give it another shot and update in the future."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza here. Huge slices at a reasonable price (3.75). A whole pie is $22 - a good deal given the size of these pizzas. My favourite is the rapini and ricotta - a great balance of salty from the mozarella cheese, bitter from the rapini and charred thin crust, and creaminess from the ricotta.  They have a decent variety of other options as well."}
{"text":"New little restaurant, it's really a take out place. The decor is nice and efficient, we can see the whole kitchen and the cooks working. That's interesting. They have 3 choices of pizza: tomato-basil, cheese, pepperoni. The ingredients are really fresh, the crust thin and crispy and the tomato is sauce amazing (no acidity, tasty and a bit sweet). But I have to say they could be more generous with the topping, for 3,50$ the piece I wished I had more. I'm really giving 3 stars for the fact that when I went they let a customer in with his dog; ordering and waiting for his order. Don't get me wrong I'm  a dog lover. But really, in an open space/kitchen restaurant? It's a no for me."}
{"text":"Finally a NYC style pizza by the slice joint in Montreal! Loved it so much we brought one home."}
