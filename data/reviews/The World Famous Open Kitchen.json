{"text":"Me and my wife went here for dinner tonight and the food was HORRIBLE! I ordered the chicken scallopine  and my wife ordered spaghetti with meat sauce.  

1) the pasta was disgusting.  It was overcooked pasta with the texture of spaghettios, and the meat sauce was from a can with what tasted like worse than elementary school mystery meat speghetti.  

2) the scallopine was $15.75 for horrible food and small portion.  Everything was from a can.

Overall DO NOT go here.  It is overpriced and not worth it.  I wouldn't even feed this food to my dog."}
{"text":"Open Kitchen was recommended to me by some of the locals as a must if you need a quick lunch.  I ended up going for dinner, but I'm sure it's the same.  The first thing you notice about the place is it's totally old school.  Everything in there looks antique.  Even the cash register is the old fashion kind (but refurbished to be electronic).

As for dinner, I had the Lasagna Parmigiana and then Pineapple Cheesecake for dessert. Almost half the lasagna of was cheese (I'm not complaining) and it was a generous portion for the price.  It tasted good, but it certainly didn't blow me away.  Kind of your run of the mill American lasagna.  

The cheesecake was homemade, but unlike the lasagna, I was a little disappointed in the size of the slice.  However, what little I did have tasted very good.  I ended up having to scrape off the pineapple sauce because it detracted from the rich cheesecake.  I suggest ordering it plain.  

All in all, I enjoyed my experience at the Open Kitchen, but with so many other options in Charlotte, it may be a while before I try them again."}
{"text":"Play some Italian music for an even better vibe ;) great atmosphere and wonderful food! Will return and bring others!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday afternoon.  Off peak hours, only one other car there.  I will tell you why.  I've driven by for years always meaning to try. Who doesn't love Italian? I had the chance to take my nephew out for a meal. He's in the military and on vacation.  I love to feed this kid.  
The outside had been touched up (paint...) from what I could tell.  The inside was very stereotypical old school Italian. I like that.  I liked the Dean Martin music, red and white check tablecloths and the quirky decor.( I'll have to revisit that.) We walked in with no one to greet us. We kinda milled around looking until someone came from the back and said she did not hear us come in, but we could sit anywhere.  We sat facing the flag wall.  If you've been, you know, lots of felt school flags hanging above the window facing the street.  Interesting. I noticed on the menu there was a special offering free calamari with 2 entrees.  Cool.  My nephew ordered the crab meat parmigiana and I ordered the braciole.  The calamari arrived quickly and was hot.  Slightly over cooked but that's not uncommon. The marinara was tasty.  I anticipated REALLY good Itialian and my new favorite go to place.  

Screeching, chalkboard scratching halt!  

Our food, ( I use that term loosely.) arrived piping hot. This suggests that they have pride in what they serve.  I hope not. If you say crab meat on the menu, and you charge $18.75, one should be able to get actual crab meat, not imitation crab meat.  We all know what it looks like: bright white with the signature red colored stripes, shape holding chunks that disintegrated into these coin like pieces. The bechamel was tasty, and the pasta only slightly over cooked.  He ate most of it.  He's just got back from overseas where Taco Bell is cuisine. I had to ask the server if it was real crab meat.  She said it was supposed to be.  Disbelief washed over me.  I've never balked at menu prices.  If you can't afford it go elsewhere.  I happy to pay for quality and good service.  But twenty bucks for fake crab? That is offensive.  More offensive later. I let that go. Service here was not bad.  The server did smell of cigarette smoke when she brought out bread but she was pleasant. 
My braciole( forgive the spelling) I expected to be a thing of beauty. It's not something you see everywhere and truthfully an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond sold me on it. What I got was mutt ugly.  Sauce was tasty.  Somebody in the building may care.  The rest? Frozen manicotti sandwich the steak? that was stuffed with sausage, all under a mountain of gloopy rubbery world's lowest quality mozzarella.  Covering everything in cheese does not make it better.  I love cheese.  It complements many things well, but when chewing it is liking eating rubber bands, too far. The steak? was barely beef.  If you walk in the open kitchen I'm betting you'll find the package of Hormel roast beef that it came out of. Perfectly oval slices of exact thickness with a signature and distinctive processed taste and smell.  I even unrolled it. Great for making sandwiches for people you don't like. The sausage inside can be best described as.  It shouldn't be described.  It could convert you to vegetarianism. 

While I waited for my nephew to finish. He is young and forgiving.  I enjoyed the decor until something caught my eye.  Near the register and entrance was a family portrait presumably. The people seemed happy and proud.  What was concerning and offensive was that across the top and clearly in the background of the photo was a small US flag and proudly next to it a Confederate one.  I am a patriot.  My nephew is an active duty one.  I believe in the right to express your opinions. Nothing wrong with showing pride in this country.  Showing pride in the Confederate battle flag clearly invites judgement.  

My judgement is this: political views inclinations aside, I can not recall having food this horrific, ever.  I left hungry with no interest in dessert.  The food was awful before I saw the flag and I daresay it will remain.  Big shame."}
{"text":"Being new to Charlotte, Open Kitchen was one of many landmarks I wanted to sample. Unfortunately, I was tremendously disappointed. Although the decor has an inviting old world look and feel, the floors were dirty and my table sticky.  The Parmesan, salt & pepper containers were caked in grime and the older waitress was surly and non attentive. I ordered the calamari and it was clearly frozen by its taste and rubbery texture. When my eggplant entree arrived, I was hopeful by its appearance but after digging through endless layers of cheese, 
I discovered a watery thin sauce with bland ground beef and tiny diced up mushy bits of eggplant.  Saying that this dinner was awful is an understatement. As a topper to the evening, the guests at the table near me requested more Parmesan cheese as their container was empty and my great surly waitress, without batting an eye spun around, grabbed the container from my table and sat it on theirs!  I will never recommend or return."}
{"text":"This food was gross. They tried to pass it off as authentic Italian cuisine. I wondered why it said international food......because it wasn't authentic!!! It was American Italian food. Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Love open kitchen, the food and service was great! I love the atmosphere it's like going back in time. There is not a bad thing on the menu! Some of the best meatballs l've ever had!"}
{"text":"The veal dish I had was amazing and you can't beat the atmosphere of one of charlottes oldest restaurants"}
{"text":"This a really cute restaurant, and the food isn't bad at all. Everything I've tried has been okay, but it's also not the best I've had (I.e. I'd still go to Maggianos if I'm craving the best Italian for the best experience). The soup is great. I do wish they'd serve their bread warm when it's given to your table when you're seated, but it's never stale. Service can be kind of slow but I don't go when I'm in a rush."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Neighborhood for 10 years and we need more great restaurants.  Unfortunately, Open Kitchen is not one of them.  I can promise after several tries attempts and a very low bar of criticism, this is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to.  There are zero redeeming qualities.  It needs to be bulldozed and redeveloped into a chef driven concept with a great bar/lounge that will satisfy Uptowners and neighborhood folks alike.  Anything would be an improvement...like a kitchen fire."}
{"text":"Food tasted less than average, kind of Chef Boyardeeish.  The owner complained how business is nothing what it used to be and snuffed at my Groupon and spoke under his breath and complained about people using plastic instead of the good ole days when everyone paid cash!  Go figure.  I won't be back again."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and thought to check this place out. The food was so bad that it got me thinking I should sell my house and move"}
{"text":"Finally made it here for lunch.  Atmosphere is Old School nostalgic and cool for sure.  Service was quick.  The food (chicken parm) was good.  A little pricey for lunch but they did have other lunch special offerings if price was my biggest concern.  I will definitely bring my wife for dinner."}
{"text":"not what it used to be,i have been many times over the years and am sad to say that this will be my last! ordered the crabmeat parmesan  for $ 17.00, all it was a bowl of melted cheese with a faint taste of crabmeat,none was actually seen in the dish.i have ordered this dish many times and over the last few years, it gets smaller and smaller while the price goes up and up! when paying at the front she says how was everything,i said not happy with the entree and she said maybe i should order something else the next time,she was right but it will not be from this place! this dish looked like someone dropped a jar of babyfood in it and then topped it with a layer of cheese.why does these old establishments serve food like this,why not just close up and move on!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised by all the bad reviews. I'm glad I didn't check yelp before I ate here (I usually always do). My bf and I stopped for dinner tonight. It's a very old school spot. I ordered chicken parm and it was delicious! My bf ordered some sausage entree and he loved it. We ordered a small sausage & pepper pizza too...which we both liked. It was nice to eat a pizza that was nothing like dominoes or papa johns. The food was real Italian food. I felt like I could walk in the kitchen and find my grandmother making the meals. It wasn't out of this world good, but it felt like home. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Within one week, I had 3 different individuals mention this restaurant to me - raved about the authentic Italian food.  My parents are off-the-boat Italian.  I know authentic Italian.  This wasn't it.  It seemed that everything had a twist to authentic.  
The Italian antipasto salad was good.  For the entree, I had the eggplant parmigiana.  It was floating in oil and cheese.  I ate as much of the eggplant and meat as I could dig out.  The bread basket had variety but the sliced bread was non-descript.  Thank goodness for Groupon!"}
{"text":"I had an antipasto salad - medium - perfect size for one person. There was a good amount of meat and cheese, but only 2 olives, which was a bummer. I got a substitute for tomatoes for an egg.
Everyone seemed that they liked their meals, but no 'loving' anything.
I think the large would've given me two meals, and the small might have been a little filler prior to another entree.
There are specials every night - we came in on a Thursday night & it was receive a free appetizer for 2 entrees bought. There were 4 of us, and the waitress was kind enough to give us 2 appetizers (mozzarella sticks and cheesy bread).
Overall, a friendly, casual, nicely priced (aka cheap prices) restaurant, that if I was in the area, I wouldn't mind stopping at again."}
{"text":"We went here for one of our anniversarys and it was very delightful. The food is really good for a fair price. It has a great atmosphere and an old school vibe."}
{"text":"The main reason for 2 stars is the decor, good grief it's a visual carnival inside. I love the mash up of nutty stuff collected over the past 62 years. Too bad the food is so bad.  I had a small side salad to start which the waiter described as Greek. Well it had cut up canned pickled beets on iceberg lettuce. Just odd. He brought a side of bread, wow Lance prepackaged breadsticks!  I had no idea they still made those things. I think Sysco foods is making a killing here. For the pizza, ugh. Just bad. Frozen dough with chopped vegetables on it, little or no sauce. Tasteless is really the only way to describe it. It's really a shame because the location is so great. Feels like a family business that they have had so long, they lost the passion."}
{"text":"Oh wow talk about a throw back in time. But if you like really good authentic Italian food this is your place the ambience I'll be honest a little weird but it is so eclectic it was funny. Try the Barcelona chicken you will fall in love pizza is excellent prices you can well afford. And the waitstaffAre really helpful if you don't know what you want to eat they don't rush you an excellent place to go in Charlotte a hidden gem"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a froofy, over-priced, millennial-frequented place, then this is not it. What this place IS, is an old-school Charlotte staple serving authentic Greek/Italian food. They do it up right here. If you're looking for Lasagna, get the Lasagna parmigiana because it has all the cheesy goodness. Also, highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer.

All the negative reviews confuse me because this place is straight up delicious. Perhaps they were expecting something else. Let's just put it this way, if you grew up in the Charlotte area BEFORE the influx of non-North Carolinians, then you'll understand."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant in 20 years I have ever gone too in Charlotte NC! Food was absolutely disgusting. We both feel sick. I only ate 3 bites Rude manager,poor waitress was a nervous wreck. Good reviews that's why we went.Must be posted by family members and friends. What a disappointment. Stay away for your health!"}
{"text":"This place has everything to be a great local Italian place except one thing, good Italian food!  I had the spaghetti with Italian sausage. What I got didn't look like any plate of spaghetti I've ever seen. The sausage was piled on top the meat sauce in ground pile. Poor, poor presentation.  I tasted the pizza and the crust was undercooked and burnt on the edges. Obviously the oven was too hot. My advise, stop in have a drink enjoy the atmosphere then gotlot Olive Garden to eat."}
{"text":"Quick recap: if you like Italian, this is your spot. A little spot in Charlotte that is family run. Nothing here disappointed and the service was amazing. 

Ordered pizza and baked ziti and both were on point. Friends got lasagna and chicken parm and no one left a crumb on their plates. 

The layout is a little dark but it makes it feel cozy and very local. Not a chain by any stretch of the imagination. 

Service was on point and not a single complaint here."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say about this place!
Hmm, the atmosphere is good, food ok, but the service I received...HAHA terrible! 
I assume since I went with a group of my friends and we are \"college kids\" she was expecting us to not tip well or be obnoxious one of the few things labeled as being a college student. First she was rude, second she would not give us our 'complimentary' basket of bread! Therefor she received very little tip! I was not impressed with her at all! 
The food could of been better but what can you expect for a cheap price! 
Overall the experience was ok, not the best, but definitely not the worst! Could of been better!

I though will never be back!

{"text":"I am baffled that this place is still in business and has a packed parking lot at night. It's dying for Chef Ramsey to come in and do a turnaround on it. It's textbook \"We've lost the love of cooking\" and now takes the easy way out and used canned everything. Even the \"world famous pies\" are frozen perfectly round manufactured pizzas with congealed cheese in one gross layer and no flavor. It's like a mini-frisbee with a little cheap pizza sauce and gross elementary school cheese. I ate one of the 8 slices of the pizza and called it quits.

The lunch side salad came in a little bowl with iceberg lettuce and an INCH of Italian dressing. Yes, an inch. It was ridiculous.  The lasagna and spaghetti is very generic.  The only thing I can say anything positive about (besides the awesome kitschy interior is the seafood dish with bechamel sauce, but you can only get it once every 2 years for fear of heart attack because it's so rich.  

I'm sounding hateful, not because I want them to go away, which I don't but because I want them to reinvigorate their menu to be authentic Italian (or heck, even Greek since they're greek!) I love the place, but it's not enough to get me to eat the food, so that says a lot. I wanted to be a regular, but I just can't stomach it. I might phone up Gordon to save them from themselves..."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is in business. When ordering my meal, I asked the server if the pasta was homemade, and she said she had no idea.  Ordered a side salad and was served some chopped up romaine without a single vegetable... odd. My entree (chicken parm) cane out quickly, and I had high expectations since the server recommended it. Unfortunately, it was disgusting. The sauce was watered down and bland, saving grace for the chicken was the abundant cheese to mask the lackluster flavor, and the pasta was straight out of a box. Disappointing to say the least. The server brought the check and asked if we wanted boxes... definitely not. Would have been nice if she checked in after serving our meals, or when we ran out of drinks after our salads. You know you had a bad meal when you have to stop at the Golden Arches on your way home. Save yourself the time and expense and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First of all let me start off by saying \"I love Italian food\".  So with that being said, I had the WORST experience at the \"World Famous\" Open Kitchen that I have ever had at any reputable establishment. I had previously been to this restaurant and did not really care for the food, but it was a very late dinner so I chalked it up to that.  Present day and needless to say I find myself here again. But since I had purchased a Groupon, I thought all would not be lost because I would get a discount on my meal.  I ordered the Fettuccine with Shrimp; let's just say Lean Cuisine should tell them to stop using their recipe.  Not authentic at all. Yuck! This is the \"World Famous\" Open Kitchen!!
So now we receive our bills and because we are in a party larger than 6 per the menu, we automatically are going to be charged 15% for gratuity for our meals which is customary and we were good with, but we were not charged 15%, we were charged 20% and when we asked the Manager about it he had no real reason for charging us more. And I must also mention that he stated that since we were all at the same table (that they put together, mind you) only ONE person could use the Groupon, although the Groupon states one coupon per visit, per person, not per TABLE! And we had three different groups of people at the table with three different bills. After continuous protest He still would not let us use the other Groupon coupons, which was $17 off a $30 value and my bill was over $60!!
So on top of the food and service being substandard we also were overcharged for gratuity and were not allowed to use the Groupons that we purchased online. So if you don't mind Chef Boyardee cuisine in an old dark outdated restaurant where they can charge you however much they see fit, than this is the place for you! But don't expect to see me there EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"wow...such a letdown.  Probably been 30 years since I was last here, and at first was so pleased that they were still around.  Question now is, how in the heck is the Open Kitchen still open?!! 

Seriously, everything was bad...flavorless, textureless bread, limp and watery salad, tasted worse than frozen pizza, toughest veal we've ever had.  Hate to say it, but it's time for this place to go or undergo a major overhaul."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. A perfect Italian choice!! The lasagna parm and chicken parm, exceeded expectations. Perfect for a night in, with red box. The food had fantastic flavor and the ample amount of spices!"}
{"text":"Food is very hearty and you can tell it is indeed made from scratch. Interesting decor...Looks like an original Buca DiBeppo. A lot of regulars (age 60+) eat here. 
I've read a lot of comments about the poor service. The waitstaff seems rushed and 'appear' too busy to be bothered with your questions about the menu but the food is good. They will easily make substitutions where possible w/o 'nickle and diming' you. Only two seafood dishes. Lots of beef, veal and chicken.
If the aloof service bothers you then I'd suggest take-out :)"}
{"text":"Ok, I must admit that just based on food alone, I would have to give it only 2 stars. However, being a native Charlottean, I can't help but become overwhelmed with nostalgia when I walk in the door.   I have some good memories of coming here with friends & family when I was a kid and that   makes me enjoy the place more than I would otherwise. 

This is certainly not authentic Italian food by any stretch of the imagination. Like so many restaurants in Charlotte back when I was a kid, this place is owned by a Greek family, so you really are getting Greek-Italian-American food. That usually means over-cooked pasta, sort of bland tomato sauce and loads of cheese. 

It's not a place I  frequent, but on occasion, its fun to go for a lunch down memory lane."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE Customer Service from Manager. When trying to redeem a Groupon whose $24 promotional value had expired but the $12 actual value was still valid, the manager refused to honor it even though I showed him the fine print. After 10 minutes of trying to reason, the manager told me to \"Get out of my hair\" and \"I hope you eat crap\". Food was only ok, but good portions for the price. Our waitress was good, but the manager ruined any positive experience."}
{"text":"The Open Kitchen offered decent Italian food, but I wouldn't call it \"world famous\".  The atmosphere was the best part of my visit.  I loved the brick interior.  The servers were kind and attentive, but it's worth noting that our party of four was served after nearly 20 minutes of waiting, and with only a handful of other guests in the restaurant at the time (weekday for lunch).

I ordered the cheese-stuffed cannelloni and I thought it to be an acceptable dish, but I can't say I'd ever go back there again.  I've had better, cheaper Italian elsewhere in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Groupon led me in and I was real anxious to try it. I'd driven by it for years on the way to Charlotte and the curiosity led me to buy a Groupon for half off. I was very pleased. The food had a lot of flavor. I had the egg plant dish and it was the best I'd had. There spaghetti sauce was liken to an old family recipe. Their cheese bread complimented the meal beautifully. The atmosphere made it much better, it was a homey place with artsy designs and the staff were very welcoming and helpful. I'd love to go back soon, I'd say the food was very authentic just like the owners."}
{"text":"So I cannot even give this place a star, I only gave it 1 star because you have to in order to write a review. I love Italian food, but there is nothing to love or even like about this place. I order an ice tea, it was horrible! You can't mess up Iced Tea. The bread was store brought Italian bread from the grocery store. The salad is bag salad from a grocery store with dressing on it. And I ordered the lasagna.....the frozen one from Stueffers is better. A true waste of money. Nothing taste authentic at all. I would have been better off at a chain restaurant like Olive Garden or Chef Boyardee"}
{"text":"Came here with a group for a friend's birthday.  We decided we wanted to do family-style so we ordered some appetizers, salads, and entrees.  Our server was spot-on with service and recommendations.  Often times groups are hard to manage and the food takes very long, but not in this case!  My tea stayed full and when we left our bellies were all full.

They had some interesting items on the menu and if I ever decide to try liver it will definitely be here!"}
{"text":"Got a Groupon, went and it's Ok! Ravioli was very meaty,  pizza crust was not fresh,  AT ALL, to top it off, the drinks came in PLASTIC CUPS. The best thing about the night was the waitress, she's was hilarious."}
{"text":"We were just verbally abused by the manager. I approached him because he yelled at my 2 year old to \"stop asking to see the swinging monkey and go back to your table!\" It's a toy in the foyer. I let him know she and her older cousins were very upset with the way he spoke to them. He said that's how he runs his business and his customers were complaining. I let him know we were his customers since the 70s, but no longer. It was a long, heated exchange that I still cannot believe. Simply put, he's not a nice man and he does not deserve your business. Especially with the food being just barely average. 

I recommend Zio's. Also been here forever, but much better food and good, positive people you'd feel good about supporting."}
{"text":"I had lived near this place for a year and never made it there.  I'm not sure I'm sad about that either. 

I used a groupon to go here so I was able to taste appetizers, entrees, wine & desert.  The prices were very reasonable but I wasn't super impressed with the food.

Our waitress brought out some bread & breadsticks.  I love my bread so I was sad when it wasn't fresh made, it was definitely bought.  The breadsticks were more like bread crackers that came in little plastic bags just like crackers do.  Nothing to come back for there.

I got the lasagna that was described as \"put back in the oven with more cheese\", and though the lasagna part of the dish was fine - the gobs of cheese and grease weren't really up my alley.

We had enough money leftover to get desert so we splurged for cheesecake - with pineapple.  I had never had pineapple cheesecake and now I know why.  It was very gelatin-y and we had to scrape the orange colored \"pineapple\" off the top.

The decorations and the history of the place were neat, and I'm a bit sad I didn't try the famous pizza, but I don't think I'll be going back to try it either."}
{"text":"Do not order the pizza.  Crusts are prefab and tasteless as is the sauce.  Calamari was tender but had little flavor and the marinara for dipping was watery and again little flavor .  Super disappointed.  Maybe their pasta is better.  The pizza at QuickTrip is better at half the price."}
{"text":"Best Italian food restaurant in all the Charlotte area--and a major tradition in the Queen City that dates back to 1952. Delicious pizza and pasta. Service was a bit spotty during our meal, which is why I give it four stars. We'll be back. The atmosphere feels more New York than Charlotte. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"The Open Kitchen has been my favorite place since I was a kid but unfortunately it was a total disappointment Saturday.  I ordered \"the steak\" dinner.  It looked great but was all fat.  I kindly sent it back.  I then ordered the Chicken Parmigiana. It was dry but  edible.  We had a kids meal, Manicotti and two Chicken Parmigiana and the bill was $75 and some change.  I was overcharged by about $10 but I didn't catch it.  So with tip a very disappointing mean cost me $90.  Should have gone to a franchise."}
{"text":"Open kitchen was the first restaurant to offer pizza in the Charlotte area, and the place is filled with nostalgic atmosphere, complete with red and white checkerboard charm.  The place has value because of its place in history, and no doubt has many lifelong followers.  

Despite the fact that the pizzas are baked on pre-cooked frozen shells, they still had a nostalgic appeal of something that I might have had as a little kid.  The crust was crunchy, and the cheese was full of sharp flavors and spices.  For anyone looking for sophistication, consider yourselves forewarned.  The spaghetti and meat sauce was a pretty big disappointment with slight sweetness, but if I lived near Charlotte, I might return for the pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place in Charlotte. Very good pastas and nice salads. Haven't had the pizza but they look great. My only possible complaint is that the baked pasta dishes are always so hot that it is 30 minutes before you can eat them without burning your mouth. No exaggeration.  Great service and atmosphere with a nice selection of options."}
{"text":"Tour de Italia de Food Lion..

Great place if you want to explore the wonders of canned and frozen Italian cuisine! 

I had the chicken Barcelona, featuring canned mushrooms, an unnaturally generous helping of what can be best described as \"sketchy meat grease,\" and something extra on the side I didn't remember seeing on the menu: canned, unflavored tomato paste.   

I was perplexed.   Until my girl friend got her manicotti dish; which correctly featured the canned unflavored tomato paste but had a seemingly random addition of the canned mushrooms.  

Something like this must have gone through their heads to reach an epiphany reserved for the great Italian philosophers: \"well, we opened the can of mushrooms and there's still a third left, that's 25 cent worth.  And we opened this big can of tomato paste with at least 30 cents worth left... I have an idea - lets RANDOMLY ADD THE CANNED INGREDIENTS TO BOTH DISHES AND SAVE 55 CENTS!!

Enjoy, the frozen cheesy garlic bread actually was quite good!"}
{"text":"a really family and date night spot. Pizza is great and customer service is really good. its like going to Aunt's house."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business.   My family went last night on the recommendation of a neighbor who grew up in the area.   My daughter ordered a pizza that was a warmed up frozen pizza.  I had a greek salad with beets and my husband had veal parm that was \"congealed\".  My husband wanted angel hair instead of spaghetti and we were told it was possible... for $3 more.  I know many restaurants have fees for special requests but this was just which box of pasta to throw in the water.  The cheesecake is like a slice of bread from a loaf pan which was chunky and had not been thoroughly mixed to be smooth...ugh!   I will add that our waitress was quite lovely and felt awful explaining the up fee for a simple pasta change as well as keeping our drinks full and was horrified that the cheesecake was something the kitchen knew about yet served anyway.  If it's world famous it's because it might be the worst place still in business.  ......calling Gordon Ramsey......"}
{"text":"I really don't know what these reviewers are talking about. I will admit that I grew up going here but continued to until I moved out of state. This was mine and my husband's favorite date spot. I always got a cup of minestrone soup and dipped the bread in it. The lasagna parmesan is to die for and though you might not expect it, they actually do have the best steak in town which they call our
 best steak that is topped with yummy mushrooms. The service has always been top notch and this is one of the places we are already missing. Please don't let the bad reviews sway you. This place has a very loyal following for a reason. Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"I worked here for 3 years give or take so I can claim expert status on this review.

Sausage Crumbles and the Marinara on the lasagna are way better than the normal meat sauce. 

The Meatballs are hit or miss depending on who makes them.

Eggplant Parm is insanely good and my all time favorite.

Sweet Tea is insanely sweet

Chicken Parm is great for low carb but not low fat.

The Barcelona is great! but you better like melted butter because there is a half a stick of butter on your plate. and no, it is not butter like substitute, it really is butter from an actual stick.  

The Ranch, Blue Cheese, 1000, and French are all home made dressings as is the Mama Ks but your side salad is not going to be some dolled up salad so don't expect it.   

Both the marinara and the meat sauce are home made. 

Yes the place is old and a bit dusty but if you can name one restaurant in charlotte that has been opened for 60 years consecutively that isn't, I will eat my words.   *no pun intended.     

Thats my review folks!"}
{"text":"first impressions: the world famous open kitchen has seen better days.  tattered flags, rotted wood trim, faded paint and an overall dilapidated facia greets you in the parking log.  when you get inside, it almost feels nostalgic but the ecclectic nature of it all just made me feel like i was on an episode of american pickers.
i was recommended the lasagna if i was hungry, which i was.  the menu appeared to be your basic italian fare with nothing amazing jumping out.
the service was good as most the employees had that seasoned waitstaff feel about them.  our food came out relatively quick, which was a plus for lunch service.
while my portion was sufficient, there was nothing spectacular about the lasagna.  no real spice or boldness to the sauce.
hungry, i cleaned my plate of the blandness, but i don't see myself coming back..."}
{"text":"The first time we have ever went to this restaurant was yesterday it was awesome and our waitress Robin was fantastic looking forward to going back today for lunch and taking a friend with us.

My husband and I had a great time yesterday thanks again for being one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.

{"text":"I just walked in to check out the place because I always drive by it and had the craving for a cannoli. Now I'm not a cannoli cotnnesiour by any means but I've had a lot of cannolis locally and in Italy but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be soggy and soft. I'm assuming they fill their cannolis in the morning and let them sit with the filling all day long. I'm still curious to try the actual meal and see what all these reviews are about but just for the cannoli I wasn't very impressed."}
{"text":"Revisiting an Old Friend -  Still Good after all of these years.

Back when to the first time I lived in Charlotte in the early 1970's, The Open Kitchen was already a tradition having been in business for 20 years at that time.  If you wanted a good dinner in the what was otherwise a culinary desert, you had two choices. One was The Open Kitchen which was more casual and the Gondola which was  bit more upscale and catered to a slightly different crowd. 

The Gondola is long gone but now 66  years later, The Open Kitchen is still going strong.  Not as crowded as back in the 70's but a lot more dining options but still a good crowd this evening. Say's a lot about the quality of a restaurant to make it to 66 years.

For a change, i had to drop a package off at the UPS terminal this afternoon which was a Saturday and while I was down here, decided to go to The Open Kitchen for dinner.

Parking lot was full but got lucky because someone was backing out as I turned in so I scored a spot near the door.

Walked in and it was pretty much as I remembered it with a bit more whimsical trinkets added.  Seated pretty quickly in a nice table in the corner where I had a good view of the dining room.

When I was seated, I was given menu's so did not have to wait for my server.  She came out and took my drink order for 1/2 and 1/2 tea and while she got that, continued to study the menu. So many choices ...

She came back with my tea and with some bread for the table and I ordered a Small Greek Salad and the Veal Barcelona for dinner.

I was amazed how quick the Greek Salad came out and if that is a small salad, I would hate to see what the large one looked like. Had it with Mama K's   which had a perfect balance of herb and vinegar.  Lettuce was nice and fresh as was the tomato, olives, pepperonici etc. all topped with a generous amount of Feta Cheese.

The Veal Barcelona came out a bit later and it was nice and hot.  A bed or Pasta with Veal pieces cooked with a generous amount of mushrooms cooked  in a lemon oregano sauce and Marinara to add to your hearts desire. Other than the Marinara was a bit bland and while it had a good taste, it was not a vibrant presentation.

Still it was a great dining experience and were much like I remembered.

Atmosphere is interesting. A lot of miscellaneous things scattered throughout the dining room. One thing that I did not quite understand was a balancing jester on a string suspended over the dining room. Did not understand it till a father and his young son got up to leave and while the father held the little boy, probably about 2 or 3 in his arms, the owner of the restaurant raised the string and the jester started sliding across the restaurant.  The little boy was captivated.

I took a picture of that and the little boys grandmother came over and we chatted and she reminded me that when I was here with my sons, the jester was a bear.  She's right and now I remember.

Other thing I enjoyed was the collection of campaign buttons behind the front counter going back to the 1960\"s.

Great Place.  Warm and Cozy Feel. Good hospitality with Great Cuisine. 

It's a bit worn in some places but what do you expect after 66 years.

Great Spot and give it a try.  For out of town visitors, check hours first but if open, it's right off I-77 in Charlotte at the Morehead Street Exit on the west side."}
{"text":"This is your standard, old-school red sauce Italian restaurant. It's neither good or bad, really. It's much better than heating up a frozen lasagna, but not as good as a well-run Maggiano's (yes, really). I like it OK - I wouldn't seek it out, but wouldn't have a problem going there - but my GF doesn't."}
{"text":"Service was good,  BUT THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE,  MADE ME VIOLENTLY ILL.  I had the '' World famous lasagna''  and as one who makes a mean lasagna,  was NOT impressed with its taste,  but fought thru it anyway,  thinking I was just being overly critical.  Salad was poor,  overall rating should be '' Shut down and make a kiddie playground inside ''  If could give it no stars,  I would..."}
{"text":"I love authentic Italian food... This place did not disappoint. Open Kitchen has been around for 60 years and I now see why. My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday night. It wasn't busy but it wasn't dead. The restaurant is decorated with different giant figurines, old head shots of actors, a whole wall of college pennants. We were given a small table in the corner. Which was fine with us. Complementary French bread was brought right away.... Yum. We started with an order of the calamari. The breading on the calamari was very flavorful. The marinara that accompanied the calamari was very simple. Nothing wrong with that. My boyfriend ordered the crab meat parm and I got the spaghetti with white clam sauce. I loved the clam sauce. The clams were tender and the sauce was perfect. Exactly what I wanted. My boyfriend enjoyed his dish but I feel like he liked mine better. No worries there cause my dish was family size portion. I had a glass of the Malbec to accompany my dinner. I firmly believe you don't go to Italian restaurants without trying the dessert. We shared a tiramisu. It was light and dreamy. A perfect way to end the meal. Our server was a little overwhelmed tonight but who hadn't been there. Good times all around!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from this area and remember fondly my childhood days when my parents would make the 45 minute drive to Charlotte to eat at the Open Kitchen.  This of course only happened on rare and special occasions and the OK and the Gondola were the only places to get a pizza!  The food was really great back then!   So, I wanted to have a great experience but when I recently dined there, I was seriously disappointed.  The same charming ambiance is still there -- the college pennants on the wall/ceiling, photos of old Charlotte, etc.  But sadly, they have lost the art of making great food.  The pizza was horrible!  (Any frozen pizza from the local grocery store would have been it's superior.)  The edges of the thin pre-molded crust were burnt, the slightly warm toppings were bland, sitting in a thin, rubbery cheese.  The bread was cold, with all the taste of a day old hot dog bun.  The salad?  Not much more than a chunk of lettuce drenched in Italian dressing.  This latest generation either failed to learn how to cook or has lost interest in doing so.  Chef Ramsey, where are you when we need you?  My recommendation:  Go there for the really warm and nostalgic atmosphere, order up a cold beer or nice glass of wine and enjoy the memories.  If you want good Italian or Greek food look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to the Open Kitchen about a year ago and the inside was very cool, lots of old Charlotte pics. To see how much S Tryon St has changed over the past 60-70 years is amazing. Really like the look/atmosphere of this place.

My favorite is Spaghetti so I gave theres a try and it was okay....not to die for, not bad just average. Compared to other restaurants I think they should offer you a little more food then they do but i suppose its about equal to Olive Garden. 

I was disappointed that they didn't offer any healthy pasta whole wheat replacements.

Overall, it was a nice experience....tried something new but I probably won't be going back. I'd recommend someone go there for a meal but I don't think it's going to work itself into one of your regular dine out spots."}
{"text":"I grew up coming to eat at Open Kitchen. After telling my son how good it is and then being severely disappointed, I doubt I'll ever be back. We ordered a pepperoni pizza. There were 6 slices of pepperoni on it. We counted. The crust is not hand-made but is  frozen store-bought (and I'm not taking about Boboli - that would have been MUCH better!) The sauce is horrible and the service isn't much better. I told my server that the pizza wasn't good. She just mumbled and left the table, no mention to get the manager, nothing. If you like the pizza here, then you will love ChefBoyardee out-of-the-box pizza. I couldn't tell the difference."}
{"text":"We went for a work party in the back so it probably wasn't a fair judgement. The food was good but I got the baked ziti and would try something else next time."}
{"text":"Wow I haven't been here since I was knee high to a grasshopper and all I have to say is BLEH! Not impressed whatsoever.. I don't know what did it in for me the stale store bought bread, the plastic cup my tea came in, the soppy noodles in my chicken barcelona, (quite frankly I'm surprised that my entrée didn't come out with a little paper plate and plastic fork), OR the fact that our waiter wanted us to pay the bill not even half way through our meal!  

Sigh. I'm glad we used Groupon.. I definitely would've dined and dashed hadn't it been for that.. 

I'm sorry (not really) but I would rather go to olive garden than go to this place ever again."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I expected. Why there are so many bad reviews is confusing to me. This is an old fashion Italian dive. The decor is not a \"carnival\" as someone put it. It's a typical old fashioned Italian restaurant. I'm guessing all the bad reviews are because people spoiled from the likes of fancy Italian fusion restaurants like Bravo etc had some silly expectations before they ever walked in the place. I've been to real Italian places in NY and this place is very much like them. Our meal was edible, not horrible like others have claimed. The cheese bread was AWESOME! Waiter was on the ball with refills. Their meatballs are the real deal, not just subpar ground beef rolled into a ball. Their main disappointment was that my mushrooms on my spaghetti with meat sauce were from a can and not cooked in with the sauce, but seeming heated on the side and tossed on top. We felt very welcomed having two children with us, and BTW they eat free on Tuesday. We will go again for sure."}
{"text":"Some of these nasty reviews on here are unbelievable. Don't let them fool you if you've never been. The open kitchen is amazing. The service is excellent and they frequently have groupon offers. The food is delicious. I have tried various things off the menu and have never eaten a bad meal there. The garlic cheese bread is great to have before the meal. I love their lasagna and chicken Parmesan. I can assure you all the food is homemade. If you're into disgusting, cheap quality Italian food like Olive Garden or Carrabbas, then this isn't the place for you! 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"Service is always great! The dining room has such an authentic feel. My favorite dish is chicken Barcelona. It's the most delicious chicken pasta dish I have ever had. They can get very busy on the weekends so be sure to arrive early! Don't forget to order a salad with the house Italian dressing! It is a little expensive but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Can I please give this restaurant 0 stars? I specifically told my mother that I did not want to eat at this restaurant simply because trying new things when I'm really hungry is not a good idea. 

Let's just say that when I left, I was just as hungry. This is by far the worst meal I've eaten in a long time. I would've been better off eating dog food from a can. The pizza was horrible. When it was brought to my table, I could smell the grossness radiating off of this sad excuse for a pizza. Who messes up pizza?? 

The worst part of this experience was the waitress. The waitress did not smile at all when she came and took our orders. When she brought our salads out, she sat them down without word. The salads were certainly not what we expected. We called her over to get her attention, and she came over and said \"what\" in a very nasty way. 

So basically, do not go to this restaurant. It was horrible. Someone needs to call restaurant impossible on this place. Horrible food and service."}
{"text":"I live right next to this restaurant and was extremely excited when I found out I had an italian restaurant walking distance!  Not only was I extremely disappointed by the food, but my friends were too; both times we went we came home with stomach aches.  The experience was sub-par and the decor seems dusty/musty.  We all tried different dishes and weren't \"wow\"-ed by any of it."}
{"text":"The food is Horrible. I went to dinner with 10 friends and we had a variety of food. I swear my pizza was frozen from the grocery store. No one ate their entire meal. No one took any left overs home  . We all are Charlotte natives and the nostalgia of this place hasn't changed however I will never eat there again   Honestly canned food is better. I can't think of a way it could have been worse."}
{"text":"Unfortunately being a Charlotte institution does not mean tasty food.

Open Kitchen has been around for a while, and it feels like it inside too. I have only found one thing on the menu that is actually edible (grilled chick sandwich). 

Their tomato sauce is very nasty, tastes like it came straight out of a can. So stay away from anything that has sauce on it (95% of menu). 

My workplace literally faces the back of OK and it sucks to smell food all day long, but know the taste will never be there."}
{"text":"It's locally owned. The building is old and historic. The inside has a very cool atmosphere.  It's within walking distance of my house.  For all of these reasons, I really, really want to like this place.  However, the food just isn't that great.  I've been three times now and each time I was pretty disappointed with the food.  

I've had pizza and two different pasta dishes.  The pizza was alright I guess.  The lasagna was ok too I guess.  However, the alfredo sauce I got with my chicken alfredo was treading closer to the side of thick gravy than alfredo.  Don't even get me started on the bread you receive pre-meal.  I think they just pull it straight out of the bag and put it in a basket.

Additionally, the prices do not match the actual food received.  Long story short...I MAY visit Open Kitchen every once and a while...but unless the menu/prices change, I definitely won't be a frequenter."}
{"text":"fabulous fabulous fabulous!!!!! next time i am down in nc, definetly going there again!"}
{"text":"Wife and I celebrated our 18th wedding anniversary with our children this evening at Open Kitchen. My buddy is from Charlotte and grew up down the road from Open Kitchen. He told me this would be a great place to celebrate. He was right. Food and service were both excellent!!!

Service- excellent 

Bread- excellent 

Anti-pasta salad- excellent 

Dinner- excellent excellent and excellent 
1. Wife had the combo for one....huge portion ...she didn't even eat half. She loved all of it except for the chicken livers. First time she tried them... I tasted them and they were fine...just something we don't eat.
2. Daughter had meatball sub and LOVED IT!!!
3. Son had grilled fingers and enjoyed them.
4. I had veal parmigiana....wow, wow, wow. DELICIOUS!!!!

Dessert- excellent...waitress brought us a piece of tiramisu. Wow...excellent!!!!

This was our first time and will definitely not be our last!!!!"}
{"text":"Really the place gets 2 stars except I like that campy atmosphere so I gave it three.  Good food but overpriced.  Pretty dead on a Saturday night so that tells you a lot.  Service is ok - maybe a repeat if I need to carb up for a marathon."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid!  Love the decor!  The salad and bread is yummy!  Veal barsalina is the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"I went here as a kid every time my family visited Charlotte. I've never had a bad experience or bad food. It's family owned and operated, and the recipes are the same as when they first opened. The atmosphere is unique and whimsical with old pictures, toys, menus, college pennants, etc.

Their meatballs are unbelievably YUM. And the chicken barcelona is fantastic!!

Cozy yet great for groups (they have a large section in the back for groups and overflow), this place has lots of charm and delicious dishes you must try!"}
{"text":"Well. I can't really suggest this place to anyone. But the food wasn't too bad, but it was too good either... After reading the reviews I noticed if you have eaten here all your life then you love it. But the new comers don't like it. I had ravioli, the cheese and sauce was really good. But the ravioli its self was way over cooked and they weren't the same meat and had no flavor. My husband had pizza. He said it was good but the crust looked premade, frozen. The inside was cool but alot to dust..."}
{"text":"The great thing about The Open Kitchen is that it never changes. I've lived in the Charlotte area all of my life (50 yrs) and The Open Kitchen is the same now as it was when I was young. My wife and I went to The Open Kitchen as teenagers and we took our children there when they were young. We have been married 30 years now and regularly enjoy The Open Kitchen. I agree the pizza isn't great, but many of the other dishes are wonderful. My personal favorite is the braciole. The Open Kitchen is the only restaurant that I am aware of in Charlotte that serves it. If you are looking for a fancy uptown dining experience then forget The Open Kitchen, but if you are looking to enjoy a good meal at a landmark Charlotte restaurant then try it out. The family that owns and operates The Open Kitchen are really good people and they are dedicated to preserving the ambiance and menu that made it World Famous."}
{"text":"This place is a little treasure. The atmosphere of The Open Kitchen is wonderful.  They're pizzas are wonderful. Occasionally have a slightly mysterious little spicy kick to them."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years I really really love the lasagne it's so good so is the bread"}
{"text":"Been living in the queen city and have been looking for a favorite pizza parlor, apart from the chain pizza joints...this isn't it, average at best, looked much better than it tasted... needed more sauce...disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for over 20 years.  The parking lot tells the truth.  It is almost always full.  I had lunch here Wednesday April 1
2015.  The place was full at 11:30, and stayed that way the whole time I was there.
My favorite lunch is a tossed salad, and meatball sub and fries.  The simple tossed salad is great.  Fresh crisp lettuce, tomatoes and dressing that tastes house made.  A thing of beauty.  The homemade meatballs on the sub roll are almost the size of baseballs, and loaded with flavor.  Anointed with tomato sauce and oven baked.  Perfect!!  

When the lot is full, including cop cars, that says a lot about what's inside."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a few times for lunch and had excellent service and food.  But Saturday we enjoyed a dinner, they were pretty packed but sat us pretty quickly.  We love the atmosphere very romantic and homey and old school.  The service was superb.  The food was excellent, the simplicity of it works well.  You don't need fancy names or ingredients, we both got veal dishes and they were AH-MAZING!!  The spaghetti was yummy and the marinara, what can I say.  Give it a try.. We will def be going back. :-)"}
{"text":"Went here twice for a small birthday celebration--the first time and the last time. I was INCREDIBLY disappointed with the food and can confidently say that the Olive Garden is more authentic (and cleaner, more reasonably priced, tastier, etc). My friend ordered spaghetti with mushrooms--it was an entire CAN of mushrooms dropped on top of the pasta. Not even cooked!!! Disgusting. The sauce had a metallic taste, so that almost certainly came from a can, and the noodles were mush. How can you offer \"traditional Italian fare\" and not cook a noodle correctly?

I got a \"small antipasto platter\" described as \"traditional greek salad, olives, tomatoes, salami, and cheese.\" It came out as a bed of lettuce with two green olives, hard unripened tomato wedges, BEETS (wtf? not in the description and not something you surprise folks with) and little triangles of generic meat and cheese arranged in a geometric pattern on top. $7.95 or so for $1.00 worth of Walmart ingredients. Does this place think it's funny to overcharge people for store-bought, prepackaged food? I didn't get the joke, and I don't understand how can this place can possibly take itself seriously. 

If you look closely at the reviews, you can read right through the thinly-veiled attempts to say something positive about this \"historical venue\" to the nasty reality. \"Almost half of the lasagna was cheese\"--yeah, they're hiding boxed noodles and sub-par sauce under there for $14. \"Crab meat\" and \"veal\"--yeah right. No way you're actually getting either of those meats in the dishes.

The only thing this place has going is its kitsch, and even then--it's dirty, dusty, and disgusting. We sat at a table with a creepy toy clown on a bicycle that kept zipping back and forth overhead, and you could see the dust on it. Over our food and drinks! I was appalled. If you have ever had an authentic or homemade Greek or Italian dish in your life, you will kick yourself for paying to eat anything at this restaurant. The owners should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I love this place since I moved from New Haven,  Connecticut and found this Gem of a place I've been coming back. See living in New Haven there are a lot of mom-and-pop Italian restaurant with great handed down recipes and this place feels just like that. Their lasagna is to die for...I love it. I simply love the old world feel. It feels like someone's Italian grandma is back there cooking her heart out and I'm getting to enjoy a spot at her table back in the old world. This is a must go and check out kind of place. If you go for lunch good luck the place is packed but worth the wait anytime you go. I haven't been in a while so I'm over due for a taste of Italian heaven. The prices are insane for the quality of food you get to enjoy. Great food fine. If you are looking for upscale Fusion Italian restaurant this is not your place. This is a dark and old feel  a family recipes kind of place."}
{"text":"We knew we were in trouble when we looked up into the ceiling and saw the piles of dust and debris.  Cob webs hanging from a ceiling fan - a total mess.  This place looks like it was frozen in 1972.  AND the Food.  Awful.  This is not Italian.  This is GREEK trying to masquerade as Italian.  FROZEN pizza doe.  The red sauce tasted like catsup with oregano.  We couldn't finish our meal.  Sanitation Rating 95?  Really?  The Health Department was being generous."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see the star average for Open Kitchen which prompted me to really write this review. I've been coming to this restaurant for 30+ years and everything about it is top notch. There's something nostalgic about a restaurant like this--its survived economic ups and downs and the Great Recession of 2008-09. The food is excellent from the salads to pizza to entrees. The service is very good and the ambience is old school/nostalgic. I highly recommend this restaurant for all of the reasons mentioned here."}
{"text":"I got the lasagna parmigiana and it was delicious. I couldn't even finish half of it. Cheesy and meaty. We got a calamari appetizer and they were cook good. Thought it was strange they served it with cocktail sauce instead of marinara. Had to ask for marinara. Hubby got spaghetti and meat balls with mushrooms. He personally likes the marinara sauce better than the meat sauce. He didn't like that they served canned mushrooms instead of fresh mushrooms. I personally like canned mushrooms. Bread is good. Both servers we had were super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Okay - so this place is a Charlotte institution not for the reason that it's exceptional but it's definitely a throwback.  If you go into your experience at Open Kitchen with the idea that you'll have a culinary revelation, you'll be disappointed.  This is, what I would expect, would have been the same menu in the 50's and 60's and prepared the same way.  In the days where eating \"ethnic\" was Chinese or Italian, this was your Italian option.

Everything you've head about this place is true.  Yes, the waitresses turn the table cloths over between servings and the drinks are served in clear solo cups.  One little irk I always have with places that offer bread that isn't warm and cold butter.  The bread would have been 100 times better if it warmed however the waitress did provide a plate of balsamic and olive oil.

I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was pretty good.  The meatballs were large and the sauce was pretty good.  The eggplant parm was also decent but was served with meat sauce; so not exactly an option for vegetarians.  

I would highly recommend trying this place at least once.  When all the new restaurants are offering a new interpretation of what Italian food could be, this is Italian without pretense and it's not bad at all.  Plus, they have pebble ice."}
{"text":"The decor is tired and old but cozy. The waitress was sweet and attentive. That's the good news.  The food was horrible! The veal Barcelona was pre cooked roast beef, canned mushrooms and butter over overcooked mushy pasta.  there was no lemon or anything fresh. 
I told the server that the meat was dry, overcooked and old tasting. She assured me that it was cooked earlier today and reheated when ordered. I asked if there was anything cooked fresh to order. Her answer was no, everything is pre cooked and reheated when ordered   All the chicken, veal, and meat is prepared earlier. 
The red sauce is from a can (hunts) I think. The bread was cold and tasteless. 
I will not be back. There are too many good restaurants around"}
{"text":"This was one of the first places that I ever went to when I moved to Charlotte. And over the course of nine years, I ate lunch here entirely too much. Why? Well, I worked two blocks from this place.

It's an old-school Italian restaurant family owned and open since 1952.  The walls are plastered with all kinds of nostalgia. One wall is covered in college flags. There is even a Nebraska one. Go Huskers! 

The lunch specials are by far the best deal here. Basically, it's a menu of things covered in cheese. They are good sized portions. The meal comes with your choice of a cup of Minestrone soup or a side salad (heads up: it's just iceberg lettuce) and a drink (tea, water or coffee). Also, THEY HAVE THE GOOD ICE. 

I really like the chicken barcelona. Yes, it does sound like it would be a little healthier than the others. However, it seems like it's made with a lot of butter. This is one of those places where you just need to accept that you're going to consume some calories, unless you go the salad route. Cheesy garlic bread is a must. Hey, if you're gonna be bad, do it right. 

The service can be slow at times, but everyone who works here is so ridiculously nice. Can't decide what to order? Tell them what you're debating. They can help you make the decision. We got here late on a Sunday evening because our friend's flight was delayed. They were more than gracious to still welcome us in for dinner."}
{"text":"Totally shocked by so many of the reviews of the OK! 

Here is what to get: 

Garlic cheese bread. It will knock off your socks and change your life. 

Veal OR chicken Barcelona (I'm talking veal people) but, this is for keeps. 

Crab meat Parmigiana-has the perfect touch of sherry. 

Deluxe Grilled Chicken Sandwhich-gives Chick-fil-A a RUN for its money! 

Add grilled chicken to a small Greek salad with Mama K's famous dressing and you've got one h** of a meal. 

The ambiance is enchanting.  A collage of old photographs and memorabilia- I don't think anyone can walk into the Open Kitchen without getting a touch of nostalgia. Not enough places like this left in the world today! Oh, and don't forget the cheese bread!"}
{"text":"Bit of trivia.  Open Kitchen was the first place in North Carolina to serve pizza.  

Yes, people traveled near and far to experiment with such \"international cuisine.\" It wasn't all that long ago that PIZZA was unique.   

Of course, it wasn't all that long ago that you could see SugarCreek at Dixie Electric Company next to Cinema Blue.  

And for you babies whom want to correct me, \"The Creek\" was originally named SugarCreek and they lived off Carmel Road.   

The food as a whole is truly extra-medium; but, walking in the front door is like entering a time warp circa 1974.  

Charlotte hasn't done a very good job saving the historical places. . .or bands.  What ever happend to SugarCreek?   Heck, less than 3 blocks away is an empty, leveled field where Coffee Cup used to be.  Sigh.  

As such, Open Kitchen is a fun place to go on occasion. 

Italian:  no.  Go to Villa Antonios for that.  

Old Charlotte \"Greek Italian\" cooking and a tase of history:  yes.  They're nice people and you'll see some fun B&W photos at the cash register."}
{"text":"It was a very nice place.I was waiting for a mobster to walk in with his wise guys while me and my boyfriend were eating. We went for my birth day yesterday and the service was super fast and friendly. The salads and sweet tea are great. Sweet tea is a serious matter in my home... lol! Loved it! We will be back and try the pizza and beer next time! The table clothes are really neat and the rest of the decor keeps ya looking for the next surprise!"}
{"text":"For typical, American style, cheese bomb type Italian food, Open Kitchen is great.  For anything resembling real Italian food, look elsewhere.  Open Kitchen is a Charlotte institution that has been there for ages.  The people manning the various positions, cashier, waitress, manager, seem to have been there for ages also.  They are very friendly and at home roaming the spacious Open Kitchen floor.  Ironically, the kitchen is not open, it is back through a narrow hallway.  The lasagna was cheesy, and probably 5 thousand calories, but tasty nonetheless.  It had a hint of Nutmeg which added some nice flavor. 

As long as you go in with the appropriate expectations and are OK with consuming massive amounts of cheese calories, Open Kitchen is a fine option if you are in the area.  It's not fantastic, it's not awful.  It's just there."}
{"text":"I live about 45 minutes away from this place but it is worth the trip.  When I was in high school this is where your \"serious\" boyfriend took you for a special date.  The building hasn't changed much since my high school days.  The food hasn't changed either.  It's still wonderful, hot, and freshly made.  My daughter and I went for lunch yesterday.  We both ordered the cannelloni.  It was hot, very cheesy, and delicious.  Or course I got the tiramisu for dessert and it was also wonderful.  The price was reasonable.  $8.95 for the lunch special not including the dessert.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  It is very clean inside and I have never gotten a dish or silverware that was dirty, unlike what one reviewer mentioned.  There's a reason this place has been in business for 65 years.  It's good!  Even at lunch the place was packed with customers all of which seemed very happy."}
{"text":"World Famous? OMG...World Famous? 

I am a lifelong Charlottean and the Open Kitchen of my youth must be in a pod somewhere waiting instructions from the mothership. This place gives restaurants...no...anyplace with a kitchen, a bad name. Terrible greasy smelly cheesy food. Cinnamon or nutmeg or something in the sauce. flimsy plastic cups and paper plates, cold bread. And to top it off the woman at the register was very rude. 

Come back Mama K.....we need you."}
{"text":"The first time I visited here was horrible. The eggplant parm is absolutely disgusting. Cinnamon flavor and just gross!!! That was several years ago, so I decided to try again today. The sanitation rating scared me at 92...ehhhh should be a lot better. It was very busy for a Wednesday.  The waitress was helpful and friendly. I got the spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were very good, I was impressed. I would go back and get this again...I hope the sanitation rating gets better! Quick service. Good tiramisu also."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you desperately want to love... the decor is amazing, some strange, psychedelic mixture of saloon meets slightly-cheesy italian... the waitstaff are a bunch of sweethearts, mostly old ladies...and it's been here for something like 60 years, pumping out pizzas and pasta and texas toa-er-garlic bread. 

But you can't really, because its pretty pricey-- and the food is bad. The combination kills it for you. Your pizza comes out, at a whopping $12 for a smallish two topping, and the crust is Elio's, or something, a poured batter-like pie shell texture crust. The sauce is hardly there, and the cheese is so plasticized, it stretches for feet. Your \"greek salad\" is $6 and is half a head of iceburg with oddly-flavored diced beets, a small sprinkling of feta, two tomato quarters, and two small olives. 

I've given it two tries, maybe the third will be different... but I get the feeling the recipes and style of cooking happening here haven't changed in 20 years, and are unlikely to in the near future."}
{"text":"Ventured into this place with the hubs after driving past it countless times and I have to say, it wasn't half bad. Sure, it's not a \"fancy\" Italian spot, and it's doesn't have gourmet food, but it's kind of kitschy and cute. The portions are rather large, definitely split-able. I ordered the spaghetti with clam sauce. It was spaghetti, nothing fancy, cooked well and topped with zillions of chopped clams. Was it the best I've ever eaten? No, but it also was very far from the the worst. 

Their pizza that was on many tables looked decent and I would certainly venture back to this spot again."}
{"text":"We decided to pop into the open kitchen for lunch.  Our server was very prompt in taking our order, but as with our past experience, their servers are not super personable.  We order cannelloni and lasagna as part of the lunch specials.  Both of our pastas were on the mushy side.  You would have been hard pressed to find some ricotta in the lasagna as well.  I've had other good meals in the past, so I would really like to see this place get back online with the good stuff.  I know they are capable.  I'll give it another 6 months and try again."}
{"text":"I like to write good, great and, unfortunately, sometimes bad reviews. I am honestly shocked that this place has been around since 1952. The only reason I'm even giving it a second star is the cool old-building ambiance (what a waste) and a fresh Greek salad, albeit the onions and olives were missing. Now for the bad. The garlic bread was burnt to start and it went downhill from there. The minestrone soup must have been Campbell's with some canned mushrooms added (they weren't fresh mushrooms for sure), and, since I got the sampler plate, I got to taste how bland and poorly prepared the Veal, what they call \"Chicken Parmigiano\" (but isn't even close), Meatballs and Chicken Livers were. I believe our waitress referred to the one person in the kitchen as \"the cook\" (not a chef) and the food did indeed taste like that of a military cook preparing food for an entire army. I could go on and on, but let's just say, next time we go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Meh.  Went here with a coupon, otherwise would have definitely NOT been worth it.  Greek salad was pretty good but nothing else really was.  Cold, generic bread, bland, overcooked spaghetti drowning in butter and canned mushrooms (YUCK), mushy, flavorless meat ravioli.  Service fast but not friendly.  Wouldn't want to eat there again, especially at full price. :/"}
{"text":"I grew up in Philly, eating at neighborhood joints that had the same vibe as Open Kitchen, and I've felt right at home every time I've had a meal there.  The last time, however, really went above and beyond.  

For starters, my companion and I arrived at 4:45, and the server told us he'd have bread out to us momentarily, as \"the bread guy\" had just arrived.  When it came, it was crusty and tender on the inside and drank the butter well.

As it was tomato season, they had a caprese salad on as an appetizer special, and it was excellent. The tomatoes were thickly cut and very fresh, and the mozzarella was decadently creamy.  My companion went for the fried calamari, which was delicious although to me could have used a touch more salt.  It was properly cooked, which is an achievement in itself.

My entree was the real winner.  Braciole is one of those dishes that is easy to make, but hard to make well.  This was stellar.  The salami, prosciutto and Italian sausage were distributed well in the rolled steak, and cooked perfectly. This is one of those old-school dishes, like Oysters Rockefeller, that you don't find on a lot of menus anymore, and that's a sad thing.  

My companion, being of a somewhat more pedestrian bent, had the lasagna, and it was tasty.  I haven't been much of a lasagna guy since I discovered the Latin version, Pastelon, which uses plantains in place of noodles and tons of chorizo.  

With cold Peroni in abundance, this was a truly excellent meal.  It's working-class Italian food done with an attention to detail.  Look at it this way: You're going to spend far less than you would at Olive Garden (may they rot) and get FAR better food."}
{"text":"Just ok. Cute and interesting decor and feel inside. Food is generic Greek-owned going for Italian from the mid century, and not the freshest seeming. Great prices and friendly staff at least, though we did have to ask for water refills. Don't see it lasting much longer (at least not at those prices) with the changes in the area raising the property tax and yuppie tastes coming in. Mostly older crowd inside, can see why they send the mailer coupons (why we went), Groupons, Yelp ads, etc."}
{"text":"Bleh never again!.. Except to pick up tiramisu! 

We came here last night, despite the mixed reviews, with a groupon for dinner. There were about 4 or 5 other parties in the entire place and the lighting was very dark. We were quickly seated at a small table in the corner. The server was nice and attentive. What really sent this place off to a bad start was the condition of the silverware, eww! There was dried, old marinara sauce covering most of the prongs of my fork. I have never seen a fork so disgusting in an eatery in my entire life! Sent it back right away for another set which also had a less amount of dried, old marinara. I had to switch out my silverware twice, that is really terrible and made me question the hygiene practices of Open Kitchen. I was afraid to think of what they do to the food in the back. 

Despite this, we stayed. I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and the bf had the lasagna parmigiana as well as an order of cheesy garlic bread and some marinara. The food, nothing special here. Our very flavorless, tomatoey marinara was $3.25. Not worth it at all. I had to add a ton of salt, pepper, and chili to make the fettuccine edible. The lasagna parmigiana was unfortunately not edible, extremely mushy! I couldn't get past it. What a bust, nothing tastes fresh! Dessert on the other hand was delish and my favorite part of the meal. The tiramisu was amazing! 

After the groupon, I ended up paying $20 with tax and tip. Not worth it! We definitely won't be coming back. But, I will be taking tiramisu to go!"}
{"text":"on second thought I can only rate this one star.
need to use oregano, basil and garlic in your sauce
and rethink you prices !!!"}
{"text":"First, let me say as a native Charlottean I've been eating at the Open Kitchen (and formerly Gus's 49'er) since the 60's and have really enjoyed the food over the decades.

With that said, I've also known over the years they don't make their own pizza crust using a pre-made suspected frozen crust. But since the ingredients were always good quality it was usually edible.

Stopped by today and ordered the 16\" Mama K Supreme. I'm sorry to say it was the absolute worst pizza I've ever had - including cheap frozen grocery store pizzas. Besides the sparse tasteless ingredients, the crust had a pita bread like texture and tasted like cardboard.  

I know it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks but if the owners read this ... PLEASE stop using the cheap frozen pizza crust and start making your own. I'll never fully understand why an Italian restaurant of this caliber would do this, especially with the opportunities to boost their bottom line by selling a better quality product."}
{"text":"This place has more nostalgia than culinary appeal. My parents used to date here when they first met and now my girlfriend and I do the same. There is one waiter who is a total douche and won't actually do any waiting. Instead, he brings your food out and lets you thirst to death the rest of the meal. The other waitresses are very nice and I enjoy the food. The mama K's pizza and lasagna parmigiana are my staples. It's hard to choose every time we go. This place is in a rough looking part of town, so maybe go for the lunch special if you are wary."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to the Open Kitchen for years now.  We always get great service and the food is sooo good.  I highly recommend the Veal Juliana, there's nothing else in the world like it."}
{"text":"This review will only mean something if you went to this place in mid-60's to 70's.
My family would take us here on a BIG night out.
It was a very big deal to go here and get a Pizza Pie.
Words will not adequately describe how good it was.

In a southern city that was all about comfort food, this place was a taste of authentic greek & Italian.

I had my first 'real date' here, I was a junior at W Meck and Laurie, one of the cheerleaders said yes and my parents let me take the car though I just barely had my license.

I like coming back to appreciate a place that has managed to stay in business for all these many years. 

Me & Ben met up here for lunch and we had a great meal. He had the meat ball parmigiana sammie, I had the chicken & pasta with a side salad.

Mama K's italian dressing is the real deal."}
{"text":"Should have listened to the reviews. Food was horrible. The veal parmigiana was basically a side dish of roast beef with another side dish of spaghetti and meat sauce, both of which tasted like they were from a can. I would have been happier with something from Stouffers."}
{"text":"Delizioso... which is delicious in Italian.Don't shy away from the fact that it doesn't look so fancy , I came here with friends one of my friends was Italian so i knew if she said this place was good then its good! They both bragged and boasted about the chicken Barcelona. Omg  they weren't lieing when they said it was one of the best dishes here. The noodles were drenched in a savory honey butter, my mouth is watering right now just speaking about it, i asked to have the marinara sauce and mushrooms on the side versus in the actual dish, i also had feta crumbled cheese added. I have to come back here and see how the lasagna is and try the cheesy garlic bread as well."}
