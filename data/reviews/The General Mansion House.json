{"text":"literally cant give negative star cuz the lowest i can go is 1. Extremely terrible service. Servers there like dead inside no emotion at all and blame customers for mistakes they made. Sooooooo bad. Wont go and wont recommend others go."}
{"text":"My friend said this place was good, I was a little hesitant seeing the 1 star reviews, but I'm glad I tried it!!!!! The food up to par.  It was good.  The fried whole fish was VERY crispy allowing u to also consume the tail and fins.  The meat was good quality.  I ordered lamb skewers, chicken gristle, roasted cabbage, and toasted Chinese bun.  Loved every food order!  Chicken gristle is my favourite and they did a very good job!  Pricing for the quality was very reasonable.  I asked for less salt and less spiciness and it was perfect for me, But I like my food more bland so it may be different for someone else.  The interior decor was nothing spectacular it was Ok.  However...They need to turn up the heat!!! The weather was a little cool around 10 degrees Celsius on the day I went. And thank God I decided to wear a winter jacket because it was freezing inside and I had to keep my winter jacket on the whole time.  Because it was so cold inside the food quickly went cold.  The customer service...Mmm I guess the people at the restaurant didn't have much experience...The owner and the staff acted like they were at home rather than at a restaurant but in no way were they rude, they were alright.  Sometimes there would be no one at the front desk...Not that it affected me.  But because the food was good I will definitely return.  My experience here was alright just wish it was warmer.  I think this place deserves a chance, so give it a try."}
