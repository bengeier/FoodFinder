{"text":"We've eaten there 3 times!  Had the Little S, the Big S, the pulled pork, Philly cheese steak, Parmesan chicken, fries, onion rings, and breaded mushrooms. . . Everything is prepared fresh and is delicious. The owner is always there and very friendly!  Very nice \"neighborhood\"place. . . VERY good food!"}
{"text":"I am in Painesville during the day for a few days so I wanted to check out some local places. This place was the highest rated for the location I was Yelping.  The guy who took my order (chicken club) was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu items, but forgot that I didn't want mayo (because people always put too much mayo on) and started putting a 0.5cm thick layer on. Good thing I was paying attention. It seemed like he was really putting minimal vegetables on. On a 12 inch bun, there was 1 piece of lettuce cut in half, 2 small slices of tomato cut in half, and maybe 8-10 mushroom slices. The saltiness of the chicken + bacon gave me a headache after, although the sandwich itself was passable in taste.  Maybe I'm just picky about my sandwiches. If I have time next week, I might give one of their famous burgers a try...and I'll update the review."}
{"text":"So I'm traveling from out of town, no group consensus on where to eat. Decide to yelp nearby areas and found this little gem.  I'm in love, and am going to try and convince other people to come here.  I got the Scotty B which is AMAZING. The burger itself is great, as is the corned beef. It says it comes with a horseradish sauce and thousand island. The horseradish sauce isn't coming through a ton - but it's still really good. I think this would also be good with grilled onions and peppers on it - but I didn't want to mess with something I had never tried before. Still, super super good.  I decided to order chili cheese fries with it - and should have gotten regular fries, because an order of chili cheese fries could be a meal upon itself. They use either provolone or swiss on their fries - it was melted and still good, but I was surprised it wasn't standard nacho cheese - which if I get this again i would substitute it for.  Yelp showed that if you check-in you get a deep fried treat with your order, so naturally I checked in and tried to use the offer. The woman at the counter had never had anyone use it before - but they offered it - I opted for the deep fried snickers. I'm not sure what it is wrapped in but how could you go wrong? Answer: you can't - it is also delicious.  Also - the woman at the counter was super nice and patient with me while I looked at their menu, which has a ton of options. She also walked me through some of their options and was very conversational - and I appreciated that. She was just very polite and willing to answer my questions.  I will definitely come back here - if this burger is so good I am very excited to try their other items."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice. First time I ordered a burger and fries and a fried Snickers bar. The burger and fries were okay - nothing special. Both burger and fries were frozen. I expect that at a fast food joint, but not a mom and pop place that supposedly specializes in sandwiches. The fried Snicker bar was overdone. The batter was almost burnt and I didn't enjoy it.  The desserts are all variations of battered and fried packaged things like Oreos, Snickers and Twinkies. So if you want something sweet to compliment your meal, this isn't the place to find it. I don't see how hard it is to have some homemade cookies, brownies or something along those lines available.  My second experience was a fish sandwich. It was so disappointing. The fish was also frozen - possibly something available at the grocery store. It was served on a bun that was way too large for the tiny little square piece of fish I was given.  I also noticed when I was going to give them a third and probably final try that the fish sandwich was taken off the menu. And currently they are closed."}
{"text":"First impressions... Hugeeeee menu! Very friendly staff and looks like a more modern fast food joint.    I got the pulled pork bbq sandwich along with a drink and my brother got a philly.  It came out to be around 20 bucks. A little overpriced in my opinion..but hey the friendly staff, quick service and no wait made up for it I guess.  While waiting for our food I had noticed they didn't take time to wipe down the tables and sweep the floors.  There was scraps of food on some of the tables and floor, which kind of made us move across the room.  I mentioned it to the guy there and he momentarily took care of it.    The food was actually quite delicious and definitely hit the spot! All in all great service mediocre dining floor, but hey we're all here for a great sandwich right? Definitely recommended for a quick stop!  The food comes out fast and its in a convenient location."}
{"text":"For only being open less than a year, The Sammich Shop looks more like The Shabby Shop. There was only one clean (and I use the term loosely) booth-we were the only patrons on an early Thursday evening-and the floors, walls and some water stained dust covered ceiling panels had me wondering how sanitary the food prep area was. Like Papa Joes, your order is prepared in full view which was a small comfort. Although we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff of two young men who also took our ordered, prepared our dinner & cashed us out, I just couldn't enjoy my mock Big Boy \"Sammich\" partly because the special sauce simply lacked flavor and because I can't enjoy any food in a restaurant that has dirty counter tops, walls and floors.   This quirky lime green & orange painted walled shop has so much potential that I hope the owners just take a day to step back and look around at their creation, grab a mop, throw some art work on the barren walls, then applauded their staff. They're the reason that I didn't surrender my Sammich."}
