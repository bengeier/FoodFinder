{"text":"Great spot for a quick treat if you're staying at the Bellagio. We had some of the pastries which tasted fresh and like something straight from a bakery.

The only downside was that the cafe was positioned on our walk back from the pool to the lifts.. ;)"}
{"text":"Note: I haven't had their gelato yet =( so this is a review for their food.

I came here before going to see O and I was damn hungry. We were actually looking for another place but ended up here by mistake. We saw that they sold real food in addition to their tasty looking gelato. 

Between the boyfriend and I we got the chicken pita (tasted good), chicken caesar salad (stupid), egg bacon muffin thing (I didn't taste it but the boy said it was fine), and a yogurt parfait (it was definitely European style, which I like but some people my find it too tart. I'll rate it as \"meh.\") 

Those 4 things cost $40. Are you f-ing me?! I know it's Vegas, blah blah blah, but geez. For a \"quick eats\" place where the stuff was pre-made... Pul-lease. Pre-made! Even McDonald's makes my food to order. Is it because I'm at the Bellagio? Yawn. 

Side note: they have water cups and the cutest glass jam jars ever. I plan to take 10 of them the next time I go.

I definitely want to try their gelato, but I won't be going back for their food."}
{"text":"Best.Gelato.In.Vegas.  It's a must stop whenever i'm in Vegas.  Creamy, smooth consistency, delicious - AMAZING!  I've never been disappointed when I've gone, except when it's closed.

I always get the same:  stracciatella and hazelnut and it's consistently good.  And reasonably priced with plenty of seating on a normal day."}
{"text":"A good healthy portion (single scoop) for about 5 bucks!  Plenty of flavors to choose and you can mix & match.  Dont be afraid to ask to sample their many flavors.
Loved their watermelon and their blackberry cheesecake."}
{"text":"Coffee was good, but not worth $3.95+tax for a large. Can't expect anything cheaper though since it is located on the strip, and in one of the fancier hotels."}
{"text":"My husband's dulce de leche was very good, but my tiramisu was hard, icy and the ladyfingers w/ espresso were flavorless. I'd asked for a scoop of tiramisu and one of chocolate but I got all tiramisu, the staff are nice but not really paying attention. The dulce de leche was creamy and delicious. I regret not having gotten it instead."}
{"text":"Spectacular deserts. Gelato with hot fudge is amazing. My wife asked for a cherry - she got about 8 or 10. Servings of double gelato are huge. Very decadent but wonderful.

Excellent product, fair price and delicious."}
{"text":"The gelato here has a very smooth and creamy texture. I ordered Pistachio Nut. It was delicious!

Although it is a little pricey, I noticed that some of the female servers put more in a cup than male servers do.
The ambiance was light and chipper while the cafe itself was adorned with various designs and paintings.
Go there to take a break from those slot machines and smoke-filled halls and enjoy a delicious, though somewhat overpriced, but good-tasting creamy gelato."}
{"text":"After trying Cafe Gelato last year I made it a staple to have some during this year's visit. It was just as delicious as I imagined. Oh so creamy and melt in your mouth delicious. Even the waffle cones are amazing. Yes, it's pricey but so worth every penny."}
{"text":"The Best Gelato in the West, by fare. The Chicken Panini is very addictive, a great sandwhich that you must try. They only make so many every day so pre-ordering by phone is a good idea."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in the heart of Bellagio. They have great selection of panini, salad plates, pastries and awesome ice cream. You can get two scoops (single) for $5 or 3 scoops (double) for $7. Nice place and not too crowded. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yelp did it again for me. My wife and I had an epic hankerin' for ice cream and this place was fantastic.  Comfy chairs outside in the hallway too easy on too.  Great ice cream. Tricky to find. It's neat the Bellagio gallery of fine arts back by the stores towards the back of the casino."}
{"text":"Everything in vegas costs a pretty penny - BUT! at Cafe Gelato, they at least give you your money's worth.   Love the creamy smoothy texture.  Their gelato was the closest I've found to gelato in Rome - when you pull each scoop you can just tell that the flavor is going to be rich and luxurious.  Sooooooo goooood."}
{"text":"They have a ton of flavors and the ones I've tried are super yummy. 4 stars because they have the best tasting coconut gelato EVER. yummm."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at Cafe Gelato at Bellagio for some gelato before getting on the tram back to Aria.  The server was very nice and offered me to try some samples when she saw that I didn't know what flavor I wanted to order. She also told me if you ordered the small that you can have up two flavors. I was sold. She offered different combinations and even mentioned that her favorite was the coconut and chocolate combined which tasted like a Mounds candy bar. After trying several flavors, I went with the mango and banana toffee. It was soo good! The mango was a bit tart and was complimented so well with the sweetness from the banana and the crunch from the toffee was enough to put it over the top. My husband ordered the mint chocolate and was very happy with his choice."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find gelato the is not just american ice cream called by a different name.  This is good stuff.  I was skeptical but it delivered.  Dense, goopy and rich like a good gelato should be.  Give it a try you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Selection was decent but the prices are high. Their chocolate covered waffle cones are amazing and a single scoop is a food size."}
{"text":"Lots of really good gelato flavors and this place does not jip you so that is a definite plus!"}
{"text":"Love the location!  Quiet area at Bellagio!!  Great refreshing place to be away from casino crowd.  

Wish if their \"single\" is true single scoop and priced for a single scoop price.

The price for a single is about $5 and double is $7.

I ordered a single, which is 2 scoops...  I watch what I eat, I want variety over quantity.  If I end up eating 2 scoops, I wanted to try 2 different flavors... Although don't know they allows.

I did not try their salads but they have healthy salad selections like quinoa or orzo salads."}
{"text":"Poor quality of the food. Sandwiches have no taste. Pastries tasted like old pastry from grocery store. Don't spoil your brunch by coming to this place ."}
{"text":"We were at the Bellagio and the boys were playing video games. My sister and I decided to get some gelato before heading out to watch the water show out front.

I taste-tested a few flavors and settled on the lemon. I have never tasted a lemon gelato so tart  AND creamy at the same time! It really hit the spot and was VERY refreshing on a hot Vegas day!

Right near the pool and arcade and museum. A little pricey. I think it was about $10 for 2 servings. Oh well! You're in Vegas! Who cares!"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Bellagio and has a good selection of flavors. It is also better priced than the gelato kiosk/cafe things they have in the malls like the Forum shops. It's quieter, has a place to sit and enjoy your gelato, less expensive, and also has offerings of smoothies, coffee beverages, salads, soups, quiches, and sandwiches. I loved it, and probably would have been happy to go back and try a new flavor each night of my stay."}
{"text":"This place has Bailey's and Chocolate Amaretto.  Those flavors aren't easy to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good  Gelato , very very good but they the employees not friendly , they know they dont need to be friendly because they always busy"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the gelato here. I've had it other places, not as good as Cafe Gelato. I got the snickers gelato, so good. My husband went on and on about how amazing the Mango was. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We journeyed down here on a Saturday evening from Platinum Hotel. After checking out the Bellagio Fountain show this was quite a treat! I'm typically pretty picky on gelato and frozen desserts because back home in Philly we have Capagiro (amazing, authentic). But this quaint little spot was a hit for me. They have a nice, variety of flavors (nothing too exotic) and they offer a handful of ways to customize your dessert (i.e. sundaes, banana splits, tutti frutti, etc)

The staff was extremely accommodating in letting us sample flavors before making a decision, which was a huge plus. 

I ordered a Black Cherry Cheesecake Sundae with warm chocolate sauce and fresh raspberries. It was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, we ordered three different ice cream. All cups of ice cream were delicious. Free wifi, relaxing music, what else ?;))"}
{"text":"Yum! This place is on point.  Got a 3 scoop banana split with bananas AND strawberries (the nice lady hooked it up) to share. Hands down best flavor is banana toffee crunch.  For all you chunky monkey lovers, this takes it up a notch.  The Tiramisu and lemon was good as well.  Set us back $9.50ish but well worth it on a warm day. Free sampling of flavors."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place is a expensive!!  

We were staying at the Bellagio and wanted to grab a quick bite for breakfast so we stopped in here.  The staff was super nice and were so entertaining for our six year old daughter.  So, that's nice.  And the food was really pretty tasty. 

My husband had a fruit bowl, which was full of lots of different fruits (not just grapes and bananas).  Our daughter had a muffin which was so big she barely at the top of it. I had the tropical yogurt parfait, which was actually pretty amazing.  We each had an orange juice to drink.  $43.  Forty-three dollars!!  That's insane.

But I guess.... when in Vegas...."}
{"text":"This is a cute gelateria and more.  They offer a nice selection of different sandwiches, coffees, pastries, and of course gelato.  The ambiance was nice and almost had an outside cafe feel without being outside.  There are tables set up like in Italy, outside of the gelateria in a long attractive hallway located across from the pool.  During the day the view is nice and you don't have to deal with the heat.


The service was very good and the staff were amiable.  We had the Affogato (Espresso with two scoops of Vanilla gelato) and a Pistachio Gelato (Low Sugar), both were a very good choice.  We would definitely suggest this gelateria to anyone visiting the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Great Gelato and good service!  My cousin and I visited for an evening dessert and neither of us were disappointed.  There was not much of a crowd, no line to speak of, so service was prompt and focused solely on us.  The place was clean.

I may be out of touch with ice cream prices, but it did seem a little pricey for a single scoop.

There were also options for sandwiches and other side dishes if we had wanted those."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato! My aunt came from Texas and wanted to try this place she heard thru a friend and definitely worth it . We got baileys ,tiramasu, and chocolate flavors and all very good creamy and very rich in flavor. The line went by fast and the cashier was very friendly. Try it out if your at the strip and want a little something to cool off ."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic italian gelato.... Bravo Bellagio.  Nice selection of flavors, and a great way to stroll around or watch the Fountains at Bellagio.  I can't believe I had to visit the desert to find great dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Love the gelato..Kids loved it too. Lots of flavors!

Located in bellagio in a surprisingly quiet area. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service. Amazing gelato and a lot of flavors to choose from. The servings were big too!

I got the dulce, mango, and pistachio, loved all three! :)"}
{"text":"This is the Gelato shop inside the Bellagio and it is some of the best Gelato I have ever had. So smooth and creamy. Very good. If you are in the Bellagio, which you should be anyway it is a great place to walk around, then be sure to stop by here. You can even mix and match flavors. I got cookies n cream and mint. It was hard to pick which one I liked more. I think the cookies n cream just edged out the mint. But just barely.
If you want a good afternoon snack this is a good choice. Plus you can wander around the Bellagio before and after your Gelato. Service was very good too. Nice and friendly. Plus is was in a kind of quite area. So you could sit and really enjoy your Gelato and relax. We will definitely stop by again whenever we are in Vegas. Yummm."}
{"text":"Gelato was so-so but if you are lucky you get to wait in line for over 40 minutes for mediocre this mediocre cream! Bellagio has been good except for this below average place with terrible service"}
{"text":"Average overall, but the Tri-berry sorbet is to die for. Perfection! Surprisingly cheap, yummy and authentic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"GELATO MASTERS is more like it!

Found this place by accident while walking around the Bellagio!

It was HOT already outside and I needed something cool and sweet and this place appeared at the PERFECT TIME! My lady and I came here with one thing in mind, ICE CREAM!!!!!

I don't know what she got but my ice cream was MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP! The scoop itself was BIG! One of the biggest one scoops that I have ever seen and I don't mind at all. 

After getting to ice cream I made my way quickly over to a seat. COLD...SWEET....SUGAR INFLUX.....HOW GREAT!!! Let me put this place in perspective for all of you reading this review who have not been here before. If this was my last meal or snack on earth I would be a HAPPY MAN because this place is JUST THAT GOOD!!!! 

#respect #Iwillbeback"}
{"text":"Review 27 for 2017! 

Gelato Cafe is located inside of the Bellagio Hotel right next to the pool area! Perfect spot for when summer comes around. 

It's set up like a quick service restaurant where you queue up, order your gelato and then pay. There's usually very little to no wait at all. They also have a variety of flavors ranging from fruity to savory. I also noticed that they had less sugary options as well. I don't really have a go-to flavor here. It's usually just what I'm feeling for that day. Today I ordered a small snickers flavored gelato and it was pretty tasty. I would have liked more chocolate pieces though. Be aware that their small is actually pretty big! 

Service here is whatever. The employees are just trying to do their job at bare minimum. 

Overall verdict: I'll be back since it's convenient and satisfying!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best and closest to the real thing Gelato I've tasted outside of Italy. If you are in Vegas and love gelato (real, authentic) make the effort to drop in and have one! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Gelato was toooo sweet to our taste. Coffee was ok.

It's on not too busy corridor in Bellagio, so location is a plus."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and ordered both an orange juice and a tropical parfait. The parfait was delicious, if anything it had TOO much fruit. My orange juice on the other hand was clearly from concentrate. REALLY??? You charge me over $5 for a small orange juice you made from a frozen can?? If I wanted water I would had ordered water"}
{"text":"Delicious gelato and beverages! I had one scoop of cookies and cream and it was huge! The gelato was rich and creamy and the cookies added a nice crunch. The caramel drink my boyfriend ordered was also delicious. It's a tiny shop located inside the hotel and was little difficult to find. I will definitely be back for more of the delicious gelato anytime!"}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude!!!  Three of the four ppl in the shop were anything but nice.  First off, Jose saw us and just went on to the next group and then came back to us with a glare ?.  He couldn't figure out how to figure the comp which frustrated him even more.  Obviously, Jose was having a bad day and it showed.  He then went to mgr/cashier (pregnant lady) to ask so they sent us back to clarify with the casino host and so we did.  We cane back again and this time, an asian lady was helping us, yet she was short and kept cutting us off as we were ordering.  Again, she couldn't figure it out so she went to the back again to get the mgr/cashier.  She couldn't figure it out either.  We asked if she needed our card, she snapped \"I don't need your mLife card,\" waiving us off.  Obviously, there must be some inhouse issue, because they were all irritated.  The owner? then came out and fixed the problem.  We mentioned that the workers were really unkind and she just kind of shook her head..and that was it .  No apologies or acknowledgement of anything.  This might even be my first negative yelp.  I'm normally real patient but this was really upsetting.  Coffee was blah but their cheese danish was so good.  That's where my stars are going to."}
{"text":"Q: Do you know what hits the spot on a warm Tuesday afternoon in Vegas when you're trying to recover from a weekend full of binge drinking and debauchery? 

A: Gelato. Specifically, gelato from this place. Even more specifically, tiramisu gelato from this place while you watch the Bellagio fountain show."}
{"text":"Awesome pistachio and dulce de leche. Customer service could improve, and prices are outrageous."}
{"text":"The gelato is really ok. It's creamy and rich but flavor wise, it's really ok. I personally think the gelato at Jean Philippe Patisserie, which is also located inside Bellagio is better. I am always in search for good gelato and ice cream, so I had to give this place a try. 

I've had gelato served in paper cups and plastic cups. I like how they also serve theirs in a plastic cup, but a very sturdy one. They also have a nice location, as they're located inside, across the entrance to the outdoor pool. It's a great way to get the gelato flock coming."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Cafe Gelato.  Fabulous flavors to taste, and then mouth watering perfection in a cone all for you.  It's not cheap (for gelato), but they're not skimpy.  Good luck in finishing it, but it's worth a try.

Perfect for those hot days after shopping.  Sit in the Cafe itself or in one of the nearby comfy sofas in the main hallway."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this cafe inside Bellagio! They offer so many different gelato flavors, and you can sample as many as you like! The espresso is great as well.

They have lunch options, and everything is displayed in the cases. Service is quick. It is a great casual cafe to have lunch or dessert."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Hubby and I went in right before closing Monday November 9th. The 2 ladies, Lourdes and not sure the name of the other lady, behind the counter looked so disgusted being there. Neither were friendly nor welcoming, and they were both lacking customer service skills. This experience was the only disappointment while staying at the Bellagio.
As far as the gelato, it seemed like it was lacking flavor. I had the tiramisu, it was ok, and I also had a chocolate cookie which was HARD! 
I Don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Are you KIDDING ME right now??? This place is a hidden gem for someone who's still trying to stay somewhat healthy while visiting Las Vegas. 

Kinda tucked away down one of those long hallways in the Bellagio, you'll find the gates to heaven - aka Cafe Gelato.

They've got a great selection of pre-made sandwiches, ridiculously good desserts, pastries that are making my mouth water just THINKING about them, and of course - a shit ton of gelato.

What you wouldn't think to look for here is their SMOOTHIE selection. Not sugary milkshakes or Jamba crap. We are talking all fruit/veggie smoothies. This is the one place in Vegas I can go and actually get some spinach! 

When I stayed at Caesars a couple weeks ago, I walked to the Bellagio just to get my fav green smoothie, the Fruit and Veggie Smoothie.

Seriously, come here. The prices are okay, and you're actually getting what I think is real food. 

All of the pre-made sandwiches I've checked out seem to have cheese on them - that is literally my only complaint.

Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Gelato gives me a taste of Europe! It's conveniently open late, serves more than gelato(think croissants, wraps, quiches and such) with coffee and other desserts and drinks. Can get pricey but you are in LV!"}
{"text":"This place had very good gelato but bad service. We asked for the banana split yet the server gave us the sundae instead and she looked really mad about it even though it was not our fault. We did get the flavors we wanted but I want to have better service. She even gave us a dirty look and if you are going to this place, make sure the server acts happy before ordering. We will be coming back here someday."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Bellagio recently, but did not discover this fantastic place until our last night. One word - YUM!  Go there to relax and  cool off and enjoy the treats.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but definitely not my favorite gelato. However, my favorite gelato is not actually in Vegas.

They give you a pretty good portion size for the price. I was hoping for a few more flavor choices, or perhaps a few more unique flavors.

Overall, it is a good place to grab something quick after a show before returning to the your room, especially since they are open late."}
{"text":"Yummy gelato!!! I got the Banana Toffee Crunch & Chocolate Amaretto. Friendly service. Located in a quieter part of Bellagio. They also have sandwiches and various pastries for purchase. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Located near the arcade and pool of the Belagio.  Great selection of flavors.  I only got the chance to try out the Oreo and Snickers.  I love how this place is a perfect place for snacks. I can get a sandwich and gelato at the same time."}
{"text":"I am amazed at how few people actually know this place.  I'm actually kinda hesitant to write about this because I'd like to keep it my little secret, but I gotta give props for this reason.

The first time I came here was as a kid (I'm guessing some time in 2000 or so...I don't remember) because there's an arcade next door.  I had dulce de leche with a waffle cone, and I pretty much fell in love with this place.  And since that day, I vowed to myself that every time I came to Vegas for more than 24 hours, I'd come here to get some delicious gelato.  Spring, summer, fall, winter, didn't matter.  And yes, the tradition continues to this day!

As for the gelato itself, it's just great value.  $6.49 for a scoop (which is in reality TWO scoops) and a waffle cone.  In a town where you rarely find good value for money, you get GREAT value for money here.  Personal favorites are dulce de leche (obviously), blueberry cheesecake, Oreo, and stracciatella.

If you're looking for this spot, it's right next to the pool.  Just go down the hallway that's next to the buffet and you'll find it."}
{"text":"So FLAVORFUL!

Pistachio Gelato: 5+
Chocolate: 5
Mint Chocolate: 5
Cappuccino: 5

Nice setting to sit in, with people always around."}
{"text":"Dulce de Leche Croissant literally weighed half a pound and had what seemed like a cup of caramel inside. Good value, but I can't eat that much straight caramel! Breakfast panini was meh, cappuccino and chocolate gelato were great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas and it's a MUST come every time I visit Vegas.  I love their tiramisu.  It's in a little plastic box.  It's not like a traditional tiramisu that looks like a cake.  Check it out in my photos.  It's really creamy and layers of creams and wine.  It's super good, you have to try it.

Two other things I order from this place is their breakfast croissant with egg, cheese and ham.  Their eggs just taste different, I mean the way they cook just really yummy!  Their daily soup is also really delicious.  

I only tried their ice cream once.  Since I'm not a big fan of ice cream, I can't tell if it's really good or not.  

If you haven't try this place yet, please go try it!!! ~~~ 

The price is moderate, when I order the three things above, it costs me less than $20."}
{"text":"We got a double gelato with three flavors:  strawberry, chocolate, and mixed berry.  The strawberry tasted artificial, but the chocolate and mixed berry were very good.  This was $6.75 plus tax, which seems like a bargain in Vegas!  

We also got a large soda, which was $4.00 plus tax but included free refills all day.  

The location is nice and quiet, and the girls behind the counter were nice.  My only complaint is the other adult customers who seem to think it's appropriate to wear skimpy drippping wet bathing suits in places other than the pool, but I can hardly hold Cafe Gelato responsible!"}
{"text":"Update: No more crab/shrimp seafood wrap sandwiches as of 4/2011. No explanation as to why - it was an awesome value and it will be missed."}
{"text":"This cafe is located in a quiet little hallway near the Bellagio pool and art gallery. I had seen this place before while heading towards the art gallery but never stopped to check it out. Finally on Christmas Day, while trying to escape the crowds on the casino floor I remembered this place existed and decided it was finally time to check it out. Although there was a line, it definitely was much quieter and emptier than in the casino! 

Besides carrying a couple dozen flavors of gelato, they also have coffee, soft drinks, sandwiches, quiches, pastries, and other baked goodies. Because we had already eaten lunch, I decided to just get 2 scoops of gelato: mango and blackberry cheesecake, which ran about 5 bucks. The gelato was good and full of flavor, especially the mango one. It tasted like a real mango! They have a self service ice water and condiment station that is stocked with small jars of jams and honey.

Cafe Gelato is a nice, quiet way to escape the hustle and noise of the casino floor. I look forward to coming back next time I'm at Bellagio. I just wished they had separate lines for food ordering and gelato only because the line gets jammed up when the person in front of you is standing there trying to order sandwiches and I'm stuck behind them hoping they would finish. Since the gelato case is located closer to the register you figure one wouldn't have to wait in line just to look at or order gelato"}
{"text":"Always always always delicious. Great Italian gelato made from cream. They are a little pricey and don't seem to have a set opening time."}
{"text":"In need of something sweet and cold, we stumbled upon Café Gelato in the Bellagio, located across from the main entrance to the hotel's pool. The café offers both gelato and traditional ice cream, and man was the ice cream good! After tasting a few of the ice cream flavors, we ordered the Snickers ice cream single scoop on a waffle cone, which totaled to $6.75 but was big enough to feed both my husband and myself. We couldn't help but indulge the next night and order another waffle cone, this time with the Oreo's ice cream. So yummy! The Café also offers panini's and free Swiss jams and honey on the side (make great souvenirs!), in addition to in-café seating and hallway seating (a great place to people watch!).

Go to Café Gelato if: You love ice cream and gelato!; you want a warm sandwich; you want a truly Italian experience - people watching under the façade of ice cream consumption.

Don't go to Café Gelato if: You are on a budget with no wiggle room, because this is just pure and pleasing gluttony! Otherwise - hand over the $7 and get a waffle cone!"}
{"text":"Had berry sherbet.
It almost tasted like real gelato.
I know my gelato from Germany or Italy.
Cute place with fancy colors all around.
It's in Bellagio!
Chihuly in Bellagio didn't looked the same, after seeing in Seattle."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their coffee drinks are bomb -- and their breakfast is awesome! Oh... And the gelato is so yummy!"}
{"text":"It's gelato. How can you go wrong with gelato. Most of the gelato I've had tastes just about the same. The only difference would be the flavors and sometimes the texture (although theyre generally soft) All the flavors I've tried = good. I like standing towards the side of the whole array of flavors where i can see its reflection through the mirror. Why? Because it makes it look like they serve 2x the flavors. Don't be fooled. 

Don't waste your money on those yummy looking cones unless you absolutely want one. The gelato you get is enough and the cones are mediocre. I got the white chocolate one, and it's just typical and not worth the extra cost. I also tried that peanut butter lollipop. Unless you wanna eat an extra sweet snickers ice cream bar as a lollipop, no need to try it. 

WARNING: If you come here in the summer, DO NOT eat your gelato outside. I brought my gelato outside to check out the pool and it melted IMMEDIATELY. Sadness. I had to go back into Cafe Gelato to ask for a cup, so I could dump my cone&gelato into it...otherwise I'd have to start licking gelato off my hands, grotesque."}
{"text":"Best Gelato in Town!  Rich, creamy, flavorful, true-to-taste flavors - none of that artificial junk here.  They also serve sandwiches, salads, and paninis which is convenient when you don't want to wait in that long Bellagio buffet line.  Their servings for gelato are big too!"}
{"text":"A hangover panacea, these smoothies always powered us up for a day of door-knocking in '08. Of course, order them without sherbet, yogurt, ice cream, ice or whatever other pollutants sometimes make their way into \"smoothies\".

Minus one star because $9 for a smoothie is a bit presumptuous!"}
{"text":"mango genoa smoothie.  so good.

$9.  no so good.

whoever heard of a $9 smoothie????"}
{"text":"They give you a lot of gelato for a single. However, the flavors are just okay. I would expect more from Bellagio. The tiramisu gelato had too big chunks of lady fingers that just over powered the smoothness of the gelato. It would be better if the ladyfingers had been soaked in espresso prior."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm on the strip.  Normally I enjoy my lunch and bite of gelato. Unfortunate this time was quite different. I had the bacon cheddar melt and it was only half cooked. Toasted on the top not the bottom.  I went up to ask about it and the old wrinkled cynical woman questioned why I didn't like it.  She said you ate half of it already. It's fine. I again asked was this a new way of cooking it. She said just finish the sandwich. That's all. Dismissing me. She was rude embarrassing and has no customer service skills.  The gelato was still great."}
{"text":"First time here. I got tiramisu gelato and it was very good. They have so many flavors to choose from. If you love gelato you'll love it here."}
{"text":"Best Almond croissant and Gelato I've ever had. The croissant was so decadent, it was moist in the middle and super delicious. We only went here out of convenience since we were staying at the Bellagio but when we come back to Vegas this is now on my must stop by list."}
{"text":"Great Gelato! What a fabulous selection. I will be checking out the pastries next trip. Good service with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Awesome gelato shop! Considering it's in the Bellagio, I figured it would be really pricey. Nope. The large Americano I got from here was more expensive than my gelato. One scoop is only $4.75, which is the same as Vancouver prices. So for me, thats cheap. I tried the Berry Sorbet, which was amazing. I also tried the Mango Sorbet, which was good but tasted more like Mango mixed with Pineapple or some other tropical fruit. Still refreshing and sweet though. I got my coffee here every morning as Palio Cafe across from Cafe Gelato had a line up out the door every day. I guess nobody thought to grab their espresso from the Gelato shop, which worked out perfectly for me!"}
{"text":"The perfect place to grab something sweet after an amazing dinner at Prime!  We stopped in last night and I thoroughly enjoyed the Oreo gelato...so creamy and delicious!  Friendly staff, great selection of gelato and beautiful pastries as well."}
{"text":"A friend of mine really liked this place, 
I've totally had better gelato.
The flavor selection wasn't too good.
They had a lot of the basic flavors, but nothing adventurous. 
The flavor was alright, but I wasn't blown away at all."}
{"text":"This gelato shop is inside the Bellagio, on the way to the pool. There weren't too many people there. We stopped here to get a quick dessert before our show. A large gelato was ~$7, but man, they give you a lot of gelato! Check out the photo...a large cup packed full.

The cookies n cream flavor was delicious. The gelato was dense & creamy, not overly greasy or sweet. Not the densest, but certainly premium stuff. Cappuccino flavor was also really good. DH tried the tiramisu flavor, but it wasn't as bold."}
{"text":"they have a wide variety of gelatos to choose from! I had their pistachio! :) note: get a small cup and it's big enough to share with another person. but if you are up for the challenge, by all means get one and eat one by yourself! :)

one small cup of gelato came out to $5.13."}
{"text":"Excellent choices of gelato! The portion sizes are immensely large and honestly 2 can share a small, unless you need to eat more than 10 oz of gelato on your own. Another option is to get the small which gives you two choices and split that into 2 cups. The quality is great and very fresh. Don't pass this up if you have a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick coffee since there are no Starbucks here in bellagio. Ordered a iced mocha (my typical Starbucks drink) and let me tell you it was less than lackluster. Watery , flavorless, and boring. Didn't try the gelato but I surely don't recommend the coffee."}
{"text":"Grabbed a creme brûlée gelato after dinner. It was good but not $6.95 for a cup good."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the Bellagio. My friend and I came here with a 2 for 1 coupon from MyVegas. They have a really decent selection of gelato to choose from. I got the mint chocolate chip, my go to flavor. It was rich, thick, creamy, and delicious. Each scoop was $5.25 which I would never pay for normally but 2 for 1 made it worth it. The other desserts like the cheesecakes and things looked amazing as well."}
{"text":"My feet were tired from walking around the streets of Vegas. And I was also on a 3 hour wait for the bellagio buffet, so I saw this charming little place and ordered the mint chocolate chip and tiramisu gelato. The chocolate mint was absolutely amazing. Great gelato velvety texture. The tiramisu was eh. Maybe it wasn't my preference. But oddly it was still good due to the texture.
That's the good thing about such a great place. 
Everything is will taste good even if it's the water."}
{"text":"We were walking around the Bellagio looking for an afternoon snack and this place had a nice selection of sandwiches, pastries, and sweets. Their sandwiches are about $11 each, they had a nice selection of hot and cold, and they looked delicious. They also had a great selection of bakery items, pastries, desserts, and of course a great selection of gelatos. 

We decided to get the Quiche Lorraine, the classic French favorite, which was $8. We enjoyed it, it was steamy hot because we asked them to warm it up for us. It was very buttery, rich and flavorful with lots of bacon bits and it wasn't too dense. 

We also had an almond croissant. It had a great amount of almonds crusted on the top and the almond cream filling was heavenly. It didn't last very long. 

The coke from the soda fountain was about a small/medium size and it was about $4.35 but they did offer free refills. 

They also had complimentary preserves and honey in little glass jars by a delicious and quality company called bonne mamam. It was a very nice and cute touch. 

It wasn't busy here in the afternoon and it was very peaceful, a perfect way to get away from the commotion of the casino to take a break."}
{"text":"Nice decoration, nice people on the counter. The only reason I won't give them 5 because my kids tried the mango sorbet gelato and it was a bit sour (mango shouldn't be :) and they didn't have pistachio gelato."}
{"text":"When you can find something so cheap and good on the Strip, you hold onto it and never let it go.  So whenever we're looking for a sweet treat and we're doing the tourist thing in Vegas, you can find us here.  Every flavor we've ever had is rich and tasty.  The servers are fast and polite.  There is not a bad word I can say!"}
{"text":"Gelato has a very different taste in my opinion. I've never been a big fan until I tried this place. 

flavors I liked: oreo, stracciatella, mint chip 
flavors I didnt like: pistachio, snickers

*Tip: Get 1 scoop and ask for half and half flavors. Its big enough for one person! ($5)"}
{"text":"LOVED the tiramisu gelato.  It was difficult to choose between the nutella, tiramisu, and coconut.  Wish there would have been more seating though.  We ended up taking our gelato outside."}
{"text":"Best Gelato in Vegas!! Many flavors to try and sample too. Clean and friendly quick service!
Highly recommend the Tiramisu flavor you will have your taste buds going crazy happy lol! Highly recommend coming here for Gelato if your in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent quick cafe spot. Spacious well lit total assortment of sweet treats, gelatin and sorbets on tempting display.

Breakfast of lunch quick on the go perfection.

Warning: do not enter here on a diet. But hey what happens on Vegas stays in Vegas so leave your pounds when you depart ;) indulge."}
{"text":"We ended up at Cafe Gelato on a whim while I was hoping to get some photos taken with the Christmas decor at the Bellagio.  However, I was too early for Christmas since they still had the Thanksgiving decor up.  So, my slight disappointment led me to look for something to cheer me up...

We showed up around 1:45 PM on 11/24 and there weren't many people waiting in line so we got our gelato pretty quickly.  I got a small order of the cheesecake gelato and my son got the double chocolate.  We both really liked the flavor and consistency.  We'll definitely have to come back again next time.

They have other pastries and deli sandwiches as well.  I saw a few people dining there and the food looked pretty good.

The place is nice and clean with lots of seating available inside the cafe or you can go sit outside and look over the pool area."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Gelato when I stayed in Vegas with my family during Christmas. I believe it was our last day in town and after having dinner at the Fashion Show Mall food court, my cousins and I wanted ice cream. We've walked around Bellagio at least twice or three times during our visit and after walking back from the mall, we went back cause our parents wanted to play the slot machines. While they were playing, we got ice cream (I am not underage, btw. I am 23 while my cousins are not even 21 yet).

When we got to Cafe Gelato, there was a line but it didn't take long for us to order and pay. Since my cousin and I were still kinda full from dinner, we decided to share a cup. We got a two scoops gelato in a cup which cost about $4 (I forgot about the price). I got an Oreo while she got a Mint Chocolate Chip, while my other cousin (her little brother) got a Snickers. The price was reasonable since we got two scoops while my cousin got one and the scoops were pretty big and fulfilling. The guy that helped us with our gelato was really nice.

When I go back to Vegas, I'll definitely go back and try more flavors!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by the gelato at Palio Pronto (a gelato stand in the Bellagio near the hotel entrance by the Strip), my family was determined to find some authentic gelato one night, and we stumbled upon this cute café/bistro-like restaurant here in the same hotel, the Bellagio. We appreciated how it was open late (until midnight), and how the café interior was so welcoming, bright and warm.

The place was well-lit and very clean and had the feel of a '50s neighborhood ice cream parlor.

We ordered small cones and cups of gelato, and they were all great! Way more authentic than that sold nearby at the Palio Pronto. And the prices were more reasonable, too. The staff behind the counter were super nice and we had a great time here. Great place to grab a snack or dessert late at night."}
{"text":"Ran in here solely to grab a water while walking through the Bellagio.....the gelato on the other hand, had different ideas.

We started out by ordering a couple plain flavors - but when we asked a bout a couple we had our eyes on- she let us sample them! We quickly changed our minds to the chocolate chip and dulce de leche.

We got smalls and I could have gotten more and more! Great tasting, creamy, and smooth. Will look forward to this place again if ever we are back!"}
{"text":"Yonge and Eglinton doesn't seem to offer much as far as falafel and shawarma is concerned but I finally found a place that has and does an amazing job with it. Cafe Gelato is located a bit north of Eglinton on Yonge and is right by the Capitol Event Theatre.

Jeff, the owner, makes almost everything from scratch from the marinating and cooking to the meat for the shawarma, putting together the ingredients for the falafel, and making the hummus and sauces.

I also enjoy the BBQ chicken that he makes. Jeff takes pride in the marination process which includes saffron. This is not your typical BBQ chicken that's roasted and slathered in BBQ sauce, it is on a different level! It's actually my favourite sandwich there! (A must try)

Now I've talked a lot about the sandwiches (also offered in meal plates) but there's a reason why the place is called \"Cafe Gelato\" and do I really need to say why?

Yes... In case you didn't guess, the place serves homemade gelato too!  I've only tried a couple of flavours and it's a welcome dessert to have after your sandwich.

I will say that the place is small, has limited seating and does get a lunch rush but there's plenty of street benches you can sit if you aren't able to grab a spot inside."}
{"text":"This place has some damn good gelato. It's also a great alternative to the chocolate fountain dessert shop by the Bellagio conservatory. The line here is often much more bearable.

They've got some great flavors that taste very much like the gelato I've experienced in Italy. However, the price here is a bit more steep but still alright. This is no surprise given that it's located within a Strip casino.

My only gripe, which deducts one star from my review, is that the manager gave me such a bad attitude on my last visit. I had asked for two flavors to be included in my one cup. But for some reason he couldn't understand my request. It's not like this practice isn't common in almost every gelateria in the country as well as in Italy. I found it to be a simple request.

The manager gave me the harshest stare and condescending tone as he was trying to figure out what I was asking him to do. It made me a bit uncomfortable. Ultimately, another coworker intervened and scooped me exactly what I wanted. Afterward it seemed as if the manager were thinking to himself that it was MY FAULT that he didn't understand my request. I got the impression he just wanted me to GTFO. Sillys...

This whole debacle makes me hesitate coming back, but at the end of the day, Cafê Gelato has a heavenly product. I'll bear the burden to get my gelato fix."}
{"text":"I'm a local and I have to say this place has some delicious gelato.  Yes, it's stupidly expensive, yes it's so inconvenient for locals, and yes, it's worth it for a treat.  My son and I had a mommy and son date night and this place was the highlight of our evening.  They have some great flavors like rum raisin and other interesting flavors.  The line was long, the bill was out of line, but for an occasional treat, this place is worth it."}
{"text":"A landmark gelato stand everyone should see.  Last time I was here with my 3 sisters and we were happy that the performance artist at the moment was the woman who is the Italian nun mime who makes ever so subtle facial movements to the little children who bring her tips.
The gelato is perfectly placed so you can enjoy one of many many flavors and sit on the nearby benches for the program and love the surroundings which are so pretty.
My personal favorites are the cappucino and come to think of it everything!"}
{"text":"Cafe gelato is really good! We ate here at least three times during our five day stay! Dnt miss the gelato flavors!!"}
{"text":"This place was disappointing  I was really looking forward to some good gelato and this was just mediocre. The cafe itself is really cute and there is lots of seating nearby but the gelato is nothing special... I had a sample of the root beer and it was really gross and there was random piece of plastic in it? I decided on the Oreo gelato and it was ok, but the staff wasn't even friendly. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This nice little coffee and pastry place is located in the Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip. It has a fun happy atmosphere, the employees are very friendly. I dug into my Cream cheese Danish and forgot to take a picture. It was a basic Danish but was good!"}
{"text":"Expensive, but serving size is big for a small. Ice cream was good, but not enough options and not that delectable. Average ice cream place. Would come back, but wouldn't be excited to be back."}
{"text":"Had the chocolate gelato. It was almost gummy. It had a strange texture. i prefer a smoother softer gelato. I don't mind the denseness, as gelato should be that way. Otherwise, not a bad place to get gelato. They give you quite a bit for $5. It's about two scoops.

If you ask politely they'll give you a different flavor for the second scoop.

Chocolate flavor was good though."}
{"text":"Yay for gelato! Cafe Gelato is a great haven from that wretched Vegas heat. The place sure is fancy (as expected for something at the Bellagio) with their mini jam jars and super thick napkins. The gelato thankfully wasn't TOO expensive though.

The Oreo flavor was super good, more so than the Mint flavor, which I normally favor. Nonetheless both were extremely satisfying after walking around the strip in humid weather."}
{"text":"You get 2 large single scoops for the small size. You can get 2 of the same or choose different flavors. 

I got the wild berry with tiramisu in a waffle cone. It was delish. Very large so 2 people can share if you wanted to."}
{"text":"wow, one of the few places new years eve time (dec. 30th, specifically) with little/no line. Their hazelnut gelato is the best Ive had...the watermelon one not so much; tastes more like cantaloupe which I fucking dispise.
They have really cool looking quick eats/breakfast stuff to for those that want to grab something quick and half of their asses blown off instead of fully blown off at any sit down restaurant in this city"}
{"text":"I had the Cajun Panini and it was very good.  Great for a quick bite to take to the pools at Bellagio."}
{"text":"Passed by this gelato place on the way to lunch at the Pool Cafe. The BF is a gelato fan. So we save room for dessert.  They've  got a variety of choices from the classic Stracciatella to your Berry sorbet.  They charge $5 for a scoop; it's the Bellagio, so, it's overpriced.  The Cappuccino one satisfied my taste for anything coffee flavored.  Very creamy and yummy! So what's a girl got to do after having gelato? go back to the room and take a nap....ZzzZzz"}
{"text":"So many gelato flavors to choose from!

The flavors I've tried so far (coffee, strawberry, baileys) have all been good. The only thing I dislike is that I like my gelato to be more dense and cold, and the gelato here almost feels like soft serve- it's very soft and melty. However, it's so delicious that I don't mind."}
{"text":"Casino cafes are often misses than hits with their so-so food sold at Strip prices. On the other hand, it's re-assuring to know that there are few locations on The Strip that actually provide decent eats at affordable prices.

The cafe is located in the same wing as the Bellagio's Fine Art Gallery. It's almost easy to miss because it's off of the main casino floor. That's the awesome part about this cafe: you won't have to hear any slot machines and any other raucous.

The food not only looks good, but it tastes good, as well. Their gelato is delicious, and so is their quiche. The coffee that's brewed is bold, but not bitter. Price-wise, I'd say they're reasonable for what you get. 

There's a good amount of seating inside, but you can always take your order to go or plop down on one of the armchairs outside of the cafe."}
{"text":"Cafe gelato has stepped up to the need they now or serving breakfast items in the morning before 11 after 11 they switch to lunch time menu and everything is fresh it's good and it's tasty.
I had the pleasure of meeting the young manager and she's very attentive to the needs of the patrons and help explain the difference between the coffee shop across the way and Cafe gelato so when you go please enjoy yourself the surroundings are beautiful and then take time to go to the museum next door"}
{"text":"There are a variety of gelato and other dessert choices which are great. I've only ever had the gelato and affogato both of which are exquisite. It's tucked away inside of the Bellagio and the seating areas are quite nice, very romantic to people watch from the comfort of the inside of Bellagio. The only thing I have never been happy with is the service here, it kinda sucks. The servers are smug and hasty and look pretty miserable. But they get the job done so it's okay I guess. Love coming here with my boyfriend and just talking. Nice spot for gelato that stays open pretty late. All in all, good spot except for the customer service."}
{"text":"I ate at Gelato twice during my stay. Went in for a quick bite right when I got there and had pizza (YES, they have pizza now!) and Gelato because I'm on vacation! The pizza was surprisingly good for being a Gelato place. Cooked perfectly, crust was crisp and yummy, toppings were great, awesome snack! The Gelato was also great of course as always. During my last day I headed downstairs for breakfast and saw a line at Palio but no line at Gelato. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were also serving breakfast and there was no wait! I ordered a dulce de leche croissant, blueberry muffin, bearclaw, and coffees. Everything was excellent of course but the Dulce De Leche Croissant was AMAZING!!! It was a delicious mess of dulce de leche oozing out of everywhere, I recommend eating with a fork and knife :-) BEST CROISSANT EVER! Liz and her staff were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Grabbed some breakfast and late lunch here. SOOO GOOD! The croissants were HUGE! As big as my face! It was very delicious. I also ordered a Quiche Lorraine and it was probably one of the best I've had! The drink was average and the gelato was very good. If the prices weren't so high, I'd come here more often."}
{"text":"The gelato was delicious! The watermelon tasted just like the real stuff. The coconut was so fluffy like a marshmallow!!"}
{"text":"Food is average here. No great, not really bad. Just ok. Nothing special. I'd say not worth the price they are asking for. Tables are dirty, they don't worry about its cleanliness. Ladies that works here are charming."}
{"text":"The service here was really good. Very friendly and worked through the lines quickly. I tried the peanut butter flavor which was very good. They also had a selection of pastries, sandwiches, and various beverages.

Located near the pool entrance at the Bellagio, this is a great place to grab a snack or a drink to keep you going."}
{"text":"I make sure to stop by this place every time I am in Vegas. The gelato is always fantastic -- I may not have been to Italy to experience the \"real thing\", but I consider myself to have a pretty discerning ice cream palette, and I am never disappointed here.

The best part is that even though you are in the Bellagio, this gelato is not stratospherically expensive. The \"small\" portion is actually two hearty scoops, and I have never even been tempted to try the larger size. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Pretty good Gelato. I had the blackberry cheesecake and rum and raisin.  Do not get the rum and raisin gelato it was tooo strong of flavor and taste!"}
{"text":"Yay for Gelato!

We have been here twice so far... it is our go to spot when we are on the Strip... located right inside the Bellagio not too far from the craps table... lol

Each time we have an Americano & some Gelato! We love you!

your constant companion,

~deirdra"}
{"text":"This one star is a zero because I will never buy anything from this store. Each morning I buy an almond croissant.   Usually I buy from Jean Philippe Patisserie and if you are familiar with the Bellagio you know it is not near the guest elevators of the main hotel.   I happened to explore the arcade corridor, near the guest elevators, leading to the convention center the other night and came across Cafe Gelato but it was already closed.  The next day I tried to buy an almond croissant from Cafe Gelato because it was so much closer.  

Here's the no-star issue.  The pastries have no price.  The two ladies behind the counter don't know the price.  This is a no go.  Most likely it's somewhere between $4-5 but on principle I'm not buying it.  This store is located in the convention center corridor.  It reminds me of congestion priced expressways where the price varies with how badly I want it.  I don't need to be reminded of congestion priced expressways while on vacation.  Zero Stars.  I went back to JPP."}
{"text":"My favorite place for gelato in Las Vegas.  The selection is always very good and I like that it's tucked away from the noise of the Bellagio.  You pay too much for soda, but the gelato is a nice, inexpensive treat."}
{"text":"One of the hidden places out in the Bellagio, unless you're a guest heading to the pool or the convention rooms you probably wouldn't wander towards this side of the hotel.  Their gelato is  really good here and it's supposedly the same gelato from the Jean Philippe Patisserie at least from what I was told.

I've also ordered their smoothies here as well, and they're pretty good but they're on the pricey side for sure.

There's iced water towards the wall on a counter near the right side of the cafe which is always refreshing."}
{"text":"Highlight of the day while shopping at the bellagio: i was eating here at this wonderfully delicious gelato place when in saunters a fat chinese dude..in his bath robe and slippers like he owns the place and places an order. Come on, you are not Hugh Hefner. He was probably at the pool nearby, but just throw on a shirt, not your bathrobe.

At any rate, on to the great gelato. Wife and I ordered the watermelon gelato, and it was heaven in our mouths. Never had I tasted such fresh, light, sweet, delightful gelato. It literally tastes like chilled, fresh, soft watermelon. It is about five bucks here, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This cute cafe tucked away next to the arcade (did you even know there was an arcade?!?! I sure as hell didn't!) in Bellagio offers a nice selection of snacks and sweets.

We only tried their gelato (dulce de leche and mango -- both super flavorful and delicious!!) but they also offer soups and assorted pastries. Their gelatos were relatively pricey (not surprising given that it's Vegas) though they were definitely very generous with their scoops. The two of us could barely finish a two-scoop cup! And that's saying a lot for a pig like myself."}
{"text":"Cheapest  place to grab something  to eat at bellagio. pastries  are very good. They also have fruit smoothies for health conscious  people. Sandwiches are decent. Nice and clean."}
{"text":"Great spot for an informal, relatively inexpensive bite. Shared ham and cheese on a croissant and veggie samosa with my wife. Both were good. Nice change of pace from buffets or celebrity chef spots in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a must stop when visiting or staying at the Bellagio hotel. Its located on the first floor near shops in a long hallway. The outside is lined with chairs to sit and catch a bite. The inside has a sitting area as well and isn't too clustered. Mornings are pretty packed and later in the evenings its slow. First time i came here i tried the sugarless gelato and wasn't a fan. The second time going in i went for a croissant. I tried the almond croissant which comes with an almond paste filling. (not bad) my second pick was the blueberry danish. Which tasted and looked very similar to the blueberry danishes sold at Jean Philip. ( not bad) this cafe started offering pressed juices that come in bottles.. The prices are high of course but the quality of the food is great. They have a variety of options for breakfast or for a small lunch. So go on in and give it a try."}
{"text":"Tasty Gelato located really close to the guest elevators. The staff is kind of meh, but you're just getting a few scoops and moving on. We went a few times during our stay. The seating in the hall is nice and we like the patio area near the pool to enjoy our treat."}
{"text":"Was hanging out at the Bellagio and of course had to get some Gelato.  I had the Mango and my wife had the Pistachio.   

I am not a fan of the pistachio but the mango had great flavor.   The cafe was decorated nicely as everything is at the Bellagio.   

Prices were reasonable and the quality was good.  Would repeat."}
{"text":"One word for this place....good!  Okay, here's another....quick.  You want another....fast ;-)

Considering the plethora of fine dining establishments that fall under the Bellagio roof, I found Cafe Gelato to be a real gem for the quick, fast, and tasty food.  Sure we are talking simple salads, sandwiches and yummy looking desserts....sometimes you just need a quick bite.  And really, for what you're paying for, I'm sure you'll be glad to use the rest of your Vegas money on something else.

I did find this place surprisingly empty upon my moments of quick dining, though perhaps a good thing as you're not disturbed by the normal Bellagio crowds, not to mention you'll always be able to find a seat ;-)"}
{"text":"Bought tix to \"O\" and got there too late to eat at a normal sit down place. Was looking for a cafe and found Gelato. Many people eating and some were in bathing suits cause it's close to the pool. Grabbed a panini and green bean salad. It was delicious and tasted very fresh. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast selections such as donuts, croissants, juice etc. Their staff are friendly too and have that smiling face every time I walk in at the cafe while staying at Bellagio."}
{"text":"Nom noms. This place is just off the guest elevators so that is a plus for late or early dining if you don't want to fight the crowds before you eat. 

Their gelato is delicious and they have a ton of different flavors. You can make a gelato sundae which I tried with hot fudge and it was to die for!  They also serve salads and paninis as well as breakfast coffees drinks and pastries. 

The line tends to be long in the morning so if you don't want to wait try to get up early and the line is nearly nothing. 

It's delicious and close to the Bellagio shops and an exit door to the Strip."}
{"text":"Inside the beautiful Bellagio resort, inspired by the town on Lake Como by the same name, there is a delightful gelatteria by the name of Cafe Gelato.  Here there is an outstanding assortment of flavors ranging from Blackberry to Amaretto.  The flavors are so bold and natural you will feel as though you had ventured to Tuscany.
Good espresso and fresh pastries are available as well, so it makes for a nice way to start the day.  I definitely recommend you make the journey for this taste of Italy, not to mention the opportunity just to be enveloped in the sights and floral smells of the resort."}
{"text":"Cute little shop with sandwiches, drinks, and of course gelato.  We tried two flavors- one was forgettable so I can't recall but the melon was delicious.  I have to say this was the closest to real gelato."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to the Bellagio to see the Conservatory or the Gallery of Fine art, I find myself ending up here for a gelato fix.  The service is very quick here, and there are plenty of tables to enjoy your treat.  I also find the people watching to be wonderful  With the pool entrance just a few steps away, I can enjoy my frozen delight while watching some lovely ladies in their bikinis.  Does it get any better?"}
{"text":"Worst espresso worst coffee dont go !!!!! If they call that espresso they should all be working at petco!!!!! Disgusting gross had to ask them please stop serving this to people and embarrassing themselves go to the real bellagio in italy see the difference in cafes what a joke its not suppose to come out like black sanka"}
{"text":"Ick! This is not real gelato. It's not even very good by ice cream standards. We tossed most of what we got. If you're looking for some good desserts I'd go to the coffee shop nearby for an Irish coffee and some cake."}
{"text":"The gelato at Caf Gelato is the best on the strip. Even better than the one at the Miracle Mile shops (I forget the name). I helped myself to a scoop of watermelon and coconut. These are two great combinations. You can taste the watermelon chunks and even the coconut flakes. The service is excellent, the prices are very reasonable, and the seating area is clean and relaxing. After a long day of gambling and walking, I like to end my night at Caf Gelato and eat my worries away.

Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"I scream, you scream, we all scream for gelato? Gelato is served at a warmer temperature than ice cream hence the texture is softer. Cafe Gelato perfected the temperature of their gelato! Water here costs $5 and gelato is also expensive but the texture of their gelato is so perfect! It's stretchy and not hard. I had the pistachio and thought the flavor was really natural tasting. They have lots of really great flavors. This place is located in the Bellagio. They have both indoor and \"outdoor\" seating (hallway). They sell a ton of savory and sweet pastries as well. Their regular size is really large! I shared 1 regular with my mom. Their plastic cups are good quality as well. You can let it sit in your cup and it wont disintegrate. Another star for opening pretty late."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for breakfast!  The musli is amazing!  A big bowl of oats, cream, apples, nuts and berries...yes please! :). 

The coffee is delicious and the cheese Danish was also very tasty!  

The server was very kind and quick.  It wax a little pricey- but this is Vegas. :). 

I would have loved to try the gelato, as all of the flavor a looked soooooo wonderful, but I was only there for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this place! For $5 to $6 you get so much gelato and the gelato has delicious chocolate too! The flavors I got are Pistachio and Peanut Butter. It was so so so yummy! The guy serving us was really nice and he put lots of extra chocolate. The interior is so cute too. I will try to come here every time I go to Vegas. I like it that much!"}
{"text":"The mango is delicious but too expensive.  I believe almost $6.00 for a cup. I guess the price reflects the strip. Good but not sure if I would pay that amount again."}
{"text":"I was just in Vegas for a week and I came here everyday to get a veggie smoothie. I recommend the Veggie and Fruit smoothie- the cucumber is very powerful, but the drink so refreshing. I also get the Froze with spinach and the Acai smoothie with spinach. The workers here are very sweet and accommodating. There is also filtered water that you can grab anytime. I brought a glass water bottle and would refill it up here before heading back to the room. 

The macadamia nut cookie is also sooo delicious. The con leche croissant was a little too sweet for me, but the almond croissant was perfect. 

For the ice cream, I recommend the snickers and oreo."}
{"text":"Make it a point to grab your favorite flavor and enjoy the decadently creamy creation while you head up the escalator and watch the water and light show at the Bellagio. You won't be disappointed with either experience."}
{"text":"I'm sorry gelato stand in the middle of saint marks at the Venetian, but THIS place can show you a thing or two about what gelato should taste like. 

I went here to use a 2-for-1 coupon from the myvegas app, and I was shocked at how affordable and delicious the gelato was! The employees were really friendly, and we loved the flavors. 

The snickers flavor and white chocolate were standouts, and I would HIGHLY recommend them. The blackberry cheesecake was good, not great. The dulce de leche was also really yummy. 

Will definitely be redeeming some more 2-for-1 deals for this gelato!"}
{"text":"Just because it's in the Bellagio, doesn't mean the price must be out of line.  A black coffee, a chi tea, and two bananas - only $18.00!  Better yet, the nice woman behind the counter strongly implied she needed a tip.  Her service was nice, but no tip for you!"}
{"text":"He makes his own gelato onsite so he knows the ingredients! My kid loved the cookies and cream gelato which had no eggs in it. Bonus they were playing Coldplay. Limited seating, but the cute bench out front is just right."}
{"text":"Cute, casual spot to grab a quick bite for lunch or a snack.  It was a bit pricey for the three of us - about $70 - especially considering that there is no table service (you order at the counter and then bring the food to your table yourself).  We ordered a sandwich, two salads, diet coke, bottle of water, and latte.  I would like to return to try their affogado.  They have low sugar gelato options as well that I am eager to try."}
{"text":"This visit started out with a little disappointment as the first time we tried to go here, it was closed (even though it was advertized to be open an hour later than when we got there). We went back the next day, and were really happy that we made the second trip. Though not all the flavors had the fancy display decorations like other gelato places do, they did have the spot on taste. As we had a bogo offer, my boyfriend ordered a scoop of the Mint Chip and I the Baileys. The mint chip was very refreshing, which is a big complement for me since I usually avoid that flavor at all costs. It is my boyfriend's favorite flavor, and he was more than happy to finish the whole thing himself. I was also very satisfied with my Baliey's order. It was smooth and creamy yet still light. We went here in the late morning, so I have happy to not have something too heavy so early in the day.

The staff was very friendly and helpful with samples. And though it is $4 for a scoop of ice cream, they give you a very generous helping. If you're looking for a treat while walking around the Bellagio, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge dessert person. But when I do dessert, it usually involves cream, sugar & being frozen. That's what made this gelato perfect on a hot Vegas day! Got a buy one get one free coupon from the m-Life booth. I had the tiramisu & it actually tasted like tiramisu! So good, creamy and rich. My friend had the mint chocolate chip & she finished all of hers! I just couldn't handle all that much sweet. Tasted like real, authentic gelato- A++"}
{"text":"This is one the few places in the US that has gelato is remotely comparable to that in Italy. They have tradiational Italian flavors and a few inventive ones as well (which is also on par with Italy). It's surprising to find anything authentic in Vegas, but it's definitely a good thing. And plus, who doesn't want a top noctch cold in that heat?

A true gem in the madness of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting Vegas and we had a buy 1 get 1 free scoop of gelato from here. We stopped in around 10pm one night and waited in line. They had two staff members working, a girl and a guy. The girl was helping two girls in front of us when the guy called us up. I immediately asked for a sample of the cheesecake - big mistake. The guy seemed irritated that I'd dare ask for a sample. No sooner did he hand me the sample spoon - and he begins chatting with the girls in front of us. 

My friend and I exchanged glances. We waited a moment and then I asked if she knew what she was getting. The guy continued to ignore us. I finally said, \"I'll have a scoop of the snickers\" and was, unsurprisingly, promptly ignored. So I said it a second time, louder. Without making eye contact, the guy continued to talk with the women in front of us, scooped the gelato, and placed a cup on the counter. I asked my friend if she wanted me to order for her since he was still ignoring us so I said, \"And a scoop of oreo.\" Again, the guy wouldn't even look at us as he served up the scoop, focusing solely on the women in front of us. 

He eventually was able to pull himself away long enough to ring us up. I told him I had a reward and he seemed offended that I didn't want to pay full price. I ended up tipping him nothing and he seemed pretty unhappy about that, making passive aggressive comments as we left. 

To top it all off, the gelato had ice crystals in it. 

Overall, I'd give the gelato a 2.5 stars and service a zero. I expected better from The Bellagio - in quality and service."}
{"text":"This review for the gelato only. Ignore the rude and impatience barista. Gelato was so good. Especially the pistachio and cappuccino ones. Nice place to have a little break from shopping."}
{"text":"Gelato was good.  However, the service was terrible.  Served by Lourdes and she had a horrible attitude."}
{"text":"Dropped a notch, as compared to how their gelato was 5 years ago.  I had told everyone visiting Vegas to get it and they all agreed- it was the best.
Recent visit- no longer the best, crazy expensive now but still definitely  very good!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located cafe right next to the Bellagio casino. We randomly passed by this cafe as we were walking out of the casino, and we were drawn in the colorful gelato display near the door. The space is well-lit, clean, and large, and in keeping with the golden classical era theme of the Bellagio hotel. 

The gelato here is quite good. There are about 12-15 different flavors, and the prices are very reasonable ($4.75 for a single, which is actually two scoops of gelato, and $6.75 for a double, which is actually three scoops). We tried a single with a scoop of Baileys and a scoop of nocciola. The nocciola was delicious - strong hazelnut flavor and deliciously creamy gelato. I didn't like the Baileys as much, which had an overpowering flavor of Baileys that took away from the enjoyment of the gelato. 

There were some large tables to sit and hang out, and complimentary iced water at the far end which we appreciated while we recovered from the casino experience."}
{"text":"Das Café liegt ein wenig abseits, fast schon ein bisschen versteckt, nahe den Gästeaufzügen und dem Zugang zum Poolbereich im Bellagio Hotel & Casino.
Das Angebot des Cafés geht von Frühstück über Desert bis zu kleinen Gerichten für zwischendurch, mein persönlicher Favorit ist jedoch das Speiseeis. Eine Vielzahl von Variationen stehen zur Auswahl, wer möchte und unschlüssig ist kann gerne nach einer kleinen Geschmacksprobe fragen. Wer nicht ganz so puristisch veranlagt ist wie ich, kann sein Eis auch noch mit reichlich \"Beilagen\" aufwerten, hier gibt es von bunten Streuseln über Obst bis zur heißen Schokoladensoße ebenfalls reichlich Auswahl.
Das Eis selbst hat geschmacklich einen erfreulich geringen Zuckeranteil und die Geschmacksrichtungen sind auch nicht so wirr, wie bei Ben&Jerry, was zumindest für mich ein positiver Punkt ist.
Hat man sich entschieden, kann man seine süße Belohnung dann gleich vor Ort im Café oder vor der Tür in gemütlichen Sesseln genießen und dem Treiben im Hotel zusehen."}
{"text":"It's expensive, it's fattening and I prob should not be going here... But it's so good! Right now my favorite flavor is the banana toffee. But it really doesn't matter which one you choose because they are all good. You can sit out in the hallway and check out the view of the pool area... It's a nice way to enjoy a little time with a friend."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure where the lunchtime rush was, but there was most definitely shawarma and falafel! He makes his own sauce which I definitely recommend adding to your pita. The garlic sauce (?) was a bit weak or perhaps he was hesitant to put much in."}
{"text":"It's amazing! We ran from across the strip fighting all the water show watchers to get there before they closed. Worth the run!  Love the rum raisin!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious given that it looks like a fancy Starbucks.  

Excellent cappuccino, pastries and lox and bagel platter.

Just buckle up cause this snack bar doesn't come cheap- given its 5 star location.

Great service from Joanna today! 

Would I go back? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Great gelato. You can sample the flavors, and they'll put two flavors in a regular cup if you want. I've usually had the fruit flavors: watermelon, lemon, berry, and they're all great. You get a good amount of gelato for the price."}
{"text":"Cafe Gelato is a pretty good dessert alternative especially in the hot Vegas heat but you'll have to venture a bit further to get it. In addition to gelato they have pastries and coffees. 

It is a bit hidden in the Bellagio and you'll have to venture towards the less happening corridor of the hotel near the buffet and directly next to the gallery of fine art and the arcade. 

The two things that really make this cafe worth a visit is the price and the portion size. 

A Single gelato is $4.75 but they'll let you include two flavors and the fill it up and stack the scoops up high.

I really thought their Stracciatella flavor was really good. My only gripe about the gelato is that it becomes runny and melted too quickly but we also did come late at night so that could explain the drop in quality of the batches. 

Tip: come here for free glasses of water. I saw a lot of families here resting their weary feet and taking a break from the triple digit weather."}
{"text":"This place gets a five according to my wife but I would give it four stars. One scoop cost over five dollars! But their portion was generous. About 3 mini scoops equal one scoop. They give samples and have tons of flavors! They have a bunch of cakes and desserts for premium prices. They do look good but I just don't think it would be worth it. The staff was friendly. My wife and I took our gelato and finished it watching the water show which was awesome!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas for something sweet! It's by the pool entrance and a quieter section of the hotel. It's a beautifully decorated cafe with a great selection of gelatos. I always get a small cup with one scoop of mango and one raspberry. Make sure to grab a cup of water by the napkin station before leaving!"}
{"text":"The gelato is amazing, decently priced and in generous portions! We just had gelato for $7.95 in the Venetian and we were hungry...walked by Bellagio to find the Forum Shops and voila! Found this gem, stracciatella, coconut, so many good flavors. You can get 2 flavors in 1 small size...best deal/value/taste! Especially since there are so many overpriced items in Vegas"}
{"text":"The right way to have a meal here is to do it in reverse; Desert, Main Course, Appetizer.  Plain and simple decision when faced with such delicious deserts like GELATO!

Granted the food is very good, prepared somewhere else, but very fresh.  We enjoyed (in the re-reveresed order) a Mediterranean Couscous Salad, Flat Bread Pizza, Tomato & Basil on a Ciabatta Roll, and a twin scoop of two Gelato.

There's comfortable seating in the Cafe or out in the Promenade, the Pool Side Patio is also a short walk if you'd rather picnic outside.  We chose a poolside.

Plump and happy, we off for the Slot Machines without a worry in the World, well maybe one worry, \"How much can I afford to lose.\"  Oh well, there's always more Gelato!"}
{"text":"Yum! Got mint chocolate gelato, 1 scoop, early in the morning. Came in for breakfast, but could not resist having dessert as well! Have plenty of pastries/desserts, sandwiches, coffee, Kettle chips, and of course gelato. I would not recommend any of the pastries as they seemed generic. I feel like a lot of the bakeries on the strip had the exact same thing, and I wondered if they were all made at one spot and then delivered. Could be said about anything, but something I noticed as I tried numerous cafe/bakeries during my visit. 

The small cup was in my opinion very plentiful, and it took me some time to eat it. Creamy, velvety mint, with dark chocolate shavings throughout -- I enjoyed this more than the typical chocolate chips or chunks, as it was more delicate and seemed to blend better with the smoothness of the gelato. Wish I had been able to get more in the evening or tried more flavors. 

Larger space than expected with plenty of seating. I easily found a table to myself, as lots of people grab their desserts/sandwiches to go Also outdoor seating in the hallway. 

And this place is sort of hidden from the rest of the casino downstairs. You need to venture past the elevators and walk down a hallway, towards the pool. Not a lot of people came that way, so in the middle of the chaos , you get some peace and quiet. 

As for my breakfast sandwich, was good, but nothing amazing. Got a prosciutto, egg, cheese since the bacon/egg/cheese was sold out. A little bit more cheese to...well, anything ration, so it felt like eating a grilled cheese sandwich until I got to the egg. The egg was a welcome surprise as it wasn't beaten/cooked. Maybe it was over easy? The whole egg was cooked, but the yolk was slightly underdone, so I got a little gooeyness/texture. Enjoyed that! 

For these two items, and tax, cost me around $18. Pricey, but had to have breakfast, and this was a delicious way to start the day!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a weekday morning.  It's a decent sized place near the Bellagio pool with desserts, sandwiches, etc.  They have a greater sandwich selection than Palio, which is across the way from Cafe Gelato.  The line was long, but moved quickly.  However, once we ordered, we waited a bit for our food, and were in fact given the wrong sandwich first.  So, that was annoying.  They had a lot of employees behind the counter, but it was a bit chaotic.

I had the ham and cheese croissant breakfast sandwich.  Good breakfast option, very large and a decent price.  Lots of egg.  The soft drinks were $3.50, but come with free refills, so I guess that helped a bit.  

All in all, nice place to get a quick bite for breakfast or lunch.  I'll try the paninis one day, they looked good."}
{"text":"The smoothest, creamiest gelato I've had. Melts in your mouth. I either get strawberry and lemon sorbet for a sort of Starburst experience, or strawberry with dulce de Leche for a rich, desserty experience."}
{"text":"Daylin needs an attitude adjustment. What a rude person! I told her a double scoop. She fixed a single. When I corrected her, she said you said single. I was like no double. She tgen was like well I didn't hear that. Very rude."}
{"text":"Really damn good gelato here.  Also pretty reasonable prices for a Vegas joint.  If you are looking for a tasty treat after dinner (or losing at gambling) I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The employees at this place could use a class on customer service. I was here with my husband and friends tonight 2/6/17 to enjoy a treat.  The 3 employees that were behind the counter were not friendly nor very welcoming to us.   Our decaf coffee was cold. Asked to have it warm and mine came back tasting weird. I asked one of the ladies working if they did something to my coffee cause it tasted different.  She said the other worker had put cream in it!  I didn't ask for cream. The lady who put the cream in my coffee started giving me attitude about her mistake. Wow!  I was disappointed and dissatisfied.  They ended up giving me a caffeinated coffee not decaf all served with a  disgusted look on her face. If I could take the star away I would. That was a mistake!"}
{"text":"I enjoy a good quiche, and so I enjoy Cafe Gelato for a quick quiche option. Sorry if you were hoping to read about delicious gelato! I haven't sampled this sweet treat here, but I have had the vegetarian quiche, and it is quality. The quiche is filled with delicious, fresh veggies, and they serve a generous slice. It is reasonably priced, and it is served up quickly. Just order at the counter, and in no time you're eating! There is plenty of seating. Perfect for a quick bite before you hit the tables or the clubs. The only thing that would make it better is if they served it with a little green salad. The other cool tip: If you get coffee here, you can get free refills all day if you keep your cup!"}
{"text":"This place has the best soft serve icecream I think I've ever had. With different flavours daily and seasonal it's always worth the trip over! My favourite is the mango soft serve!"}
{"text":"A single scoop gelato was about $5.75 and it was not worth it @ all and a croissant was about $4. It was hard and we had to get it warmed up. Then it came out burnt. Dissapointed that this did not meet my expectations especially since its in Bellagio."}
{"text":"The first time and the last time for here. Bad service bad food bad drinks. I ordered one cake one ice cream and a mango green tea large. When I got my drink and I drink it. It's was toooooo sweet. And I ask for a cup. She's like oh I'm sorry I can't give u cups. That is it. Didn't ask for change a new one and how do I wanna do with the drinks. She keeps talking and laughing with those guys witch is nothing on the table I don't think they are customers. Might be her friend or something. Won't be back anymore. And I spent $13 for nothing. Where is those good reviews coming from. Bad experience"}
{"text":"Nice gelato place. There are seating both inside and outside. It is very close to the fine art gallery insurance the hotel. Gelatos were good. We tried cappuccino and tiramissu. Both were yum. You have to pay $15 for two scoops."}
{"text":"We came here twice, once just for coffee and a second time for gelato.  It's conveniently located at the Bellagio so we didn't have to walk outside. 

The line moved quickly both times. If you're looking for basic breakfast pastries, this is the faster place to visit compared to other locations. 

The coffee was super hot and not too bitter.  I needed two napkins around the coffee sleeve to hold it. The gelato was very smooth. I went with chocolate, that had a rich flavor."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical of gelato having had the real deal in Italy and this place was on par with some of the best little cafes in Italy. Hard to believe that I'd find the real thing (or close) in Las Vegas of all places...but believe it!

I had the nocciola (sp?) and stratciatella - my two favorites. The first is hazelnut and the second is chocolate chip. These have always been my favorite and I was pleasantly surprised to find them here.

At first I was surprised by the prices but when I found out that a \"single\" meant two scoops, I was okay with it. 

Only thing that I didn't love was that they were selling food here...focus on your gelato, people! It seems odd that they sell soup in an ice cream shop but whatever works..."}
{"text":"Nothing like creamy, cold goodness on a cone during a hot Vegas vacation! We were looking for a delicious dessert to top off our \"last supper\" before the madness that was about to ensue that night. ;) When we had gotten here, we were so overwhelmed with the selection that it literally took us 15 minutes to figure out what we we wanted to get. I mean that's a good thing they had so much to choose from but I hate it because it's an indecisive persons' nightmare. Eventually my gfs and I all opted for a scoop of the flavors we picked and devoured it like no tomorrow. I found my mint chocolate chip to be too creamy and sweet for my likings but my friends enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed theirs flavors. Generous portions and a nice place but we honestly just wanted something to soak up the alcohol later on..."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot for pastries, individual quiches, croissants! The almond croissant was absolutely amazing. Oh, don't forget the gelato... or you'll just have to go back! Prices are very reasonable, especially for being located in the Bellagio. Take your fare out on the terrace and enjoy!
Our server, Camelia, was super!"}
{"text":"This gelato caffe is located inside the Bellagio towards the pool. It is beautiful and clean with a few tables and chairs inside and confi couches , chairs and tables right outside for additional seating. They have a lot of beautiful flavors.
I got 3 scoops of coconut, Baileys and rum raisin . All were very yummy! Service was prompt. I was also able to sample a few flavors before making a decision."}
{"text":"Cafe Gelato is a place if you love gelato! For a small cup you get two big scoops, or you can get a small cup and put two flavors for the same price. 

Cafe Gelato is a hidden place in Bellagio. If you like to explore the place you may run into this shop! It has a beautiful decor, but be sure to get in line! Just make sure to come here when you're at Bellagio!"}
{"text":"Yummy, creamy gelato. The mint chip had a nice texture and was not overpoweringly minty. The chocolate chips did not have as much flavor as I'd like. They do not have many toppings - mostly sprinkles and chips. Would have loved hot fudge sauce!"}
{"text":"This place made me feel fancy. The cups and spoons were a thick matte plastic and the napkins felt like a luxury fast food restaurant. The layout is super adorable and fits with the theme of the Bellagio. I got dulce de leche and coconut. Both were very yummy and delicious. I love that the gelato was thick and creamy. I have tried some places back home where the gelato had an almost liquid consistency. This was a delightful surprise and I highly recommend that you stop by when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Located within the Bellagio, we stopped by for a treat since it was so darn hot!

A wide range of flavours, we each got a two scoop cup and sat in the chairs right outside the cafe in the hotel hallways. 

It's gelato, ergo it's cold, refreshing, tasty, and awesome."}
{"text":"***************************** 1429 ***************************

  Located across the Bellagio pool, how convenient? The gelato is so good here.... I love the vanilla and the mint. Don't forget to try the latter too, only $10 but it's at the Bellagio right? They also offer coffee, sandwich, salad, and pastries... Service can be slowwwwwww on the weekend.

  Cafe Gelato is a perfect spot to stop by before you hit the pool!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by Cafe Gelato for a sweet treat when passing through the Bellagio. When I walked in at 7 p.m. the place was completely empty so I thought good for me more time to try different flavors. I started with the Tiramisu. The mouth feel of the gelato was perfect, silky smooth, rich, thick with the right creamy consistency and at the right temperature, however the flavor was off and it was one of the worst Tiramisu's that I'd had. I then switched gears to try the dulce de leche. By experience I know that this is supposed to be sweet, but here it was off the charts sweet. I mean it would literally give the not-too-sweet crowd nightmares, complete with the midnight shaking and cold sweat, that sweet. I was not too keen on this but before I could ask for a third taste the demeanor of the gentleman behind the counter changed, like don't you dare ask for another. I quickly looked around if there was a sign which said only two samples per customer or if I was holding up the line, both of which were not the case so I could not understand why the person would behave in such a way. Anyway I decided against another sample and went with a single scoop ($4.75) for which I could select two flavors. I went with one random flavor that looked good and got the dulce de leche from among the ones that I had tasted as the Tiramisu was terrible. Later I asked my friend to sample the dulce de leche and he literally spat it out saying \"diabetes\", but I hung in there and finished it even though it gave me a slight headache.

I would sum this up as reasonably priced, perfectly made gelato with a terrible flavor profile coupled with bad service. Sorry you don't have me as a fan."}
{"text":"Overpriced and quite possibly the worst gelato I have ever had. Ice crystals and nasty artificial flavoring -- I couldn't stomach finishing a small cup, despite the expense. I've had better generic supermarket ice cream. Nothing like what you get in Italy, or even NYC."}
{"text":"I expected a better customer service since it's Bellagio but manager cut us off and wanted to help a white lady before us then when we told her we were next.. she didn't want to help us!"}
{"text":"What a little hidden gem! Summer days in Vegas makes me scream for ice cream !! I tried the banana toffee crunch and the pistachio- 5/5 stars! Two scoops for $6 but they give u huge scoops so its good to share or for your own if you don't feel like sharing. They have cafe foods to go to satisfy your hunger if you're on the go. Dont leave this place without ordering The Ahi tuna salad and it is AMAZING. Now I know I gotta make a stop here every time I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"My goodness! As I walked into this gelato spot I was astonished to see the plethora of flavors they had to choose from. You can sample them all too! I love the Bellagio and this made me love it even more. This place is somewhat hidden from the other guests that come to gamble and I happened to come across it when I ended up walking away from the casino part of the hotel and walking near the pool area. 

I had the best pistachio and mango gelato for $6 (large size, 2 scoops) and it seemed never ending! The gelato cups are cute too. Great price for so much gelato and deliciousness in every scoop. So fresh, light, sweet and amazing service! A great way to start the afternoon in heat!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of gelatos inside Bellagio by the pool.  The portions are generous, specially for 5 star Vegas resort.  I got the mango and pistachio. Mango was tart and fruity while the pistachio was creamy with lots of whole pistachios mixed in. Great place to grab a treat or sit and recharge."}
{"text":"It's a very quaint but cute ice cream shop hidden away in the Bellagio.  They let you sample their products so you can pick the perfect Gelato."}
{"text":"I've tried and I've tried, but have yet to find truly great gelato (or ice cream) in Las Vegas.  However, this place is pretty good.  Located near the pool, Caf Gelato also sells other desserts."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in to the cafe to get some gelato, we had the M life coupon 2 for 1. I got the chocolate ganache while she got 4 flavors of gelato. 

The reason for 3 stars is the place was a bit dirty and half the tables had leftovers on them. While my girlfriend was choosing the gelato flavors the people behind the counter were trying to hurry her up because there's a line. They should just wait and let you sample whatever you want, because they have about 10+ flavors."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place for gelato in the world.  PERIOD.  Cappucino and Blackberry Cheesecake are must-try flavors!"}
{"text":"The Café Gelato has the best cheese Danish I have ever had.  I wish that I could order a box of them to be delivered to my home.  I was recently staying at the Bellagio's for a Conclave--May 13-17 and I walked there three times to get the cheese Danish and gelato.  I have since been dreaming of the taste and wishing I could have some transported to me."}
{"text":"I was told to come here and try some high quality gelato. I came here on an empty stomach in the morning so I ended up getting an order of a chicken panini sandwich. It wasn't cheap but it was damn good. It's Vegas and I would expect nothing less. I heard that in Vegas, they set the standard very high when it comes to hiring people with good looks and so I expect them to have the same standard for their food quality. Gotta try the gelato next time."}
{"text":"I will never, ever forget how good their Irish Bailey's gelato was. Never. And I have never been able to find that flavor anywhere else out here in California. So I guess I have to go back to Las Vegas to have it again. *sigh*

They have other pastries there that look good, but I had the Irish Bailey's gelato and the raspberry New York cheesecake flavor, which was also very sweet and very delicious."}
{"text":"Not bad. Quick stop for food on your way out of the hotel rooms...gelato is quite good :) Never a giant crowd either. Most of the employees there (one of them is quite a cutie!) are friendly and helpful!

Bellagio pie: I didn't have it, but my friend did and she liked it!

Spinach quiche: Wow. Yum! I don't know what else to say, but it was good.

Ham and cheese croissant: Super greasy, but cheesy! Nice thick layer of ham in between :)

We ordered plenty, but that's all I remember for now. We also ordered a shot of espresso with our gelato, which was amazing. Overall though, like most Vegas cafes, it is generally overpriced and I prefer going to Jean Phillippes for crepes and pastries  just a short walk away."}
