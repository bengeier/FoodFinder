{"text":"this place had a very home-like feel to it.

it's not a fancy restaurant where you get served food its a fast food joint, but they take really good care of you.

I got the chicken & rice and it was one of the best i have had in the city my girl who is a vegetarian came with us and they customized a dish for her - that's service!

I echo the review below mine, the owner was super friend - which i think is a testament to excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place after reading all the reviews that praise it, but I have had better tasting shawarma elsewhere. I ordered my food around 5PM so I dunno if it was a bit old, but the chicken was a little dry, and did not have enough flavour for me. It was spicy enough and the service is friendly, but the taste didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Had the lamb sharwma  and the chicken on fries. Super delicious! The owner is super friendly too! 5/5 would recommend"}
