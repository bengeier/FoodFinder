{"text":"Spice 7 is one of the few South Asian restaurants that scores the real trifecta: excellent and authentic food, true regal design that boats all the exuberance of the continent, and amazing and refreshing customer service that will have you wondering is it really a brown restaurant.

Formerly \"Mirchi\", but now re-branded and under new management, Spice 7 picks up where the old restaurant left off with Pakistani and Indian dishes that'll have the most scrutinizing of brown aunties impressed, but with a feel and customer service experience you can expect from any other top tier high-end restaurant in the city. The staff treats everyone with care and attention. Though the food takes some time, it is standard because the amount of time the food takes directly correlates with how awesome the food will taste, here's a tip: be sure to ask for the appetizers to arrive first (the menu is setup with the appetizers in the later pages, you may ask for an appetizer but it'll arrive with the rest of your meal).

Items that are real winners on the menu: all the Karahis (have them with anything, so good), Butter Chicken or Prawns (the sauce will have you licking the bowl clean), the Platters (pricey but ideal for crowds greater than 5 or 6) and their Naan! Oh, the Garlic Naan, I could eat them for days, and I'm a rice person so it's a testament to the deliciousness! I could be mistaken but they have a real tandoor oven in the back and you can taste the difference compared to other restaurants.

Things to keep in mind and be forewarned:
1) If you're brown, this place is a bit on the expensive side so don't be outraged at the bill at the end of the night; but you get what you pay for, in a good way
2) foods can be spicy so be sure to let the waiter know of your tolerance and preference
3) location and parking - in the corner of NW downtown, a bit out of the area so keep that in mind of you're planning on walking. A note about parking, on a busy night it can be tedious as parking is mostly on the main street outside the restaurant.

Regardless of the above, Spice 7 is a must-try for anyone or group looking for refined, memorable, and overall amazing South Asian dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place hits all the notes for me when it comes to South Asian cuisine - authentic and delicious. 

The spotlight definitely needs to be placed on the extravagant dinner menu: offering plenty of variety, matched with a diverse flavour portfolio. I would recommend the biryani which is quite honestly what keeps me coming back - best i've ever had! 

The lunch buffet spread offers a great option for those wanting to sample a few different dishes.  However, I have found it more satisfying to enjoy dishes from my own selection (this could possibly be because it does not always include the biryani.)

Great food aside, it's the welcoming service and regal decor that will leave anyone with nothing short of a great experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking for ambiance then this is the place to be. Very nice decore , food is yummy and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"We are THRILLED about Spice 7 being in Royal Oak!!

Service - stellar. We have been a couple of time since opening, and have been treated like royalty.

Food - Wonderful. We were dismayed with the closing of another local favourite in Bowness/Montgomery, so we really had our fingers crossed for Spice 7 and they do not disappoint. Dishes are flavourful and rich, with subtle differences and uniqueness. Some places just seem like the same sauce but with different names, but I dare say Spice 7 honours the differences!! 

Overall - 5/5. Small and intimate, and doing a great takeout business. Our kids are treated well there, and also love the food; especially the pakoras and mango lassi."}
{"text":"I recently got the food for our party catered from this location (they also have another location in Royal Oak). The food was not only horrible but it was stinking badly.. the kabobs were uncooked and the naan bread was over burned. They claimed to be an authentic Pakistani restaurant but their food lack the basic Pakistani at taste and flavour.

The dollar amount they charge is arms and legs with no value associated to the food they serve. I took lots of pictures and am going to share..

Third class food and worst service... will never go there again and would like to advise other not to get food from this outlet.."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for lunch for the first time.  

The atmosphere is quite, very nice furniture and very clean.  It was a buffet lunch.  I'm not normally a fan of buffets but this was a little different.  The selection was smaller but of better quality.  A simple green salad, basmati rice, vegetable (mainly potato) pakoras, 5 different stews including butter chicken a fish one and 2 vegetarian options, nan and dessert.  I had a taste of everything and it was all fresh and tasty.

The service was a little absent but being a buffet all we really needed was water refills which we got so I won't dwell in the service.

It is a little hidden away (below the Oscar building) so it seems like a lot of people don't know about it.  Shame because I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant tucked away in downtown Calgary close to Eau Claire. The decor is quite nice and inviting. The service is commendable, sometimes could get slow in busier times. The food is very tasty, I've tried a variety of dishes with friends and everything is fresh and leaves you wanting more. If the spice level is something you want adjusted, all you need to do is ask and they will try to accommodate. The Naan bread here might easily be the best thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian I struggle to find great restaurants.  Spice 7 is one of the best vegetarian friendly places there is.  There is an abundance of selection, with incredible flavours.  For two people to eat at dinner it's roughly $25, can't complain.

The interior has recently been renovated and it looks fantastic.  The service is incredible, friendly and very quick.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Decor is great, food consistency is improving with each visit and they have made a better concerted effort to improve customer service as well and it is showing.

Keep up the great work...food serving size is good...taste and flavour of desserts could be better but better than most places in the city."}
{"text":"Very lucky to have such great food nearby. Best lentil daal I have had. The haleem is wonderful."}
{"text":"Yummy food I always order from skipadish.com"}
{"text":"One of the nicest Indian restaurants around. Fine dining experience plus good food at really good prices. Food may be a little too spicy for some people. Would go again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here so many times! Dine in or pick up they never disappoint! Food is always fresh, with care and attention paid to service and presentation. The staff are kind and always have a smile."}
{"text":"Disappointed. 
Ended up at Spice 7 because of its great Yelp reviews but upon arrival I found the restaurant itself to be somewhat poorly taken care of aesthetically, for such a nice neighborhood I found Spice 7 to be a bit of an eyesore. 
As we entered, we noticed not a single other table which was worrisome as it was 6:00 on a Thursday night, we were not greeted although the owner/manager was sitting at the only other table, waited at the table for what had to have been 5 minutes before we were handed menus and waited another 10 for a waiter to return and take our drink order.
The food was mediocre, and tasted like it had been sitting out before we had arrived and I found the staff to be a little less then friendly like they had other places to be. The food we had received was quite spicy, and had to ask for a glass of water (which came without any ice). For the price of the food (on the more expensive side compared to the other Indian/South Asian restaurants I have been), I found the quality to be quite unacceptable. 
Overall, I had a poor experience and because of this, a terrible night as I had traveled into Downtown Calgary to try this restaurant, only uplifting portion of the evening was the chance to visit the Peace Bridge after which is surprisingly beautiful when lit up at night. I will not be recommending this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"My favourite Indo-Pakistani restaurant in Calgary. Service, ambiance and food are excellent. Spice level can be adjusted based on your tolerance. The owner usually tries to meet customers."}
{"text":"Small and intimate spot located in Royal Oak in the newest strip. I went in for take out and it wasn't busy at all. I was the only one in there at lunch.

It was clean, well organized and the man at the counter seemed friendly. Was provided a menu, ordered and told to come back in 15 minutes for pick-up. Would have preferred to sit and wait for my lunch however I took that as my que to leave and come back.

Service was good, food was great and place is small and and very quiet. Maybe its louder at night or they have music on but it was really quiet when I was there. I would like to come back again and try other items in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was there for the ramadan buffet on June 30th 2016, paid $25 for literally shit food. I was so upset with the selection and the quality of the food I was served - the dates were in poor shape, there wasn't enough flavour, the curry's were way too runny, and there was only one selection of desert (which wasn't spectacular). 

I'm a huge believer of you get what you pay for. For they charged me, I wasn't expecting something extravagant, but at least decent food and selection. 

I was very disappointed, because when I had gone to this place in March 2016, and ordered food, I received great portions, it was delicious, great ambiance and great service. They really dropped the bomb with this buffet."}
{"text":"A delicious place to go get some affordable Indian/Pakistani food! It's tucked away in over by peace river bridge, but once you walk inside it has a feel of a different country. The tables and chairs take you to India, and that isn't even mentioning the food. I ordered the chick pea curry. That with some of the naan, I was in heaven. The spice was just enough to get you hot but not enough to have you scrambling for some water (and that was the mild). My fiancé ordered the butter chicken with some rice and loved it as well. She said it was tender and juicy. The food comes out family style with generous portions so it easy to share."}
{"text":"The food is good.. well at least the dish I tried. Problem is the menu is too long and for someone who isn't familiar with this cuisine, very hard to choose from. There are no descriptions and the waiter was very unhelpful in explaining what the dish is or what is included in the order.

The only way I would go back is with someone experienced in Indian/Pakistani dishes and who knows what's good.

Despite the good food quality, the service experience and confusing menu ruined it for me.."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, exceeded our expectations. Friendly and helpful staff, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great Indian food with a wonderful atmosphere. 5 out of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for tasty, hot, spicy Indian food this is the place to go! The food was fresh and delicious. 

The chairs however were uncomfortable although they looked very nice."}
{"text":"i ordered fish pakora at spice 7 restaurant it was smelly and dirty taste and afghani tickka was so small pieces they charge $10 for small pieces, will never eat or order in this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great Place to satisfy your tastebuds!
Loved the authentic cuisine and friendliness of the staff. Small place with awesome food.. Do try the Goat Chops, Karahi and Nahari!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and very tasty. The naan was the best I have ever had.  The spice level is high, but I was able to manage with the help of some raitha. The service was good, although we went on a Sunday night and the place was empty. I will be back to test their butter chicken."}
{"text":"A fairly new place in my neighbourhood. We saw it as we were out for a walk and saw a very long line up on a weekend evening so we came back to visit on a weekday evening. 

I don't know very much about authentic Indian food and I am embarrassed to admit that I barely know the difference in all the different types of curry and spices. I just know that I like dishes like butter chicken, vindaloo, and garlic naan so take that as your warning if you are reading this review and know it is entirely based on a personal preference. 

We ordered the chicken karahi delux, garlic naan, rice, and the tilapia (sorry I can't seem to find what it's called on the menu). 

We were surprised to see the lack of choices in rice like coconut rice but they do have biryani which are rice dishes as well which is different! 

We enjoyed the naan and the fish dish very much! I would visit again and probably just order the fish dish to myself because it is served on a plate of rice with the fish and the sauce on top. It is definitely enough food for one. 

The chicken karahi delux I enjoyed but not sure if I would order again, not because it wasn't good but I felt that the spices were too strong for me. Perhaps it's an acquired taste? 

Long story short, I do not have an authentic taste palate for Indian food and enjoy \"white-washed\" dishes like butter chicken so I very much liked the tilapia dish here as well as the naan bread. 

I would visit on a weekday evening when they are less busy or order take out as the restaurant itself is quite small."}
{"text":"Spice 7 is a new addition to deep NW that has been starved for variety for far too long.  The space is quite beautiful when you walk in.  It's a blend of modern with the traditions of the Indian/Pakistan region and it seems quite elegant.   The menu variety is average,  but I find vegetarian options a bit weak for this type of food compared to many other options.   The food I did order (chana) was quite good - spiced excellently.  Nann and rice were both done quiet well.   

In my experience, most Indian/Pakastani restaurants keep things a bit bland for someone like me until they trust I can handle the heat which really makes it difficult to try something new at times because it's kind of boring.   Spice 7 starts out a bit spicier out of the gate which meant I got a great heat level for me right away.   They are happy to deal with people that like things milder but it's something you should mention when you order if that's you or your party. 

The portions are a bit small, the prices are a bit high (average NW indian food pricing though) but they are also good and very close to me.  I'm sure I'll still venture to the NE for Indian food because of the selection options, having left overs for days and still come out ahead after paying for gas but it's not the only option for good food indian and that's nice."}
{"text":"LOVE THE FOOD! thats all there is to this review, i have never, not even once been let down. The food is authentic Pakistani and offers a great selection of BBQ dishes as well as traditional Karai but my favourite are the vegetarian dishes, i usually am a meat person but at spice 7, i love all the dishes. I have been going to Spice 7, at least 4 to 6 times a month. LOVE IT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES SPICE...last thing, the chai may take long to arrive but they make it from scratch and the desserts are great!"}
{"text":"Being a Regular at Spice 7 in Eau Claire, the owners of the new Spice 7 Royal Oak invited me and a few of their friends, family, and colleagues. The Food is Amazing, we had tried a sample of a few curries, meat and veggie. Loved the Daal(lentil), the tikkas were juicy, tasty, and most of all the my favorite the aloo palak(spinach and potato currie) was amazing, this place is going to do very well being in a suburb of Calgary, and being a halal based restaurant. The Pakistani and Indian dishes are amongst the finest I have tasted in Calgary, with good food like this, people will come from all over Calgary to experience it! I recommend this place to anyone who likes their spice! I will follow up on another review once I experience their service, so far I have only experienced the food!"}
{"text":"A big fail! I called 2x to inquire if they were wheelchair accessible and both the manager and the woman that took my reservation said yes. We arrive to stairs! Many stairs! From the entrance in and doesn't into the restaurant. No other entrance! The manager was not even in the slightest apologetic an denied that I was told they were wheelchair accessible. Why say yes to something when clearly you are not set up for that. Our reservation of 4 moved on, but I was so disappointed at the lack of respect to mislead about their accessibility and then not even apologize for that once it had come to light!

We went to Moti Mahal instead and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Karahi deluxe is just that......deluxe! Super tasty and we usually go back at least once a month if not more never disappointed!"}
{"text":"We went on the weekend for their halwa puri breakfast. They serve that from 9-1 only. We ordered 2 halwa puri plate, 1 aloo paratha, 1 dum ka Keema and teas for the 3 of us. I thinks it's better then raja food restaurant. I found rajas halwa puri breakfast extremely oily. Here what we ordered was delicious, and the host was most gracious. The restaurant is pretty small and we had to wait about 20 min to be seated. But it was totally worth the wait. I'm giving it 3 stars only bc of limited seating and long wait times. Bc of these 2 reasons I can never bring my kids here, bc they won't be able to stand and wait quietly for long periods of time and not create scenes. That's my personal opinion, might be diff for other families."}
{"text":"The samosa's are off the chain! 

Definitely worth a visit, great location, great food!"}
{"text":"I have 2 words to describe Mirchi's little big brother ... \"Mutton Biryani\"
Not that the Chicken Tikka, Afghani Tikka, and Shish Kabab ( Collectivly known as the Chef's platter ) where not fabulous. I jus find myself craving more Biryani right now!
I did not ignore the dhal ( but it does deserve it's own food category ) 
And while you are at it, don't forget to cool down over a 3 flavour Kulfi desert 

The service, setting, and pricing all get full marks."}
{"text":"Very beautiful restaurant! And the food was good as well... more spicy than what I would have liked it, but very tasty ... we went there a group of about 10 people and the table we had was very nice!! The service was slow for lunch... it took us more than what we would have liked as we had to go back to work ... but definitely this is a restaurant worthy to visit at least once just to see the nice decoration and try some Indian / Pakistani food in downtown ... the prices are not bad at all..."}
