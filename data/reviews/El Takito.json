{"text":"Used to be el taquito .. Now they had a renovation and added new stuff to the menu. They have nachos, quesadillas, and burritos all for $5 .. My favorite is the pastors mmm.."}
{"text":"Off to a good start for my first time here. I've only tried their Tacos and wasn't disappointed. I'll be coming back and going through all their menu choices. Parking wise it's on the side streets and  not bad depending on time of day."}
{"text":"This little family operated joint turns out some pretty tasty tacos for a deal. Authentic options, great service and cheap prices make El Takito shine - apart from the tacos. The tacos are no nonsense, and free of flavour adulterating toppings, really highlighting the delicious fillings. The Cabeza is a must try, and the El Pastor were super satisfying. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and thought I would check out some local restaurants. El Takito might not look like much from the outside, or inside for that matter, just some simple Mexican decor and tapestries. The food on the other hand, smelled amazing on the way in, and tasted great as well. We had corn tortilla tacos, great for my wife who is gluten-free. The tortillas were blue corn, and looked pretty cool too! My one issue, was the overall price, two people getting 4 tacos and a drink each was almost $40, which wasn't the greatest value. I think it's worth another visit to try more from their menu."}
