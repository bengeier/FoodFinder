{"text":"Terrible service. I've been here two hours and haven't gotten my appetizer yet. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, spacious and comfortable for big groups, rooftop views. Great service and food. Tacos, veggie burger, salads are all great! Order the cheese curds here!"}
{"text":"Madison Blind is a great place to go to for a nice dinner and some good drinks. Dining rooftop makes the experience more fun in my opinion. With excellent views of the capitol and Lake Mendota, the location is hard to beat. Cheese curds and edamame hummus are a must when ordering appetizers. I would highly recommend the Blind Burger as your entrée. Would definitely go back again for at least a drink."}
{"text":"Thank god there is finally another rooftop in this town!  

However,  The Blind is nothing special. If you want a good view with ok drinks and food priced in the average range, this is a fine place,  but it's nothing special. 

The menu is your standard elevated gastropub fare.  The problem is,  The Blind is coming to this trend a little late and the menu doesn't offer anything new or exciting. 

We had the elk poutine. It tasted like every other poutine.  The highlight was dessert. They offer these delicious little hand pies. But even these are not made in house,  but by Portage Pi.

I'll likely return if I ever want a decent mixed drink and a good view."}
{"text":"Overall Review:  if you just want a quick cocktail with the view of the capitol, then this place is fine- but otherwise spend your money elsewhere in madison where they have their act together.
-----

it's a bummer this place can't get it right, because the space is absolutely beautiful, and both indoor and outdoor tables have some of the best restaurant views in madison. the food is also decent- but the service is just so bad that it makes the whole experience not worth it- with all the other good restaurants in madison, there's no need to waste your time here. 

i've been a couple times now, and was waiting to review hoping the next experience will be better, but after dining again last night- it just isn't getting any better. our experience last night was annoying because we waited 40 minutes to be seated (we had a reservation) because the server said a table wasn't ready, and we finally looked outside- only to find that there wasn't even anyone at our reserved table. we sat down and waited another 20 minutes until we had water and a could put in a drink order. the server was clearly not able to handle the workload of his 3 tables, and no other employee was around to help him out. He didn't know what they were out of on the menu, forgot drinks, brought things we didn't order, didn't know who ordered what, etc. 

it was a tuesday night so the restaurant was suuuuuper slow, so there wasn't really a good excuse for such slow and bad service. hopefully this place can get a manager that can whip it into shape, because in the meantime, it's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It feels like the best kept secret in town. The chef at the Blind was sniped from Chicago and they really got lucky finding him! This menu is on point. Elk poutine with so much flavor my mouth is watering remembering it. The fries are fried in duck fat, which is amazingly flavorful. The Blind Burger is real star of the menu, though. I would eat it every day if I could. Prices are average as far as Madison fare goes. Worth the price in flavor and portion size. Plus there's the view. It's too cold now to sit outside on the rooftop, but there's still a spectacular view of the city from inside. The service is also amazing."}
{"text":"Had to wait several minutes to be sat when the restaurant was mostly empty. Our waitress took over 10 minutes to take our order and that's when we left. Menu was short but looked like it was good quality, although expensive for burgers / bar food. The view was very good if you're lucky enough to get one of 5 outdoor tables."}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Had a delicious drink called the pancho villa -- watermelon and cucumber juices with tequila is a definite win in my book. Will be back to try the food. Can't wait to go on the outdoor terrace in the summer!"}
{"text":"Checked in The Madison Blind at 7pm on a Saturday night after the Badgers gams. Very friendly and helpful staff. 
Started off with a Madison Mule and the Steak Tacos - it was absolutely delicious. Highly recommended. For the main course, I went with the Blind Burger and my friend had the Winter Whitefish. We both walked away with more than enough food to satisfy grown men. More
Importantly, it was high quality ingredients made my a chef that truly cares about what he/she prepares. 
Needless to say, we will be back in no time."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Beautiful view.  The food was very good -- had the fish tacos and scallops and thought both were excellent.  My wife originally didn't like her sangria (truth, the white sangria is really bad) but the waiter brought out an extra glass of wine for her to try instead --very good service."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, service, and small plates. I would highly recommend the Blind for a happy hour or dinner on the rooftop. The place overlooks lake Mendota and the Capital. It's casual and fun. It definitely has a younger vibe, since it is on campus, but the view makes it worth it. This is a hidden gem in the city!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and quite affordable for being a hotel restaurant/bar. They do have a veggie burger option and the appetizers (hummus, etc) are tasty. Nice view of the capitol."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Madison blind and the food/drinks here. We have been going to the restaurant since it opened and it has only gotten better with time. The portage salad, the skirt steak skewers and the rosé are phenomenal. 

Also Jeff is the most incredible waiter. He convinced us to buy a unicorn wine holder and we have no regrets about it. 

If you're looking for a place with incredible service and great food, the Madison blind is for you. Don't forget the incredible views of the capital/lake!! And seriously. Ask for Jeff."}
{"text":"I recently attended a Madison Chamber of Commerce luncheon. The views are just unbelievable of the lake and the capital amazing atmosphere. The food and service was outstanding will definitely go again they're only open for dinner at this time"}
{"text":"I've come back here for a second review. After a really poor experience a week ago (and a 1-star review), we were convinced by the management to come back and try it again. We were hesitant at first, but ultimately took them up on the offer.

Even with the poor service during our first experience, the food and drinks were great. That continued this time. The fries, curds and shrimp are excellent. And everyone at the table who ordered the burger agreed it was among the best they'd ever had. Which is pretty tough to do, right? But this is a restaurant where it's actually worth ordering the burger.

And the service this time was excellent. And not just our table. We were keen to notice that every table in the restaurant was receiving the same exceptional service we had. It's fortunate that we took a second chance, because this is one of our new favorite spots in Madison (realistically, a 4.5/5 stars). Kudos to the entire staff. If the service we saw tonight is any indication, we will be back many, many times."}
{"text":"Very cool spot at the top of the Graduate hotel with awesome views of Lake Mendota and Capital. We had a group of 20 people and the waitstaff was super accommodating. Was initially unsure of this spot as no one I know has eaten there...but, exceeded expectations. The food was great...I crushed an outstanding burger perfectly prepared...and, all in our party left happy / satisfied...I would absolutely recommend this spot to anyone, and likely go here again when I'm back in Madison."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of city & delicious food. Try the scallops - they're soooo yummy.  There's an outside dining are but its small. The inside area tables all have a nice view while not being hot. Very relaxing and not rushed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after strolling around the lake Mendota. Located on the 7tg floor (roof top) of The Graduate hotel. Nice rooftop view of Madison. Not stellar, just a different view. We sat outside for dinner. Outdoor furniture was weathered. Mural on the wall looks incomplete. Overall vibe is so so. 

Food was OK. We asked for recommendations and selected the duck dumpling, PEI mussels, crispy chicken and scallops. We added the portage salad. 

Duck dumpling was ok. It was shredded duck meat wrapped in wanton skin and deep fried. I would skip this the next time. 

Mussels were good, especially the curry sauce. 

Crispy chicken cones with lots of greens piled on top. Basically just breaded chicken breast and greens. Very unremarkable. 

Scallops were the best dish. Skip the portage salad next time if you are getting the crispy chicken. The salad is also just OK. 

Had their white sangria made with seasonal fruits and white wine + triple sec. It was too bitter and there is no fruitiness to the sangria. Basically white wine with cut fruits. I had to ask for additional basic syrup to improve it. 

Probably won't be returning here for a while."}
{"text":"Had the Blind Burger and it was good! Nothing crazy special but definitely a good burger. A tad bit expensive (especially for a college student) though. The Hummus was garlic and pesto and was outstanding and they serve it with this delicious bread, would certainly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had a great evening at The Blind. Although there was a birthday party going on in the bar which made things a bit noisy the drinks were great, views from up high were unique and quite nice and the food was delicious. Servers did a really good job of attending to our needs and the price for all of this was quite reasonable. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks with my boyfriend on a Monday night. We sat at the bar and were impressed by Ted! He is amazingly charismatic and led us to have a fantastic time. The restaurant atmosphere is beautiful and the view of the lake is perfect. Our favorite drink, with orange marmalade and gin,  was perfection. (As was the Madison mule) We opted against food for the evening but regretted our decision when we saw food delivered to the people next to us. It smelled AMAZING!!! We will be returning to try the food and make it our regular \"haunt\". !!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a gem we found accidentally. Great atmosphere. Good price. The poutine was great. Will be back to try a burger."}
{"text":"Food, service, and decor was top notch. Would have liked cooking options for burgers however."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to attend a social function recently at The Madison Blind. I had been in The Graduate before, but this was my first time at their rooftop bar/restaurant.  One of my favorite parts of the Graduate is the overall ambience of the lobby (and presumably the rooms). I was super impressed with the cool design of the \"lobby\" of the Madison Blind, as well as the fun plaid bathrooms and the bar with it's subway tile and beautiful lighting.  The actual restaurant seems a bit understated compared to everything else - it's pretty simple and plain, but perhaps they were going for something sleeker and cleaner compared to the rest of their super eclectic decorating!  

I did not eat a full meal at The Madison Blind, however I tried a few appetizers and some wine.  The food I did eat was very good and the servers were all incredibly friendly and fun.  After taking a peek at their full menu, I am excited to go back and try, of course, their cheese curds.  I'm always on the lookout for the next best cheese curd in Madison! I also love that, while the menu is fairly small, they offer a number of different vegetarian options. Our event was in the evening, so I did not get a chance to see the views from the rooftop, nor did I venture out in the cold to really check it out, but I can assure you I will be back when the weather is nicer! 

I talked for awhile with the general manager (?) of the Graduate and he invited me back with my family - saying that it is a very kid friendly place, which is nice to to know, though I don't know that I completely believe him - my kids seem a little too crazy for such this nice, calm space. ;) I am looking forward to going back during the day, in the summer, and getting the full experience!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to check this place out for dinner. We went in on a Saturday night and arrived shortly before 8pm. The manager and servers did not greet us. When the supervisor finally noticed us she simply said, \"do you have a reservation?\". Mind you there were all empty inside and just a few occupied tables outside. She told us she would bring out menus but she proceeded to set up all of the inside tables and 10 minutes later a different person finally said hello and asked if he could bring menus. Another 5 minute wait for menus and water. When we finally ordered, one of the 4 main courses was sold out, leaving 3 choices left for a dinner menu. Our appetizer came out cold. We had a party of four and two people received their food 10 minutes before the my sister and I. This was my birthday dinner out and it was a total bust."}
{"text":"The Madison Blind was a chill place to end the night. Bar keep was a nice guy, and the waitress was attentive. You can't beat the view; Madison skyline and a direct view of the Capitol. Need to try the food next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Had a great time here with friends on Gallery Night. Enjoyed one of the best drinks in recent memory...a jalapeño-infused tequila with cucumber and watermelon. It might be autumn, but I'll still relish summer! Between the rest of our group, we tried most of the craft cocktails...multiple times :)

We had a mix of food items from the menu. The pesto hummus was delicious as were the duck-fat fries. The surprise winner, however, was the asparagus. It was so tender and perfectly grilled. Between that and the drink, it was tough to discern if it was June or October.
Weather wasn't the best on this visit, but the patio looks awesome.

Hoping the Blind finds success in this location, but I'm  also enjoying this brief period of time where it seems like a secret find. Judging from the universally-cleaned dinner and dessert plates at our table, that window is limited."}
{"text":"In Madison for a week-long seminar. Madison Blind sits on the top floor of the funky 70's-vibe Graduate Hotel. A few doors down from the campus Memorial Union, but still laid back and quiet. Madison Blind is a great place to hang out for both happy hour and dinner. Bartenders are tops all-around!  Penthouse views of the lake are spectacular, with the option to sit outside.  Next time I'm in Madison, I'll be sure to be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at the Graduate Hotel Madison this past weekend visiting from Chicago. One of the features that attracted us to this spot was the roof top bar. On Saturday afternoon, after strolling around, we decided to take a break with a glass of wine and cheese plate at The Madison Blind. 

The start was a bit rocky - the seat cushions on the patio were wet from rain (probably should have brought them inside during the storm) and there was no music on (not the best ambiance). Both minor grievances, and if that had been all I would be giving 3.5/4 stars. 

However, as we were wrapping up, a 20 something couple arrived. From the first second I saw them it was clear they were inebriated, completely and utterly inebriated. They were seated and not turned away for being over served. 

What happened next was deeply disturbing. The guy took out a stack of cash and began throwing bills on the ground and telling the young woman he was with to, \"fetch, dog.\" 

\"Fetch, dog.\" 

Yes, this is restaurant review website and not a political forum, but I'm going to take there anyway: 

Allowing this behavior in your establishment perpetuates rape culture. 
Laughing off this behavior, as the group of men that were there and apparently knew the drunk couple did, perpetuates rape culture. It's gross and upsetting and not okay."}
{"text":"My friend who lives in Madison described the restaurants downtown boasting rooftop views like Venus fly traps...the view is appealing but the food is just awful...Unfortunately, his advice was given to me after I ate at the Madison Bind.

First of all, my wife and I had trouble finding the restaurant because there are no signs outside. The only signs are in the lobby of The Graduate hotel, where the restaurant is located.

Our server, God bless her, she was very nice, but we had to ask for silverware and napkins after we were eating the terrible cheese curds.

Btw the cheese curds are terrible. They taste like balls of those store bought frozen breaded mozzarella sticks. And the dipping sauce was essentially just ranch dressing. This was disappointing, since we were in Wisconsin after all.

I ordered the $24.00 steak (what was I even expecting ordering a steak for that low price...) and it came with asparagus and duck fat fingerling potatoes. The steak was....edible...it was fine, nothing I couldn't make myself at home. The asparagus was huge, kind of gross looking. It wasn't tender. The fingerling potatoes were flavorless and soaked in some sort of saturated fat that was certainly not duck fat. The worst part of the dish was that everything was topped with this nasty green pesto-like substance that vaguely had a garlic citrus flavor. Also, everything was sitting in a pool of the oily substance that the fingerling potatoes died in. 

I felt terrible for my wife cause she couldn't even really eat her burger. Said it tasted like McDonalds. I had a fry, it was like a deep fried store bought frozen crinkle cut.

Everyone at this restaurant was a college student except one other middle aged couple. Being in a building called The Graduate, my guess is that this place is run by college students, for college students since my dinner was maybe one step up from a dorm room dinner served on a paper plate."}
{"text":"Oh geez. This is the first time Yelp has really led me astray. This place is NOT a four star establishment. Quite frankly it's probably not even a two. This is basic hotel room service food (which makes sense seeing as the restaurant sits on top of the Graduate hotel) with room service prices. It's a sterile environment with a view if you're able to snag a spot outside.

The service was some of the most lackluster I've ever experienced. I watched as servers and hosts ran around the small space frantically the entire evening, accomplishing nothing. I felt really bad for them. Everybody just seemed so confused. It honestly made for a really uncomfortable night.

The burgers are whatever. Nothing special. Their fries were served cold. I'd tell you how the cheese curds were but they never came. The food was presented haphazardly much unlike the photos already posted to Yelp. The saving grace for the evening was the white sangria, which was very tasty and made with fresh fruit. 

Pass on this place unless you're staying at the hotel. But even then there are a trillion restaurants in the surrounding area that are truly amazing. So I guess skip this altogether."}
{"text":"We decided to have a drink here last night since our friends were staying in the hotel. When we arrived at the bar at 10:15pm we asked what time they closed. Midnight. The bartender was extremely rude and grumpy as he prepared our 7 drinks. He treated us as if we walked in 5 minutes before closing. We enjoyed our drinks outside-nice view of the Capitol- but the staff was breaking down tables and closing up the entire time. We left at 11 after the bartender and 2 different servers came to remove our quarter full drinks without asking if we were finished. Despite the good drinks this was an all around bad experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic outdoor seating and views of Madison. Great service and friendly staff. 

Had the cheese curds (great) and cheeseburger (very good) and a quality local beer. 

We did have to go in search of someone to help us get seated, but we will likely be back again!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the top places to go for dinner of state street near campus. The patio is amazing, and restaurant decor is a breath of fresh air from all of the heavily college and Wisconsin themed bars/restaurants. Had to knock it down one star due to the menu change. I miss the shrimp appetizer and weekly hummus plate. However, the crispy chicken sandwich that I had this last visit was amazing. Creative presentation with the wooden board and wire basket for the fries."}
{"text":"Hard to find... We circled around the block trying to find its sign, and finally located it after asking the front desk of Graduate Hotel.

Rooftop provides great view of the lake and state st, though it would be better if located on the other side of the building. And you couldn't get the attention of a waiter if all of them are serving customers sitting inside... Good food, average beer. Ordered the Wisconsin pie, venison meatball, and cheese curds. The meatballs are my favorite, but the years living in Madison made me a little picky on cheese curds. Not bad, not top-tier either."}
{"text":"We ordered the cheese curds, crispy shrimp, steak tacos, and the venison meatballs.

All were great but the cheese curds and venison meatballs were my favorite.

We also had the Mendota martini and the Pancho villa- both also very very good. If I had to pick a fave, it'd be the Pancho villa- very flavorful."}
{"text":"This venue is amazing, you can't beat the roof top views and the quality of the food is impeccable. The restaurant it self is beautiful and unlike any other establishment downtown. The atmosphere is casual but with an upscale feel defiantly worth recommending to a friend."}
{"text":"As others have said, the rooftop is great. I'm really excited to go back in the summer and enjoy a cocktail with a good view of the Capitol. 
I split a few \"snacks\" and a burger. The cheese curds were one of the worst in Madison, but the elk poutine and burger were delicious! 

The ambiance is nice, but it was odd because we had the place pretty much to ourselves on a Friday night. I don't know if people just haven't heard of it yet or what, but like I said, it was empty..."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place for chicken sandwiches, the chicken was so over cooked it tasted like I was eating a tire. My boyfriend had the burger and enjoyed that, our waiter is the only reason I'm giving three stars. Great service, bad taste:("}
{"text":"Executive summary:  I don't get what the fuss is.  This place was meh in my opinion.  Sure the décor is classy and they have an eccentric menu but fancy digs and fancy food equals fancy prices.  They have a few options for vegetarians but do the fries really have to have duck fat?  I would have liked some fries.  Gluten free bun available for $2.  Single seater restroom clean and well stocked.

I'll start by admitting I was having an off night when I went here so perhaps that colors my review somewhat.  But given the lack of food options I can actually eat I probably won't be returning.

Yes, the interior is nice.  Yes, it has a downtown view.  Yes, they have some interesting menu options (if you eat meat) like short rib poutine and duck dumplings.  Small plates range from $7 to $12 and entrees up to $26.  The menu is small though so very limited vegetarian options aside from a salad that'll run you $8 to $12 or the quinoa burger.  With entrée options like seared scallops, braised short ribs, and skirt steak I really hoped for an equally amazing veggie option, but alas, no such luck.  Perhaps with a name like \"Madison Blind\" I should have expected that.

Service was...odd.  I was standing there with money in my hand for a while before I could catch the attention of anyone behind the bar.  And my friend had to flat out ask for service, they completely ignored her.  It wasn't very crowded either.  But once we got someone's attention the service was fair and the food was ready promptly.

The restroom was clean and well stocked but with only one toilet expect to wait in line if it's busy.

As with all downtown locations parking is a trick.  Plan on parking in a ramp and walking."}
{"text":"I had heard about The Madison Blind through college/young professional friends about a year ago as a place for drinks with a view but became motivated to try their updated menu after learning the new chef is from New York. I asked what the staff recommended and was super excited when they selected the cheeseburger and fries, primarily because I am a true sucker for any sauce with the labels \"secret\" and \"special\" attached. 

The portions were generous; the ingredients were fresh and I loved the presentation of it all (the ketchup came in a little bottle, the fries were in a mini basket and the entire meal was served on a plank). 

This will go down as one of the best burgers I have had in Madison and I'm excited to get it again, maybe next time with a side of the lobster bisque poutine. The gym can wait."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great views!! Staff was friendly and knowledgable! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Drinks are affordable, chill atmosphere. Bartender Kayla is very knowledgeable with drink recommendations and the local scenery. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The view is awesome. The Space is well done including outside. There are opportunities to improve direct sunlight. However, there is some nice delineation of seating-a nice feature. 

I had a wonderful Wisconsin white wine that was recommended by the bartender and one star is for that. It was excellent. I did not eat food so cannot judge that. 

The star rating if 4 is 1 for the wine and 3 for the place. The acoustics by the car do not lend to chat. That's what I want to do with friend at a bar. So boo on that."}
{"text":"This was the first time in my life that I wanted to leave a restaurant without getting the food I had ordered. We sat for over an hour after we ordered when we decided to throw in the towel.

In their defense they apologized profusely, boxed up the food we hadn't received yet and gave us vouchers for 2 free hotel nights. 

Still, we arrived at the restaurant almost three hours ago and have yet to eat."}
{"text":"I went there because of the scallops dish posted on Yelp. I was so disappointed in finding out that they took it off the menu. I ordered the trout dish but it was so so. There are many more nicer places in the neighborhood.  Don't go there unless you have to."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the view from this rooftop bar. Loved the variety of items offered on the menu. Tried cheese curds for the first time and loved them!  I just wasn't too impressed by the veggie burger I ordered. I liked the pretzel bun, but the burger patty itself seemed to be a little bland and wouldn't really stay together. I had to eat much of it with a fork. The portions are very big. Service is fast and friendly. If I were in Madison again I would definitely return for some late night drinks."}
{"text":"Madison had a huge need for another rooftop bar/restaurant. Thankfully, the Graduate Hotel delivered.

The Madison Blind is 5/5 for ambiance, food and service.

From the roof you can see state street, the Capitol building and Lake Mendota. It's beautiful. But when winter inevitably comes, you'll be just as happy sitting inside with the modern decor and large windows.

The menu is diverse and affordable. We really liked the cheese curds, profiterole ice cream sandwich, cheese plate and steak tacos. Very shareable. The cocktails also rock, I highly recommend the martini with gin and cucumber!

Service was friendly and accommodating. The cherry on top of a great experience.

We will be back for appetizers and drinks, dinner or maybe even a night out! I really hope this becomes a bar to throw into the rotation."}
{"text":"I attended a social event here, so we sampled their menu and everything was amazing. I'm still thinking about these tiny shrimp tacos they served! The space is beautiful, with a great view of both the lake and the capitol. I can't wait to make good use of that rooftop patio this spring and summer!

Their staff was great during our event and they have a lovely craft cocktail menu. The Madison Blind has quickly become one of my favorite spots for a drink."}
{"text":"Staff ignored us while they played on their phones. Came here about a year ago because we heard the view was good. The view is good but doesn't even compare to Eno Vino. 

Food was not good and they brought us the wrong food and didn't really offer much to fix it not that we're picky but we expect at least an apology"}
{"text":"Lesson learned - trust your gut instinct. Walking up and seeing it is a hotel restaurant gave me pause. Seeing the dark, oak, dank elevator that takes you to the 7th floor restaurant should have made me turn back. 

Came because of great recent reviews here on Yelp. Did not share the same experience. Long wait on for my drink order on a Wednesday night. When my wine came, in the same kind of cup my water came in - plastic - was dirty. Interestingly they only serve in plastic outside, I kind of get it but at least use a wine glass.

Waitress came with new glass of wine in clean cup this time and a beet salad. Problem: I ordered the caprese salad. When I told her I didn't order the beet salad she didn't have a response and just stood there and looked at me and finally said she could bring the caprese. I opted for the check and went elsewhere for a meal. 

The view was nice but didn't make up for the disappointing service."}
{"text":"Menu looked eclectic and fresh, but everything was underwhelming.  The view/atmosphere is nice and service was decent, but food and drinks left a lot to be desired.  Highlights:

1. They were already out of 1 \"medium\" dish at 6pm on a Saturday night.  Then one in our party of 10 ordered the \"last\" of the chicken sandwichs...so they ran out of chicken too? But then we saw other chicken sandwiches come out to folks that ordered after we did. 
2. The servers got confused and tried to give us another table's starters. 
3. Rose sangria was bland.  There was no fresh fruit in the glass (the defining characteristic of a sangria) and the wine tasted flat and artificially flavored. I only drank about half of it before I gave up.
4. Someone in our party had to send back the iced tea, which was over-brewed.  He said it tasted like coffee. 
5. The food flavor was not bad, but everything fell short. The freekah bowl (added chicken) had good flavor but was lukewarm and watery.  Little gem salad was mainly just iceberg lettuce and cheese.  The person in our group who had the trout liked it, but it was blackened, not just grilled as indicated. Asparagus toast was tasty but again, fell short.  The \"soft cooked egg\" on top was NOT runny AT ALL so the egg just fell off the toast and again, the meal was lukewarm.  

Overall, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped by the Madison Blind for a drink and a late dinner on a Friday night a week after UW graduation. I have no complaints! The burger I had was great, as were all the apps me and my table shared! The view was great, a perfect way to see those beautiful Madison sunsets from a different perspective. I also got a kick out of the women's bathroom - floor to ceiling covered in a plaid pattern."}
{"text":"Attended a social holiday gathering here and the bar, service & food were all so amazing! The shrimp tacos were definitely the hit of the evening and we were so impressed by the ambiance here. Everything is so quirky and well thought out. The view of the Capitol at night was absolutely incredible and I can't wait to visit during the day for a view of the lake. I was also informed that they are very kid-friendly, which is great!"}
{"text":"Great place. In town for a conference and wanted a unique place. Lots of local stuff with a gourmet twist. Beautiful view of the lake. Went at 7:30 on a Wednesday and no wait. Had local beer, friend had mixed drink with local infused liquor. Shared edamame guac- it was okay, light but nothing to die for. Ordered two small plates- crispy chicken with arugula which was perfect and fish tacos. 
Overall, would return because of the ambience, nice service and good food and local beverages. I didn't give 5 stars, because I don't unless the place was phenomenal. But I would definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Oh Wisconsin, even when you have a rooftop restaurant, you can't resist making a reference to hunting in your name. Make no mistake though, the atmosphere inside this restaurant is the exact opposite of a treestand in the woods.

This restaurant, recently renamed from The Graduate, note the computer screensavers and your credit card statement showing this old moniker, is a nice indoor/outdoor rooftop restaurant on top of a hotel just off of lower State St. We arrived with a group of five around 8:30 pm on a Saturday night and had no trouble getting seated right away. The restaurant is set up in roughly a U shape with one half of the restaurant being part of the bar and the other half split between inside table seating and outdoor bar seating.

Ordering drinks, we all agreed that their mixed drinks are well worth the higher (for being next to a college) price. My \"Madison mule\" was a tasty twist on the standard Moscow mule toning down the too-sweet flavor typical of many Moscow mules and replacing it with a more minty and tart flavor. 

After that we split the cheese plate which came with blue, Parmesan, and Gouda cheeses with a side of very delicious jam to go on top. We also went with a side of cheese curds which came in a nice ornamental fry basket. The chipotle sauce, a delightful mixture of chipotle seasoning and aioli, that comes with the cheese curds was so good we asked for two more of them to go with our fries.

A good number of us had the blind burger and were surprised by how big the burger is. Most of us also had trouble finishing it when it was paired with the duck fat fries. The fries themselves were good, but nothing earth-shattering, but they did pair well with the chipotle sauce from the cheese curds.

Overall, this is a good spot for a nice mid-scale dinner near the university campus with some well-prepared staples on their menu."}
