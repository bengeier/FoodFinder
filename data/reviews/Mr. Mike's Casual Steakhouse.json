{"text":"First off , as for the bonehead that mentioned a lack of diversity among the wait staff, I'm sure unlike Justin Trudeau appointing his cabinet the restaurant chose these people based upon their ability and qualification to do a good job, not their skin colour or ethnic background. This is a steak house trying to properly serve customers, not the Liberal party trying to pander for votes. That being said,  I noted several servers that were of an ethnic background. The service I found to be prompt and friendly. The vibe was clean and modern with a slightly rustic feel. I had a ribeye steak which was reasonably priced, prepared properly, and tasted very good. It came with ample and tasty sides. I live close so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the entire vibe of the restaurant, played a couple of board games and card games while we waited.  Staff was friendly and the good was fantastic and reasonably priced.  Will definitely be going back very soon."}
{"text":"We came here for a complimentary lunch from a friend. They are not officially opened yet so this lunch was kind of their practice. Since it's complimentary, we had to randomly pick for our appetizer and entree from a bucket. We were a party of four. The ambiance is good, it has a rustic, modern vibe to it. They have board games,  and other games for a pair or group to play while enjoying their food or waiting for their order to arrive. It could be a fun place to hang out. We got Pemberton Skins for appetizer, Lobster Salad and Montreal smoked meat sandwich with fries on the side, Mac and Cheese, and Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl. All the food is good and with good serving.  My favorite is the lobster salad. Since the staff were practicing, the service is still not par but still friendly enough. Though prob the only observation and comment that I notice is that there is no diversity when it comes to the servers. This community is very diverse,  maybe they could add that to serve the community better.  We'll come back here again to try the steak next time."}
{"text":"Very good Selection of food and drinks. Service is slow; however the place is new and they are working to improve. Staff would listen to constructive criticism. I would recommend and go again."}
{"text":"They opened only two days ago but they are doing an okay job considering most of the servers are still learning. An over all satisfactory experience. I will be back. As far as the person who reviewed this restaurant a few days ago and commented on \"diversity of servers \" was lacking, I'm not sure how skin colour affects one's restaurant experience, but I can't say I have ever given such a thing a second thought. BTW, I saw people of all shapes and sizes and backgrounds in mentioned establishment if that makes a difference?? Weird."}
