{"text":"This place got lucky I had to give a star to start writing!!! Yelp should offer a zero star rating! every time I call this place the male owner keep rushing my order and he keeps saying yeah yeah yeah what do you want everyday special like what the hell! first off I only order  from pizza wings is because it's cheap and convenient. Their service and quality is horrible!! And also the pizza becomes hard as a rock after 9 minutes no joke try it!!!!!!!

IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR NIGHT ANGRY AND WITH A STOMACH ACH THEN ORDERR FROM HERE BUT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO IS ABOUT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE  TO GO ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"This unassuming little gem is right across the street from Humber College on Lakeshore and is one of the best pizza places in the area. toppings are generous, delivery is quick and the best part... garlic crust!! If Pizza Pizza even offered this they would charge extra for it but at Pizza and Wings that's just how they roll. I'm so glad I found this place after several disappointing pizzas from Pizza Pizza and months of not even bothering to order pizza."}
{"text":"The place is called Pizza & Wings but most of the students call it Pee in Wings.

I've been going there for 3 years and I complained one time because the wings smelt like piss and not fresh at all.

They told me if I don't like it, I should find a different place.

Screw the owner, I thought we were buddies for the last 3years, what an asshole.

Their service is so garbage, never going back again."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever....hate thiS place !!! U don't know how to talk to your customers !! Specially that lady !! U can't insult your customers like that !! U r frustrated old woman !! N I'm not coming back to ur place anymore"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this joint 3 Stars is for their prices. They seriously master the faster food pyramid, where cheap and fast can't be good, in contrast to good and fast can't be cheap. 

The secret to this place is the higher you are, the better it tastes. You should try the sober challenge to see the difference."}
