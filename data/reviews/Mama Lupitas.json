{"text":"If you are looking for authentic regional flavors, Mama Lupitas is for you. Food is fresh and delicious with the right amount of spiciness. 5 starts for food and service, just beware that the location or the restaurant amanities are not top notch. My favorite dish is the Chilaquiles with eggs, but they also have some pretty good caldos (soups), and other regional dishes from southern Mexico. My recomendation is for you to explore, you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Delicious food and big portions. Delicious handmade tortillas.  Free chips and sala. Plan on coming back again. Tequila, beer, micheladas and music (not too loud) just enough for a happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best kept secrets in Glendale.   Tacos are wonderful,  tortillas are hand made, salsa is flavorsome and hot.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but inside is yummy Mexican goodness."}
{"text":"The above reviewer definitely got it right when he called Mama Lupitas the \"ultimate hole in the wall\" restaurant.  I didn't read a review on it but rather drove by it and decided to give it a shot.  Coming in, I saw it had an authentic Hispanic vibe to it.  The tables were clean and plentiful and i was promptly helped although when i went it was relatively empty.  I'm not a huge Mexican food fan so i tried the huevos con carne asade.  The steak was very good and seemed to be of high quality although the eggs were a bit on the small size portion wise.  The price was good and slightly cheaper than comparable Mexican places.  Overall the only annoyance i found was that the jukebox they have in there can get quite loud if you sit in a close vicinity to it.  That makes talking to someone quite difficult.  Thus I give this place a strong 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"i was here for the first time 4 months ago and ever since i been going here every week, the food is delicious but what keeps me coming back to this place is the rice is so yumy.........."}
{"text":"Excellent food. It's like eating homemade food.  And the handmade corn tortillas are delicious."}
{"text":"Grim strip mall outside. Bright and cute inside.  Very spicy salsa. Nice! Homemade flour tortillas. Good. Barbacoa seca. Stewed, tender and falling off the bone.  Will return to try the mole.  Update: Returned for mole, twice. 4 star mole. Very good, better than most, but not knock my socks off mole."}
{"text":"Very good food for a fair price. I like to try small local places and this fit the bill perfectly. If you ever in the area stop by you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place 0 stars. Prior to today I've been here about three times and the food was decent but the service was always mediocre. But today definitely takes the cake for the shit service. We walked in, sat ourselves, then 8 minutes later someone brings us a menu....I should mention that it's hot as hell in here and feels like their AC broke...so we look at the Menu and are waiting for them to take our drink orders, but no the TWO servers they have just keep walking by. The table next to us was there before us and they didn't even have their drinks so I knew it was going to be awhile. Another 10 minutes go by and nothing!! Worst service ever, so we get up and walk out! Do not come here unless you want to be sweating while you're eating and get mediocre service."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come here it gets better and better. Chef Ana is a great cook and the waitress Carmen makes you feel right at home. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was pleaseant, clean and very organized. They were prompt with their service and acknowlefged us when we came in. We ordered and waited about 10-15 mins for it which isnt bad consideting the freshness of my food when i got it. The tortillas were thick, hot and ripped apart like nothing. And they have Margaritas too. The nice part was that the pozole i ordered was $8 but this is more like a $11 meal with the extras i got. My husbands burrito al pastor was hot and the meat had a smokey but sweet taste to it and eating it was like eating butter; melted so easily. Add yhe sour cream and it set it off lol wonderful. So id recommend for ppl that wish to eat n actually be full. :)"}
{"text":"Yelp is the way to go! Took a shot in the dark on this place and it is amazing! Carne esada tacos and chips and salsa were great!"}
{"text":"I agree with the other posters, although it is a small place in a strip mall where you might not think about stopping it was a great place to eat and the prices were very fair.  Very friendly service and a nice authentic atmosphere :-)"}
{"text":"Sometimes books should be judged by their cover.  Mama Lupitas is in a ran down strip mall on the westside of Glendale.  The inside is small and bleak as the outside is ran down and weak.  The chips are hard and stale and not worth human consumption which is unfortunate because the hot salsa (by request, not the one they serve you) is actually quite tasty.  I had a shrimp cocktail, a chicken flauta, and a pastor burro.  The shrimp cocktail was plain-jane and rather boring.  It consisted of flavorless shrimp and mostly cocktail juice.  A good shrimp cocktail should have lots of cucumber, onion, jalapenos or serranos, cilantro, lots of lime, saltiness, spiciness...this had close to none of that.  The chicken flauta needed to be cooked longer and the chicken was also bland.  Finally, the highlight was the al pastor burro which had lots of flavor.  Great heat, good meat, & a nice proportion.  The only thing it was lacking was some vegetation.  Again, onion, cilantro, lettuce, tomatoes, something...  My companions shared the same sentiments with their meals but they'll have to give their own reviews.  The other highlight was our waitress.  Although we couldn't communicate very well she took good care of us.  She filled up our drinks non stop and was very attentive.    Unfortunately, I would not come back nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to stop here for breakfast. We became interested due to most of the reviews but unfortunately, we were disappointed. I ordered huevos con machaca and my mom had huevos con chorizo. The machaca had a gamey taste to it and the chorizo was flavorless. We sampled the menudo and that too wasn't the best. It was followed by an unusual and bad aftertaste. Something was missing on all 3. The handmade tortillas, beans and rice were good, though."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  I had tacos de tripa, and they were amazing, and huge. Couldn't finish my carne asada sope. And the horchata was fantastic as well. Little hole in the wall, but the food is the best."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, but I lovedddd it!  Steak was AMAZING!  Yes its a hole in a wall, but to my surprise i loved it!"}
{"text":"Tried their carne asada and pork tacos at the glendale food festival this past weekend. Gotta say their mest was very tasty, even the tortilla had flavor. Their salsa was very delicious and actually spicy. Will definately try them one of these days in their store location."}
{"text":"The ultimate hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Located in a shitty strip mall looking particularly unassuming, our Mexican gardener recommended this place, so I knew the food was going to be good.  It wasn't just good. It was GREAT. I had the chicken tacos. To die for. And the beans were fabulous. This is what I imagine authentic, Mexican home cooking to be like. Sadly, I've never had any, so if anyone wants to help me out in broadening my home cooking horizons, hook it up! I LOVED the food, but I HAD to take away one star for the greasiness. Ambiance isn't anything luxury for the snobs out there, but if you can get over that, it's totally worth the visit."}
{"text":"Unbelievable flavors and authenticity!!!  Was on the other side of the valley from my home with visiting family.  We were hungry for something Mexican and simple.  Located thru yelp and glad we did.  Humble restaurant and not at all flashy but worth every penny!!!  Best fish tacos in the entire valley!!  Great value and the only place I have seen that has authentic mole and chicken.  I am going to travel back across town to try the mole very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced, took 45min to get my bowl of albondigas that was really awful. The bowl was over spiced with chipotle and served 30 minutes too late. Very disappointed and was not worth the 50 Dollars we spent as a whole. I will not ever eat here again....very, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great and authentic Mexican food! Ambience is really cozy and the service is superb! I ordered the costillas and they were accompanied by home made tortillas, AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going to mama lupitas but the last 2 times j went was disappointing. I asked for more meat, I got more bone. Each time my pozole was missing items like the radishes, cabbage, etc. I usually only had a bag of limes & or a bag of lemon or chili peppers.   I love the flour tortillas though those were super yummy."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and service! The fresh home made corn tortillas are amazing! You can eat the tortillas by themselves, that's  how good they are :) Prices are affordable, the music is at the right volume and the place is clean. I would have give them a 5 stars but there was one fly bugging us lol!"}
{"text":"Far from top notch. This place had a table salsa that tasted as if it had been sitting out a bit too long. Perfect combo to go along with the stale chips. The best part? That would be when we were told that they ran out of cheese.  What a letdown! Very difficult to believe that anybody would find anything tasteful in this restaurant. This place used to be awesome until it switched ownership. Not even a slight chance I'll ever be returning to this restaurant.  Service is practically nonexistent too. Tables that came after were served before us."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the appearance of this strip mall eatery. Feels authentic as you walk through the door. We usually have to ask them to turn down one of the two conflicting jukeboxes (isn't irritation by music universal?). Which they always do with a smile. Unfortunately, they were out of margharitas the last time we visited so we enjoyed coca colas from glass bottles which come from Mexico! I am vegan and they usually are pretty helpful with custom making dishes for me. And they don't hesitate to remake a dish if the chef accidentally throws some cheese on there. It's habit I'm sure. Fairly inexpensive and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Nice little place.. Most real I have found in my area and they do a good job.  Never have been disappointed and have returned many times already."}
{"text":"Driving by I would never had stopped but Yelp said it was good so I did. Boy am I glad because that was some of the best Mexican food I've had in years. Home made corn tortillas to die for. Try this place."}
{"text":"The outside isn't impressive but it's pretty nice and clean inside. You get free chips and salsa which is a plus. Chips aren't good but the salsa makes up for it in a way. I tried the Pollo en Mole which is terrific! A little overpriced at $12 but those homemade corn tortillas are amazing. Big and fluffy. Overall it's a good hole in a wall. It is a sit down restaurant so bring that extra tip money. :)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Mexican restaurant with great food Happy Hour Nice atmosphere Loved the chicken dishes; good rice and beans Excellent carne asada Very friendly food service Local favorite"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I like it all. Don't let the westside strip mall location deter you. Get the handmade corn tortillas with whatever you order. Try the huevos rancheros, tampequeña, or camarones a la diabla. I also enjoy the micheladas (large and cold). Also a great stop if you are trekking across Glendale to watch the Coyotes or Cardinals."}
{"text":"Delisiosa comida me encanto los huevos rancheros y el café estaba muy bueno  Me gusto la atención y el ambiente"}
{"text":"I had Caldo de Pollo, delish!  Clean, not greasy or cold like Pro's Ranch Market or Food City. Maybe a little pricey, $8.95 but you get free homemade chips, tortillas and salsa.  The menu prices changed that you've seen here on Yelp. I'm going to try a different menu item next time."}
{"text":"We went one day and it was delicious we got the carne asada tacos and they were good and the carne asada burrito with red chile. All was good!!!   We went that weekend and I got the menudo and bf got the steak breakfast. ALLL was good especially the bread until... Right on the wall that we were facing a little Roach crawled across it! We told the lDy and she was like whatever and offered us to move. I told her everything was good but the roach crawling on the wall right at our table was just disgusting. Thanks roach for ruining Mama LUPITAS fora me!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Real Mexican food straight from Michoacan. will def. be back, So much i want to try.  oh & btw the playlist is a great bonus!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp and because of some of the ratings I was willing to try it. Total waste of money. First off the service was not that great she was pleasant but not very attentive. I had to keep getting her attention to bring us stuff. Me and my partner both ordered the same plate machaca with Eggs. I never thought anyone could mess that up but they proved me wrong. There was no flavor to it and I had a couple of chunks of lard. Them we ordered a menudo to share. By looking at it you could see it was watered down had no flavor and it was basically a bowl of tripe. We asked for some additional corn she came back with 1/4 cup of corn we just kind of looked at each other and we're like really. Both our stomachs were hurting after we eat so most definitely never coming back."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 5 years almost every sunday after church. Can't get tired of the amazing flavor... I've tried almost everything on the menu but some of my favorites are: caldo de res, chicharron en salsa verde, sopes"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican food, this is the p[lace. It is small but great food. Cicharones in chile verde , outstanding. I have not been disappointed with any of the dishes I have had. If you are in the west side, a must try."}
{"text":"Came here hoping to find a super authentic \"hole in the wall\" type Mexican restaurant, but the entire meal was pretty underwhelming.   First, we were the only people in the restaurant and it took about 3 minutes of us standing around for anybody to realize we were even there.   We had a pastor taco.....which was very good.....  But we also got 2 combo plates and neither of them were very good. Everything was just luke-warm and bland. Really nothing special or good. Too bad...."}
{"text":"The beans and salsa were so tasty!  Didn't care much for the enchilada. I would go here again for the price."}
{"text":"This is so good and our waitress kept us full on drinks and chips. It's the surprising hole in the wall that exceeds your expectations. Chili renellos were so good and had a little kick. Gotta have the handmade corn tortillas!!  Would definitely recommend this place!! Last time I had posole, fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"Nice carne asada tacos with a great hot sauce. Real friendly employees and a nice atmosphere. I walk in and think I am south of the border. They really do a good job."}
{"text":"I yelped this place yesterday when looking for a new lunch spot, and man the reviews are right on! This place was very good, and I am a snob when it comes to Mexican food. I tried the green chile enchilada style, and it was some of the best green chile I have ever eaten. You could taste the tomatillos right away, and there were large pieces of green chile in there...yum! Met the new owner (changed ownership about a month and a half ago), he says they have retained the same cooks that have been there for the last 12 years. Everything made from scratch...no canned! Oh yeah, the salsa that came with the chips was excellent as well! It is a pretty obscure hole in an endless series of the Glendale Avenue barrio \"strip mall\", but worth hunting it down."}
{"text":"I live in this area and I first thought it would be a descent place ..first experience Menudo was descent but overpriced ...second time came with friends only because they wanted to try it ....worst experience ever ...horrible service they ran out of bread for the Menudo...hominy was out of a can ...meat was not sorted and was all dark Menudo meat aka bad meat ....80% meat 20% canned hominy...chips were stale...I asked for new chips and was told they are the same as the others in back ...torta was dried meat..best part TORTILLAS WERE SUPPOSED TO FRESH...WHICH THEY WERE THE FIRST TIME I WENT CORN SPECIFICALLY...2ND TIME I WENT I GOT FLOWER AND THEY WERE STORE BOUGHT AND SMELT LIKE MISSION TORTILLAS!!!! WTF I won't ever go back ....note my 6 friends who joined me 2nd time ...over priced too"}
{"text":"The food was good, very nice service. The restaurant was in a bit questionable neighborhood. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"What a great find.  Ceviche and shrimp diablo are to die for.  Salsa is fresh and excellent."}
{"text":"Not much to look at outside in a grim strip mall but surprisingly the inside is clean and has a nice charm. Server was very attentive and food was served hot and quick. I had the chorizo and eggs which was maybe a little salty but the spices were spot on. The beans were as good as I have had, the rice was fresh and the grilled jalapeno along with the avocado slices were the perfect garnish. I can't wait to try more of the menu as all dishes I saw looked great! Don't let the outside scare you as the inside and food is the real deal and worth the visit."}
{"text":"Definitely a great little spot for lunch or dinner. The appetizers, some of them, are big enough to have as a meal."}
{"text":"Had breakfast , I think the hash was out of a can, scrambled eggs over cooked, hash browns & toast too crispy. Will never eat there again because their Mexican food may be along the same lines, not willing to chance it!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Mama Lupitas, because of all the wonderful reviews I have read on here. The food was fairly good; I wouldn't say it was the best mexican I have ever had, but still quite tasty. However the chips and salsa were absolutely phenomenal! The salsa was nice and spicy! The downfall was that our service was absolutely horrible! I don't know if we had a waitress who was new or just didn't care. I have read many reviews that say what great service they have received, so I understand this was rare. The waitress seemed to be in no hurry, there were only four tables in the restaurant, and still incredibly slow.   I may give this place another try sometime, but the service really diminished my experience."}
{"text":"I will definitely be returning here. The chicken enchiladas were pretty good and homage tortillas are always a plus."}
{"text":"I grew up in the west valley and have likely driven by this location numerous times in the past, never taking notice. It is my new favorite. My wife and I made the trek from Buckeye passing a myriad of place I have stopped at and called a favorite for three decades. The shrimp coctail was spectacular giving evidence of the best parts yet to come. The mole (chicken) and barbacoa exceeded every expectation. These amazing bonuses were only further highlighted with the fresh homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"On vacation from San Diego so I was hesitant to eat Mexican food as I didn't think it would compare but Mama Lupitas delivered big time! Super unassuming atmosphere but the food is top notch and as authentic as it gets."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Amazing Mexican food! Your pay for what you get. Tacos on Thursday and worth the deal."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Best tacos I've had...probably ever.  The homemade corn tortillas....the salsa..I tell everyone about this place.  If you like Tacos al Pastor, then this is a must.  Yea the neighborhood isn't the greatest, but I never had any problems.  Don't get scared by the bars in the windows and doors.  The service and patrons are nice and the food is super authentic...forget all those chain Mexican places this is the real deal my friend."}
