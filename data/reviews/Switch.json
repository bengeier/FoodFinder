{"text":"My visit to Switch was disappointing.  Despite the fact that we had bottle service booked for a large party, we were made to wait outside in the pouring rain (there is no overhang or awning) for almost 15 minutes.  I could not figure out the reason for this, as who was let in at what time seemed arbitrary.  By the time we got in, my hair was ruined, and I was soaked to the skin and shivering.  The decor of the club is really cool, with lots of exposed brick.  However, the layout leaves much to be desired. The large number of bottle service areas made it difficult to move from one place to another.  There wasn't a lot of room for dancing, which is too bad because I was enjoying the music for the most part.  The washrooms are ridiculous.  The lineup was almost 10 minutes long for three miserable stalls.    I will say that the hostess for our section was really nice, and made sure that we were well stocked.  However, after having to wait outside in the rain again for 5 minutes for re-entry after going outside for a cigarette, I decided that I was over it, and made it an early night."}
{"text":"The interior of the club is nice and it's neat that they have a bit of a lounge area in the basement mixed in with arcade games...  However... I was not fan that coat-check would not let me check-in my purse and jacket together, so I had to pay double the price. And the ~$20 cover led me to expect a lot more. Nothing all that special."}
{"text":"We were here last night.  The bar itself is nice.  Pros: The bottle service hostesses are really nice. The decor is nice.  Love the brick interior walls.  Cons: The bouncers were less than desirable, not the nicest, but I guess that's a part of the job.  There seemed to be some confusion about what list you're on.  Perhaps the communication between teams can be improved. The DJ doesn't take requests, so you're kind of at his mercy.  The security people inside acknowledged that he wouldn't take requests.  It seems he's a big Drake fan, and doesn't like the Black-Eyed Peas.  Too cool for Top 40? Also, they've put a bottle service station anywhere it could fit, so there's very little room to move around.  I guess someone had a lesson in space and profit optimization. The bottle service line (outside) is longer than the regular line. The bathrooms were also questionable.  No Chill vibe here."}
