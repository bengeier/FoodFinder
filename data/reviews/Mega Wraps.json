{"text":"Tried their chicken shawarma on a late Thursday night right before they closed. The owner(I'm assuming) was really funny & was joking with us the while time because he wanted to go home but we didn't let him.   This location is located in the food court of the Toronto general hospital, I was here visiting a family member. I was starving the whole day. Iv seen Mega Wraps before many times, but just ignored it because it didn't seem so appetizing to me. Boy, was I ever wrong? Their chicken shawarma is actually very tasty with Tzaziki sauce & feta sauce. I Was so hungry, I could've eaten another one. I wish it was maybe a tad bit bigger. They have many location here in the Burbs, now when I want a Delicious shawarma for $7 I'll know where to go. This definitely made the cut for me."}
{"text":"So, like the name says, they specialise in wraps.  Tasty wraps too.  I've had a few and they were all yummy.  A poster on the right lists the wraps that are reduced fat but you can easily customise any of them to what you want with a choice of meats, salads, pickles and dressings.  There's also a little selection of chocolate bars and a few pastries. Extra points for the entertainment value.  The first time I went I wasn't sure what I wanted and the guy promised to make me something special that I'd like.  If I didn't I could bring it back.   I liked it a lot!  Today he referred to the junior size wrap (smaller one) as \"lady size\" and to the hot sauce as lady sauce...but told us we didn't need it because we were hot enough. Wraps are pricey at around $6.50 for a small one but I'd pay an extra dollar or so for a bit of flattery and a giggle any day!"}
