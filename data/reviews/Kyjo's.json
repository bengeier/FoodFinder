{"text":"This restaurant is already in Troutman, and recently opened in Concord next to the UPS store at Copperfield where Bangkok Garden used to be.  My sister and I had dinner here tonight with a groupon.  We both got the spring rolls and sushi.  I got the Crouching Tiger roll, which was delicious. My sister loved her sushi, too.  The service was fast and friendly. I will definitely visit again  and give it high recommendations."}
{"text":"So so so good! Sushi is fresh and amazing.  Love all the creative signature rolls.  Might be my new favorite place in the Charlotte/Concord area!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, the food is uneven but can't help but go back
 I love the fried spring and cheese rolls. Recently tried the fried rice and I loved with the char coaled cook chicken. The sushi is bland and I will avoid in the future. The staff seems to care a great deals and is attentive. I will be back for the items they do well."}
{"text":"We actually planned on going to Bangkok Garden, being in the mood for something a bit different while we were in the area, and it came up with some good reviews - but when we got there, we couldn't find it, and instead ended up at Kyjo's (since it seemed to be in the same location).

The inside is sparse, to say the least. In fact, even the least is a bit of an understatement. Luckily the staff is friendly, and the food selection is solid - otherwise you might think that even Kyjo's was closed and you were just sitting in a restaurant that had closed, waiting for food that was unlikely to ever be delivered.

When it comes to the menu, it's a bit of a mix - Japanese, Thai and sushi - but all of them seem to be prepared relatively well, if not outstanding. Certainly serviceable for this part of town."}
{"text":"Service was fine and friendly, and the iced tea was good.  The soup was good too, but the pad thai was far and away the worst I have ever had.  The chicken was thin and dry, and the noodles were under cooked and tasted like a dirty grill.  

I ate here when it was Bangkok Garden, and the food was excellent.  I see that there are good reviews here for Sushi as well.  Maybe there is good food here, just not if it needs to be cooked."}
