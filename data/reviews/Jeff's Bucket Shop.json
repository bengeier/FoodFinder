{"text":"My friend was in town and really wanted to song some karaoke. We stumbled Upon this place. Very small underground place but great for karaoke. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. Also told us where to park so we did not get towed. The only complaint I have about the place is it kind of smells like a bathroom... But besides that we had a great time."}
{"text":"I hadn't been into Jeff's bucket shop in awhile. That place was probably 3-4 stars and a real unique experience. For those of you who haven't checked it out JBS has karaoke at least on Fridays if not other nights of the week and it's off of Montford near Park Road and Woodlawn. The Dj is entertaining and and the place is a total dive which I usually like.   Recently it's lost it's liquor license so it's BYOB with cooling and corking fees. No problem with that but the place reeked last weekend. Hopefully they just overlooked it that one night. Please guys keep the place smelling clean and I'll give you some more stars next time."}
{"text":"I haven't been back terribly recently, but I did go several more times since my last review and the old DJ was no longer working there. The newer DJs did an excellent job and that was my only major gripe with the place. Definitely worth checking out for a great time as long as you don't have personal space issues because it gets packed Friday and Saturday nights. But that's cool, it makes it feel like you're performing to a sold-out crowd when you do karaoke."}
{"text":"I have gone to Jeff's bucket shop at least once every other week for about 5 or 6 months. What I've noticed are weak drinks getting weaker and people only get to sing if they give a generous tip to the DJ.. I'm a teacher and can't afford to give $20 or more each time I want to sing. Tonight for example, I arrived before 10 pm and being number 15 on the list, I thought the wait wouldn't be too bad. However, I just left at 12:15 am and still didn't get to sing. I'm extremely frustrated that I go almost each week and spend money on drinks and still am not given the chance to sing at a karaoke bar. What is the point?! Why can't the DJ just go in order by who signs up? Call me crazy but that actually seems fair.."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed with this so called club.  Out with friends who are members and made to wait in a ridiculous line and treated with no respect or common curtesy.  We live in Charlotte, not New York or LA.  We have been to numerous clubs in a multitude of cities and have never been asked to wait in a secondary line as the rest of our party goes into the subterranean club.  We will not return and recommend that no one else decides to waste a weekend night on this pointless \"club\"."}
{"text":"This is the place where you can see all kinds of people....Dive, underground karaoke spot. I would go for a karaoke experience with friends as an end to your night. You can sing or listen to others (very entertaining) and maybe even do some dancing. One thing for sure: you will not be judged. Patrons of this place are in for a good time. If you want your song to be played faster, a decent tip can go a long way..."}
{"text":"I am giving Jeff's a ONE-TIME 2 star rating based on my time there last night. We have been here many times and have always had a great time doing karaoke; however, last night, I was very disappointed. First of all, the smell upon entering was very overwhelming and NOT in a good way. Jeff's should come up with some kind of ventilation system so you are not hit with awful smell. Looks like they have some new employees since the last time we were there. The DJ guy was not very good. Not sure if he didn't know how to regulate microphones or what, because it sometimes didn't seem to be turned on while singing for some, including myself. Missed the guy with the glasses and ponytail that usually DJs. He's the best!!  The bar staff are friendly and welcoming. I love the feel of this dive bar and know we will be going there again, but hopefully, it will be better next time."}
{"text":"Jeff's is an interesting little spot.  When I say little I am not speaking metaphorically - it is pretty tiny.  It is in a strip mall down some stairs behind a non-descript door.  There is a stage for some karaoke or other similar activity.  It is a good hang out spot, not at all pretentious.  They have a smattering of beers on tap.  When I was there they had 3 offerings from SweetWater, an Atlanta brewer.  Definitely a comfortable dive."}
{"text":"This place was awesome back in the day.  One of the best small music venues in town.  Its still cool, but it smells like poo.  I've only been here once in about 5 years and I had a great time.  Local rockstars that were known as The Ideal Way did a reunion show that was great.  There really weren't any great beer specials for a place that seems to be going for the dive bar theme and the stench of sewage is awful.  Ironically, they have a popcorn machine in there that does a pretty good job of covering up the smell, they just don't use it that often.  I really don't know what else to say, if there is good music I'll go back, but never am I going to say lets go grab a beer in the basement spot that smells like poo when Duckworth's is a block away."}
{"text":"Downstairs!  The entrance is on the right side of the chicken joint above it.  What a wacky little bar!  And they have friendly people that are just as weird as you are.  Great place for conversing with patrons, the bartender or just hanging out.  Dare I say this is the first true dive bar I've discovered in Charlotte.  You \"could\" dance in here if it wasn't so tiny.  It gets packed quick and then nobody can move.  I've noticed locals confusing dive bars with biker bars.  Both have their merits but  they are not the same!  Dive bars are cheap, have their own regulars and have been around forever.  Many are former speakeasies.  In the surliest of places, the bartenders drink as much as the patrons.  That's not the case at Jeff's because they run a respectable establishment.   Oh right, and biker bars have a bunch of hogs parked outside and bikers drinking inside.  Get it?!  It's pretty simple.   Where the two lifestyles sometimes intersect is at joints that refer to themselves as punk rock or heavy metal bars.  And I haven't found one of those in Charlotte just yet, but I'm still looking..."}
{"text":"Like several other reviewers have mentioned, I happened upon this place after grabbing a bite to eat at the Roasting Co.  I was with a girlfriend and we were curious as to what JBS was - so we tentatively crept down the stairs to check it out.     I like little dives that have character but on the night we were there, there were just a few regulars and we clearly didn't fit in so we didn't stick around long.  However, I think this place would be a fun stop if you are bar-hopping with your friends Montford."}
{"text":"Not so sober review #339  Dear Diary, I started drinking today in the most civilized way, bubbly with a girlfriend out of fancy, thrift store, vintage, bird bath champange glasses, oh la la la. Then went to a holiday bubbly tasting, snacks at Good Food on Montford, then all hell breaks loose.  We are walking by Jeff's Bucket Shop, my friend says, \"what's Jeff's Bucket Shop?\" Well. I don't know, I could tell you exactly where it is, but have I been there? No. So, I was like, let's go find out.  You walk down a narrow hallway with a HUGE neon lit arrow pointing to the door, OMG, you had me at HELLO!  We walk into a teeny tiny bar, with the bartender and a few patrons. Everyone is low key, but friendly. The bartender is super, super nice.  Oh Jeez, it's loaded with boys and there are some cute ones. Oh my. Yummy, little Debbie snack cakes and drink specials, nice barkeep and kaorake at 10p.  Sweet Jesus, give me the mike. but no, not even loaded with alcohol, I'm still too shy.  I might say, now don't quote me tomorrow, but right now, I love you Jeff."}
{"text":"Terrible. The owner harassed me and the bud light  bottle he handed me was already opened. What a joke. Obviously,  I left immediately upon receiving this second beer and will never return. WHAT A JOKE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT. I hope they have coming to them what they deserve, especially that bartender."}
{"text":"The List at karaoke is a lie Neo. You either pay to sing or wait for \"the 3 people ahead of you\". The good news is they have a liquor license and no detectable smell last night. To become a member is easy, fill out a form & pay a $1. As you wind down the corridor to the main room note the free popcorn machine. Yes, the place is tiny. Shockingly so.  The front man at the door and bartending staff are polite and perfunctory so don't expect a lot of chit chat. They'll get your mixed drink or beer (choices are $4 drafts or bottles ) just fine and move on to the next thirsty patron.  So the bar is really, really small. You'll easily be able to see & hear who's singing or judge the line at the bar.  If you want to sign up to sing, you need only shuffle, squish and slip through the crowd to get to the books to pick your song. If you only want to be entertained by the likes of a death metal interpretation of Miley Cyrus's \"Wrecking Ball\" you'll be all set.  The bad news is if you want to sing. I get it the karaoke hostess works for tips. But 4 different individuals up on stage 4 times each, and seeing the same off key dude 6 times in 2 hours? Total bullshit. Tip for service after you sing, not tip just to even get service. When the rest of the audience groans with the lack of participant rotation I'm not out of place to knock off stars. Don't bother looking at the list on the hostess desk, because she's going in no discernible  order, neither in the order signed up or juggling people by what they want to sing to keep the mood right. Nor in 45 minutes should one be told \"there's 3 people ahead of you\" multiple times.  Fine place to drink or watch, terrible place to sing."}
{"text":"Very cool little \"speak easy dive bar\" right on Montford drive. I still have NO idea how we all got in since you have to be a \"member\" or something like that! Maybe that's all a ruse...  Nevertheless, we came in for our (mine and Paul N's) birthdays and wanted to do some dancing after our awesome meal at Good Food on Montford.  Well we found on this is KIND OF a karaoke bar, with people KIND OF signing the songs on the sound system. Hey it didn't matter, we all had a blast!  I think I only had one drink, but someone bought it for my birthday so I have no idea what the drink prices are...I can only tell you that I had a really good time and we danced our butts off!  I definitely want to come back here.....that is, IF I can figure out the secret handshake to get back in... :-)"}
{"text":"Holy shit I love this place.  Please keep in mind that I have only ever been here after several adult beverages.  This place smells like urine, the karaoke is outdated, and its FREAKING awesome.      It's definitely a nice change to the other frat-tastic bars on Monford.  I only suggest going here if you have no expectations, plan on drinking quite a bit, and want to have a good time.  Cheers to the bucket shop!   The only basement in NC."}
{"text":"I give a solid 3 stars  Awesome beer pong table on the outside patio and there is also giant jenga.  I don't really like the karaoke because it's a lot of loud in a tiny room. So, really where I hang out is the back patio....after a few games we usually just head on to the next bar."}
{"text":"A small bar in a basement that smells like old beer and has really bad karaoke - surprisingly fun!  I am going to need to go back for a better review, but hey, I am not scared to go back....."}
{"text":"Excellent Karaoke bar... best I've ever been to.  So, let's get this straight, this place is a dive bar, there are no ifs, ands, or buts about  it. The owners (who are great btw) have made some upgrades to it, and it's a little less dingy than it was before, but it definitely hasn't moved it into the upscale category, nor however has it really killed any of the charm.  Small stage, great karaoke, the bar really gets into it. Good drink specials, PBRs are $1.50 every day (even though it isn't ever on the board) and the food is actually surprisingly good for bar food.  Only two single stall bathrooms in the joint - one for guys and one for the ladies, but its small enough that the wait is never awful. The place gets packed, but the crowd is always pretty good. Everyone seems to be there to have a good time. Punks, thugs, preps, regulars, they all come - and truth be told, amazingly, there are rarely any problems with fights or anything.... everyone is just there to get drunk and have a good time.  I can't say enough good about the place. If you want to go out for a nice dinner and have a couple cocktails - avoid Jeffs'. If you have had dinner and those couple cocktails and are feeling brave enough for karaoke, or just want to get sloshed - head on down the concrete steps, under the sign with the finger, and give Jeffs' a try. If you regret it, you did something wrong.  See you out there!"}
{"text":"The DJ is the biggest douche on the planet!  Skipping your songs after you have tipped him.  Your job is to play the songs requested.  Guy needs to be replaced.  He's detrimental to the business, and makes customers not want to come back."}
{"text":"I really love Jeff's because it's a great atmosphere, a fun place to bring friends from out of town. It can smell a little funky down there.. But overall it's a good time.   If you show up at 10 maybe you'll get to sing, but show up at 11 or 12, forget it. It gets annoying when you watch the DJ and his friends sing 5 times before other people you know have been waiting a long time."}
{"text":"Turns out, tips matter, despite the list order. Then, when you give a decent tip ($15), you have to remind the DJ you gave a tip. Fun music, loud, hoping the dj picks well."}
{"text":"Never going back here. The DJ cussed me out because I asked him why he skipped us entirely ( there were many people crossed off the list after us and there was no way ALL of them tipped him to move up). He told me if I have a problem with it then \" F*%k off b%#*h\" and gave me both middle fingers. If my husband was around I bet he wouldn't have spoken to me that way. What a coward. AND the bartender and bouncer both agreed that this is a regular occurrence!! Why does this guy still have a job???  I was supposed to get a call from the owner but of course, nothing. They don't care. They want you to spend money on drinks while wasting your night away waiting to sing a song that you will never have a chance to sing unless you pay MORE money to the DJ. And if you simply inquire or call out the DJ you get treated horribly and still have to pay your bar tab."}
{"text":"You usually can't go wrong with a place that has Birdsong on draft. This is definitely your stereotypical hole-in-the-wall dive bar but that is absolutely what makes it awesome. I visited this place for a fund raising karaoke event and had a blast. The drinks are a good price and there was a good group of 21 - 35 year olds belting out their favorite 80s tunes with a beer in the other hand. The staff there is super friendly and the entire atmosphere makes you feel like your in your best friend's basement for a house party."}
{"text":"So this bar is in the bottom of a building and if folks could go back in a time machine....lets say 1970s, this would be a VERY common type of bar in North Carolina..........hey its the south...we don't care about what it looks like...we care about what it feels like..........and Jeff's feels like a cool little bar with nice folks behind the counter in a place that looks like you went a little bit back in time.  If you want something more........you need to go somewhere else..  I tend to find Jeff's the type of bar you use to \"test\" your date to see if they are cool enough..........if they get all bent out of shape having a beer here...toss them to the curb....for the infraction of being high maintenance. *grin*"}
{"text":"This is literally a whole in the wall of a bar. Small and usually packed after midnight. It's the place were the drunks stumble to from all the other bars on Montford in order to sing Karaoke.    They have gotten their liquor license back but the smell of stagnant water & beer is still there.   they even serve food though I have never been bold enough to try it.   If you have never been, it is definitely an experience you must try, at least once. If you are young and out to party, this should be a stop on the Montford crawl."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago cause I've heard some funny stories about this place.  It was a Wed and pretty early so there was only about 12 customers there at the time.  YES this place definately has its own unique odor but be a good sport and just laugh it off as you chug that adult beverage.  There was karoke and the two I heard where quite unique themselves.   Since going I have heard recently they lost their liquour license but working to get it back.  I'd definately give it another try cause I'm sure there are some good times to be had there."}
{"text":"Cousin and I visited this spot after searching for karaoke in Charlotte.  Definitely was not what we expected, however, the bar staff were friendly and welcoming.  Karaoke set up was sub par.  There was no book available to scroll through to help one choose a song.  The three stars go to our Tenders, but I doubt if we would return."}
{"text":"*WARNING*  Only come here after 5-7 adult drinks... entering this establishment sober is not advised!  What a weird place! After walking down a flight of stairs to some shady looking hallway where i had to sign my name, I was already READY TO GO!  However, my friends wanted to stay because of the Karaoke.  This place had a weird smell with equally weird patrons as well.  Perhaps if I was drunk this place would have been awesome since the DJ was letting any and everyone on the mic but alas... I was not.  I will never go to this place again! Jeff's Bucket Shop is appropriately named as everyone that was there when i went was just about to \"kick the bucket\"  If I had 5 hands, I'd give this place 5 thumbs down!!!"}
{"text":"This may be my favorite bar on Montford. The absolute epitome of a dive.  Yes, it has an odd smell. Yes, it's not fancy at all. Yes, you should probably have a few (and by a few I mean a lot of) drinks in you before you head down the stairs here. Yes, you will have a damn good time.  I've been here with several different crews of friends. From the \"we all want to sing karaoke peeps\" to the \"we just want to people watch\" variety. No complaints... always a lot of fun.   The weekends are packed. Wait time to get on stage and pretend you're on Star Search can be up to an hour. You must either be a member or know a member to get in... not sure what the membership process is. I have a friend who is a member.  If I'm out boozing in Montford, Jeff's is a definite stop. Don't ever change JBS. You're a breath of fresh air in the land of frat-tastic-ness."}
{"text":"I love this place. The owner is nice and friendly, the atmosphere is fun and accepting with lots of characters. Perfect little dive bar :)"}
{"text":"Despite the urine-smelled walk downstairs, as the stars state, I'm a fan.  Wednesday night and I sang \"As Long As You Love Me\" with birthday girl's sister.  The beers were cheap and not people singing much bc only a few regulars on that night.  I'll definitely come back when I need to belt a few Backstreet Boys songs. Heh. Only bummer is they didn't have the song from Aladdin, \"I Can Show You The World\".   Yeah, I have off-kilter music taste, oh well.   dmo out"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night around 11pm. There was some pretty awful karaoke happening, & EVERYONE in the room was 4+shots over served. I'm not exaggerating, everyone was either drooling in themselves or falling over their own feet. It looked like an AA meeting gone wrong.   Mind you, this is coming from someone who works in the alcohol industry & knows how to drink & have a good time. This place is a shit show, & the bartenders need a lesson on how not to over serve people, because that's how car accidents & bad things happen. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I didn't even know that this place was even around!  Hole-in-the-wall dive bar that's SMALL.  But it's a perfect place to sing kareoke.  It's crowded but it's not really that bad.  Love it."}
{"text":"You walk into this little bar and feel its age. For some places, that's a negative... not here. Well-worn wood, small stage, blood red walls, its an old, classic aesthetic that immediately puts me at ease. The lingering smell of cigarettes (that will eventually air itself out after the first of the year) is no deterrent to ambling up to the bar and ordering one of the 4 tap beers they keep (guiness and harp, of course, along with blue moon and a bitey IPA) or a bottle of something else (domestics are cheap here, and they carry a SC brew I hadn't seen before). 3 TVs to watch if you want to catch a game here, but they're placed in a way that you can keep out of line of sight of 'em, if you'd like. Naked photo hunt et all at the end of the bar, if that's your thing as well (yay). Not a boutique bar, not an art bar, not a bar with any pretensions at all. Just a bar. Lovely."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the ground kinda place... you heard me, I said ground not wall, considering you literally walk down a narrow stairwell to get to the little door in order to discover this little establishment.  By the way, I do mean LITTLE, I've seen someone's bathroom bigger than this joint.  Let's be real peeps... this place is put in the \"Dive Bar\" category for a reason.  Besides, the place is called \"Jeff's Bucket Shop,\"  I seriously for the longest time don't even know of its existance... or what the heck Jeff is selling by the bucket, or if Jeff is trying to sell buckets, or who the heck is Jeff?!  So yes, there maybe a little weird smell (frankly I don't even pay attention to it, and I have a super good nose, but I do have high tolerance for \"weird smell\" courtesy of my heritage lol).  My personal suggestion is stop asking what the heck that smell is (because you probably don't want to know) and just keep drinking.  I have been here mostly on Fridays and they have karaoke.  I think they have karaoke on other nights too.  Not sure if they always have the same host, and if he is the regular, let me warn you, he doesn't play... he will gong you off that stage like you're on Apollo if you are seriously tone-deaf.    This place gets packed.  So if you have issues with being too crowded, well... not sure if you want to sardine your way into here on a weekend night.  And again, if you are the high-er maintanence type, you may want to stick with your \"safer\" choices and go next door or across the street or uptown.  But honestly, it's always a good crowd, nice people having fun together, beer isn't too expensive, and I always have a blast here."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at Jeff's Bucket Shop last night. I've heard all kinds of things about this place and I do love karaoke, so it was time to check it out. My friend told me that the experience may feel like walking into my friend's basement, and he was exactly right. It's pretty small in the bar and very crowded, and you do have to go down a narrow staircase to get inside.  When we got in - around 11pm - I immediately signed us up to sing Destiny's Child \"Say My Name.\" It looked like there were only about 6 names in front of ours, so I thought it wouldn't take long for it to be our turn. Regrettably, that was not the case. There were 12 names easily called before ours. At 12:15am, we still had not been called to belt out \"Say My Name.\" I went to look at the sign-up sheet, and it had been thrown away. Then the DJ got up there and sang a song. Womp womp. We actually left before we were called up for karaoke.  I was a little disappointed that I didn't get to do karaoke, but I did have unlimited popcorn, so maybe that makes up for it? My friend did warn me that the popcorn can be questionable because drunk people go to the bathroom, don't wash their hands, and then reach in the popcorn container. EEK. He called it pee-corn. Yikes.  I will go back to Jeff's. I just may go a littler earlier to get my name on the list and I will only get the popcorn when it's freshly popped before it becomes pee-corn."}
{"text":"I really like Karaoke, and there is just something about this dive bar that I like.  Sure you're crammed in there like a sardine, and drunk and sober people may brush past and touch you a little, so if you don't want anyone in your bubble, don't go.  But if you want to belt \"My Heart Will Go On\" or \"I will Survive\" until \"Closing Time\" well then this is your place!  Hopefully you end up singing because we all know you \"Can't fight this feeling any longer,\" so don't be afraid to let it show. Most times everyone else is singing with you and can't hear you anyway in their drunken bliss.  So grab some adventurous friends, and get ready to \"rock and roll all night!\""}
{"text":"If you're looking for karaoke, I definitely recommend checking out Jeff's Bucket Shop. To enter the bar, you'll walk down some stairs feeling like you're going into a basement--the bar is under the businesses in the plaza and can seem a little sketchy. It's absolutely a dive bar. There are no windows, it has little to no décor and a small space. That being said, they have cheap drinks that are worth the stop. It can get pretty packed for karaoke on the weekend and the crowd can be pretty rowdy--I recommend going a little earlier in the night for a better experience without having to battle for space at the bar!"}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately was blasted with the sent of urine. Was giving a pint of beer and drank 3/4 before I nearly cut my lip and realized my glass was cracked. I showed the bartender and he told me he had to charge me for a new pint regardless. Karaoke was fun but their equipment is out of date. Not a terrible experience but the whole pint thing killed it for me."}
