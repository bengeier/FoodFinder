{"text":"Very much enjoyed this sushi restaurant. A bit pricy, but I thought it was classy, both with the flair/display of their food with complimentary dishes and offering curtsey appetizers, and their miso soup was amazing! Two of us shared a 34 piece sushi boat (included miso) and had water, paid $50 after taxes and a tip. I thought the décor and music were nice, and the service was great too, we were welcomed by the entire staff upon our arrival. I did notice an odd smell, which is something that a few other reviews mention. I will definitely return, but the prices suggest not a once a week sort of place."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Did a quick internet search one lunch hour after my regular sushi place near my work caught fire. Found this place.  For a work lunch hour meal, its not too bad. The menu has a variety of different options for those craving sushi, Japanese, or Korean, and the price is about to be expected for the area.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall on the north side of Dundas, and parking is available in front. The décor is cute and simple, and the waitresses are nice. I did have an issue on one occasion where the booth smelt distinctly of urine, but on each visit there has always been plenty of other tables available. If things don't work out for you there, there is two other sushi restaurants in the same mall (one two doors to the left, and the other a few past that)."}
{"text":"KISOYA 416.233.2727 5084 DUNDAS ST. WEST I admit I don't eat fish but that doesn\"t change me from recommending this as one of the top sushi resturants in Etobicoke. I have seen alot of sushi in my days and if I were to eat it, it would be here. Fresh, wet, colourful looking fish, well rolled and lovingly presented. This is not an annex sushi joint but it's not Kaji either.  Prices reflect the better quality of ingredient and the slightly finer cooking style. Sashimi dinner is 17.95 and georgous on the table. I come for the Korean and Lunch specials. I love their KIMCHI JIGGEA (stew). (under 10.00)Good amount of Pork belly slices and a nice spice level. They bring all the little dishes when you order a koren meal and I find all  of the kimchi's( diakon cubes, napa, diakon leaf and green onion,)   I've had there to be delicious and homemade. It is a family run establishment with the same staff for years  who always have a wave and a smile for you when you return. Small staff means waiting for service sometimes but it is always worth it. I  encourage you to try their korean entrees and soup as I find extra love in those dishes. Spicy beef soup is another fav. If you are set on the Japanese side of the menu,bentos specifically,  I recommend the lunch special because  otherwise the bentos start at $15 and run to $20.95 that being said, it is a full box ( for instance, even in the lunch bento your tempura portion comes with two giant shrimp,  for dinner even more food is crammed in ) in regards to poritions. still I think the Korean side outshines the other cooked entrees( I am bored with bento's so this is more to do with me then Kisoya) BEST: LUNCH SPECIAL RUNS TILL 4 EVERYDAY THEY ARE OPEN WORST: Closed tuesdays, waiting for refills on your drink"}
{"text":"They don't do ayce here... Their sushi is alright... The dynamite rolls are good, but I've had better California rolls elsewhere. The miso soup here is really great though!!! Medium price... Not cheap"}
{"text":"This stretch of Dundas between Kipling and Islington has a lot of sushi/japanese/korean restaurants to choose from but Kisoya is the best of the bunch.  Their lunch and dinner combos and bentos are the best! Good quality sashimi, quick service and decent prices (for the burbs), what else could you ask for!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the outside - in fact, it looks exactly like every other tiny little strip-mall-esque restaurant at Dundas and Bloor.  But we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  The restaurant has a great, authentic Asian vibe: it's well-decorated without being gaudy or immature (common in small Sushi restaurants).  I would have no problem stumbling in here for a take-out lunch, or bringing a date for a casual dinner.  Service was quick, and we got a strong family-restaurant feel inside.  There are some comments about it being pricey, but I tend to order simple Sushi, which I was really surprised to find was cheap.  The Avocado, Salmon & Avocado/Cucumber rolls I ordered were all  less than $5 for a decent sized 6 pcs.  I've seen the same for $6.95 and higher in most other restaurants.  The other surprise was how huge the pieces of Avocado were in the Sushi...largest I've ever seen. That was exciting to see.  Unfortunately, the Salmon Skin I ordered wasn't very tasty - and was really hard. Disappointing. But the Avocado Rolls more than made up for it.  We'll definitely be back.  Probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"Steadfast improvement with new owners. Fresher. More creative well within the Korean canon . Home specialities never seen with encouragement and familiarity .  Pickled fun. Friendly : Charlie and Joy( she is)."}
{"text":"I always come here with my friend. The food is great and service is usually pretty good. I prefer getting sushi downtown because it's half the price and a bit better but for Etobicoke sushi, this is pretty good stuff!"}
{"text":"Weak fare. Not bad, but not good. It's fresh enough to eat and keep down without trouble, but that's all. Not inexpensive enough for what it is. Also, the room and tables could use a good clean."}
{"text":"Lots of great veg options, always fresh ingredients and everything we have tried here was great quality. Our family has been eating here for the past 8+ years and have seen a couple of changes in ownership. The food is always amazing and once in a while we get a small side on the house.  Kisoya is one of the few restaurants where my kids enjoy the food without picking at it :)  This restaurant is great for groups and families and there's parking right in front."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for dinner with a couple of friends. The restaurant did not seem very busy at all since it was an early Thursday evening. Our waitress seemed really friendly but was extremely slow.  The seating booths were very spacious and comfortable.  The server provided us with two different soups for each of us and some sort of fried ball of potato as appetizers, which we assumed is included as a service since we did not order them.  A friend of mine ordered a bento box with different types of rolls and tempura. He got a huge portion of tempura which is always good to see, but the meal was $17.99.   I got a medium sushi combo, which is 6 california rolls and 9 pieces of assorted sushi for roughly $13.   The sushi was great, definitely would love to come back. However, the service was extremely slow. We waited up to 15 minutes for our food to arrive, and 10 minutes for the waitress to provide us with our bill."}
{"text":"I give them 4 stars for their specialty rolls. Quality and taste is always consistent and my top favourites are the Kisoya roll and Black dragon roll. It may be pricier than most sushi restaurants but believe me, it's worth it. I'm not impressed with their bento dinners though, and the sushi boat/sashimi is so-so. I like the little bit of noodle soup that they serve as appetizer, I wish it was bigger!"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I've had in Etobicoke (but don't get too excited because it's still pricy). Their rice is always super fresh and their spicy mayo is actually spicy!  I've ordered: Spicy salmon roll Salmon handroll Dynamite roll  and they were all amazing! The miso soup was edible but still not the greatest. The free little appetizers they give you with your order are great."}
{"text":"Expensive with slow service I cant help to give the few sushi restaurants on this side of the city bad reviews. The fish is fresh sometimes and is really a hit or miss.   Better than the all you can eat but still a three star."}
{"text":"If you are in Etobicoke and you are craving sushi then this is the number 1 place to go!  Every kind of sushi you like will be better here.  Seriously, you can't go wrong with this place.  I have been going here for the last 5 years and I have tried most of the menu (certainly all the sushi) and I can't complain about a single thing.  If you sit down, you will get soup, salad and a nice appetizer platter to go with it.  It contains all the delicious little cold dishes you love like kimchi, bean sprouts, tofu, potatoes, etc.  If you come in for take out, then you will still be seated at a table and served something while you wait for your order - either soup or salad or something of the like.  Kinda neat if you ask me.  Anyways, if you haven't been then I certainly recommend at least checking it out once.  You won't regret it!"}
