{"text":"This is an amazing little place, a little off the beaten track in the SE (Foothills) Industrial area. I have been coming here for about five years, every time I am down in Calgary.

Must have the donair sub with hot sauce (sririacha)....it comes on the best bun EVER.  Soft but not chewy, barely holding itself together under the weight of the meat, cheese and veggies....The cheese, donair sauce, and hot sauce all sort of blend together in an amazing combination.  It is quite literally the best sandwich I have ever eaten.

The shop is only open weekdays from about 10-3 so it may be hard for some to make it, but it is worth the drive or extended lunch."}
{"text":"I love this place.
Local owners, quality food - and most importantly - DELICIOUS.
Given the reasonable price point and friendly, prompt service I can't see why anyone in the foothills industrial area would choose anyone else if they were craving a sub. 

Simply great and to a great family!"}
{"text":"Unique restaurant. Great food, great service, and a tv for entertainment. I often go here with coworkers to take our minds off work. Definitely a place to check out if you're looking for a good classic sub."}
