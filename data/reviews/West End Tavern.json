{"text":"While out running some errands the other day, I spotted this little tavern and decided that we had to stop in.  It was a good choice, with a cozy wood interior and bar full of older gentlemen (I love \"old man bars\").  Plus, it was early on a weeknight so happy hour prices were in full effect.  I ordered a Guinness, which was nearly $1.50 off the $4.25 price tag, and my dining partner had a Sierra Nevada for about $0.75 off.  Although the beer selection left something to be desired overall, the discounted prices kind of made up for it.  We both wanted to try to Vegan Dagwood, so we found another suitable option, the Margherita Flatbread, and decided to share.  Unfortunately, our server broke our hearts by telling us that they were out of some of the items on the Dagwood, so while they could make one, it wouldn't be the same.  Slightly bummed, we stuck with the Margherita Flatbread and she ordered a few tacos ($1 tacos that night).  The Flatbread was quite good!  Just the right amount of garlic oil for the base, plenty of mozzarella, tomatoes and fresh basil with a light sprinkle of parmesan on a nicely crisped bread.  Yum!  I think she enjoyed her tacos (which were nothing special, described by our server as \"ones you would make at home), but probably not enough to warrant another trip for them.    I could see this easily becoming a four star review, once I return for the Vegan Dagwood, and probably brunch.  While there I noticed a sign for weekend brunch and now after reading good reviews of it, well, I'll just have to see for myself!"}
{"text":"If this place wasn't a staple in Lakewood, it would not survive.  The food isn't very good. Definitely not fresh.  Went for brunch this time.  Oj worse than the generic kind you would buy at a grocery store.  I asked for over medium eggs, and they were barely over easy (very runny).  The bacon was rubbery.  Side note, the owner will not seat you without your entire party present. That includes just 2 people. My boyfriend was parking the car and he would not seat me until he came into the restaurant.  Not very welcoming.  The owner is lucky people come here out if habit and tradition. Not good!"}
{"text":"Really want to be a regular here it's nearby cozy and decent food ; but neglected in atmosphere...approaching entrance it looks dark and closed from outside on a weekend!; and once inside loud and a bit trashy vibe. Sorry to say; plz consider polishing up your act for evening dinner crowd...fantastic claim strip and fine wings..."}
{"text":"I really love the food (especially brunch) and prices at West End, but I have had enough with one of the bartenders here - multiple negative experiences have turned me off of this place.  The first time I had an issue with her was when my husband and I were sitting at the end of the bar for brunch. A woman and man showed up and clearly knew everyone there, so we figured out that she was a bartender there but was off that day. They offered her a table, but she said no because she wanted to wait for a spot at the bar. We were just finishing up food but wanted to order more drinks because we were watching a soccer game on TV, but she kept repeatedly making comments out loud that she wanted our spots and proceeded to put her drink directly next to my husband's hand and stood over his shoulder. We felt uncomfortable and cashed out, both of us angry that our nice brunch together was cut short by how rude she was.   Last week, a friend and I came in for mule night and the same bartender was working. I gave her a $5 for my $3 mule and she proceeded to decide that her tip was going to be $2 and NEVER gave me change and put it right in the tip can. I would've tipped her $1 as I always do (and a mule isn't a complicated drink where I would've tipped more), but apparently she decided otherwise. I commented loudly, but she was far too interested in the attention she was getting from some bro next to us to allow me to confront the situation.   You should never, ever decide what your tip is - you let the customer decide. Once I finished my drink, she could see that I pushed it forward but never came back to ask us if we wanted another round as she continued to only speak to the guy the rest of the night. 20 minutes later, thankfully another bartender came over to us who clearly didn't feel well, yet still kept tending bar as the other one spent her shift flipping her hair and giving out her number to drunk guys.   Disappointing for a place I otherwise have no complaints about."}
{"text":"For a Saturday at 11am this place was not busy at all. We walked right in and sat at an open booth. Then we waited and waited and waited. We spent approximately 1.5 hours at West End Tavern and it wasn't because the drinks were flowing. We did make one spicy Bloody Mary at the make it yourself bar which was great. The stuffed French toast was quite good as were the sausage and eggs. The service was terrible.  No excuses when the restaurant is not busy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The food is good. I had a burger/sandwich (shared/split.) there is always someone there. The drinks are cheap and the service is pretty fast.  The crowd is larger on Wednesday nights; especially in the summer. Westend is a good place to go out during the week. Low lights and 20-somethings is the hallmark of Lakewood bars on this stretch of Detroit.  No need to get very dressed up, we are locals and have to dress up enough for work. #jeansandtshirt"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the taco Tuesdays! We missed the kitchen being open for tacos (closes at 10pm weekdays). So we went to hairy buffalo bc we were really hungry (not a great experience there). West End has great service, bartenders and waitress work fast and on point. I believe it's the owner, he always either greets us or says says goodbye."}
{"text":"As someone who has come here before I am extremely disappointed and will not recommend it to anyone from now on. I'm 22 years old and from California. They did not accept my ID and would not take either my credit card or debit card as second form of ID. They asked if I had a student ID (im not a student anymore so I didn't have it). Will not be returning again, my experience was insulting and they are clearly a poorly operated facility."}
{"text":"I was kind of bummed about brunch here the other day when I went with my boyfriend. I had heard about how great it was from him, and the whole thing was just OK. My mimosa was good, but service was super slow. We were kind of off in the corner, and we waited almost an hour for our food. I wouldn't have minded too much since they seemed so busy, but there were 2 tables who sat down after us (a good 20-30 minutes), and they got their food either before us or right after us (like within 2 min of us getting ours). And then the food was cold - and we had to ask for syrup for our French toast because it was not brought out the first time. Our waitress did tell us that it was her first time working brunch, but I was still a little bummed. I am all for giving a restaurant a second chance though, so hopefully the next time I go back, it will be better and I can update this review."}
{"text":"Always great service. I love their mushroom app. Good food, great price. Perfect place to become a regular."}
{"text":"This place used to be so friendly and had great service. Came for brunch on Super Bowl Sunday to angry bartenders, shitty manager, and the worst service I've had in Cleveland. Closing my tab and gonna spend my money where folks are having a good time. Nothing worse than seeing employees argue and it looks like it's because of poor management. I noticed all of this by just sitting at the bar for 15 minutes. Never again."}
{"text":"I don't think you can top the West End when it comes to Lakewood Bars. It is everything you are looking for, plus better than average pub grub.   Their brunch is AMAZING.  My prototype Bloody Mary is vodka, tomato juice, and a stalk of celery. The West End Tavern's Saturday Morning Bloody Mary bar makes me rethink everything I thought I knew about everyone's favorite morning after alcoholic drink. This Bloody Mary bar is so fun, even those who turn their noses up at tomato juice have been known to get caught up in the fun of concocting your own crazy version. Anything you could ever imagine that someone might add to a Bloody Mary is included in the spread. In fact, a few things that I never thought about, nor even knew existed, are included. I have heard of Clamato juice, but did you know there is Beefamato juice? I couldn't tell you what it tastes like because...it just sounds gross. But you are welcome to use it if it sounds good to you. Have you ever thought about adding garlic pepper to your bloody Mary? Worcester sauce? How about starting with a Tabasco base, and finishing it off with a Zucchini garnish? Perhaps the best part of the Bloody Mary buffet are the long Bugs Bunny carrots topped with shaggy greens.   Toping off the delectability of the Bloody Mary spread is the quality of the brunch. Definitely try the French toast...who can resist French bread stuffed with cream cheese, battered, fried, and topped with berries? It looked amazing. I don't know why all French toast isn't stuffed with cream cheese. Genius!"}
{"text":"Went to this bar while visiting my friend who is a Lakewood native (I'm from Massachusetts) and was rudely denied entry and service because of my out of state ID (I'm 22). The employee, who claimed he was the owner but his attitude suggested otherwise, took one look at my ID and kicked me out, screaming at me without any sort of real explanation or scanning my ID - even cursing and placing his hand on my shoulder. I do not recommend this bar to any tourists because they don't even consider letting you in. Horrible experience and service, I'll never go back. I felt incredibly disrespected. Wish I could give zero stars."}
{"text":"Yeah i just paid $9 for a chicken quesadilla to go and upon opening the container there were 3 pieces....really 3 measly pieces c'mon."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch (3/23/14) left a lot of room for improvement. Service was horrible! Took forever to be greeted, not very inviting, and generally slow on drinks.... and it wasn't busy. Food was decent though I only got a half of a piece of toast (perhaps it fell on the floor?!). Drinks were reasonably priced. I'd recommend going to a diner for breakfast and slide over to some other bar after for Sunday funday drinks over West End Tavern."}
{"text":"Never had the food there but when I go out thats the place I wanna be.  Only negative is it can get crowdeddddd."}
{"text":"So I love the food here. I've had the grouper, black bean soup and now this awesome burger. It's called the O'Brien. It has Gorgonzola cheese, bacon and grilled mushrooms. I actually took my mushrooms raw...I'm a texture person. Oh and $2 Long Islands."}
{"text":"So I said in my last review that I would try it again, and I did! However, the rating is about the same. I just want to add a litlte more detail now that I know more!    We went for brunch and the menu is awesome. Really fantastic options - I had basically eggs benedict but with spinach and artichoke! It was so tasty! My friends had the french toast which was beautiful and really delicious becuase it came with a berry mixture. I also enjoyed my bloody mary, which was very reasonably priced! Overall, I recommend the brunch over the dinner, just based on my one time trying each.   What I enjoyed a ilttle less was the service. Our waitress wasn't awful but she was generally unhelpful. The pancakes also came out different from what the menu said - basically, the menu said they'd have the same berry stuff as the french toast but they came out with nothing on them. When my boyfriend asked, she said that was optional and can be served on the side. Not really a huge deal but a bit annoying - why not have an accurate menu? I also ordered something on the side and it just came without it altogether.. Which wasn't a huge issue but, again, just annoying. We had a few other little issues (needed water, had to explain to her how to split the check, etc.) but nothing that ruined the experience. She just was not very attentive.   We weren't thrilled with the service last time, either. I will probably go back in the future because I did really like what I ate (for brunch) and the prices were fair, I just hope they step it up a notch in terms of the staff. Sometimes food is slow becuase your kitchen is small and I get that but if I have to wait ages for my food, the least you can do is make sure that the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times. Food is good but the service was terrible. Our waitress could careless if we were there. When my wife unwrapped her fork to find food on it, the waitress exchanged it with a set from a dirty table next to us. No personality and rude at times our waitress ruined our entire experience. I'll think twice before taking anyone there in the future."}
{"text":"I have only been for breakfast a few times.  Service is has been great both times.  Great food for the price.  If you are an eggs Benedict fan I recommend the Benedict royal."}
{"text":"Brunch is great with a good selection and a cozy atmosphere.  the little guy behind the bar, Jimmy I think, was awesome; just a really nice genuine guy.  One of our favorite place in Lakewood."}
{"text":"I've never been to the West End Tavern until today for Saturday morning brunch. I was a few minutes late arriving and I found my friend standing outside with a number of other customers as they were late opening for the day.  I did the Bloody Mary buffet which was unique, tasty, and surprisingly reasonably priced. I had the steak and eggs.  It was yummy overall but the potatoes were cold.  Speaking of cold, the whole place was freezing.  It's April, you don't need to blast your fans!  Circulate if you want to, but there's no need to put your fans on high.  I will return and hopefully they'll add a star at that time!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch here was OK. We got here pretty close to 10:15 and good thing because it started to get very crowded. We ordered bloody Mary's which were VERY good. Very flavorful and spicy. My husband ordered the combo (one eggs Benedict with steak instead of Canadian bacon, and a piece of the stuffed French toast.) I ordered the Chicken an waffle. The food was not exactly disappointing but also not anything to write home about.   The Benedict was bereft of Hollandaise, and the piece of steak was tiny and dry and definitely not worth the $3 upgrade. The French toast was pretty good, as was the waffle. The fried chicken that came with my chicken and waffle (a boneless, skinless breast and a skinless leg) was quite literally the blandest I have ever had. I think I was lightly sprinkled with flour and nothing else before meeting the fryer. It was desperate for flavor and even dousing it in syrup didn't help.   I'm not sure if we'd ever return, but if so I'd probably stick to a more traditional dish like omlettes etc."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite to eat before checking out the rest of the Lakewood scene. Decided to go with the chicken club wrap. This wrap features horseradish which I glanced over before ordering. Sometimes horseradish is just too overwhelming for sandwiches and wraps but this wrap had a great mix."}
{"text":"The prices are right, the tacos were great. Happy Hour success :)"}
{"text":"Just had THEEE worst experience I've ever had in a bar!!! The bar tender ( don't have his name, he has a giant beard and wears a baseball cap)  came out and started insulting my friend( who is beautiful btw) saying she should wear her hair down and insulting her makeup, just being completely rude and misogynistic so she walked a way then with out warning he grabbed my drink  stuck his hand in it and told me I was being an \" asshole\", when I  wasn't even talking to him then told me that he owned the place, which I'm pretty sure isn't true, that he had more money than me and that I needed to \" get the fuck out\"   The real owner should make a smart business move and get rid of this guy BC they just lost customers for life   I honestly think that him making fun of my friend was his feeble attempt to flirt with her and when she wasn't in to it his ego was hurt so he lashed out like a child. He obviously doesn't respect women or customers of the place he works   NEVER EVER EVERRRRR GOING THERE AGAIN  Ever."}
{"text":"Aside from their brunch and bloody mary bar there's no reason to stop in here.  There's something about this bar that just seems to miss it's mark.  For food there's a much better option right across the street.  For drinks there's two better options just a few doors down in either direction."}
{"text":"I've only done brunch, and it has been delicious every time.   It is crazy crowded at brunch time. Seating is tight. The wait is usually not too long, and usually worth it   I usually love the frittata and I've also had the hash. Frittata is my hands down favorite.   Decor is cool. Service is ok. It's a fun option if you can time it right."}
{"text":"Its a corner bar in Lakewood.  Its comfy and cozy and serve beer."}
{"text":"Cheap beers and good food. There is a reason why this is a Lakewood staple. They have an awesome atmosphere to watch a game or just to hang out and have a drink. Sunday brunch is fantastic. One of the best in Lakewood. Stop on in for some cheap drinks and good service."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, here:  The managers of the West End are family friends of mine.  But they didn't put me up to this.  Especially since I'm going to call them out on a few finer points.  Their menu is a welcome step-up from the usual bar fare.  The salads, and yes, they have salads, are fresh and creative.  Any chicken dish is sure to please.  The soups are delicious.  I come here with my family during the dinner hour and the cacophony of most sports bars is not felt here.  The wooden benches and faux brick walls remind me of a New York City bar, but the waitstaff are all Mid-Western warmth.    But there is still room for improvement.  On a busy Saturday night, you cannot get near the bar.  It's just teaming with frat boys.  Waitstaff could and should circulate the dining area more, fill the empty glasses and just keep the area flowing.  I've also always thought that what this bar was missing - which many Lakewood bars don't have anyway - is a deck.  How great would that be?  Of course, with due respect to the neighbors, I can understand why.  But this would probably be my favorite bar with some kind of outdoor element.    If you do drop by the West End, I'm sure you'll feel all of these familiar elements, and you'll want to become a familiar face, as well."}
{"text":"What would bring me back here is the atmosphere, the ceiling, big old wooden bar and things. But we went for brunch and the food was just alright. The portions were pretty small for the price."}
{"text":"I give several stars for the mimosa presentation alone. Westend Tavern had a menu full of brunch items I would love to try like pot roast hash and frittatas, but I ended up going for the much recommended almond paste french toast with berry compote and it was really great. I would have preferred the bread a little more saturated with the french toast soak, but the other ingredients were so good, I was totally on board. And not that I needed the home fries and bacon AND sausage, but I got them with the meal and it was delicious!  The staff was also extremely nice and welcoming and I felt like they not only wanted my business, but they were happy to have me there. It's a genuine distinction sometimes...   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've frequented this bar many times late on Friday/Saturday nights, but this past weekend was the first time I've eaten there.    Let me tell you, their brunch is outstanding! When a friend and I first arrived there seemed like there was a long wait, not a single bar stool was open etc. We got there around 12, but then 5 minutes later they sat the 2 of us at a 4 person table.  I would definitely say it get's crowded but everything seemed to move fast, and then by 1 PM the place was pretty empty.    They have a very full menu, the classic eggs and hash browns, Eggs Benedict then specialty pancakes and french toast, along with a hash etc. I got a 'classic' breakfast with eggs, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns and toast.  My eggs were cooked perfectly and flavorful, the hash browns were chunked potatoes that you knew were homemade.  My friend got steak and eggs and the steak looked like something you would get out of a 5 star restaurant, not a \"tavern\" and was cooked better than I've seen most places capable of.    Not only is their food delicious, but the bloody mary's are top notch! I didn't go on a Saturday when they have the bloody mary bar - which i heard is terrific - but the pre made on I got on Sunday was perfectly made.  I just added a little pepper and I was a happy camper.    I know there are a lot of good brunch places around, especially in the Lakewood area, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I previously gave West End a 5-star Review. Unfortunately, after my last visit I doubt I'll return any time soon. Almost everything that earned it 5-stars before was still present. Unfortunately, the service experience left my friends and I absolutely furious. We arrived while the place was pretty busy on a Friday. No problem, that's what we hope for. My one friend, decided he wanted to pick some music, so he pops $20 in the jukebox (he wanted to pick a lot of music--the mood struck). Realizing we wouldn't be here for more than an hour or 2, he opted to play next with his selections.  That's where things got annoying. A couple people had played songs ahead of ours, and those songs played. Once our songs came on, unfortunately, the bartender gave the remote to one of her friends who happened to be at the bar. This guy proceeds to skip very single one of our songs before it ended. When I confronted the bartender her excuse was \"Any time someone hits \"play next\" it ends the current song\". Clearly, we knew this wasn't the case considering the songs it was skipping to were just more of our songs. If it was 1 or 2 songs, that's one thing. But, we didn't get to hear any of the songs we paid money for. The bar essentially stole $20 from us and either the bartender lied to us or just had no idea what she was talking about. My guess is it's the former--I think she's far bitchier than she is stupid. Most likely, it's a combination of both.  People play music I don't enjoy all the time. It's the nature of the beast. Unfortunately, when a business takes $20 from you and blatantly goes out of their way to avoid providing the service--well that's something I take issue with. I've reached out to the good people of touchtunes and hope to have some explanation as to how this is allowed."}
{"text":"Loved brunch here (got the French Toast) and also loved my bloody marys. The place has a nice feel to it."}
{"text":"great food, pretty good service.  don't go as much as i should since i'm within walking distance, but when i do pop in i have no complaints."}
{"text":"Blackened. Grouper. Sandwich.  idk how they do it, but for years this has been the best blackened grouper sammy you can get within a couple hundred miles at least, and the price makes it even better. just get it. you'll see."}
{"text":"I walked in to the West End Tavern and just stood there. No one welcomed me. After a minute I asked the bartender if I could just sit anywhere. She said yes. It wasn't busy (1:45 pm), and I sat in a booth. It appears the benches are decades old and not maintained, as they are cracked with torn and duct taped upholstery. It is very dark, and has confusing decor. The music was appropriate and played at a reasonable volume. I ordered the Eggs Benedict ($10.95) and coffee ($1.85). My meal was served with home fries which were pretty good. There was Cholula on the table, which made them even better. As far as the eggs, they were over done, the ham was like lunch meat, and the hollandaise was sparse. The total was $13.85, I paid with a $20, and was given six ones as change. How does the server know that I don't collect nickels? Look, it wasn't horrible, or over priced, but I am still not finding a better brunch than Jack Flaps."}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty. I sat the bar with my wife for 10 minutes and never got served. She would not even look at us. She just complained at the end of the bar about how tired she was. We walked out and spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Brunch here is awesome.  I've never had lunch or dinner but I'm eager to check it out.  On the brunch: amazing how they turn that place around from the night before.  It's actually a miracle they are able to get most of the stale beer smell out of the building by 10:00 the following morning.  Apple, bacon, cheddar omelette is killer!!!  And the home fries are redskin potatoes cooked to perfection.  Texas toast is also a great add.  I look forward to coming back"}
{"text":"The bartender we had tonight was so attentive and nice. I don't usually write reviews, but I had to because of the outstanding service. The woman, I think she said her name was Nina, was really awesome. She really puts her customers first. She asked us if we needed anything any time we looked low on drinks and what was so impressive about that was that the bar was extremely crowded. I would've been so overwhelmed with the amount of people, but she kept her cool and made sure everyone was taken care of. Will definitely come back because of this experience. It's hard to find quick and nice service in crowded Lakewood spots as everyone knows. Recommend x A MILLION."}
{"text":"There is a review from Fhr I that clearly looks like a personal vendetta. So I had to step in to help this establishment with a review. Fun, inexpensive, good food local bar."}
{"text":"I just revisited the West End Tavern for a relaxing Sunday brunch.  It's been a few years, but I'm so glad I did.  The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed.  The service is friendly and quick.  Yes, the food takes a little longer to come out, but it's worth the wait.  I usually never order french toast, but it sounded amazing.  I'm so glad I did.  My sister had \"food envy\" after tasting it.  It's stuffed with smooth almond cream cheese and topped with a warm berry sauce.  Hands down, the best french toast I've ever tasted.  While there's no bloody mary bar on Sundays, only Saturdays, the standard blood mary is spicy without feeling like you've had a spice cabinet dumped in your mouth.  This is a great Lakewood establishment which I need to remember to come to more often.  It's places like this that make me happy to be a Lakewood resident."}
{"text":"For brunch in Lakewood, this spot is pretty good. We started our meal with $5 mimosas, although there was a make your own Bloody Mary bar. The Saturday brunch menu isn't huge but enough options that everyone will leave satisfied.   The service was better than I expected, and the wait time for food was fairly short. I ordered the West End Omelette, which originally came out without the bacon or sausage. Once I asked it appeared in less than a minute. The omelette was nothing spectacular, kinda smaller than I expected. However my friend got the Bacon, Apple and Cheddar Omelette which looked amazing.   At night this bar turns into a hot spot to go out, given its location. Highly recommend for food, but I could pass going out here on a weekend night"}
{"text":"Today, my boyfriend and I decided to try west end tavern for brunch. We got there early and it's a good thing we did because it filled up quickly. The service was great. Food came quickly and was delicious. I ordered the pot roast hash and loved it. My boyfriend ordered the apple bacon cheddar omlette and it was huge and also delicious. I would definitely come back an next time try the Bloody Mary bar"}
{"text":"We went for brunch today and had such a lovely time. Our server, Athena was sweet and attentive. The food was awesome! My dad had some coconut pancakes that came with an assortment of berries on top and I had the steak and eggs. Both of us were very happy after we left."}
{"text":"I've given this place four stars for one reason.  The Sunday Brunch.  It's ridiculous.  The corned beef hash is a crazy mixed up pile of tender meat and greasy potatoes with pepper, it's the perfect remedy for last night's bad decisions.   The stuffed french toast is well coated and thick with that super sweet taste.  The filling is delicious and could be eaten by the bowlful.   Sometimes I order a mimosa when I want to feel classy.  They're strong and good. However, I haven't been to the West End on a weekend night in a long time because it did start to get too crowded for my liking (like can't move)"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time with the bartender Nick. He Let me order off the menu with a couple of hot toddies on a cold night. Would come back to see him any night! Love this guy!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I think I need to go for brunch! We went for \"taco night\" and as a taco connoisseur I was pretty bummed. The $2 coronas were awesome and the fish tacos were a fantastic concept - but there were only four pieces in a huge soft shell (not warm) with a couple sprigs of cilantro and red cabbage. I was disappointed that we tried something new and it was a fail. Next time I'll try a burger or different time of day. Bartenders were pretty and very nice, but didn't ask how the food was :-( I think she could tell we were disappointed. I'd go back for booze and brunch..."}
{"text":"Went there on taco Tuesday. 1.00$ tacos that are worth 3.00$. Great deal. Service was excellent. We will be back to check out the patio."}
{"text":"I love this little neighborhood bar! They have great specials throughout the week, good food and bartenders. My favorite time to come here is on Sunday for their brunch! They have a bloody marry buffet, delicious mimosas and an amazing brunch!   During the week it is very chill and laid back where you can find any type of people of different ages. Usually late night on fridays and saturdays can always be a toss up. Sometimes it is packed with the younger crowd and sometimes it's just busy enough to be full and still fun. Overall I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Beer. Wine. Appetizers. TVs for the game. Jukebox.   Yep that sums it up pretty well.  I came here to meet a friend on short trip and chose this place based purely on location. Needless to say we were pleased.  In my eyes, you can't go wrong with a pub filled with a satisfying bar-food menu, great beers on tap, and even some nice wine selections for winos like me.  The games were blaring and everyone was laid back and enjoying themselves and one another. Can't ask for much more than that. Great Cleveland pub!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came in on 1/18 to celebrate her birthday. I'm from out of town however multiple friends have told her that this is the place to be on a Wednesday night. First impression was that it was just another dive bar, definitely nothing fancy. It started to fill up about 11:30 pm and they had $2 'you call its' . Was kinda bummed they were out of the first 3 beers I tried  ordering, but that's more of a management issue.   When I came up to order our second round, I immediately found an open spot at the bar, there were plenty of open seats. The 2 female bartenders were busy taking shots, so I continue to wait, not a problem. However, after they took their shots, I made eye contact with both of them trying to get their attention but they continued to conversate amongst each other. Im totally down for having fun at work but being a bartender myself as well, I would've liked to atleast have been acknowledged. Customer service is key!   Overall, I had a delicious Moscow mule (not included in the special). I would come back."}
{"text":"I had a hunch I'd like this brunch a bunch! And I did!   Met up with a few friends recently for a lazy Sunday brunch. The interior is cozy, inviting and comfortable. Notes of dark wooden trim, intricately painted tall coffered ceilings & walls. Seating can be selected from intimate booths, high top tables or at the bar.   Being a bar, we had the luxury of ordering Bloody Mary's or Mimosa's.  Everyone at the table opted for the Bloody Mary's which came adorned with a celery stalk and a lime wedge. Hints of Worcestershire Sauce, Tabasco, salt, pepper and of course Vodka were all evident. Smooth yet not too spicy. An appropriate way to begin the brunch.  The menu appeared quite inspired and refreshingly creative. If you're looking for a typical bacon and eggs scrambler, you won't find that here. The menu instead offered Texas French Toast schmered with cream cheese and topped with seasonal fruit, Omelets and Frittatas of various varieties, Pot Roast Hash, Eggs Benedict with a twist (steak instead of Canadian bacon) and more.   After much debate, I chose the \"combo\" which included a serving of the Eggs Benedict with Steak along with a serving of the French Toast. Both were, well, for a lack of a better term.... AMAZING!   While the service and speed at which orders come out of the kitchen could probably use improving on, I didn't seem to mind. Yes, it took longer than one would generally be accustomed to and it was pretty busy for a Sunday, but when it comes down to it, there's really no need to be in a rush on a Sunday. That's what this day is all about. Relaxing and unwinding from a long weekend. And I can't think of a better place to accomplish that than Sunday Brunch at the West End Tavern."}
{"text":"Horrible experience on Sunday, went in with two buddy's of mine to have a few beers. Waited 15 minutes to have a server come over. (It was not busy and after 5mins I asked the bartender if we can order from her and I was told she would send someone over) there were about 10 rough looking guys at the bar that were inebriated and one came over and sat in our booth and informed us that he hates ni**ers and fa**ots. Another guy comes over and continues to corner us and try to start trouble. I know who the owner is and he was just standing there as we couldn't find our server to get out of there. We then saw the server doing shots behind the bar when she came in from ripping cigs in the parking lot. We got out without a fight but it was really close. This place used to be a good spot for good food and drinks. I will NOT go back. Service sucked and the crowd was worse."}
{"text":"Haven't been since they discontinued taco Tuesday and made a venture back with a friend because they told me it was back. Back? Well sort of, let's be honest, Not really. Ortega shells filled with 2 tiny pieces of cod, battered and fried (sizes of little shrimp) topped with some red cabbage and cilantro that were supposed to resemble fish tacos, no sauce, no nothing. They were a pathetic excuse for a taco-basically pulled the fish out and ate with the cabbage while throwing the Ortega shells to the side. If you've experienced taco Tuesday at west end a few years ago you'll know how disappointing this is. The tacos were soft tortillas that were fried in house to make them somewhat crunchy...and they were amazing. I have pictures to prove it! Nonetheless I had the beef tacos to supplement and they were equally mediocre. Hardly any toppings and that Damn Ortega shell. needless to say I'll stick to Barrio for tacos any day of the week. Thank goodness they had a margarita to make up for something."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! Went for brunch food was good but that's about it. It took about 15 minutes for a server to greet the table and that was after one of us went to the bar to get some waters......The server had walked past us multiple times. Acted like she didn't want to serve us. Had to go back up to the bar for refills. The bartender was too busy socializing with others. Food came no one came over to check on us or get refills. Will not return. Oh and the place smelled like the basement of a college house party."}
{"text":"Bumping it up a star party people.  Maybe after a few more visits it will be a fiver for me.  Searched out taco nights and this one looked the best to me.  Everything is clearly spelled out on their website so there is no bait-and-switch or servers who don't k now what the hell their talking about and don't even know the daily specials.  I'm starting to gravitate towards more tried-and-true places that have been around for a while.  The hip, new places with 20-30 something urbanites eating burgers off wood planks and sipping 9.00 bourbon drinks in mason jars make me wana slit my own throat.  People in here are a little white and preppy for me but its a happy medium.  Its like Lands End and Teva sandles have a shop right next door but I came here for food and booze.  Had beef tacos and fish tacos.  They both were so good I cant tell which one gives me bigger chub.  The fish was lightly breaded and came with cilantro and little cabbage.  Cilantro is a nice touch most places cant seem to figure out.  All sauces (spicy mayo, sour cream and salsa) all come on side so you can get as gangster as you want. The margaritas were the strongest Ive ever had as a margarita on \"special\"  you can really taste the luscious booze.  All-in-all Big Red and I ate and got saucy for about 18 bucks before tip.  The server girl said it was her last day and even after that she still was cool as hell and was genuinely nice...not vapid and looks at you like your her spending money to go out later...  Im not a prude but the people smoking right out the front door kinda sucks though.  Good thing I brought by bottle of Michael Jordan cologne from '96 to spritz on my I.O.U. sweater!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast today for the first time, the food was solid. Good portions very tasteful, good presentation. We had steak and eggs, eggs Benedict royal, and  the french toast, everything was delish.  The service was slow, and the place was dirty,  dingy, raggedy, and decrepit. Thats why im giving this place 3 instead of 5 stars. I'd be back, nevertheless!! Maybe no idk lol"}
{"text":"Brunch is delicious but from the behavior of our server, you would absolutely not think that she works for tips.  Rude.  Don't expect a bill either... She'll just tell you your total and expect you to pay up."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice for some food and drinks. Service is always good, even when the bar was mega packed for the CAVs playoffs last year. You can't beat the super cheap Moscow Mules ($2 on Thursdays) and the 40 cent boneless wings on Thursdays. Have gotten burgers there and they've always been good. Got the filet mignon there twice; the first time it was great, the second time the meat was good but they didn't have the red skin potatoes and subbed in fries (fries with filet mignon??) and didn't have asparagus and were going to sub in broccoli or some other gross veggie. Pass, and I probably learned my lesson: don't order filet mignon at the corner bar. This is a great place to just grab a drink and hang out with friends or catch a CAVs game. Crowd can be a little diverse in age, but everyone seems to be having a good time. Love that this place is pretty laid back and not one of those annoying hipster places where patrons are just a nerdfest, posing while ordering overpriced PBRs and \"craft\" cocktails."}
{"text":"Both the Cajun soup and Black Bean soup with corn bread was a phenomena! Deanna is a super awesome waitress! Thanks! We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"we stopped in for Sunday brunch around noon. our party of 4 was seated immediately. that's a big plus considering it's usually a pretty busy time at most brunch spots.   the atmosphere is nice. casual but with nice character. the painted tin ceiling is really nice.   I have to say the food was good but not great. and the service was just pretty bad.   our waitress was very very nice. it was just soooo sloooow. and there was no acknowledgment of it at all.   our server took our drink order a minute or two after we sat down and brought that out pretty quickly. then we waited for 20 more minutes before seeing her again to place our order. after we ordered, we waited 30 minutes for our food to come. so by this time we'd been there for 50 minutes just for brunch food.   I had the combo. which consisted of stuffed french toast and eggs benedict. the french toast was good. it was nicely cooked and had a nice almond flavor. but my eggs benedict was completely cold. I'm not exaggerating at all. not lukewarm. not slightly cold. completely cold. super disappointing after waiting 50 minutes for it.   maybe we just had a bad experience. I don't know. I wish I could say I'd give it another try, but I just don't think it'd be worth it. there are so many other great brunch spots in cle. maybe save west end for drinks and hanging out."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend you this place for breakfast or brunch. Their ATC and Hangover Omelette were awesome and the place was pretty laid back too. Cheers."}
{"text":"A-Ok. Never tried the brunch though- wouldn't mind coming back earlier in the day to check it out."}
{"text":"I loved this place for its proximity to my home, a good long island iced tea and a fantastic Cobb Salad.   It's always a chill atmosphere in the afternoon, when I stop for a late lunch after leaving work early. Eclectic music, good menu of bar basics. I don't often frequent Lakewood bars at night, but this place has a simple but quality menu that makes it worth stopping in during the day."}
{"text":"Day or night, this place is awesome to check out. For weekends, this is my go-to brunch place. It's one of my favorites I've been to in the area. The food is great and they offer a Bloody Mary bar on Saturdays as well as \"Mega Mimosas.\"    During the week, I'll normally be found here Wednesday nights when they offer $2 drinks from a wide list of specified options. Bring your friends and everyone can get a round for cheap. They've got other assorted deals depending on the weekday, so be sure to check them out to find out which day is best for you.  West End Tavern can get pretty crowded on weekend nights. That being said, you can expect to wait a while for a drink. I've typically seen 2 or 3 bartenders working and the bar area is not extensive. If people are hanging out at the bar, I've had times where it's taken about ten minutes to make your way to the front and wait to be served. The staff has always been nice throughout all of my visits and I'm sure the amount of people packing the place has got to be way more overwhelming for them than the wait is for me."}
{"text":"The taco night here is my favorite one in existence (besides Si Senor). Pork, fish, beef or chicken (Porks the best). Not free in Tuesday's? Well feel comfortable coming in anytime. They have a killer Cuban sandwich. Crispy fries and some seriously solid Cajun stew.   Check it out folks it's worth the stop!!!"}
{"text":"So....3 might seem low, but Yelp describes a 3-star review as \"A-OK.\" And that's fine. It fits. 3.5 perhaps? We rushed in here on a Sunday around noon to catch brunch in between softball games. It was packed, which was cool, except our only seating option was a lone table in the very back between - get this - the ATM machine, the back exit and the bathroom. We were also kind of ignored for a few minutes and were about to hit up Borderline until someone seated us. Also, the only lighting was through the windows so we were in the back in the darkness. I'm amazed our waitress remembered us.  The service was quick and reasonably pleasant (though she was clearly rushed what with the brunch crowd), the food was good and interesting (bonus points for interest!!), and the coffee refills were pretty quick. I don't love the \"tavern\" atmosphere, but I think it's cool they're doing brunch. 3 stars because it was good, but I'd rather go somewhere else for brunch where the atmosphere, the food, and the service all knock my socks off (which some in Cleveland have done and continue to do).  The boyfriend liked it more than I did, maybe because there was a huge flat screen over our heads playing some game or another. I MIGHT try it again, but repeat visits are usually reserved for places that blow my mind."}
{"text":"I usually frequent this place for their $2 \"you call it\" night on Wednesdays after Riverwood's (next door) happy hour ends. This deal brought me in the first time because I mistakenly thought the name implied that anything would be $2. However, they have a short list of drinks that you can pick from. I generally go for fireball or Sierra Nevada and am happy enough.       When I heard that West End had a fantastic brunch that I needed to try, I will say I was surprised. I would never have thought about this place as somewhere to go for good food. I finally got around to trying it today and was very pleased. I started out with a mimosa that I thought was perfect. I watched our waitress make it and she filled it mostly with champagne and then added a splash of orange juice (how a mimosa should be, in my opinion). It was even garnished with a pretty little flower. The menu was standard enough with anything from your classic egg and bacon meal to French toast to pot roast hash. I went with the pot roast hash. It was pot roast mixed with seasoned potatoes and topped with three eggs cooked your way. Potatoes and toast cake on the side. I loved this dish. My only complaint was that I ordered my eggs over easy, and they were only partially runny and somewhat overcooked. Still delicious. My boyfriend got the French toast, which was two huge pieces of bread filled with cream cheese that came with a fruit sauce on the side, as well as home fries, bacon, and sausage. It was a little sweet for my tastes, but he enjoyed it.       As for the bar itself, my one complaint would be that they had one person serving the entire place. It was not overly crowded while we were there but the poor girl was running all over the place and barely visited our table. She was also making drinks that were ordered by her tables when the bartender was not that busy.       Other than that, fantastic place for both a night out or a fabulous brunch."}
{"text":"Usually love coming to this place. Recently the bearded barback started telling the peoples he's the main manager and that we can't bring another bar stool to the bar after we bought another drink because he is \"in fucking charge of the bar and if we have an issue we can leave\" I've been coming here illegally since I was 18 so unsure of their major \"change\" since the people and the environment haven't changed. Refuse to spend my money on a place that refuses to accommodate one extra spot at the bar because the bar back can't fit between the 10 foot space. UPDATE do not write a review for this place, my friend was refused service because of my bad review."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday around 9pm, it was half full. There were available booths and chairs at the bar. My friend and I grab seats at the bar. We talked with people around us throughout the night, everyone was friendly. The male bartender was nice but his girlfriend, the other bartender, was not. It started to pick up, by midnight it was packed. I would go to West End Tavern again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice-brunch hours. I'm definitely not a west side of lakewood late night person, that's a little too yuppie for me. Anyways, I remember the coconut pancakes were good but they were served on a plank instead of a plate. So inevitably messy food got everywhere. This last time I really liked my Bloody Mary. It was perfectly spicy and super cheap.   I guess my only real complaint is that they need a hostess for brunch. Both times I walked in and waited at a table for 15-20 mins before getting any greeting. After that the service was ok."}
{"text":"I used to like coming here. I lived in Lakewood for years, and this place had a good menu and a solid staff. What changed my opinion? The music. They use a touchtone system, which carries the risk of being susceptible to customer control. After putting $20 into their jukebox to play classic rock, the bartenders chose to skip more than half of the songs I selected. I didn't choose obscure, unpopular songs. I picked high quality music, albeit not the trap house rap garbage played on the radio today. I'm a 28 year old guy who likes good tunes. They skipped through my full paid selections, 5-6 at a time, to get to new, shit selections."}
{"text":"So I used to love this establishment. When I first turned 21 my friends and I would always go to west end for $2 Wednesday's and were always there on the weekend. It's small.. play good music.. crowded but not overly.. and the bartenders are always good and fast.. and can make a mean rainbow shot. After hitting a certain age of 24 it was less going out and more 'brunching'. Their Sunday morning brunch is amazing. The staff is nice the food is awesome and so is their drinks. So when i wanted to do my birthday brunch for 15 of my girlfriends I called them seeing if they could accommodate. They said they would. I sent out the mass facebook invite and told all my girlfriends where it was. Well some people wanted to bring a friend and when i called to confirm my reservation a week later i asked if they had room for 5 more. He said no they can't handle 5 more. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 7 years and understand large parties. I even explained that we'll sit at the bar were not fancy we don't need everything coming at the same time. We just want to have a casual good time and drink mimosas. He told me he doesn't have enough staff (1 bartender/1 server) and that he doesn't want to deal with the hassle. I've been there many times on Sunday's and there is more than 1 server.  And what if the restaurant was filled with walk-ins which it usually is.. you going to turn them away because you don't have enough staff? Mind you he is telling me this 4 days before my birthday brunch on my birthday. So even if my '5' extra people were walk-ins he doesn't want to deal with it. This just sounds like he was in over his head and he told me yes when he shouldn't of.  He lost myself and 19 other ladies.. and probably some more since some of us are Lakewood residents in business. I booked my birthday brunch with someone who is accommodating and even took my reservation after i told him I booked with someone else the week before.  Really this place is a nice place to go.. just don't try to book a party.. they don't know what they can and cannot handle."}
{"text":"It's hard to argue with $2 you-call-its!  Popped in here last night for a cinco-de-mayo drink. We spotted a few clientèle sporting oversize mustaches and sombreros. While most of Cleveland ignores our sacred southwest holiday, I was happy to celebrate the Suns beating the Spurs with a Corona here :)"}
{"text":"Brunch!!! Me love brunch.  A couple of us (including fellow yelper Anisha A.) ventured to the west side to check out the restaurants. After seeing that the original restaurant we had wanted to go to down the street was closed (they didn't even have a specified time! Boo on them!), we noticed West End Tavern and decided to venture in and try.  We were seated right away at 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. Cute spacious diner, with old school booths and mirrors lining the wall. Nice, very nice. Our waitress was inpatient at first, and then proceeded to forget about us. I was about to knock off a yelp star just for her rudeness, but another waitress noticed we had no server or food (with ten more minutes left to order off the brunch menu) and she took our orders right away. Why, thank you.  Decided to not go alcoholic (so no opinion on the Bloody Marys), and just got coffee. And out came the food. One of my friends ordered off the lunch menu and got the chicken linguini. It looked okay. My other friend, the Eggs Sardoux ala West End Tavern. Also, good, with good sauce. But the winner of them all? My FRENCH TOAST.  I was ready to give this place three stars, but then I tasted the french toast. Can we say a mouthful of creamy goodness? Imagine a thick french toast stuffed with almond something and cream cheese....it was utterly amazing biting into it. Came with fresh fruit and bacon and homefries.   Yes, definitely a heart attack. But that french toast is to DIE FOR....."}
{"text":"The deals here are so good that I feel like it's almost easy to overlook any downsides. Is the food ok? Absolutely. Especially the tacos. But I don't ever find myself going out of my way to go here.   Wing night and taco night are always a solid choice.   Lower your standards just a bit and go to enjoy $2 Long Islands or $3 margaritas!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place to just go and chill. The food is fantastic. Especially Sunday brunch. They always have great drink specials so you will not break the bank when there. I believe taco night is on Tuesday and pretty good for only 1 dollar. They have a nice tv set up if you are looking to catch one of the games. Enjoyable place to hangout."}
{"text":"A lot of yuppies on the weekend nights. That is when this place is not fun. The west side of Lakewood nightlife has turned into a nightmare. Even worse, it has now progressed to a night terror. I guess I am at the point of my sad life that I only can feel welcome at a place like the Shamrock or other Madison dive bars. I guess I really am low class pond scum. The food is good. Especially the brunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sunday spots. The brunch is UNREAL, you've got to try it. Reasonably priced, great staff, and the atmosphere is fantastic."}
{"text":"West End Tavern has it all! Great food, easy on the wallet prices and a super crowd. Parnell is a super entrepreneur and great host."}
{"text":"Brunch at West End Tavern is the best! Great coffee, great food & great service!! They have the perfect amount of options and everything on the menu sounds delicious."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday Time! I'm a big fan of the West End Tavern anyway, but how could you not be drawn into $1 Tacos, $2 Coronas and $3 Patron?  Sooo...it's taco breakdown time!  Meat: Spicy, saucy and yea, sure, it's maybe a little on the low-end.  At the same time, they gave me lots.  Yay!  Shell: They have a baked shell which sort of crumbles when you eat it.  It tasted healthy too, and I'm not sure if that's good or bad?  It was different.  Let's keep with that.  Toppings: Lettuce, Tomatos, Cheese and a side of both sour cream and salsa.  No problems here!  Overall, I was very happy with my taco!  It was messy and crumbly, but for $1 I was really impressed.  I'll have to come back again! (and I'm not just saying that because of the Patron)"}
