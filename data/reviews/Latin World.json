{"text":"I went last Monday for the first time around 1030am. I saw in the Latinos magazine that they have $1 dollar tacos promotion, so I decided to give a shot.  When I ordered one taco, the server questioned why, I had to explain myself I want to try it first I like it or not. I felt uncomfortable doing that so she screamed the order to the cook \" only one, she just want to try it if she likes it\"   It was a mini taco, I was expecting that... But 2 chunks of fat/nerves on it...  My disgusting picture is attached (sorry) but I don't lie or exagerate.   I tried the sauces in my taco and gordita and love them!  The place was empty at that time, nevertheless the server urged me to pay my bill before I even finish my gordita... Very disappointed on that.  I hope management uses Yelp and acts on it. The reason I write reviews is for new customers consideration and management improvement.  I'll try their new location hoping the service is better... But won't try pastor tacos again"}
{"text":"Just ordered from Uber eats, it got here fast. I will not order again though. We got tacos and a burrito, and a tres leches for dessert. Can't say anything was good. Too salty, too greasy, lacking with fresh flavour. The cake was soggy even. I'm sure it would have been passable if I was intoxicated."}
{"text":"Casual and very authentic. Lots of menu options and if you like to cook, tons of spices and sauces you can buy to use at home. Took a while to get our food, but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"This used to be a Latin American grocery store but they've recently started serving food in the middle of the store. And it's delicious! Mostly Mexican and Salvadoran: tamales, pupusas, tacos, pozole, etc. But picky eaters beware: they rarely offer more than a couple different dishes on one day. And they don't have menus so it's not clear how much things cost... but in my experience, not a lot! Add in a guava Jarrito, cheesy Ranchera music, and pinatas for decoration, and it feels something like a Mexico City fonda."}
{"text":"I had the chicken flautas. They were some of the best flautas I've had in ages. They were like the perfect amount of crispy and spiced. I would have liked if they put tomatoes on top but the cheese/sour cream/lettuce on top was still really good. Also it was 6 for $10 which was more than I could eat.   They also carry Jarritos in pineapple which is my favourite flavour. One thing though is they don't have the twist cap like the ones from the grocery store but there is a bottle opener attached to the shelf."}
{"text":"Really good tacos at 4 for $10 (chicken, chorizo, fish, steak, pastor). The meat was delicious and well seasoned.  Came with 3 different salsas to top with and some freshly fried tortilla chips. The place is quite small so it's difficult to get a table (because it's busy, because the food is good). They also sell various grocery items (sauces, spices, etc) and sweets."}
{"text":"Amazing flavour and quality was so good, real cheese, flavoured spiced meat, baked almost crispy on the outside of Burrito. The owner cares and his partner the chef puts love into it. Thank you guys for the great Burrito. Please keep it up."}
{"text":"Very authentic, delicious and pretty affordable Mexican food. In a simple and genuine atmosphere. Primarily frequented by Mexican/Latino people, which is a good sign."}
{"text":"Super little Mexican/Latino place serving excellent, nothing fancy, honest home cooked food, a diversity of Latino groceries, and a cool little off the beaten track super friendly vibe... I really like this place... $1 Taco Tuesdays today!! What?! What could be better??  I'm going back again today!"}
{"text":"Pros  The server was nice. Prices are not super expensive. Food was tasty enough.  Cons  Serving size was quite small. So you definitely don't walk out of there full. At least not after the 4 taco dish. Menu does not contain enough of a description to really know what the items are. It made ordering a challenge. The server forgot to bring me water or a napkin. I noticed another table approaching the front counter for a napkin as well. Plus I noticed all the other table were given chips with different types of sauces which I never received from the server. It would have been helpful since the taco was a bit dry and therefore the sauce would have been nice to use.   Also you may want to have cash on you since although they take credit cards, there is no option for a tip during the transaction. The tables are squeezed in close together so definitely no room for any privacy whatsoever."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop budget Mexican place with a snack shop in the back. There's usually just one girl running the place and she's very nice. Vegetarians beware: it is pork heavy but there is veggie tamales ($3.50 each according to the menu, but who knows because I keep eating about $30 worth of food here with my friends every time). I think this is as close to authentic and low priced Mexican as you can get in Toronto. If you liked Tenoche you'll like this place. No room wasted on stupid lettuce and tomatos and sour cream or whatever white folk put in tacos these days. There is meat, onions lime and cilantro instead.  Read this: They have barbecued tripa (tripe), lengua (tongue) tacos on the menu! YES! (Those were $12)  There's nachos with zesty hot salsa with every eat in meal. The chicken pozole ($5) is super savoury with pieces of shredded chicken, hominy, chiles and jalapenos (perfect for a cold day) and the bistek and tripe/lengua tacos came with a couple globs of fat but were not offensive.   They may be in a rush, the meat may be dry, and they don't double-tortilla your tacos like some tacquerias do but you will do just fine here. There is usually a taco special or deal every day of the week by the way."}
{"text":"The real deal, latin food in a convenience store sorta vibe. (that's because it's literally this)  Highlight: $1 tacos - can't beat that  Delicious housemade sauces"}
{"text":"Got here completely by accident. Didn't even know of this place until my friend dragged me in telling me the whole way how cheap and delicious the food here is. He wasn't lying!:) They have specials every day (like $1 tacos but these are not vegetarian) and their general food is extremely cheap in relation to the size of portions!  Half of the menu carriers dishes I don't recognize by the name but all looks like a delicious mix of beans/rice/sauces/tortillas in different proportions. Note of caution: most of the food is pretty spicy and they don't really adjust it down even when they say they do. Portions are better shared between two people (seriously). You can also buy lots of stuff there as it used to be a little grocery store of Mexican specialties and they kept it (pickled cactus anyone?)."}
{"text":"This is an inexpensive and casual taco spot that can't be beat! They have taco specials daily, and their $1 tacos are only slightly smaller than their regular ones. The Hubster and I came out of here with a roughly $20 bill and were quite satisfied. The chorizo tacos are juicy and flavourful.   Service was a bit slow, but there isn't a ton of staff there, and the food is very fresh. This is definitely a spot to just sit, relax and enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"A no frills authentic Latin restaurant. The daily deals are amazing-- who can say no to $1 tacos? or 2 for 1 Pozole? The service is a little slow, but the food is worth the wait. Although I haven't bought any food stuffs from here, it also serves as a grocery store. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had such a bad experience here tonight. It was constant miscommunication with the server and the cleanliness was not good . The table and chairs had crumbs and food from the previous diners. Staff or friends of staff were randomly eating in the hallways next to the bathroom. We asked for water and we got two dirty disposable cups and a jug of water. When we asked for new cups they gave us one clean glass. We ordered two fish tacos and two veggie tacos and the enchiladas verde yet....We were served a meal of mushroom and cheese tacos and mushroom and cheese enchiladas in green sauce.  You can only eat so much mushroom and cheese! Not what we were expecting at all. The menu is part Spanish part English and I feel like the server could have done a better job making sure we knew what we were getting- and that she properly served what we requested. On a positive note, I liked the home made complimentary corn chips and the family run business mood of the place."}
{"text":"Not a nice experience. Tacos al pastor were tasteless, the salsas were not fresh, pretty old looking and tasting just old. My entry came after I finished my tacos, I ordered nachos with guacamole and they didn't have avocado so ok they brought them with beans. Again, nothing tasty to talk about it. A Pozole was brought and after a few minutes I had to ask for the toppings such as oregano, onion, salad. They didn't have coke or Pepsi which are basic drinks. Again, a big dishonour to Mexican food with these so called tacos. Avoid this place. I am giving 1 star only because the waiter was really trying her best. -"}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me 4 years before I tried this place. Burritos were much better than chipotle and the meat were seasoned very nicely with delicious rice inside too. Tacos were also great and they have really cheap weeknight specials for $1 tacos. Will def be back! Space is small but we did manage to bring a stroller in"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food north of the boarder!! So authentic and delicious, I didn't even feel like I was in Toronto !! I recommend this place to anyone wanting authentic Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  It is fantastic value and delicious food.   I sincerely may be eating lunch here 5 times a week.  Yum yum"}
{"text":"Like like like.. food tastes great.. and I had tried many of the things in the menu. I liked that I order 4 tacos, I can pick different ingredients for each. Complementary nachos to get you going while you wait (which is really not that long) is a big plus. Try the orchata or tamarindo drinks and first timers should get the tacos so they can try different things.. I personally keep getting the carnitas and chochinita.  Make sure they get your order right though.."}
{"text":"Ordered pupusas got something thicker decided to eat it. Had hair in it. Bailed and won't ever go back. Gnarly"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, salsa, guacamole. Excellent price. Nice staff. Restaurant a little sweaty on a hot summer day.  I would like to come back here soon."}
{"text":"This place is a casual, inexpensive source for great tacos right next to Lansdowne subway that is also a Mexican grocery. Tonight they had $1 carnitas tacos on special, so we got 6 of those along with 2 pastor tacos. Normally the tacos are 4 for $10. It was some of the best and possibly the cheapest carnitas I have ever eaten in Canada or the U.S. - instead of being uniform in texture like a lot of (still tasty) carnitas, this alternated between delicious crunchier bits, tender meat chunks, and flecks of rich fat. The pastor was great too, bright red and tasty. Bottles of Mexican Coke for $2.50."}
{"text":"The chicken pozole is the best. Like home made, the service is slow and this enhances the mañana philosophy of Latin America...mañana mañana ... Yet the experience is great you feel like in a real tienda."}
{"text":"Very yummy food! The small Mexican grocery store with a menu of Atlantic Mexican dishes. Great value and very tasty."}
{"text":"They had only a menu hand written on a board without any prices. I ordered the vegetarian tacos which are 3 tacos with cheese, mushrooms and lettuce. Not large. Or filling. Went to pay and they were $14! Not a good value at all, I was still hungry leaving."}
{"text":"What a great place. This has become my go to store for buying Mexican food products - fresh cheese for grilled corn on the cob, super tasty chips, treats and drinks.   I've also taken the opportunity to try their 4 tacos for $10. Super tasty, great variety served on lovely soft tacos with fresh line and salsa verde. Service is really friendly.   A true hidden gem."}
{"text":"I ordered a fish burrito, which was totally average. It was lukewarm and the ingredients didn't taste very fresh. They use rice that sort of standard yellowish, very pasty rice. I was full by the end of it but by no means impressed by the flavours. Disappointing. For the same price or less you could go to Burrito Boys or Chipotle, which at least have fresh ingreds.  Definitely an authentic \"vibe\" and a great place to pick up some hot sauces.   Might be more enjoyable for a meat eater."}
{"text":"I had the tacos and quesadillas on my first visit here and I really enjoyed it; the horchata was so good.  The price point is on point, not as expensive as other Mexican restaurants in the downtown core.  I'm definitely coming back."}
