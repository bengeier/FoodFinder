{"text":"My gf and I went here and had the Canadian chinese food menu, which consisted of food that non-Chinese people are more familiar with. I do like that aspect. Food turned out pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Chinese restaurant.   The food is not Cantonese but rather a mix of Shanghai and other regions of China.  There are a lot of innards on the appetizer menu which is a bit of a clue.

We ordered the tofu crab meat soup which was merely ok.  Tofu yes, no evidence of crab fake or otherwise.  Beef with fresh chile was good as was the ma po tofu.  The chicken in wine was tasty if you like ice cold broth with chicken.  The spicy scallop dish was a joke. Maybe 3 scallops that were sliced and diced to look like there was 12 scallops in the dish as if we couldn't tell!!  The monks delight noodle dish was also good.

The room is basically a big hall with terrible acoustics as sound just bounces off everything.  Service is standard in Chinese restaurants.  They also have a dessert menu which I do not usually see."}
{"text":"Paradise Chinese Restaurant specialized in Hangzhou and Shanghai cuisine which is not commonly found in Mississauga.

The taste is more refined and subtle with emphasis on fresh ingredients. We ended up ordering some of the \"famous\" dish that are representative to Hangzhou cuisine.

Longjing Shrimp ????($12)
Dongpo Pork ???($13)
Double-boiled old duck soup ????? ($19)

Food were all well prepared but nothing really wow me enough to come back for a repeat visit. 

Service here though friendly and the restaurant itself is spacious which is good for groups.

Paradise Chinese Restaurant is a good option if you are looking for something different from the usual Cantonese or Northern Chinese fare in Mississauaga."}
