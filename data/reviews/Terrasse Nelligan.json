{"text":"Snooty service, food is meh, wine is -- if you can believe this in a French-language metropolis -- overpriced and subpar.  If you're a local who wants to have a drink in the early evening with other office workers, go for it. If you're looking for food, wine, or even a pleasant sit on the terrace, stay away."}
{"text":"So it's a beautiful day and I'm sitting at the bar here waiting for my food. So is the couple next to us, they were here first. It's been an hour, the lunch rush is over and we are still waiting for our food. No one has stopped by to give an update, take a drink order, or just acknowledge our existence. There are too many good restaurants in Montreal to bother with this one. I think I'll head to one of them now."}
{"text":"They close when its cloudy outside even though on the website it emphasizes how they stay open rain or shine. It was around 10 C outside. When we walked in, it was super awkward. Our waiter told us we had a limited amount of time to choose what we wanted because they were closing for \"it was too cold\" although there was heaters everywhere! The whole staff made me feel so uncomfortable that I decided to leave and find a new bar. They were staring and made my guests feel as though they were laughing at us. So much for a classy rooftop bar!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch at Terrasse Nelligan on a recommendation and were thrilled we did. We were there during the height of the lunch rush, but did not have to wait long for a table. The food was excellent and our waitress, Cindy, was attentive and made the experience even more enjoyable. Cindy knew the menu well and and helped pick perfect dishes. I had the Poutine and the fries were perfect - not too crisp, not at all soggy. My wife had the Caesar Salad with pulled chicken and it was dressed and seasoned well. Cindy rushed to make sure I had a Cappuccino to go when we sadly had to leave. We are definitely coming back when we return to Montreal for another visit."}
{"text":"I did expect somewhat overpriced food considering the location and the great views it has of Old Montreal. However the food was not only sub-par, but tasted really bland and just plain bad. And the horrible service didn't help either. All in all just a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Every summer, we cannot miss the opportunity to swing by Terrasse Nelligan to soak up some sun and order their Clear Sangria made of sparkling wine, peach liqueur, white cranberry juice and lychees, or their signature Mojito.
Next time you want to have a drink while enjoying the weather, think about that stunning rooftop part of town!"}
{"text":"Drinks: great 
Food: mediocre 
Service: slow 
$$$ - pricey dinner 
Went with the review in Lonely planet that said that it was a place to come to. I even checked Yelp and saw mediocre reviews but came anyway. Service is sloooow. Drinks are great! Food is mediocre.... Couldn't order a wrap without dressing because it was pre-made. Friend had the wrap anyways and the bacon for the wrap was served on the side??? Not in the wrap??? So stick with view and drinks and bring your patience.

Should have listened to my fellow reviewers"}
{"text":"Belle vu si tu es assie à la bonne place mais le service est très très lent. 20 min pour un verre d'eau et 15 min pour la facture. De plus la liste des vins est très pauvre (3 choix de vin rouge). Le menu est aussi très limité."}
{"text":"Excellente table:

- Tartare de bison assaisonné comme il faut

- Lapin très bien préparé à la moutarde

- Dessert incroyable
Super service
Bemol:

- Quantité limite

- Prix un peu élevé"}
{"text":"Nice spot to be on the roof on a nice day. The service is good an the drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Love to come to this place in the summer! The vibe is very chill and I love the sangria! Plus its on a rooftop in Old Montreal, so the view is nice. The staff are friendly and attentive. I've tried some of their food and it's also been consistently good. would recommend if you need a place for a happy hour or just to relax with a drink in the summertime."}
{"text":"It was one of the first nice weekends in Montreal and we had heard that there were some nice rooftop restaurants open for brunch.  We arrived and sat down and were quickly surprised to find that they were not offering brunch, only lunch.  The sign in the elevator said brunch was offered from 11 to 3:30 but that was apparently just for the restaurant downstairs.  I'm honestly not sure if that's true.  We decided to eat anyway because we were starving.

We got some drinks and ordered an appetizer.  The appetizer was excellent, but that was the only positive point of the meal other than the weather and the view.  I ordered a veggie burger and it tasted / looked like a cheap patty that came out of a frozen package.  

After we ate we then proceeded to wait for what must have been at least a half hour before our bills came.  The place was filling up and our waiter looked busy but unfortunately we were tucked away in a corner that was essentially forgotten about.  The waiter was apologetic when he finally did return which was appreciated.  Overall I would definitely not return as the food was below average and the service was pretty poor."}
{"text":"This place has a spectacular view and ambience. And being part of the Nelligan, it has style and cachet.

Unfortunately, unlike the other restaurants in the Nelligan, the staff seem overwhelmed. I had instant service from the maitre D' to find me a seat (great) and then waited for 20 minutes to be served at the bar.

At the end of the night when I asked for my cheque, it was delivered with no customer contact at all... I was handed a machine by the young lady and had to navigate the vendor menus before getting to mine while she was busy doing other things.

The food here is not bad, and in my past visits the service has been earnest if strained, but tonight it was simply inadequate."}
{"text":"My cousin who attends college in Montreal recommended this to us, mainly for the view from the rooftop. Went around 2 pm on a Saturday morning. No wait for a party of 4, but the place was a bit crowded. Although it was nice to be outside on a sunny, warm day, it was really hard to get a great view unless you are one of a lucky few tables at the end of the restaurant.

Our server was very friendly, took the time to make good recommendations and bring out a special birthday treat for someone in our group. I think the drinks are probably stronger for this restaurant than the food, the white sangria was delicious. Very sweet, light, but still with a decent amount of alcohol. Out of the food that we ordered, the squid ink linguini was prob the best. The chicken taquitos were average, and my least favorite was the poutine.

Overall a great place to check out on a day with good weather, especially tourists. Probably would recommend to get drinks here vs getting dinner."}
{"text":"Didn't have much of a wait, on the 5th floor. Very hip place, quite lively and fun rooftop bar. Decent view but there's only limited sun exposure. 

A few of the other rooftop restaurants were drinks only but this place had food! A bit on the pricier end though.

Wouldn't recommend, maybe just have dinner somewhere else beforehand and hit up another Terrence for drinks only and chill."}
{"text":"Belle terrasse sur le toit de l'Hotel Nelligan qui offre une vue magnifique sur le Vieux-Montreal. Je ne suis aller que pour prendre un verre donc je ne peux parler pour la nourriture. Les cocktails sont excellents et il y a une bonne variété de vins et de bières.

Par contre, comme la terrasse est situé au-dessus de l'hotel, elle doit fermer ses portes à 22h et ce tous les jours de la semaine pour éviter le tapage nocturne et les fêtes jusqu'aux petites heures du matin. Profitez plutôt de cette terrasse en après-midi pour vous rafraîchir après une promenade dans le vieux ou pour un pre-drink avant vos folles soirées d'été."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today. Had asked to get the poached egg cooked longer. Waitress said \"we don't do modifications.\" Fine. Except the poached egg came out very very soft. So soft the egg white slid off the yolk it was so undercooked. Didn't ask for a second drink but got one. Great! But then wasn't offered anymore after that. Felt like we were being pushed out once our meal was done."}
{"text":"L'été dernier, 2 fois que mon amie et moi avons tenté de souper à cette place! On était là pour passer une belle soirée, souper et boire! Nous n'avions aucun problème d'attendre pour se faire placer! La première fois, l'hôtesse nous a fait comprendre qu'il n'y aura pas de place! La deuxième fois, l'hôtesse nous a demandé d'attendre sans prendre nos noms, mais elle ne nous a jamais installé à notre table.. elle a même fait passer des personnes qui étaient derrière nous, alors qu'elles n'avaient pas réservé et qu'elles étaient 2 également! Un niaisage qui a duré 25 minutes où l'hôtesse nous ignorait complètement pendant qu'on attendait calmement! On a même tenté de savoir si on pouvait donner notre nom et elle nous a dit pas besoin! Elle nous a même dit d'aller attendre proche du bar (encore là, c'était plein) et qu'elle viendra nous chercher, alors qu'elle ne l'a jamais fait! On aurait vraiment voulu essayer la terrasse, mais l'accueil a été complètement désagréable... je vous recommande d'aller ailleurs!"}
{"text":"Excellente expérience à montreal! Je vous le conseille vivement. The place to be. D'abord un accueil canadien hyper sympa: chaleureux, simple et hyper attentionné. Une vue sur notre dame a couper le souffle et de l'autre côté, vue sur les apparts de l'expo 67. 
Au menu, pour les goûts de tout le monde: du Fingers food au plats classiques et aussi du typique québécois. Ambiance jeune mais pas guindés, hype mais pas prise de tête. Bref, allez y. Soirée inoubliable et super sympa pour votre séjour dans cette belle capitale remplies d'optimistes et de belles personnes bienveillantes."}
{"text":"Great view, cool vibe and convenient if you or a friend are staying at the hotel.  The only downside is it gets way too busy in the summertime."}
{"text":"La vue est super ! J'y retournerais pour la vue et pour passer du temps sur une terrasse. La nourriture ne ma pas spécialement impressionnée. Par contre, leurs cocktails sont super bon (j'en ai pris un avec du litchi) ! Le service était bien."}
{"text":"Super fun, nice view, hot people everywhere and a sangria to die for... come here and dance!"}
{"text":"Dans mon top 3 desplus belles terasse à Montreal ! Le nelligan est un incontournable pour prendre une bonne biere pendant une apres midi chaude dans le vieux port ! 

La vue sur la basilique notre-dame donne vraiment un cachet special à ce bar ! De plus , si vous en avez la chance le restaurant verses en bas est très bien aussi !"}
{"text":"Great rooftop over looking old Montreal but I didn't get the def leopard and ACDC (love'em, but wrong enviro) the tap beers were running through clean lines so quality draft was no problemo:)"}
{"text":"I must mention I have never been to this rooftop at Night, and let me tell you around 9:30 pm - nothing meets perfection like Nelligan. We stopped by because I was charging my phone at the front desk and decided to grab a drink while waiting. The lights, the vibe, the view of the old Port, with a chilled glass of Rosé made me proud to say this as the signature spot of Rooftops in Montreal.  Comparable to Chicago standards - finally! As Chicago is known for some of the best rooftops! Hotel Nelligan is definitely deserving of the best title for customers service, ambience and class."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks! The rooftop is amazing! Must try the haloumi grille and, the Paloma drink, it's delicious!!! And ask for Alexis, best waiter, so helpful, attentive, and kind. I will definitely be recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"Une des plus belle terasse du vieux-mtl selon moi. Les gens sont beaux. La vue sur le fleuve est superbe. Choix de cocktail pour tous les goûts. Quelques choix de plats. Mais bref, idéal pour allez prendre un verre entre amis , en couple ou en date!"}
{"text":"Awesome View,Great service,Love this Place When I'm Visiting Canada.
I'm a Fan"}
{"text":"While on a girls trip to Montreal, we stopped into Terrace Nelligan at the Nelligan hotel for some roof top drinks since we were in the Old town area.  It was a Sunday night around 7:00 pm.  We had no trouble getting a table which was surprising since in NYC where we are from, it is impossible to get seating on a rooftop on a really nice night.  They have a lot of different cocktails and we tried a couple that were all very good.  I would recommend this place for a drink on a nice night.  I didn't try the food so can't give any feedback on that."}
{"text":"The VS is a cool place to hangout prior to the dinner hour. The rooftop bar is cool and and the prices are fair. Patrons can get a little young on holiday weekends but I've never seen any problems there."}
{"text":"While shopping in Old Montreal we stopped and had lunch here. We shared the chips Maison (house made chips), Tataki De Thon Fume (smoked ahi tuna), and salade. While dining we had a beautiful view of Old City and the St. Lawrence River. Their staff provided excellent service and the drinks and food were great! The weather was also beautiful before the rain settled in. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Okay so being honest here, I heard amazing reviews of this place and I was super excited to try it. We arrived at 3 and were told we could sit at the bar until we could be seated and we were also told the kitchen would open at 4. Mind you my friend and I were starving, so we waited patiently at the bar and had the white sangria (lychee one)  which was so delicious I had to have two. Fast forward to being seated at 3:45, we were eagerly awaiting being ready to order. We were reassured several times that we would be able to order at 4, until 4 o'clock came around and they decided to close the kitchen due to very very light drizzle in the weather. I was so frustrated because not only had we been sitting there for An hour waiting for the kitchen to open, we were reassured SEVERAL times that the kitchen would DEFINITELY open. 

It's seriously a shame because I'm sure the food would've been divine otherwise."}
{"text":"OK so I have been these four tresses Nelligan, William Gray, Place D'Armes, and Sur L'Auberge. 
They are all within 5min walk of each other and all almost the same, I wonder if they are operated by the same company? 
Here is my dilemma, the settings are great for all of them nice view and good ambiance, the food and drinks however severely lacking especially for the price! So I am ranking Neligan as the best (4 stars maybe) - best drinks and ambiance! The other 3 all get three stars because...15 dollars a drink and it tastes like they poured a premade cocktail mix... and the food is very lacking $20 dollar lobster role on a chewy dry hot dog bun with little scraps of lobster claw! Although I should say that the drinks and bartender quality is better at Neligan and so is the ambiance!
I will post the same review for all four places."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday, the first nice day of the year. Even acknowledging that they just opened the service was absolutely a disaster. The waiter took about 25 mins to bring out three drinks and that was after a 15 minute wait to even order. I should note that the patio wasn't even that full. The drinks (2 old fashioneds and a maple ginger ale) were not made well with the old fashioned running short on bitters. 

After that it was another 15 mins of trying to flag someone down to get our bill eventually requiring me to go to the bar and speak with the manager who offered no apologies for his staffs awful service in order to compel him to let us pay his restaurant. Needless to say despite the nice patio I don't think I'll ever return."}
{"text":"First time on the terrasse, had a great experience, the view was amazing and the food !! Thank you to our waiter Jason for the great service"}
{"text":"Amazing view - visited Montreal for the first time and were looking for an exact rooftop to have a couple of drinks/appetizers at night. The drinks were at reasonable prices, the servers were nice and friendly. The place has more of a local less touristy atmosphere that we highly enjoyed."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Montreal celebrating his birthday. We ended up hearing about the Terrace Nelligan from another couple we met. We were staying a block away from Notre Dame so it was a short walk for us. The views from the terrace were beautiful and we really enjoyed the mini tarragon mango lobster rolls(although there could've been about more lobster meat in them), and some cocktails. Our server, Cindy was great! At one point it started to drizzle and she quickly had us move over to a covered bar seat. She also gave us a great list of places to go for brunch, dinner and cocktails from a local's viewpoint! She was very friendly and the service was great. I would recommend anyone staying in Montreal visit this rooftop bar to enjoy a different view of Notre Dame and enjoy some yummy food and drinks!"}
{"text":"It's on a rooftop. How do you get up there? Enter from the hotel and it's 5th floor. 

It's a gorgeous view of the river and Vieux Port. The cocktails are priced well around 13 CAD. The sangria Claire was refreshing after spending hours in the sun.

The food and service was okay. My friends got the fish tacos and I had the sky burger. Apparently you could only get the burger well done, which i found surprising.
Even though it was well done, it wasn't dry and it was seasoned well. It was a busy Sunday evening and it took our server a while to get back to us to take our order, which wasn't a issue. She seemed rushed the whole time. 


I would return for drinks on the rooftop after dinner or before dinner-somewhere else.

Location, ambiance and views are a 5. Food- 3 stars."}
{"text":"A must go if you are a tourist in the area.  Views are incredible.  Food is very tasty and drinks were good.  Pasta was delicious and my husband loved his burger."}
{"text":"Love the view, atmosphere, everthing about it! Went here on my last night in Montreal and it was well worth it. Drinks are a bit more pricey, so I wouldn't blow all my money here. This is a cute place to bring a date, friends, or going solo."}
{"text":"What a great place to have a cocktail! I didn't eat here, but the food looks really good as well. Great service and a fantastic atmosphere overlooking Old Montréal..."}
{"text":"Perhaps my experience was uncommon but the service (or lack thereof) from our waiter was enough to ruin the entire meal when my boyfriend and I went last month. I've had subpar service before and that's fine, I don't get riled up over it (especially since his coworkers were picking up the slack just fine), but this time it was so uncalled for and inexplicable (since he was serving and engaging with every other table in his section) that it made me feel super shitty.

Huge disappointment because I was looking forward to trying this place out and the food was pretty decent, but if that's how you're going to treat some of your patrons, that's messed up. I only regret not bringing it up to management at the time, but wanted to get out of there as fast as possible."}
{"text":"Exceptional place! The best avocado toast in Montreal. They accommodated a large group at the last minute and were amazing. 

Alexis is the best!"}
{"text":"My experience there was the best. I went on a Monday night around 9, it was busy but we found a table for 2 right away, as it was a week day. The staff is surprisingly really welcoming and patient, and gave me the best lychee drink ever!!! The view is stunning. If youre looking for a cool rooftop for a girl night out or a date, that will definitely do the trick!"}
{"text":"We were wandering around Montreal looking for a spot to grab a drink and I suddenly looked up and saw people on the roof.  I immediately knew where I wanted to go lol.  

We weren't quite sure how to get there, but inquired at the hotel below who sent us straight up through their elevators.  At ~11:30am on a Saturday this place was getting busy, but we happily found 2 spots at the bar.  

We both settled on cocktails and I found the bartenders to be more than helpful.  They helped me narrow down my choice and I selected an Ice Wine cocktail.  I was even more pleased when I saw the bartender sample my drink before giving it too me, that was good bartending! 

Didn't eat anything, as we were headed elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"Superbe terrasse dans le Vieux-Port (mon endroit favori de Montréal) ! Sérieusement, déjà qu'être sur une terrasse c'est génial, imagine ce que c'est si elle est sur un toit!! Gé-ni-al.

Je n'ai pas manger, alors je ne peux juger que l'ambiance et l'alcool! Eh bien, l'ambiance est super et l'alcool est en grande quantité! Le seul hic, le bar ferme à 11heures, alors je te conseille d'y aller plus tôt à défaut de te faire mettre dehors :) !

On y retourne c'est certain!"}
{"text":"I took my mom here for mother's day because I heard the view was amazing. We were not deceived, as the rooftop bar overlooks the st laurent river. I didn't try their drinks but the food was delicious. My mom's salmon and my steak were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ambience-wise...there's no way to be this view.  What a perfect place to wind down the day especially on a nice night!  It gets super busy, but they take reservations Sun-Tues evenings.  

Fun cocktails...I had the clear sangria...sweet and refreshing!  

We only had appies (meat and cheese platters) - they were pretty standards. But hey, are we REALLY here for the food??!"}
{"text":"We read about this rooftop bar in Old Montreal, so we had to check it out.  Bar is above the Hotel Nelligan, and we went there on a Sunday afternoon for drinks.  Can't say much about the food but seemed like the patrons were mostly getting burgers?

The view from Verses Sky was great.  We saw Notre Dame on one side and the port from the other.  Service was decent, and the drinks were pretty good.  I got the Thé Glacé (vodka, orange juice, and tea) and the Splash Royal (champagne, Grand Marnier, vodka, and strawberries), and both were very nice to drink on a warm day.

This is definitely a place to go if you want to take it easy from the busy streets of Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Pros: Great view, Great atmosphere
Cons: Subpar food

-Ambiance- 
This terrasse is located in Old Port and offers beautiful views of Montreal. The service is good and a bit inattentive at times but it works out if you're here for a date. Seriously, bring someone  here on nice summer evening and have a couple of drinks, you will not regret spending all that money. 

-Food-

Charcuterie: Nothing special at all. The board included different selections of meats with olives, slices of baguette, mustard. 

Sangria: Ordered a pitcher, 4 drinks in I thought it was spectacular, it was most likely just good. 

-Overall- 
After all the touring in Old Port, you should definitely come for a drink with good company and take in the beautiful cityscape of Montreal; it will be money well spent. Great ratings go for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Crowded and bustling, this rooftop bar pulls it off. Tables rotate pretty frequently and we had no trouble finding a seat on a busy summer Friday evening, service was prompt and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Didn't try the food, but a nice place for a drink at the end of the day..."}
{"text":"Duplicated business entries in Yelp make me notify continuously the moderators that they need to fix them. Verses Sky also exists as Terrasse Nelligan, but the real name is the the second one as per my recent research and I hope those two will merge into one entry soon. 

Four stars for the awesome view of this roof top bar located in Nelligan hotel and its clear sangria with litches. All the drinks were good, only the Old Fashioned was surprising with its muddled chunks of orange instead of finely peeled orange strip, but the drink was not on the menu and they fixed it for our table. As the terrace is certainly associated with the hotel bar Verses I'm sure they can get some bar tender advices on this fine drink (they know how to make strong and well balanced cocktails in Verses bar).

We had cheerful and happy service during our last visit, and overall great time. Wonderful spot to stop for a drink and snack in the Old Port of Montreal!"}
{"text":"Nice space. Hidden away from the streets below. Good service. Just had drinks. They had a bit of a moth problem though."}
{"text":"This was a disaster! The watery cocktails should have been an indication to how the apps and dinner would go. The cheese and meat plate was warm and tasted as though it had been left out too long. The shrimp bites were translucent and under seasoned. The BBQ chicken taquitos were inedible and tasted as though they marinated the chicken in chef boyardee sauce. So gross. An all around waste of money!!!!"}
{"text":"The main reason to come here is to enjoy the beautiful rooftop terrasse and great ambiance and energy it has to offer. This is honestly what brings me back here , its such a nice spot to enjoy the beautiful summer weather and a nice cocktail in a comfortable , fun and lovely setting in the old port of Montreal. They serve both alcohol and food, but this isn't really the place to come for dinner or a meal really. I've received pretty decent service each time I've been here, but while efficient they're not very friendly, not rude but just not too friendly, I don't ever recall even a smile, they seem a little overwhelmed at times , this may be why.  The prices are a little on the higher side for drinks but the cocktails I had were refreshing and well prepared (my go-to choices here are the bourbon lemonade and raspberry mojito). Its honestly a great place to stop in for a drink before or after dinner and/or to grab a small bite at the same time. You'll get a great view (both in daylight and at night) and a really fun atmosphere, just be warned its definitely pricier than a regular lounge/bar but I honestly always have a great time when i'm here and I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I love a good terrasse and since my boyfriend and I had coupons for free drinks we thought we'd give it a try.   It comes with great views of Old Montreal.  The terrasse alone makes this place worth visiting.

The clear sangria is definitely a must try when visiting here.  They garnish it with grapes and litchees and it's quite strong.  They also have a small food menu so if you're hungry you can grab a bite.  I went for the ribs and they were tender with a strong meat flavour in that the sauce wasn't overpowering everything.  The coleslaw that they came with was a little boring but that was the only part that kind of disappointed.  The fries were crispy and salty.

The prices are a little high for alcohol but the cocktails are fairly strong and I guess it is Old Montreal so that is to be expected.  The service was also quite good.  It was quick and our server was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My favorite place thus far in Montreal. Don't be stupid, come here. It's located in the best area and the atmosphere is amazing. The lobster poutine was the best dish I've had in Montreal and quite possibly in the past few months. Our server Alexis was incredible and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and make incredible recommendations. The bartender Jordan made incredible cocktails. You must see this place if you come to the Old Port of Montreal. It is a must go stop!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor bar.  Food looked and smelled good but I didn't actually try it.  I would have given it 5 stars but the bartender was NOT friendly at all.  However, the view and the ambiance earned every other star.  Don't worry if it's a little chilly, they have outdoor heaters that work pretty well.  Still, you might want to have a jacket just in case."}
{"text":"Nice view, friendly service and yammy cocktails, the combination of all three makes it a perfect place for after-work drinks or to meet your summer date for pre-dinner drinks.

It is a little pricey than your usual local lounge bar, but the location and atmosphere will compensate for that. Our service was very nice and attentive, even when it got a little busier. Definitely a cool place to try for your next mid-week evening out."}
{"text":"Great classy bar for a view of Old Montreal but nothing special. We stood at the bar and had some cocktails while meeting some cool people. If you want a rooftop bar, this bar will work!"}
{"text":"We hit a lot of terrasse bars on our visit to Montreal. This one was just OK. Hotel Nelligan looks like a great place to stay. Really cool lobby. The permit laws seem to be a mixed bag in Montreal. Some places let you have drinks. Some places let you order a drink and a snack. Others require that every single person order food in order to be sat at a table. Nelligan is the latter. We luckily found some room at a high top in the bar area. The view wasn't particularly stunning. The ambience wasn't particularly great. The drinks weren't particularly special. It was a nice place to check out. Nothing special per se."}
{"text":"Open air and nice view of the St. Lawrence River and the riverfront. Service was great and the drinks were fine. The music however was hip-hop and didn't quite match the beautiful view. So he decided to just have cocktails there until we couldn't tolerate the music anymore and then we went downstairs to have a quiet dinner at the hotel restaurant"}
{"text":"L'an passé, j'avais vu les beaux parasols rouges de Verses Sky (qui est la même chose que Terrasses Nelligan) et je me suis dit, que dès qu'il ferait chaud cette année, je m'y retrouverai pour aller prendre un verre. Me souvenir de l'endroit a été un peu plus difficile cette fois-ci parce qu'avec un été arrivé beaucoup plus tôt que normal, les parasols n'étaient pas sortis, donc la terrasse difficile à trouver à partir du sol! L'endroit comme tel est pas mal beau et c'est le fun de se retrouvé dans un recoin un peu café qui est vraiment en plein milieu du Vieux. Par contre, le service a vraiment pris du temps (10 minutes avant de commander et 30 minutes pour nous servir un verre de vin et 2 mojitos) puis nos consommations n'étaient pas si géniales que ça. Mon rosé était tiède comme si la bouteille n'avait jamais été dans le frigo, et bien qu'un des mojito était bien, l'autre ne goûtait pas une goûte d'alcool. En plus, au départ in s'était trompé et on nous avait emmené un mojito virgin, donc on a l'impression de se l'être fait donner quand même. Il y avait une différence notable entre les deux. Et 2 dollars d'extra pour 3-4 framboises dans un mojito? J'aime mieux aller au marché et m'acheter au casseau au complet à ce prix là."}
{"text":"We had a very unpleasant and very short visit to Terrace Nelligan. To start with, the reception of the hotel informed us the last order was at 10; however the waitress insisted their last order was at 9:45 and was pressuring us to order. We placed an order for salad with dressing and tempeh on the side, a soup and two drinks. The waitress wasn't able to understand the concept of dressing on the side and claimed it couldn't be done. Upon asking her why, she said she would check - a completely unnecessary exchange as every restaurant understands \"dressing on the side\". 
After we placed our order, it started to rain. The staff took their own sweet time to put up the awning while we were getting wet. When we asked if we there was any way they could release the awning, a rude waiter (called Guillaume) told us to get inside if we wanted to get dry. We asked for his name and he refused to give it to us, saying he didn't have a name and we weren't the boss of him. Rude, unnecessary and unprovoked. 
Because of this we asked for the manager and told him to bill us for he drinks and cancel the rest of our order as we wanted to leave, Guillaume replied saying \"get out\". Needless to say, we left. 
We informed the manager of his rude behaviour and told him we were leaving. He said ok and that he wouldn't charge us for the drinks. 
Luckily the staff in the reception of the hotel were more helpful and were appalled at the way Guillaume behaved with us. Hope something is done about this horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Wow pour le feeling de manger sur le toit , pour le moment c'est la seule terrasse sur le toit dans le vieux port qui offre un dejeuner brunch. La bouffe correcte et la vue superbe."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for brunch! It feels like you are really in vacation. Two of us got the lobster poutine which unfortunately had super undercooked potatoes and only a few tiny pieces of lobster. The ambiance and drinks made up for it though! It would be a great place for a brunch date"}
