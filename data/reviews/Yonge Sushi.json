{"text":"we ordered from the all you can eat sushi  menu. simply put, we have had better all you can eat for sure. the food selection is limited, yet it charges what i call \"industry standard price\"."}
{"text":"Friends recommended this place to me, so I decided to have a try. Although it's the first time I went there, it has became my favourite japanese restaurant in Toronto!

Excellent service! Staffs are super nice and friendly! When I just entered the restaurant, a female staff came to greet me and introduced their services like dine-in, take out and delivery. Then a male chef came out to greet me and recommended the most popular food and chef's special in their restaurant. After I ordered food, all staffs serve food, fill water/tea, even just pass-by are nice and with nice smile.

Excellent food! Sashimi are fresh, I tried salmon, tuna, white tuna, red snapper, mackerel, and sweet egg sashimi. Favourite one is white tuna, really yummy! Rolls are creative and special that only available in their restaurant, such as Snow Cone roll. Other rolls like dynamite roll, dragon rolls are also yummy and taste a lot better than rolls in other japanese restaurants. Appetizers and grilled food are also excellent! Food were fresh and very hot when they came, even I need wait for a few mins before putting them in my mouth lol. I tried shrimp, crab meat, squid tempuras, chicken cutlet, and deep fried scallops as fried food. All of the them are crispy and really good. I also tried salmon teriyaki, mackerel teriyaki, and salmon necks as grilled food. Mackerel teriyaki is little bit over-cooked I  think, salmon teriyaki is okay but it's dressing sauce is really good. Salmon necks! My favourite hot food in their restaurant. It's not too oily or too dry, the salmon meat are tender, match with its tasty dressing sauce, oh PERFECT! The best salad I'd like to recommend is seafood salad, green vegetables in the bottom, seafood slices on the top, including salmon, tuna, crab meat, mackerel, etc. perfectly match with lots of dressing sauce lol! 

Different from big japanese restaurants that are large, splendid, but busy and noisy. It looks simple and not that busy, but it's quite and feel comfortable to enjoy the food. And severed by nice and friendly staffs, feel warmer than eating in big restaurants (easily ignored by servers lol), just like eat at home! :)"}
{"text":"I found Yonge Sushi after searching up on Yelp for some AYCE sushi joints in the area. 

The wait staff is super friendly! I don't think I've ever been to an AYCE place and have the servers ask me how everything is tasting. I also loved how they came around to refill water/tea without us asking. Pleasant service is always a bonus!

There is a decent selection of items on the menu. Notable items: squid sushi (yum), mango maki (mango + avocado = super yum), and deep fried tofu (so soft with the perfect sauce). Sashimi was also quite fresh.

Pricing is also quite decent compared to other AYCE places. $20.99 per person for dinner, and 10% off if paying cash. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Yonge Sushi was our go to sushi spot for our family. But lately it's been a bit disappointing. The waitress that was there on the 29th Nov was so unpleasant compare to the previous waitresses we are used to. The food is also not what it used to be especially the sashimi and the handrolls."}
{"text":"Didnt expect much in the beginning. Seemed like one of the common ayce places u see anywhere with cheap price. But things changed when i tasted their sushi and rolls. For ayce, rice was proportionate to what they put inside the rolls and all of them( cali, dyna, avo, red dragon) were amazing. Sushi were great as well. I didnt wait too long for the food to come out even though the place was packed. I can see this place actually cares about what they give to customers and the service was amazing. 
Definitely goin bak again"}
{"text":"Yonge sushi is one of our favourite sushi spots. It's pretty small and simple, about 10 or so tables, but oh so delicious! Service is quick, efficient and friendly! The sushi is always so fresh. Same chef (possibly the owner) is always there and will often deliver the sushi to your table and thank you. Great spot and we will keep coming back even though we don't live in the neighbourhood anymore!"}
{"text":"Really impressed by this place. Amazing quality for a steal, 13.99 weekend lunch. Smaller menu for lunch but everything you need. Everything tastes so fresh, and the rolls that have tempura - tempura was just fried. Comes to your table hot and crispy! Great service, very polite waitress. Overall a great experience. Would definitely come back here and try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went there for weekend AYCE sushi lunch for $14. The place isn't huge but big enough for small groups.

Service is decent and the sushi tasted great for the value. Try the ginger ice cream, it's different."}
{"text":"I went for Saturday AYCE lunch and it was a bad meal.

Rice was hot and mushy, so all the rolls and sushi tasted bad. Tempura batter was thick and not crispy, tempura sauce had bits of batter in it when it came to our table. We found the salads too salty. Overall, we regretted walking in here."}
{"text":"Excellent value; sashimi was fresh and the rolls were great. Not too many seats so making a reservation ahead of time is probably a good idea. Would highly recommend to those looking for some affordable, high quality AYCE. Service was also quick and satisfactory."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this AYCE joint just before going to a buddy's xmas party. The restaurant is pretty small, can probably only seat about 10-12 tables. 

The quality of the sashimi and sushi rolls was surprisingly good for a mid-town sushi joint. My go to salmon sashimi however was not as fresh as other places, which I can generally tell by the colour of the salmon (not as orange!)

If I was in the area again and craving sushi, would still hit up this spot -- good value for the money, and food was descent."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was very fast. Totally worth the price! Try the ice cream as well!!!"}
{"text":"You order a tuna, you get white tuna. I wasn't aware of the white tuna before. Googling I understand this is likely to be escolar ( or some other less expensive fish)."}
{"text":"Started going to Yonge Sushi after our local AYCE shut down after a fire incident. AYCE is sort of our Friday night ritual, so we needed to find a good place with a decent price point right away. Luckily, Yonge Sushi isn't too far of a drive for us, so we decided to try it out. Overall, I really like this place and still plan to go back on a regular basis even though our local AYCE is renovated and open again. 

Pros:
- Good price point for lunch and dinner
- Really friendly service that is genuine
- Great options on the menu so you can get a good variety of items
- Fresh and tasty sushi for an AYCE place
- For some reason, I really love the broccoli tempura - I could eat tons of it
- I'm not a fan of lobster, but my friends LOVE the lobster roll (might be called the snow roll, I think)
- You can eat and not feel rushed, service is not over-bearing

Cons:
- I'm not a big fan of shrimp and a lot of the rolls are made with shrimp, so those choices are limited for me - but, my friends love it
- Parking around the area can sometimes be a challenge"}
{"text":"It's really cheap, It's way better than most places around town for sushi. The quantity you get for 20$ is awesome. What struck me was the fish quality was quite decent for a low end sushi place . Try the beef short ribs they are really good. Not the most authentic place but for me the spicy red tuna sushi roll and the crab hand roll are quite good. I've been to places like Nobu and blowfish but for the price you get sushi for here it is real value for money."}
{"text":"Eventhough the grand opening discount is off now, things are still very fresh and the owner is trying to do the best to satisfy the customer, A+"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Toronto! Amazing service, SO friendly, clean and bright environment... and the most consistently fantastic sushi you can get. For only $13 at lunch, all you can eat. YUM! 

Highly recommend the Spicy Salmon Sushi - it is hard to find on the menu but WOW so good! 

The friendliest service I've ever experienced in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here for the rave reviews. But unfortunately maybe bc it was a Fri. Or something else but I didn't find this place all that. It was tiny and crammed. Too busy as there was only 1 server servicing EVERYONE!!! We didn't get most of our order. I think we literally asked 10x for the edamame (as my 15 month old only eats that) and finally when we were done and ordered our ice cream and paid did they bring out the missing order. The food was meh, I know you can't expect much from AYCE but I' ve had better. The server even acknowledged that they were too busy and unprepared however when I mentioned the \"busyness\" of the night she said no it's always like this near the end of the week. The place was too crammed, We felt like a bunch of sardines. On a plus note, the bathroom was very clean!!!! Will I try this place out on a less busy day? Probably not as I found the sushi to be very bland!"}
{"text":"When I go through there was only one server available so service was a little bit slow. The food selection for the lunch time is very typical nothing too exciting, however you can't expect much since you're only paying $12.99. Would come back again with friends for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Yonge Sushi is a small AYCE Japanese restaurant that I would never think of walking into if not for the decent Yelp reviews. Like some other Chinese-run sushi places, Yonge Sushi offers 10% discount if you are paying by cash. The price for the AYCE dinner is lower than average, at $21.99 per person, drinks not included. Each person is allowed to order 3 pieces of red tuna sashimi and a lobster roll. These specialty items are what makes Yonge Sushi stands out from the rest, and because the store is small, service was pleasantly attentive and everything we ordered actually arrived at our table (rare for AYCE places). 

Some of my favourites:
1. Seafood Salad - Ok, this is essentially a \"Green Salad\" but with chopped sashimi laden on top, but it's amazing. I order at least two of these each time I visit. 

2. Egg Sashimi - It doesn't taste floury like most I've tried, but instead it's sweet and can almost pass as a dessert. My sweet tooth has me ordering this round after round. 

4. Futo Maki - Rarely do AYCE joints get this roll right, and Yonge Sushi is the closest to right! They've got the pickled radish but just missing the pink minced meat. 

5. Shrimp Tempura - Very fresh & crispy. They need to use a bigger bowl for the tempura sauce - that's my only complaint.

6. Beef Short Ribs - Surprisingly tender and juicy! 

I can certainly do without ordering the following:
1. Seafood Soup - Tasted like diluted soy sauce with a few pieces of 'seafood' which consists of imitation crab meat. 

2. Other tempura items that isn't shrimp - they didn't taste fresh or crispy at all. 

3. Seaweed Salad - Been in the fridge a little too long that it was dried up

4. Any noodle items - The soup base is almost identical to the seafood soup (see above) and the noodles were overcooked. 

Parking can also be a pain since only street parking is available. They do take reservations, which I recommend if you don't want to lose your table due to difficulties finding parking."}
{"text":"Excellent first experience with this AYCE spot. There are always a few things in the checklist that you look for in every AYCE sushi restaurant and this place hits several of those checkmarks. 

First of all, their sushi and rolls were great. Even though a couple rolls were not quite holding together, I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt and blame that on my friend's terrible chopsticks skills. Other than that I really have no complaints, they didn't overload the rolls with rice, and the filling to rice ratio was perfect for most of these rolls. You can really taste every ingredient. I would recommend their dragon rolls, and if you're feeling adventurous, try their TNT roll, it's a California roll topped with tempura shrimp cut into bits and smothered in a peanut sauce akin to those that you can find in dim sum restaurants. 

Next we'll move onto the kitchen items, my friend and I ordered the usual stuff like tempura, and some meat dishes. The tempura shrimp and some veggies were breaded well and tasted great. They had very decent karagge and really that's all we ordered since we were really enjoying the sushi. 

Lastly we'll talk a little bit about the service and the restaurant itself. The place looked small and inside you'll find approximately 8 tables. There were two waitresses working along with the owners who will help out when it gets busy, which it was when I was dining (full house). They are police, and attentive, especially the owners who will treat you with respect. The orders came out a tad slow but it wasn't to the point where you feel irritated. All of the items that we ordered came correctly and this is something that people take for granted, I often hear from others or personally experience restaurants missing items from your orders and that really annoys me because I'm not sure if all my items are out and I get a little more reserved when I'm ordering more. To finish off, I would like to say that this was a great find, the food, service, and quality of dining were all great. I will definitely come back again when I can. 

Ps there's a 10% discount if you pay with cash."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite AYCE sushi place ever. After finding out about this place on yelp with my boyfriend, we both always come here. One time we went here twice in a week! 

The restaurant itself is small. Enough to fit about 15 tables? The servers are very kind and deliver great service. The atmosphere itself is very calm/relaxing. 

The sushi itself is great. My boyfriend loves their Red Dragon rolls and as for me, spicy salmon hand rolls are the way to go. We've ordered pretty much everything off their menu already and nothing can go wrong. Although one thing is that we tried out the gyoza we had tasted kind of odd and we both didn't like it. 

Overall, this is an amazing place to go with your friends and I highly recommend it. For lunch, it's about $19 (with tax and 10% tip) per person which is not a bad price for AYCE. For dinner, I don't recall how much it costs but if you pay in cash, you get a 10% discount! (I remember paying about $25 for it with the discount, tax, and tip included but don't take my word for it!)"}
{"text":"Great, attentive service. Good food quality. Affordable AYCE lunch price ($12.99). There is also a 10% discount for cash only!

The lunch selection however, is very limited. 

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"For all you can eat, this is quite up there! Everything came out hot and fresh. The  sashimi was good quality and freshness. There was only one server for the whole restaurant when we were there... Definitely look like a handful to juggle but we thought she did great. Very friendly service. Will come back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bf on a weeknight. Great service, the waitress gave us big smiles. The sashimi were fresh, although we were still given less pieces than we ordered on paper. The spicy tuna roll was delicious and the beef ribs are better here than most other sushi ayce places. The rib meat was tender and they didn't come with chunks of fat like most other places serve ribs. The other kitchen items were okay, price is fair for all you can eat. We also got the 10% discount paying cash. The menu could be improved with more options."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever! In December, my friend and I went for dinner ayce sushi on Friday. We got rushed to eat and leave. The waitress kept telling us it is really busy and they have more customers waiting - WE BASICALLY GOT KICKED OUT. I would give 0 star if I could."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch AYCE ($18.08)
Service - efficient & attentive
Nigiri sushi - ok but fish on the thin side
Maki rolls - better than average & use less rice
Cooked foods - nothing special

Only if in the area would I come back just for the maki rolls but would not go out of my way for this place, cheers. Also I didn't get the 10% discount when paying with cash."}
{"text":"The reason why I Gave stars is the fact that the food was amazing but unfortunately the service was kind of slow"}
{"text":"So we decided to try out a new spot and saw that yonge sushi was close by and had great reviews! Sadly these reviews were either not accurate or we came on an off day... Luckily were smart enough to do a test round the first time so we don't end up with a plate full of bad food. 

The fish- we ordered salmon, tuna and white tuna sashimi and shrimp and octopus sushi. The salmon was off tasting, not fishy, but definitely off and not fresh. The rest of the fish was fine but after having bad salmon we were a little psyched out... 

The rolls- we ordered a red dragon, spicy salmon and the gari gari roll. We were caught off guard by the red dragon because it had a salad dressing inside which was not good but luckily their wasn't much of it. The gari gari roll was a dynamite roll with cream cheese and I loved it! Thought it was great combination of taste and texture, definitely a win. The spicy salmon was awful. The salmon was pale and smelled off, again not fishy but off. 

The hot foods- the tempura was fresh hot and crispy! The shirt ribs were okay but nothing special. The Miso soup was bland. We also decided to try out their avocado salad and it was pretty good, I was a little hesitant because of the seas dressing but once I tried it I wasn't disappointed! 

Sadly this place really fell short. We understand AYCE places don't have stellar quality sushi but this place was definitely bad. We won't be going back. 

A really cute thing about this place is they have makeshift learning chop sticks for those new and willing to learn! A group had come in and had no idea how to use chop sticks and the waiter was kind enough to bring them each a set :)"}
{"text":"Simply the best sushi place in North Toronto. The rice is always soft and fresh. They have the best salmon sushi I've ever had. Great prices for lunch AYCE, and even though their dinner prices are a bit pricey it's definitely worth it"}
{"text":"AYCE dinner is about $25 after tax which isn't bad considering I normally skip lunch anyway PFF who needs that? LOL! Anyway, if you pay by cash, you get 10% discount, but don't just think you get it right off the bat - kindly, let your waiter/waitress know and they will make the adjustments on the bill.

I've dined here on several occasions but mostly for dinner and the ambiance is always average, however towards the end of the meal it generally gets more busier during peak hours of 8 and so on. The service is pretty attentive as they don't try harassing you by constantly coming to your table making you feel rushed, so you can relax and enjoy your dinner/time there.

I would definitely come by here again it's a great place and the staff are always so friendly!"}
{"text":"This is our AYCE sushi place.  They have nice thick cuts of sashimi. And the fish to rice ratio is just right!! This place will not fill you up with filler.  Give it go you'll go back."}
{"text":"Not many choices available, fish was not as fresh as it should be, the place is tiny and air circulation isn't the greatest, so strong fish scents overtake you the minute you walk in. Two choices for dessert."}
{"text":"August 2, 2015

I've been looking for Sushi AYCE resturaunts  for a long time to try to check them out. Yonge Sushi was one of the sushi places on our list.  Many yelpers claimed that there were a good deal and great food here however it was just ok for us.  I ordered only few pieces of salmon sashimi, seaweed salad, avocado salad, miso soup, shrimp tempura, shrimp skewers, teriyaki salmon, chicken karaeke, deep fried oyster and eel on rice.  The portion was small so it was good to order different dishes.  Salmon sashimi came with big pieces in the beginning.  However, it got smaller and smaller when I repeated the order 3 times. Each order was only 3-4 pieces but they were smaller than the first time.  That was funny for me because we didn't order very much.  

The two good things here were the seaweed salad wasn't salty. We really like it.  Another thing was the waitresses look friendly though they didn't mention that they didn't have edamame when we ordered it 3 times!  I was too lazy to ask for it so I just put it on the list 3 times but it never came.

The price was $21.99 for each. It's pretty much the regular price for an AYCE dinner and there was nothing special here, at least for us!  However, the lunch is much cheaper at $11.99.   If you live close by, you can check it out for a lunch but make sure that you have enough time to wait for your food if you come at the busy time.   The restaurant is also small so they can't accommodate many large groups. 

For me, I would rather pay for a nice meal somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"It took me a while to write a review for this restaurant. I have been here more than my two check ins and every time, it has been a different experience. For the most part, it has been good. But I can sympathize with the bad reviews as I had similar experience but not at that level. 

This restaurant is more on the line of a 3 1/2*. It is very small, not good for a large party. The decor is very plain and ordinary. You still order through pen and paper for the AYCE. 

Let's start with the pros: the dinner price of $26 for AYCE is very good especially in the Uptown area. The Salmon sashimi is good and fresh and there's a limit of 3 pieces for the Red Tuna sashimi. The sushi and rolls are done very well and depending how busy they are, there's a good ratio of fish and rice. The beef short ribs, the Pork and Chicken katsu and the Shrimp skewers are also very good. 

Then why am I giving this place such an average rating? Depending on how busy they are, the rate in which they bring the sashimi can vary a lot during dinner service. For example, last Thursday, we were the only customers when we got there right after 5pm, so we were served with the sashimi order promptly. When is busy, as other reviewers have indicated, they do bring the sashimi last after all of the cooked dishes and sushi order. 

We do like this place and we know better than to come here during their busy hours."}
{"text":"Finally, an average score I can absolutely agree with! As I go through and review all of the AYCE Sushi places that I've been to, I can happily say that Yonge Sushi is one of the best. I was lucky to find this place last summer when I was in the area and used Google Maps to find anything close to where I was. 

At the time we went, which was a Lunch hour, the place was packed and we had to wait 15-20 minutes to get a table but I can happily say that the wait was worth it. The food was really quite good for AYCE so if you are on the hunt for a great place, you can be confident that you'll likely be very happy when you try this place out. :)"}
{"text":"I know my review is going to look like an outlier because somehow this place has a bunch of great reviews - but that's what we thought about the negative reviews, went anyway, and wasted our money. Instead of taking you through the evening, I'm going to take you through reasons for my 1 star.

1. The service was slow and rushed at the same time. The food was slow in coming out, the servers constantly felt like they were rushing you.
2. After an hour of sitting on a Monday night, we STILL hadn't received all our food, including a salad, rice, an entire platter of sushi, and teriyaki. 
3. The food we did receive was staggered, which at first we understood because the place was busy, but when you only get 1 out of 2 salads, you start to wonder how difficult a salad is to make.
4. The bbq eel sushi came completely ripped apart. I was worried it had been dropped so didn't eat it.
5. The icing on the cake was this: We ordered shrimp and octopus tempura. So did the couple beside us, apparently. We got an order, they got an order, so we dug in. Then the waitress came to us (after we had already taken pieces of the shrimp) and said \"oh I think this one is yours\" and took ours away and PUT IT ON THEIR TABLE. We tried to protest saying that we had already taken pieces from it, only being told, \"oh it's okay.\" Then she gave us theirs. WHAT. KIND. OF. SERVICE. IS. THAT. Hopefully my salad hadn't been pre-chewed. 

So, you know. Be wary."}
{"text":"I've only had takeout from this restaurant, but I've always enjoyed it. Their vegetarian rolls are quite reasonably priced and even though rolls are somewhat sloppily made, they are still tasty, which is all I really care at the end of the day!"}
{"text":"Foodwise: 3 star at best. Nothing outstanding, rice in maki was sometimes hot. I also could tell they used dirty oil as tempura had shitty color.
While the whole time i thought dinner ayce price was 21.99 on mon-thurs night, it wasn't. We were billed at 25.99. For 22$, i wouldve accepted the quality of food however for 26$, definitely not.
Also, there was something in my soy sauce bottle that looked like tempura bits... I received no apologies but \"I understand\" ??????????????? That was jokes.
I'm only giving 2 stars for the younger waitress and the man."}
{"text":"Tragic. They must have very recently upped the AYCE lunch to a much less exciting $15, which is quite a hike considering it was $12 just weeks ago. The food is still great - but not nearly as much of a deal as it was before. I mitigated my disappointment with deep-fried scallops."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with my friend  price is great c the sushi rice  is always perfect  they have a good sashimi. Their shrimps is very good  amazing lobster roll  we will be back"}
{"text":"Price has gone up to 26.99 on weekends. Okay price for the size of the menu. They don't excessively load everything with rice which is a plus. However if you order more than 20 sashimi they'll probably just give you half and then cut them all in half with one swipe to double it. That's what they did for our group. We ordered 10 tuna and 30 salmon and they looked nearly the same, but the salmon slices were actually cut in half. 

The servers are very nice, and the speed of service is pretty good. But for a buck or two more, there are other Ayce sushi restaurants that are not too far away with bigger menus."}
{"text":"First time I am writting a review on here. I must say I was very impressed at the cost and the quality of sushi. I feel as though they did not cut any corners by for example adding more rice to the sushi and giving you less fish. The sashimi was great, and considering that it was included in the cost of $25 on a Saturday night rang well. To my surprise the hand rolls and sushi did not have a surplus of rice, and the service was quick. Overall experience is good, and comparing it with other all you can eat sushi places, I haven't stumbled on one that is comparable yet."}
{"text":"Here's what we had and how we'd rate out of 10

Salmon sashimi: 10 (chef surprised us with 3 extra pieces on the house) - thick, fresh, large pieces of the highest quality 

Salmon sushi: 8 - tasty, but the salmon was thin

Spring rolls: 9 - fresh hot and can't beat the price (I think $3.5 for 4)

BBQ short ribs: 3 - I don't know, we didn't like it. Kindve a honey garlic taste and they weren't fire grilled, it was like pan fried. Maybe other people would like it, but we didn't

Miso soup: 8 - I've never had miso I didn't like, so not sure if I'm generous in rating it, but I loved it

We've spent 3 weeks in Japan and know a thing or two about sushi. This place is excellent in an area that has competitive sushi offerings, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Worst customer service last week. only one waitress works each shift so if it's around late afternoon better not go there you might get half what you order and get attitude from your waitress. We went for all you can eat around 8 pm very disappointed. After 45 mins of waiting for our food, We were told to reorder the same food. After another 45 mins of waiting and still missing half our food we just gave up.  such a waste of money...we were still hungry and frustrated when we left. Good price & tasty food...if you luck out and actually receive it."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it was going to be like any other subpar all you can eat sushi restaurant. If it weren't for my bf wanting to eat here, I would've passed by this place without a second thought. The decor is dated and the ambiance is non existent but the food makes up for all that.

We ordered a good variety of dishes to try and the outstanding dishes are: tnt roll, tuna sashimi, and seafood salad. The rest of the dishes were okay and the worst had to be salmon sashimi. It tasted slightly off, kind of an earthy dirt taste which was really gross. 

Unlike other reviews, our sashimi and rolls came out pretty quick despite the restaurant being full and the other dishes like gyoza didn't come out until towards the end of our meal when we were pretty full. 

The ayce is cheaper than other places but the options are more limited. Overall it was a decent experience and the food was pretty good, but I know of at least two other ayce places that I would rather go to so I mostly likely won't return unless if I'm in the area and my bf strongly urges us to eat here."}
{"text":"You know an AYCE place is good when your girlfriend forces you to eat there thrice in a week.  This is a true story.  After my first visit at Yonge Sushi, I was astonished by how delightful the food tasted. What makes this sushi buffet stand out amongst the many is their level of quality.  The sushi is full flavored and unlike competitors, this buffet does not pack your meal full of rice. 

Freshly fried shrimps are used in dragon rolls and dynamites'. It's a first,  but it's really gives this little sushi joint it's charm. Selection is limited for lunch and dinner buffet menus. 

I strongly recommend this buffet if you want to have your taste buds aroused.  I enjoyed the flavors and Yonge Sushi is among my top pick. 

Seating is limited; so consider arriving early. The decor is nothing fantastic but the service is effective. You can park at the loblaws one minute north."}
{"text":"Have another update - it's good again. First review still applies."}
{"text":"This place is one of the only sushi restaurants you'll find at the intersection of low price and high quality. Everything is fresh, warm, and generous! Unlike your typical AYCE, the rolls are big but are made with little rice, which to me is a must. The service was great as well. At 13.99 for lunch, this place is golden."}
{"text":"I feel like this is the first time Yelp reviews have ever led me astray. In fact on my way out I checked the sign and address just to be sure I was in the same place as the other reviewers. This place hit just about every one of my sushi pet peeves.

I was greeted and seated quickly and offered tea and water. I made my order and waited. And waited. And waited. Slowest service ever. The place wasn't packed but the kid making the sushi seemed to be out of steam. The server was actually very quick and friendly. Filling water and tea and checking in frequently. It's a shame they couldn't give her some food to deliver. She did apologize for the tragic wait for food and offered to bring me any kitchen food I wanted while the sushi chef figured out what the hell he was doing so I liked her and tipped her. Not her fault.

The miso soup and tempura sauce were both meh. Bland but not offensive. The karage was good. The kamikaze roll was a sin against sushi. If you took the avocado from a normal maki roll and cut it into fourths that would be the amount in the roll. It was over-stuffed with tempura bits and little spicy sauce. It was poorly made and fell apart all over the place. It was advertised on the menu as 8 pieces and arrived with 7. Chef must have gotten hungry. Sweet potato roll was ok. All nigiri had hot rice (not room temperature, hot). All nigiri also fell apart when picked up with chop sticks. The salmon ones never even bothered showing up. The tamago was extremely fluffy, more like good scrambled eggs than tamago. The avocado roll was tiny with nori so chewy I nearly choked repeatedly. The rainbow roll was advertised as 8 pieces and arrived with six. On the specific lunch all you can eat menu there is a picture right next to the rainbow roll which shows 8 pieces and tuna on some of them. Sadly, there was no tuna on the one that arrived. The white fish was fresh on it, the salmon had seen better days. Yam tempura was good while broccoli tempura was monstrous taking at least five bites and chews to get through each piece (this is not a good thing). Green tea ice cream was fine. Throughout the meal I noticed all avocados had brown spots. The rice (both the hot and cold varieties) was barely seasoned. And everything the sushi chef touched fell apart (left with a soy sauce dish brimming with rice). Adding to the oddness, the outside signage said AYCE lunch was 11.99 while the menu said 12.99. I was charged 11.99. I guess it's a surprise every time. 

I wanted to bad to love this place. I was so excited taking the bus all the way across town to finally try it. I'd been talking the place up to my roommate and friends before going just based on the reviews alone. Now I'm heart broken. I don't imagine I'll go back."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi menu. Great price fresh sushi and great service. The green dragon rolls are great!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. The menu is very simple, nothing out of the ordinary, but it's always fresh, well made, delicious. Price is very reasonable (AYCE and they have a 10% discount if you  pay on cash!). Service is great. Try the hand rolls, tempura, the roll with lobster at the top, the sashimi... All yummy!"}
{"text":"Good deal for weekend lunch, 13.99 but options left a lot to be desired! Service was great!

Stand outs: 
Snow roll (butter fish and shrimp tempura)
Beef ribs (big thin pieces)
Shrimp tempura

It's a small restaurants bit they do take reservations so just give them a shout ahead of time.  Also they have a great 10% discount if you pay cash but this is only for dinner. 

Wish they had more sushi choices and creative rolls! 

1 star for menu choices"}
{"text":"This is the best all-you-can-eat sushi experience in the city in my opinion.  I have been doing the all-you-can-eat thing for about ten years now, and this place is definitely a cut above for these reasons:
1. Freshness - it is as good as anywhere else I've had, the sashimi is always very fresh and well done.
2. Selection - a special roll with lobster, surf clam sashimi, octopus sushi, (limit 3 per person) tuna sashimi, an unusually diverse selection of special rolls, and a seaweed salad that is only seaweed (not seaweed on lettuce).
3. Quality - the salads are amazing, really, unusually so, the teriyaki is always very tender.
4. Service - ok, I don't care that much about service, but these folks actually bring you EXACTLY what you order, with no fuss.  This is a really nice change from almost anyone else."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but little variety. Which is fine for me but my girlfriend had a problem with that...

THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. Like someone else suggested in the reviews, it's true they purposely ignore your sashimi and sushi orders. It was $30/person and we only had one round of sushi/sashimi. They ignored our order twice! I wanted to say something but i realized i had fallen in their trap (I ate all the fried stuff they served real quickly and was pretty full by the time i had realized our sushi/sashimi hadn't come again, dangit..). So instead of making a stink about it and asking them to bring the plates we ordered, I gave very little tip and decided to come warn people about this place..."}
{"text":"The All-You-Can-Eat is very affordable [ especially if you pay in cash ;) ]. The food came out really quickly and the waitress was extremely friendly. I'd recommend this place if you're in the Yonge & Lawrence area and you've got a big appetite. If you're looking for premium quality fish, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night.  AYCE was $21.99 pp and you get a 10% discount if you pay cash.
You order off a sheet, and there were lots of choices.  Perhaps if I had known I was going to AYCE, I would have eaten less during the day.  I was full after the first round.

The staff was nice and attentive.  I can't complain about the sushi they brought. I enjoyed the seafood salad.  And the rolls weren't super rice-y.

Check it out, it's small, and clean, and tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's small but truly loveeeee their sushi. Best sushi in the area so far. Their sushi has a nice thin layer of rice and the filling is just abundant. Service is great, awesome place for lunch. Oh and their tempura is just perfect. Some may say the batter is a bit too thick but that's the way I like it! Recommend this place to sushi lovers :)"}
{"text":"Great ayce sushi (then again I'm a fan of all of them soo...)

Unfortunately it's not that authentic as I thought. When my Chinese parents were saying how they didn't give out spoons, the waiters started speaking Chinese to us as well (which wasn't to say that our service was diminished, if anything it probably made their lives easier by understanding what my parents wanted haha.)

Me and my family went on a weekend so it was 21.99 per person, however if you paid in cash they gave you 10% discount which was great.

There was a large selection of sushi and very nicely plated. I've also been to Aji Sai and Heart Sushi in Mississauga, but Yonge Sushi captured my heart (well at least my parents). 

Their sashimi is fresh and the rolls are creative! Would definitely go again :)"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing miso soup! The kamikaze roll was absolutely lovely! Nice and clean restaurant, with plenty of great options!"}
{"text":"Came here for ayce dinner. It was a bit overpriced. Their food selection could be better. No wow factor in food.  Wouldnt come back here tbh. On the plus side... service was okay."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a real gem. I'm still savoring the flavors of the grilled salmon neck. 

This is how AYCE should be done. Quality over quantity. Each dish was prepared with time and care including the sushi and rolls. The waitress serving the 3 occupied tables of the restaurant was super nice. She wasn't overbearingly \"friendly\" (ahem fake) like some can be, nor did she plop the food down and turn her back as is a custom with other servers, esp in the culture of AYCE sushi restaurants. We were able to sample everything of our liking without being stuffed by rice and grease. In fact, we walked out full of nothing but fresh, delicious food.

Did I mention the AYCE lunch is a steal at $11.99? So by default it's a must have. We started with miso soup, seaweed salad, edamame, and seafood salad. The miso was above average in flavor, edamame was served warm baked with the perfect amount of salt crystals, and the seafood salad was the first standout of the meal experience. It should have been called the sashimi salad as the small bowl was served with lettuce but chalk-full of fresh slices of Salmon, snapper, crab, and white tuna, all marinated in a light and delicious dressing that was not too vinegary.

Next came the rainbow roll and snow roll which were petite confections topped with fresh slices of fish and a small rim of moist rice. The nori and hand rolls were executed in a similar fashion.

The beef short ribs were large, flavorful (not greasy) topped with sesame seeds and the tempura was crispy as it should be. Finally the salmon teriyaki....not ordinary teriyaki in the least. This was a thick and delicious purée that perfectly sweetened the moist salmon below. Just when I had thought they may have forgotten our order of grilled salmon neck, as everything was so speedily prepared, the dish arrived. It was an impressive serving of succulent fish served hot and again NOT greasy.
I'm sure the ice cream would have been a morsel, consistent with the rest of the meal, but we were just too satisfied and didn't want to stuff.

I will definitely be back here and though AYCE is not usually my style, this place has redefined the experience for me."}
{"text":"Yonge Sushi is a nice little AYCE restaurant. It's small inside, there not much seating (you couldn't bring a party), but it's good for a lunch date. I recommend the Gari Gari Roll (Dynamite with cream cheese), it's so good! It doesn't have as many options as other AYCE places, but the rolls are the perfect size, the service is good and everything is fresh. It's good, but not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have never written any reivew before but man this sushi andce really deserves it. After I've discovered this place, I've been only getting sushi from here.

Service - absolutely amazing. Best service compared toy other all you can eat sushi places. They are super polite and constantly check up on you if you need help. I've never had to ask for an extra order sheet because they would always give it to us right when we needed one. Even when the workers were eating lunch they wouldn't let us down.

Food - Amazing. One thing I have to emphasize here is the freshness of everything on the menu. I've gone there many times now and tried everything on the all you can eat menu and I have to say, I was never disappointed with anything on the menu. Everything was super fresh and delicious especially the rolls. They will melt in your mouth. Whatever you order, it just tastes really fresh. From chicken cutlet to sashimis to tempuras to rolls. I've tried so many sushi places but this place has one of the best. The only downside is they might not have a lot of variety as of special rolls although they have quite a lot.

Price - Very cheap compared to other all you can eat. It's like 12 $ for lunch and 20$ for dinner.

Location - this is the only downside to this restaurant. The location can be a bit better but it is on yonge street but I wish it was right beside a subway station. Its in between lawrence and eglington.

This place is just amazing. Great food, excellent service and always quiet and clean."}
{"text":"Yonge Sushi, even by neighbourhood sushi standards, is pretty bad. The fish is 'mature' and the presentation is weak. Service is rushed, and by the speed of delivery multiplied by the number of staff, I'd guess that there is some freezing and thawing. Price is fine and the sushi didn't kill me, but I think I'll opt for something else next time."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for AYCE sushi in the area. Fresh sushi and good aervice always."}
{"text":"I've been a regular Take-out/delivery kind of customer for Yonge sushi ever since I moved into the area over a year and a half ago. The quality of food is consistently delicious and fresh - also filling without relying on too much rice like other places! I've tried other sushi places in the area (mainly north of the 401) but find myself always opting for Yonge Sushi.  It's officially my go-to since I know I can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi I've had for a reasonable price!!! The sushi taste so fresh!! It is a bit of a ways away from me but it is now my go to for when the sushi cravings hit."}
{"text":"I came here for the dinner AYCE sushi ($20.99) with my boyfriend and a friend who was moving back to Montreal. The restaurant itself looked like it could seat no more than 30 people and it wasn't particularly busy due to it being a frigid Tuesday night. 

The AYCE menu was not necessarily more extensive than most AYCE spots within the city but the quality of food is noticeably better. Round one of four consisted of various sashimi, rolls (kamikaze, rainbow, tuna, spicy salmon and salmon avocado), fried tofu, karaage (Japanese fried chicken), spring rolls, beef ribs, miso and seafood soup, beef udon, beef teriyaki, and various tempuras. Knockout winner in this round was the sashimi. The ribs were more fat than meat but the sauce was the saving grace. I hated the tempura batter -- I went as far as trying to peel off the batter to get at the veggies inside because it was so thick (not the most easiest of tasks). The roll pieces kept sticking together and unraveling as I tried to pull them apart, but that's just an aesthetic hiccup and it was still tasty...so whatever. Beef teriyaki was tender and delicious. The subsequent rounds just felt like a different variation of the first but I did order more and more sushi pieces as the night went on (eel sushi and salmon sushi was very good, tuna sushi was alright). 

The service was subpar. The waitress gave us the wrong beer in our first round and we just assumed that what we had asked for was not available, but a heads up would have been cool. Maybe she had misheard us or believed that asking for a Canadian really meant give us Heineken. As the night went on, we ordered more Canadians but kept Heinekens. We also didn't recieve all the orders we had checked off on the AYCE list. My boyfriend had checked off a bowl of steamed rice in every round but it never came and neither did my curry chicken rice entree. I would have given Yonge Sushi four yelp stars, but the service wasn't on the ball. When we got up to pay (we had to bounce, so waiting for her to mosey towards our table wasn't gonna happen) we also saw Canadians stacked in the fridge. Charging us an extra 30 cents per beer was pertinent it seems... Anyways, I'd come back for the food but be way more vocal on the missing orders and wrong beer."}
{"text":"Okay, this sushi place has really great value. The owners are Chinese but their sushi and rolls are very tasty. They also give you a freebie spicy salmon, California or Dynamite roll when you spend over $40."}
{"text":"Loved the AYCE lunch today, it was fresh, quick and great tasting. The server was also very attentive and the prices were very reasonable. I think this is my new favorite sushi place. I especially enjoyed the miso soup, kalbi beef and the kamikaze rolls. Parking is always a bit challenging in the area, but street parking is available. I recommend this place to anyone with a major hunger, be prepared to try everything on the menu, so skip the breakfast, and for that matter also dinner, eat your heart out at lunch."}
{"text":"Nice sushi restaurant in midtown Toronto. They have alot your standard ayce options you can get at most places plus some of their own special rolls. Their T&T roll was pretty good with lots of flavor. Also, their sashimi was very fresh and tasty. The only downside to this restaurant is it's very tiny, so you can be waiting more than 30 min for a table. Overall great spot in the area."}
{"text":"This is now our go to spot. The food is always fresh and you don't ever need to wait forever for it to arrive to the table."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 8 - 4 adults and 4 children ( one 4 year old, two 3 year olds, and one infant). It was a smaller space than I expected. Yelp says that they can accommodate groups and families with kids, but I don't they they can handle groups of more than 4 people, although they did handle the kids well and they did provide a highchair for the infant. The food was good, they had a good all you can eat menu. I would definitely go back, but only if it was my husband and I or a friend and I."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch AYCE.

Quality of sushi was ok. Service was slow until another server came in to work. Food came out fast. Other tables got asked if the food was okay and good service, but we were never treated the same way for some reason... maybe the young demographic tips less than the businessmen in suits? 

I'll stick with my favourites in Markham for AYCE sushi, thanks."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tasty.  The service is great.  We love the unagi maki.  The shrimp tempura is also excellent.  The tuna and salmon sashimi are also tasty.  I would also recommend the black dragon roll."}
{"text":"Best All You Can Eat in Toronto!
Amazingly fresh! Perfect rice to filling ratio! Some staff are so friendly! Some are filled with contempt! It is just like Home:)"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO THIS PLACE FOR AYCE SUSHI. This place has turned from a gem to a greed driven place. This place is a disgrace to AYCE sushi places. I think this place is running with 4+ stars just because this is the only AYCE sushi place is the neighbourhood. I had been a loyal customer of this place for the past 1 year. I can notice their prices go up by few dollars over the time and the sizes of their sushi/sashimi shrink. Their strategy is to ignore your sashimi orders and only bring non-sushi dishes as fast as they can and hold your sushi/sashimi orders. I had brought so many friends and families to this place over the time but forget it now. \"Oh we missed your order\" for sashimi orders twice at the same night is not explainable - when there were only 3 customer in the restaurant. If your idea of buffet is to order 1 miso soup, 2 rolls, 2 sushi, and a desert, then feel free to go. But if u are one of those sushi lovers and want to enjoy some sushi/sashimi, find another place. Freaking thieves -
 $26 plus tax for AYCE sushi ... SMH !!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi spot in North York! The sushi always comes with minimal rice on the outer layer, and so much salmon, avocado, etc on the inside! The service is fine for any all you can eat sushi place, not much conversation which I don't mind at all. You order by marking the number of items you want on a sheet of paper. The fried foods always come out super hot and fresh! The only thing is their menu is a bit limited compared to other all you can eat places, but even then I'd still rather come back to this place! The price I feel is also quite affordable compared to other places as well. Highly recommend this sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Friends really wanted ayce sushi and we were nearby this place. Friend heard about the restaurant and heard it's not bad which is true. It was surprisingly cheap but you pay for what you get. Not the best, they also keep on forgetting our orders."}
{"text":"The food we received was good but we didn't get any of the hot items we requested from the kitchen. There was also only 1 server for the entire restaurant, which was full. We ended up leaving after 40 minutes having only received 1/2 our good but paying for all of it. The fruit fly which drowned itself in my drink was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Easily the best all-you-can-eat sushi in Toronto, or anywhere I've been for that matter. The quality of the sushi is excellent, and the presentation is amazing for an all-you-can-eat place. The staff are incredibly kind and welcoming as well. 

As for the food itself, the variety is impressive and the amount of special rolls is incredible for this type of restaurant. 

Overall, you really can't go wrong with this place. 5 STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"When I first saw these reviews, I was so excited to eat there. I went for the all you can eat buffet so I don't know if the regular menu foods are good, but I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR THE BUFFET!! 

The sushi was dry like it was like they defrosted frozen sushi and just microwaved it for a few seconds and then served it. The tempura is not that good compared to other places (Don't get the crab tempura, you'll be disappointed) and the dipping sauce for the most part was just soy sauce. No tempura sauce like other place or anything. 

I felt like this place was a complete waste of my time and money. There are so many other places you can go to, save your money and don't go here."}
{"text":"This place has got to be my favorite AYCE Sushi joint at the moment. I found this place out from my trusty Yelp app. I was traveling from Buffalo to Toronto to pickup some car parts for my summer car and I was looking at a place to eat. I had a few places in mind and this place was close to where I met up with the parts seller.

One thing I must say I did not like about the place was finding parking was a paint in the butt. I had to park in a residential area and walked about 2 blocks. Still not bad but I wish there was parking right by the place.

The place is fairly small but the food is where it shines. I went by and got peoples suggestions here which was the TNT Roll, Red Tuna Sashimi, Salmon Sashimi, Chicken Karage, beef Teriyaki and more.

My favorite would have to be almost everything. The Red Tuna sashimi was cut fairly thick but not as thick as the Salmon sashimi. Some other good items also was the Spicy Tuna Roll, chicken karage, TNT Roll, Spicy salmon roll, and bbq short ribs. 

One thing I did not like was the shrimp tempura. The batter was really really thick and had little to no shrimp in it. 

Service was great too and very attentive., There was two people that was taking orders and also clearing out plates vs the one person that everyone else is reporting.

But over all, this place is amazing and I'll be back when I'm in Toronto looking for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"The menu selection is fantastic! The food came out a little out of order, and the server seemed to hover around our table waiting for plates. We were one of three tables. But the food was delicious! The rools a little heavy, but warm and fresh!
We will deffinately go back"}
{"text":"Stars: 3.5 *

About: Meeting up with friends in the area over lunch on the weekday means limited time. Normally, we only have about an hour or so to eat. In these cases, I prefer meeting over lunch at an AYCE. There are many reasons such as more variety of food, good price, and most of the time the service is quick. This time, it was at a small AYCE joint located on Yonge/Lawrence called Yonge Sushi. The restaurant was much smaller in size when compared to other establishments in the area. The overall atmosphere of Yonge Sushi was pretty casual, and a good place for a quick and casual lunch.

Price: The price was very appealing as their lunch menu was a mere $11.99 per person.

Food: Yonge Sushi offers the standard sushi fare as most places. Now, they don't offer anything out of the ordinary but the overall standard of the food items was solid. We started off with the usual starters; green salad, miso soup and edamame. My favorite cooked dishes were the scallops, beef ribs and chicken teriyaki. I was moreso pleasantly surprised that they served beef ribs on the lunch menu as it's usually a dinner item. I definitely racked up on order of ribs. The sushi were decently made, and did not fall apart at all. Also, they didn't overkill on the amount of rice used in their sushi; the fish to rice ratio was good. However, one thing that I did noticed about their nigri was that the fish was extremely thinly sliced. That they offered for lunch is value for money, and I'd definitely come back if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not often compelled to write a review, but I was so severely disappointed by this place that I'm about to go in on this review.  I had heard that Toronto was known for its sushi, and this place has four stars on here (for some unknown reason). I put all my eggs in one basket so to speak and took the transit up to this joint. Right off the bat there's not much order and the staff isn't particularly welcoming when speaking to you. I get into my sushi order and wait around for not too long before the atrocity comes out. The sashimi is laughable, and tastes like it's been frozen and de-thawed. The sushi rolls themselves were poorly constructed and falling apart (I got the black dragon and rainbow roll).  ON TOP OF THIS, they definitely left out a roll (the TNT roll) and the squid that I had ordered. Maybe it's a blessing though, because my stomach currently hurts like no other. So disappointed that this was my first try of Toronto sushi."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to AYCE sushi based on the positive reviews. The menu is limited, not a lot of variety for cooked food and desserts. It was nice to see tuna sashimi in the menu (albeit 3 per person) but the meal was overall lacking in flavour. The sashimi was fresh. The seaweed was tough to chew. The rolls and cooked food was bland. Disappointing."}
{"text":"$25 cash a person for weekend evening ayce?! What more could you ask for!

It's a hidden gem in North York - although parking can be a hassle (I took a risk and parked at Loblaws while my friends found parking near residential streets) and place can be quite small, the quality of the sushi was very decent for what you're paying.

Highly recommend making a reservation as place was packed and it was cramped trying to fit 8 of us inside, any group smaller than that should be fine.

Service was ok hence the deducted one star lol the lady kept trying to rush us to put an order in, but other than that, very attentive and service was super quick! All the ayce offerings you'd find, minus the selection of desserts (all they had was 4-5 flavours of ice cream). Quality of fish was decent too though some of the rolls kept falling apart.

I'd say this place is very comparable to Aji Sai downtown. Price, service, sushi, all in all I would definitely be coming back to satisfy my sushi cravings often!"}
{"text":"We went around 1pm for lunch the place was very crowded and small. Only one server working and she seemed to be very overwhelmed, understandably with the lunch rush  the food was ok nothing great. They forgot too bring 3 items we ordered off the all you can eat menu but by the time we got the waitress we were ready for the bill.  With all the sushi places in the city this place falls short."}
{"text":"Amazing! Ordered delivery through JUST EAT and my order arrived within 15 minutes! Food was fresh and delicious. Will definitely order again as I live in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Solid sushi place in midtown!

We have ordered several times and done AYCE once. Good quality. They give free dishes if you order over a specific amount

AYCE was really busy and the service was slow, but they have plenty of vegetarian food, so I was happy!

I think I prefer ordering, but would try the restaurant on a quieter night"}
{"text":"Yonge Sushi always has consistently wonderful and warm service. I will continue to return for lunch and dinner despite moving out of the neighborhood."}
