{"text":"I called to place my order and asked what the specials were. The person on the other line chuckled and said, \"Specials? What's that?\" So I just ordered my default order: a pizza and bread sticks. They were really quick with my order. My husband, who picked up the order, said that the setup was pretty cool, as it's connected to a bar. Oh, and they accept cards.

I was excited that they offered a large selection of toppings, but they were pretty expensive. For my large pizza, it was an extra $5 for 2  toppings that aren't even considered \"premium.\" 

The food itself was disappointing. The container of marinara that came with the breadsticks was cold and way too sweet. The breadsticks were bland.... They tasted like bread with no garlic flavor and minimal cheese flavor. Even so, I would rather eat the breadsticks without that awful sauce. The pizza tasted as if it was made with the same overly sweet sauce that came with the breadsticks, making it unpalatable.

In short, with so many other pizza options in the area, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Absolutelu horrible. I ordered the Ravioli Vodka CHICKEN, paid $20.76 and tipped the driver $5.00. I got ravioli in sauce with no CHICKEN. I called and asked to be compensayed with dessert. I was told I could PAY for dessert and he could send CHICKEN for ME to add to a dish that was already cold.  UGH....then he hung up on me.  I called back and told him he just lost a good customer and keep the CHICKEN."}
{"text":"Got a steak sandwich and cheese sticks after an uneventful evening at the hipster bar next door. Food was okay. Nothing special. The sandwich comes with lettuce and tomatoes by default for some reason. Not sure why Yinzers put either on a steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Update: When we ordered their delivery last night, I also ordered a salad to take to work for lunch today. IT WAS AMAZING.
Romaine, large walnuts halves, mandarins oranges, cranberries, almond slices, Romano cheese, etc.
Carefully chopped and arranged and packaged with a lining on top. They took extra care to leave no water on the greens to pool up on the bottom & make it mushy the.next day. There was not a single leaf that wasn't perfect.
I think I've got a new routine now. :-)"}
{"text":"Try the knots on the appetizer menu and the wings!  We've been back several times since their recent opening and have yet to had something we didn't love.  Wedgie is huge, hoagies are good, fries are good, pizza crust is awesome.  Definitely worth a try.  You can also order and eat at the Milestone next door."}
{"text":"I cannot sit here and really say anything about the food.
 But as I was watching sitting outside I watched one of the employees outside yelling at his girlfriend screaming at her pointing his finger into his face and being very volatile and very scary.
I did call the police I'm not sure what happened I did try to call up there and speak to the owner. I got no response the kid that answer the phone just pretty much like it didn't even mattwr. Even though he was the one that was yelling at his girlfriend outside. I'm really hoping that the owner takes great responsibility to who he is employing and who the people are that are treating people the way they are because if he's willing to have someone like this treaing his girlfriend the way he's treating her than he's willing to treat his his customers the same way."}
{"text":"I ordered Nachos and Tiramisu.  The nachos chips were stale, and the sour cream watery.  The Tiramisu  was frozen.

The drive calls me when he arrived and said.  \"I'm here\"

I said, \"Ok?\"

He says, \"Are you going to accept the order?\"

I said, \"Are you going to come to the door?\"

\"Oh I can't find the house.\""}
{"text":"Anytime I get a new menu in the mail, I have to give it a try. They had a coupon for pizza and a whole hoagie so I gave that a shot. I ordered the pizza with green peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Pizza was fantastic, crispy yet chewy crust. My only complaint would be I wish there was a little more sauce, but other than that a fantastic pie. 

As for the hoagie, I ordered the Texas Roadhouse steak and it was unbelievable. The steak was tender and flavorful and I love a nice soft bun. The onion rings and Santa Fe sauce was a very nice combination.

Another time ordering I got the gyro platter and I was very disappointed. Frozen, pre-sliced gyro meat and a very bland sauce. I also asked for feta cheese which they did not put on. 

Overall I will be ordering from here more often, trying more of the menu. But as of now, its one of the better, if not the best pizza place on Carrick."}
{"text":"Got a new pizza ad in the mail this week, ordered and here's my review. Got the coupon for 2 large 1 topping pizzas and ordered a dozen mild wings. The first pizza was a traditional with pepperoni,  good crust, great taste, definitely a winner. The 2nd was a white pizza with extra cheese, not so much. Not enough sauce on the pizza and seemed like normal cheese nothing extra. The wings were really crispy and had good flavor, my only complaint is my complaint about 90% of wings from pizza shops, the sauce comes off the wings and sits at the bottom of the box. It's not that hard to make a sauce that sticks, I should know I'm a chef. Overall a good meal but not great. Will probably try again but not the white pizza. They also had a fast delivery time which was a good thing."}
{"text":"I have been looking for gluten free Pizza -that's good and BOOM! They have it AND they deliver! 

#glutenfree pizza was a lil thin on the crust side, but overall very good. Added mushrooms and was very satisfied. 

We also got a regular pizza and wings. 

Pizza was good. Fresh ingredients and sauce is actually pretty good. Had a slight sweetness to it. 

Wings I couldn't have since they were fried, but, the consensus was that they were very tasty, lil oily but, overall...not a disappointment.  

We will be ordering more from this pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Save yourself the hassle, ordered a chef salad and a side of buffalo fries, waited over an hour only to get a Italian hoagie. When I called I was told I wasn't over charged? Glad I wasn't over charged for food I didn't order! The solution was a $5 credit for next time! Yeah there won't be a next time!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here tonight because they were on Grubhub and we needed some late night food (11 pm)

Pizza was OK. The chicken fingers were good. The food was pretty basic. Nothing to rave about but nothing bad about it either. They did give me honey mustard for my chicken fingers, which I didn't even ask for, so that was super nice.

They get 4 stars because they are open late AND delivery was here within 20 minutes (originally or says 45). The delivery driver was SO friendly!"}
{"text":"A brand new pizza place just opened in my neighborhood so I needed to try it. We went in to order and take our pizza home to eat. The gentleman working was super nice. We ordered the Di Roma's Special Pie. It has pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage, tomatoes, onions, green peppers, bacon, black olives, and garlic. 
Pizza is such a go to meal and you want it to be a good pizza. This pizza was covered in toppings. They didn't skimp on ingredients. The sauce was flavorful. The crust was sturdy enough to hold all of the toppings yet not feel or taste like cardboard. In fact the crust had hints if garlic. 
I would definitely would put this in my top 3 pizza places. I'm so happy that it's so close by."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here several times and haven't had a problem until today. We went in and asked for the special that was on the GIGANTIC sign on the outside of the store and the gentlemen working was extremely rude. He acted like we were idiots and said \"that was the grand opening special, that was 8 months ago\" okay. That's great then you should take down the giant sign in front of your store advertising the deal was M-F. If he would have been nicer and explained that wasn't the special anymore, it would be a completely different story."}
{"text":"I love that they have wraps and love the Buffalo chicken one.  I love pickles so it's a plus that the wraps come with a pickle. They have decent pizza.  They can be inconsistent though.  One time the pizza will be great the next time it's just meh. My pap noticed that with his hoagie. First time he had it he said it was great the next time it was just ok. I feel like delivery takes forever and I didn't care for their chicken gyro."}
{"text":"Pizza Di Roma is awesome! My partner and I order from them frequently. Their delivery is rather quick and the food is always great. I have never had an issue with their service."}
{"text":"I ordered food and I notified the restaurant I was on the second floor of the apartment up a small set of stairs. I also told the driver I hurt my ankle and could not make it down the stairs. He called and told me he couldn't bring it up because he was busy. He also walked into the downstairs apartment unannounced and was very rude to both me and my neighbor. I called the restaurant and told them what had happened... Haven't heard back from them. They couldn't care less. I know the way employees act is not 100% the restaurant owner/managers fault but the way they handle it says a lot about them.

And from the look of previous reviews this is something the drivers do a lot? Great."}
