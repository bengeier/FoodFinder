{"text":"Our first visit since the new owners took over. 
What we liked:
The one man accordian player was fun and we enjoyed him!
The warm bread/breadsticks. Very yummy and they refilled our basket.
A more flexible menu that allowed you to chose your side dishes.
The owners tableside visit to see how the meal was 
The red cabbage was awesome!
We liked the salad. I never cared for the little plate of pickled veggies that the previous owners served. So salad was a welcome sight to me.

What we didn't like:
Smaller portions, but understandable....
No veal......really? seriously?
The spatzle and the bread dumplings just weren't that great
Our server really didn't know much about the food or the drink menu
The cake/cheesecake was bland. It needed a drizzle of something over it. Caramel or strawerries maybe??

Over all the meal just wasn't that impressive. We love the sausage store next door. I guess I'll just have to cook my own German meal."}
{"text":"We did not know that the old German resturant at 49th Street and Indian School Rd was back for another rendition, but these new owners have knocked it out of the park. They accept reservations which is good, and the service was some of the best I have seen. Our server, Conny, was very attentive and very personable. 
The have a musician playing old German songs and it adds to the atmosphere very well. 
I had the onion soup and it was the best I have ever had, The salad was served family style and very good. The entrees were very good and portions were nice size. For dessert try the Apple Strudel. It was very good. A friend of mine had the Black Forest Cake - pass it. Flavorless - It must be bought at a local grocery store. If I could give 4.5 stars I would. Will return!"}
{"text":"Word on the street is that this place will be closed September 3rd. It's about time. There is nothing good about this place. Tap beer is warm and food is nothing special. It was so much better before."}
{"text":"Last weekend it was my first time to this place and I loved it.   The staff is friendly and authentic.  There is an awesome selection of German Beer and even more German wines.   My sister and I shared the sausauge platter for two which was amazing along with some other apetizers.   Everything we ate was really good.   The restaurant was clean and so were the bathrooms.  Although its hard to top a great beer and sausage the band playing did a great job competing.  It was so much fun!  One of the other guests knew some authentic german dances and taught us all.   This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great service, food and selection!  Get your oktoberfest in das boot and you're sure to have a great night...french onion soup is amazing...GO SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BUSINESS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Jaeger Schnitzel.  Sauce barely ok, looks like it was made with canned mushrooms.  Second time I was here with comparable disappointing results.
Ate at the bar and though friendly, the staff seemed overmatched.  Slow for everything.
Haus Murphy much better though portions at both are on the small side.
The one-man band with playing German songs was hilarious.

Bottom line, when you need to stop at Del Taco on the way back to the hotel, ..............."}
{"text":"This place blew me away the food was great. The atmosphere is very authentic, the owner comes over and greets every table. The fillet mignon and the lamb were to die for. There selection of drinks is impressive, I don't drink but I still had to add a note. 

Its a bit on the pricey side but luckily they advertise on the Resturants.com site so I hooked up a $50 off coupon for $4! Highly recommend this restaurant to any German enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service was poor and the food, not so great. Maybe my expectations were too high since I lived in Germany for 3 years. It looked like an old banquet hall that older people hang out at. I really wanted to love this place, but i just didn't."}
{"text":"I try very hard not to be negative, but this was the worst German food  I've ever eaten!!!!  They're located next to a German deli, so I thought it would be a slam dunk!  I lived in Germany for many years, and have had good and bad, but this was not even close to authentic!!!  \"Bavarian Dumpling\" was nothing more than a tasteless lump of wet bread.  The potatato pancackes were definitely pre-made and frozen.  The \"Wiener Schnitzel\" was not a hand pounded pork cutlet and breaded...it was two perfectly formed frozen patties that were absolutly aweful!  Frozen food, and no real cooking, this place needs to go away....the beer must keep wanna be Germans coming back, because it is'nt the food!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Black Forest Haus last Saturday evening. Things that I liked: the live music and the German atmosphere.  Things I disliked: the service and the food. 
I won't be going back to the Black Forest Haus. The waitress had little to no knowledge about the menu. I have only recently been introduced to German food and one thing that I enjoy about eating food from other cultures is knowing what I am eating. Unfortunately, our waitress had one answer to the questions I asked: \"I don't know.\". She didn't know any of the sauces and didn't know how anything was cooked. For example, my 9-year-old wanted to know something basic aboit hollandaise.  But the waitress had no idea what hollandaise was! 
I ordered a piece of pork....it's whatever their special was for the night...and it was completely bland. The potato pancakes were dry and the bread dumplings tasted like raw dough. 
I will not go back here. I had read the other views that said the restaurant was not good and now I wish I had heeded their advice to choose another place. I definitely won't be back. 
I'm giving 2 stars for the cute little old man that played the accordion. ;)"}
{"text":"Housed in what was formerly was Black Forest Mill, Black Forest Haus, was opened by the same owners as the Matterhorn Grill in Flagstaff, chef Klaus Baechle and his wife Nancy. The space is more or less unchanged with a few art pieces added as well as a fresh coat of paint. The massive main hall is complete with a large open dance floor which on Friday and Saturday nights is set up for live traditional German music. I don't know about you but I'm always looking for a chance to wear my lederhosen and whoop it up to a good polka.

The menu is a short list featuring many traditional German dishes and while most think of German food as only sausages and pretzels, they might be surprised by hearty roasted meats, stews and schnitzels. 

I've owned a fondue pot for years but not once have ever used it. The idea of eating hot molten cheese sounds amazing but for whatever reason I just have never gotten around to making it. So when I noticed Swiss Cheese Fondue ($15) on the menu, I thought of my orange cast iron pot sitting there collecting dust. So when a ceramic bowl of what looked like seized gravy was delivered, I figured there was something wrong. Asking our server she revealed \"that's how we serve it\", maybe my expectations were higher? 

Traditionally made with veal, a schnitzel recipe can also be made with boneless pork loin or chicken breasts pounded into cutlets. Now with the addition of a sour cream sauce makes it a Rahmschnitzel ($18), guess I should have asked for a description before I ordered it. You see I had envisioned a lightly breaded and fried schnitzel with creamy gravy. So when my schnitzel arrived, it was actually pan cooked and not fried like I was hoping for. So I swallowed my bitter pill along with my first bite, fork tender deliciousness. My only wish is that they had not been out of mashed potatoes; something about putting gravy on a baked potato just didn't work for me.

Haus also has a selection of nightly specials which include 2 sides at a great price. If you ever see Schweinehaxen ($19) listed on the specials board, order it. Schweinehaxen is either a roasted pork knuckle or shank that's been cooked until the meat is fall of the bone tender and the skin is crispy and chewy. For the serious pig lover, the skin was cooked so well that it's like eating a piece of lacquered pork candy. Along side I had little dumplings called sp√§tzle and a wonderfully flavorful stewed red cabbage, these both added to the delight of each and every piggy bite.

Sitting here writing I can't help but think of the additively porky Schweinehaxen. The richness of the meat being cut by the acidity of the stewed red cabbage, it's not only what's for dinner, but it's what foodie dreams are made of."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight for the first time because we had a great coupon (and because my husband is Austrian) and it was really good!

I do have to say though, German food is not everyone's cup of tea, so keep that in mind.  I'm not quite sure how to accurately put it into words, other than it's just simply \"different.\"

The service was really good, and even the owner or someone in high management came by to ask how we were doing, if we were enjoying it, etc.  But he wasn't annoying and lingering or anything, just a quick friendly hello.

The set up is nothing fancy, but cute and homey. My husband instantly loved it and felt at home.  

The reason I give it 4 stars is because I wasn't a fan of our appetizer, but that is it, just a preference thing. The appetizer we had was (I can't remember the German name) but it was the trout.  It came out prepared like I'm not used to...tail attached, and cold. Not my cup of tea, but my husband loved it, because that's what he's used to.

For our entrees, I had a shnitzel which was good, and my husband had \"rinds rouladen\" which in the description honestly sounds disgusting, but I tried it and it was good as well.  All entrees come with a yummy salad, good rolls, and two sides of your choice.

Overall a great experience! I'm sure we'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful and the food was amazing. I had the jager schnitzel in a mushroom/bacon gravy with spaetzel. So tasty. I also highly recommend their cheesecake dessert. It's out of this world and definitely not your typical cheesecake."}
{"text":"My family & I have eaten here several times and we've always enjoyed our experience.  Our little one is a bit of a picky eater and it's always a challenge trying to find a place to eat where when we leave I feel confident that she has a good meal in her tummy.  We have absolutely no problem worrying about that here.  Our waitress tonight, Conny, was great as usual!  It was my husbands birthday so she brought him his desert w/ a candle and had Bill Regina, the Polka guy, make a special birthday announcement, followed up with a birthday song from him & the crowd.  Thanks again Conny!!! :o)  The owner always makes his rounds to ensure that everything is going well, which I think is great!  Yes the portions did shrink, but the food is still delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  Under different ownership, when it was the German Corner, the portions were HUGE, but we're in different times now people!!  Besides, who really needs portions that size anyhow?!?  We DO have an issue in America w/ obesity and portion sizes are a major cause, so I can appreciate a smaller portion.  Also, smaller portions allow for more room to try different items from the menu, like the potato/bacon soup,....YUM!  The dressing on the salad is also very tasty.  I highly recommend giving it a try.  To each his/her own...."}
{"text":"My first experience with German food, and I can honestly say it didn't leave me wanting to eat it ever again.  The service was \"eh\", the food was WAY over-priced (I ordered the special - a chicken breats stuffed with swiss & cream cheeses topped with a honey-cinnamon sauce)...the chicken was good, but the portion was about 1/3 of the size of what one would expect a $15.00 stuffed chicken breast to look like.  

We were a party of 9, 4 of whom ordered another special, which by 7:00pm on a Saturday night they were already out of...but our waitress didn't inform us of this until our order had already been taken and 20 minutes had passed.  It took over 20 minutes to get our salad and rolls, neither one of which was enough for 9 people, and refills took another 15 minutes to be brought to the table.  

For a reservation at 6:30pm, we didn't receive our entrees until 8:00pm, which, without sauces or gravy, the food was incredibly dry!!!  In addition to the bad service and dry, small-portioned food, the music (some old guy playing an accordion) was way too loud, and we were in the back of the restaurant having to scream across the table to have a conversation.  All in all, not a good experience, and I would recommend friends to steer clear rather than to experience the Black Forest Haus ever again."}
{"text":"Limited selection of draft beers.  Staff was polite but often absent, and this can be frustrating with an empty stein in front of you and the desire to order food, but no menu has been offered yet.  Lot of German folks here, so overall can't be bad.  I had one appetizer and it was fairly good.  Daytime visit didn't seem terribly busy.  Will try again."}
