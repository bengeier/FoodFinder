{"text":"I don't know if what they serve here qualifies as food! I guess if you like springy fish and acidic pasta sauce this place might be for you."}
{"text":"For dorm food, this is pretty delicious! Rheta's has a huge variety of fresh, reasonable options. Whether you're in the mood for Mexican, pasta, or comfort food, you'll be able to find something tasty. My favorite is the Szechuan stir fry from the Mongolian grill at Global Kitchen. The build your own sandwiches are a super inexpensive, convenient way to go if you're in a hurry. They even have fresh mozzarella!The salad bar has plenty of options, and the homemade desserts always hit the spot. My favorite is when they have caramel apples around Halloween. Don't forget to grab some milk from Babcock Dairy to complete your meal!"}
{"text":"Rheta's is the best dining hall on campus, full stop. It was recently remodeled and is a genuinely impressive facility for a residential establishment. I worked at Rheta's back in 2013 and can confirm that everything is top notch in terms of hygiene and quality. The pizzas are crafted by hand, the burgers are grilled right in front of you, and the main dinner entr√©es are always prepared by full-time chefs. Perhaps the highlight of the venue is the huge Mongolian grill, which serves authentic build-your-own eastern cuisine. There are a large variety of meal choices here that are sure to please anyone from the pickiest eaters to the snobbiest food critics. On top of that, the prices are quite reasonable. Bottom line, you gotta check this place out."}
