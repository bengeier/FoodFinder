{"text":"I liked the Oyakodon and the Chicken Curry Katsudon. My friend got the BBQ Chicken Don however the chicken was extremely hard, dry and cold, as if they just heated up some left over chicken but not thoroughly. We told the waitress and she brought it back to the kitchen to get my friend a fresh bowl. The service was good and the food is usually okay too."}
{"text":"2.5 Tried a couple of item including the beef rice bowl, curry chicken, udon. The beef rice was dry, not much onion or sauce, the curry chicken was nothing special, have ate much better ones, the udon is average.  For the portion and quality, I would say the price is a bit high.  The place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Ordered the curry chicken katsu, grilled squid appetizer, and the gyuu beef rice. My friend and I both got soup and salad. Soup was bland and the salad looked like it was old. The curry clearly tasted like it was out for 2 hours where it was starting to settle into gelatine form. Not to mention there were mosquitos and flies everywhere which was disgusting and made me lose my appetite. I kept having to swat them away from my food. For the location they were in, I could get way better quality food for the same price. I would never go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Donburi (beef rice bowl), chicken dumplings, and curry fried chicken rice (I think it was called Curry Katsu Don).  Went with my mom who doesn't speak English so I appreciate that the menu had Japanese, Chinese, and English.   Curry is not spicy at all, but that's what I expect from an Asian curry. Despite that, it is still very flavourful and you can still taste spices (though not hot ones).   Food was delicious, and of very large portions. Interior is clean. Orders were taken very quickly. The food arrived VERY quick as well.   Good experience overall and bottom line: food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the deep fried chicken kastsu don - A little too much rice, and way too much bulldog sauce on the chicken katsu. Personally, did not enjoy"}
{"text":"Great value, good food but service can be quite slow at times.  But the food it defiantly worth it :)."}
{"text":"Ordered katsudon and katsu with curry. Like all other reviews. Pork is too dry and tough. I wish the owner would read the reviews and start making changes to their pork chop."}
{"text":"Great welcome. The chef and the owner were so smiley! There was even an Asian Santa Claus we took pictures with :)"}
{"text":"This place is like the aji-sen of japanese ramen.  A failed attempt at imitating japanese food.    Service: Okay, except they do a really embarrassing \"irrashaimase\" and even worse \"arigatougozaimasu\".  Just like Ajisen.  sad.  Food: Poor imitation.  Tried the gyuudon, katsudon, karaage (stop calling it \"car-raggy\").  All were below par.  WAY too salty.    Price: Average.  not much to complain about the price. sorry!  Wont be going back.  Anyone who thinks this place is authentic is delusional or severely misinformed.  Anything at j-town is better than here.  Might even taste better making it at home."}
{"text":"Ordered donkatsu curry rice, spicy beef fries and green tea ice cream.   We visited around 430 so it's pretty empty and we were  seated pretty quickly.   Cold waters were given without asking what we want. Would be nice to have an option for hot tea or hot water in this cold weather.   Spicy beef fries were nice. Onions were on the hard side. Personally I preferred soft ones.   Donkatsu were very hard. Had to chew pretty hard to bite it off. :(  Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Fairly tasty, but too small to be completely satisfying, then just a simple donburri combo. Chicken and rice were tasty, salad was moderate, but miso soup was quite salty 7.5/10 saltiness (10 being undrinkable)"}
{"text":"Best shrimp tempura I've ever had. Omurice was excellent as well. Highly recommend for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Their Gyudon (beef) bowl was amazing. Especially with the onsen egg. Their katsudon wasn't too shabby either. Service was great and the owner will definitely put a smile on your face. Place has a modern Japanese feel and has free wifi. What more can you ask for. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Reasonable prices and good portions. The curry and onigiri are pretty good.  I'd recommend ordering the grilled onigiri as opposed to the regular, since it falls apart easily. I personally don't understand charging an extra $1 to grill the onigiri, as that only takes an extra minute. Hopefully they'll restructure their menu in the future to reflect this nonsense, but only time will tell.  They're always improving and I notice changes to the dishes every week I go there."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner several weeks ago.  Ordered beef and rice with egg.  I felt there was too much rice.  Curry was ok, too much rice as well.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Food tasted ok in general.  I did like the fact you can replace your rice with tofu if you didn't feel like having rice.  However, Hygiene/cleanliness does matter to me and there were quite a few fruit flies around our dishes that put me off and reason I would not come back.  There are ways to catch fruit flies, perhaps the owners need to google or look into."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place has a 3.5 star rating.  I ordered the curry chicken katsu don and OMG.   First off the chicken was way overcooked and flavorless. The curry tasted like store bought curry. The coleslaw had a sesame flavoured sauce which also tasted store bought. And the worst part was the rice was not even cooked properly, it was dry. I could of done a better job cooking rice at home myself.  1 star for decor and service."}
{"text":"Finally a place that has a non starch option. The no rice Gyu Don was so delicious with lettuce strips and fried tofu bits got to go again talking about it"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time it was pretty good. The food is decent and the service was good.  Although I've only come late at night and there were only a few other tables with couples.  It's not your typical Japanese restaurant with sushi.  The prices are fair for the portions.  I always leave feeling satisfied.  The food is tasty and they have some interesting flavours for the different dishes.  I like that they are open late and the food has been consistent."}
{"text":"Onsen egg ( poached egg in broth ) as sauce to the Beef Rice Bowl,  very unique!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and I have no complaints. The food is affordable (~$10) and tastes great! I've tried their omurice, unagi rice, takoyaki, and some other appetizers. The omurice is by far my favourite and I get it every time! Entré portions are decent, but when we got appetizers like spare ribs, we only got around 5 pieces.   I still highly recommend coming here for the cheap and good quality food. Once we checked-in on yelp and got free ice cream! Great deal !!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to enjoy this place but it was only ok. I ordered the tuna tataki don and while the tuna would have been fine they added too mich flavour powder and that was all I could taste.  The rice was extremely dry, which probably works well with their saucier options but with the tuna it created a distracting texture.  that said I'll probably give them another try sometime with their more popular menu items.  They have a  decently sized menu and a few non-meat options (but still w egg for most of them) so I hope my next meal there will leave me a bit more impressed."}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed. We got several dishes and only one of them was really good.   Service:  -Kind of slow. We got seated pretty quickly but they forgot to give us water.  -Kind of hard to get the servers attention.   Environment: -The layout of the restaurant is not that good, especially when the restaurant is full. The middle tables basically block off the paths to the booths, so you have to walk completely around the tables to get to the booths. -I like the drawings they had on the walls.   Nankotsu:  -Wouldn't recommend. It tasted ok but most of it was hard cartilage, so we couldn't even eat it.   Uzura Maki: -This was amazing! It's so simple but it was so delicious.   Wasabi Beef: -The wasabi flavour was very strong and the beef was well done.   Katsudon: -I was quite disappointed. The pork cutlet was overcooked. It was pretty dry and plain. -The sauce they put over the rice was good though.  Chicken Katsu Curry Rice: -The curry had a good, strong flavour.  -It was much better than the Katsudon."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night (around 11) and when we arrived, there was only one other table in the restaurant.   My guest and I were seated immediately and given waters and menus. I really enjoyed that there was a good variety of things for you to choose from.   Having decided what we ordered, we waited about 10 minutes before the server attended to us. He was spending most of his time with a table that arrived after us.   The rest of the staff were standing behind the cash chatting. We were hungry and the fact that no one waited us until 10 minutes after already ruined our experience.   We ordered the gyozas, they were hard and cold because it had been sitting up on the window and no one saw it. It also came with a sour sauce that did not taste good.   We also ordered the renkon chips that ended up coming out at the end of our meal. They were soggy and not crispy...the oil probably wasn't hot enough when they dropped it in.   I ordered the oyaku don and my guest ordered the pork katsu rice. Both were average and does not live up to the hype that's on here. My meal literally tasted like soy sauce and rice. There were maybe 4 pieces of chicken in there. The pork katsu was small and the curry was not good.   No one came to check up on our meals or to ask if everything was okay. We ended up walking up to the counter to pay.   I really wanted to like this place because it's opened late but my guest and I did not enjoy the food or service here and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I recently took my mom and brother here since they said they've never been. We started the meal off with appetizers of okra skewers and port toro. Both were good. They have quite a large selection of appetizers so it's good for groups to share.  Don portions here are pretty big. I can barely finish a bowl of the shiitake don. I always say I'll try the natto don, but I end up getting the shiitake don instead. My brother ordered chicken omurice and mom ordered katsu don. They both enjoyed their meals thoroughly and my brother said halfway through his meal that he would definitely be back again. They also agreed that the katsu don better than the omurice.  Prices are also very decent for a sit in restaurant. Most of their entrees cost between $8 and $13, which is decent for a sit-in restaurant. I've never been when it's busy, but they were able to bring our food out pretty quickly and were attentive. I imagine that a lot of groups come in here considering their location. They also serve alcohol here: sake or even a cold sapporo. Perfect pairing with a don. Mm mm."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service, came to the store in late night, we were told the chef is eating dinner, and would took 10 min. And we said there's no big deal. But we waited like 20 min and the manager told us there's another 20 min. We feel being trolled and the manager said well, you are always welcome to leave......."}
{"text":"Good quality and quantity for the price you pay. You can get a three course meal for around $10.  Con - they only serve you water, no tea"}
{"text":"Few waitress working at the time, depending which one you get - you get different services... With my luck I got one so-so attitude. -1  Tried ordering something off the menu, but they were out of oysters. Which is fine as I ordered something else, but right after that I found out I had to pay 1 dollar for tea which I haven't heard of at similar restaurants. (It wasn't the best tea also - save your money) -1  I ordered beef with rice, which was a bit more than average. This is def the upside of the whole meal. They also give you an option to add more beef for 2 dollars more, or switch rice with lettuce + other veggies.   Overall experience it was \"A-OK\". I wouldn't recommend it, but will come back if I need a quick meal..."}
{"text":"Note: Went there for their soft opening..  Tried their with Onsen Egg + Beef Don and Katsu Don.. The beef was good the portion of beef was not enough, it came with the Japanese Marinated Ginger and pickle with rice.  Egg was on par with other Ramen can offer.. probably just on par at max with a la carte Japanese owned restaurante around town..  as my name suggested... Value aka bang for the bucks is really my focus.. in my opinion, Doburi are supposed to be economical.. yet the dinner was overpiced 10+ with the egg, and green tea was extra..   One more thing that was a little turned off:  Correct me if I am wrong.. this place is not related to  (yoshinoya).. while it can be misleading by the Chinese name and their advertisements on Chinese media..and google searched Donburi () and seems like this is only location..  While I liked their marketing and atmosphere, staffs are not well trained and not very genuine doing the \"Izakaya\" like greetings... the head wait staff have to literally keep saying the word a couple times before others can react.."}
{"text":"Its a relatively new place. There is allot of turnover in this plaza, and im not sure this place will be around in a year. It a decent place, with decent food, just not spectacular. I sampled a few of the dishes, and they were very edible, but nothing to write home about. I went maybe 3-4 times when it first opened, but havnt gone back since.  Better choices in this plaza."}
{"text":"Been a here a few times, and still only ordered Gyudon ... But yeah , I would say it a bit pricey actually, since you get nothing but just tea and a dish, I have to pay extra for a bit of kimchi. Then a dessert which I literally had to control my self not to chunk it down in one bite LOL.  The taste isn't that great compared to restaurants I've been to in. HongKong. I remember once the rice was soaked in broth it was like soup and rice I had to ask for an exchange since I couldn't stand it. I'm not a regular here, I come here just to deal with my sudden  Gyudon crave since there's no where else I know of around this area that has Gyudon"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my family for a quick lunch. We ordered a tempura don ($8.50), a chicken katsu don ($8.50), and a carbless gyuudon ($8). The tempura don was a little on the dry side, but the other two were pretty good! The carbless gyuudon was like the regular gyuudon ($9.50), but instead of rice, they gave us cabbage and fried tofu as the base. All combos came with a soup, salad, and drink (coffee or milk tea). Portions were decent, and were well worth their lunch price. We also ended up ordering a wasabi beef skewer for $2.50. We didn't realize 1 order was 1 small skewer, and the beef also turned up very dry. I don't think we'll be ordering that again. All in all, I'd give the food 3.5 stars.   In terms of service, the service was VERY SLOW. At the beginning, the waitress forgot to give us water when we sat down. We had to ask her twice before she served us some. The food also took a while to come. It took them over 15 minutes before serving us our soup and salad, and another 20 minutes until the dons actually came. When we finally wanted the bill, all the waiters were in the kitchen, so we couldn't ask for anyone to get us the receipt. It took them over 5 minutes until a waiter actually came back out to serve us again. Overall, I'd give the service 2.5 stars.   Despite the service, I think I will visit again because of their lunch special."}
{"text":"Donburi was good! The portion is pretty big and it's just a nice place to eat with a few friends. The waiters sometimes took a while to notice that I was calling them. But, overall, I would come again if I'm craving for some warm Japanese food."}
{"text":"Sitting here with 4 of my work friends, can't really comment on the food, as after 45 minutes in an almost empty restaurant 2 of us have still not received our order, 3 have eaten 2 have sat patiently waiting, but too no avail.  My suggestion, don't waste your time. If they can't fulfill a simple order when almost empty, dread to think what happens when busy"}
{"text":"The appetizers were the best part of the meal. The seats we had we very cramped, my wife and I were pushed up against the table and still had constant staff bump our tables. Why put a table there if there's already so limited room? We were branded with permanent markers when we walked in and said it was for billing purposes. Not sure how that made sense when they forgot to put in my wife's order.  I felt out of place going to this restaurant, and would not recommend anyone with families coming here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Japanese dining experience, this probably isn't it.  But the food here certainly hits the spot.  Appetizers are on the expensive end in my opinion, but main course items are more reasonable.  Everything on the menu is equally delicious, and packed full of flavours with every bite.  Portions are the perfect size for me - just enough.  I only ever visit during off peak hours, so I've always had quick and friendly service.  After trying several items on their menu, my personal favourite is their Don Katsu.  They had some Soft Shell Crab Tacos a year or two ago as a special item, I wish they would bring those back.  They were expensive, but so delicious!"}
{"text":"I was skeptic going to this place since it's Cantonese run. Regardless I went and was not disappointed. It opens till 4am on weekends and have free wifi. It's catered towards the young people and the business lunch crowd, basically people who wants a good fast meal.  I had the gyudon and my bro had the oyako don. They're both pretty good. The beef had a lot of flavour and the rice is perfectly moist from the juices. I could've had half with a friend and be full. The complimentary miso was just okay.   Great fast food place. Would come back again to try their yakitori stuff or for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Great value for money.  Wonderful staff.  Loved their chicken karage and their gyoza. My son loved the chicken teriyaki udon. Would definitely come back. My son already asking when"}
{"text":"This is the second time eating here. The first time I ordered the basic donburi. That was pretty good.   Now I'm back and I ordered the ten don. We put in our order and asked for green tea. Guess what... ONE..DOLLAR..FOR..GREEN..TEA...at a japanese restaurant.. Go figure.. Anyways, we ordered some waters. Here's a point off for service and presentation - my boyfriend's meal came about 5 minutes before mine. It's two orders people! Bring them out at the same damn time! Second point to the presentation thing - his bowl had pieces of the food stuck on the outside bowl.. Gross.  Now for the food. I'm Japanese, so I know what a proper ten don is supposed to look and taste like. The photo on the menu looked good, so I ordered it. When I got it, it was a bowl of rice with some tempura on top. It was a good amount of tempura (3 pieces of shrimp and a bunch of veggies) but that's basically it. And when I finished the tempura and got to the rice, I saw that they had sprinkled it with ???? (furikake)!!!!! Seriously? So disappointed.. There was no egg, no sautéed onions, and it was DEFINITELY not any ten don that I've ever had.   Now I'm gonna head to chatime for something good."}
{"text":"Last 3 times I been there, they have been giving bad service. One of the server was a giving me and my wife bad attitudes. Try to contact the owner but not successful. Will not go back for sure.  3 strikes you are out!!!"}
{"text":"Very satisfying and good sized portions for a good price. Tip - check in on yelp for a free green tea ice cream!  Omurice  Essentially fried rice in an egg omelet covered with sauce. I love this dish. The rice is flavoured with a tangy sweet and sour kind of sauce, which I also think is one of the sauces covering the egg. I thought there could have been more chicken but still very flavourful and enjoyable dish.  Donburi signature onigiri  Seasoned rice rolled into a ball is the best way to describe this. Not too special to be honest. I don't think I'll get this again.  Gyuu curry rice  Personally I like my Gyuu and curry separate instead of together. There was a lot of curry which some might find too much, but at least they're not cheaping out! The curry was rich and flavourful. The Gyuu was also nicely marinated and flavourful.  Overall very good value. I went to Moji in Markham recently and Donburi definitely has better value and better taste. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Although this is only my third time here I'm in love with the no rice gyuu don and haven't really ordered anything else, so my opinion may be bias. The no rice alternative is basically thin crisp shredded lettuce and perfectly fried tofu topped with gyuu don & I always add the egg!  It comes with miso soup and salad. All that for $10 how could you go wrong? The first time the dinner service was fast and pleasant. Second time was for lunch, which took longer than I expected, so I probably wouldn't come for lunch again. So third time here and with friends.... Enjoy the pictures!"}
{"text":"Not authentic Japanese don, the snacks are okay, and the place is over price for their food quality."}
{"text":"This place has really bad customer service, food suck and expensive. Food ain't warm at all. Avoid this place at all cost. There are tons of other better places around in commerce gate for cheaper and better food."}
{"text":"Delicious dons but a bit pricey. They play anime on their TV and have a bar or high chairs for seating."}
{"text":"I had some lunch with other 3 people, we ordered 1 curry chicken with rice, 1 curry pork with rice, 1 their signature beef, 1 chicken with egg and rice, total was $44. The prices are fair because they each comes with a salad and miso soup, their portion are great and makes you pretty full. Their curry are amazing, they're close to those ones in hk. My sister highly highly recommend their chicken mixed egg with rice! Overall, this place is great, tidy and clean, services are great as well."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and I've chosen to review the place since it has a new menu now and better reflects what this restaurant is capable of.   The price of the food is very competitive to restaurants that are similar but Donburi edges out because they have great portion sizes.  My favourite menu items are the gyuudon, katsudon, and karrage. It's always a rotation between those three and always amazing. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming and the staff is great. I love the events/promotions that happen, including their sensei program to earn free rice bowls.   Great new addition to the area since you won't want dumplings and sezchaun food everyday."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. I love this place! I first tried it when it opened in June and love going back every single time. I've tried their Pork Katsu, Shrimp Tempura Udon, Teriyaki Chicken Udon, Famous Beef Rice Bowl, Cuttlefish skewers, Takoyaki octopus balls, Japanese style fried chicken wings and ... soooo good I COULD EAT IT EVERYDAY OF MY LIFE! and OMG the desserts! They have green the creme brûlée now.. sooooo good. They are decently priced for the portions you get and the service is phenomenal. They always give you mango candies at the end! I just went yesterday for dinner and today for afternoon snacks and I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Donburi is one of my favourite spots to come for a late night munch. Being right beside where my gf lives, whenever we can't think of a spot we can always rely on Donburi. I usually get the chicken katsu on rice and for $10 it really fills me up. We also get the taponyaki balls as an app. and it's delicious. Would recommend 10/10 and have nothing negative about this place. :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled on Donburi on their first \"soft opening\" day. We ordered : -beef with rice and opted to add an egg for $1 more. (yes get the egg!). This rice dish was flavourful and beef was tender. yay! (most places mess this dish up). The egg was out of this world good. Came in a little dish bathed in sauce similar to tempura dipping sauce. I think the egg was steamed until the yolk was soft and runny. Egg white was soft like silky tofu. -soba noodle soup with grilled salmon. I didn't like the soba much as it was a little soft for my liking. (probably cause it was sitting in the broth). I think soba is always better cold. Grilled salmon was done to perfection. Not overcooked at all.  -udon soup and tempura. I really liked the udon noodles! They had the right amount of \"chewiness\" (for lack of better word).  I was told by the manager that they make their tempura dipping sauce in house. wow!  I upgraded my coffee to \"premium coffee\". meh! I felt nothing too special about it, other than the fact that it came in a cute little coffee filter pouch. It tasted same as any coffee from a pot brew.  another bonus, was the friendly and excellent service! all the servers and waitstaff spoke fluent English. They all worked hard to provide good customer service (that's a breath of fresh air in this area!).  I'm looking forward to coming back to try their Japanese breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"First time here and I had to say i was instantly pleased when i saw their choice of movie playing ( Thor!)   Anyways restaurant review right soo i got the Oyako don because i love it and try it whenever i can. The proportion was big; lots of rice and chicken to accomodate. What i did not like was that i felt they did not have enough egg and maybe this is something that they can change in the future.  Got miso soup and salad which I guess are complementary. They were okay; the salad that I got was a bit brown and not crisp...so I guess it was old or some special kind of lettuce...  Also got the Green tea creme brulee cuz you know japanese place gotta have some green tea somewhere...my opinions on this is that the sugar really covered up the green tea taste. So it could have been they did not have enough green tea or they thot too much green tea may make it bitter. Someone else may like it more so it depends  As for a drink there was this Strawberry lime alcoholic drink which was served in a chilled cup (wad up) and it tasted pretty... it tasted pretty. Worth a try.  Visit #2 I got the omurice this time. Sauce was nice. Portion was not as big as the Oyako don so I was still a bit hungry. Luckily there was the free green tea ice cream from yelp to fill me up.  Food +3 Friendly staff, clean place+1 4 stars =P"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the service and environment here, it is very welcoming. They always start off with a miso soup that is not too salty or bland which i really like because other places would always over-do the taste. Their rice bowls are packed with vegetables and meat that are really seasoned and flavourful. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Hmmm not sure what the hype is about this place. We ordered their special meat Donburi with a few toppings (topping options were bean sprouts, egg, kimichi etc, they charge a dollar extra). We also got a few sides including their fried chicken.  The bowl tasted ok. My rice was a bit soggy. Fried chicken was a bit dry"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here all the time and never been disappointed... nomnomnom..."}
{"text":"This is actually my 2nd time at Donburi and decided to come here after my boyfriend won a contest from markhamfoods instagram. We were given a free app (Gyu fries) and we also ordered a Katsu Don, Ikayaki (grill squid) and the 1lb of Nagoya wings.   All in all, the food was pretty good. The fries were decent, slightly watery when we got down to the bottom (maybe we ate too slow). There was a lot of rice in the katsu don (filling for sure if you're craving rice!) The wings are decent - had the option of spicy or nagoya flavoured. I asked for the spicy sauce on the side, which didnt end up being too spicy to begin with and kind of just reminded me of sweet rib sauce. The Ikayaki was really good!! I had some before that I couldnt even chew through. This one was really tender.   Aside from the server helping us throughout dinner, a lady (who I'm assuming is the owner) came by and congratulated my Boyfriend for coming by and winning the contest. We chatted for a bit and she wanted to make sure everything was okay. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered from here again because I was dying to try a chicken heart skewer!  Delivery again was fast and cheap the server on the phone was helpful at explaining what everything was (as I am new to Japanese food)  If you are looking to be a little adventurous and are curious about Japanese food I do recommend going here and don't be afraid to try something that seems a little odd!  Ps. The chicken hearts are not gross at all they taste pretty good and infact I thought they taste more similar to beef."}
{"text":"We came in at midnight and for a place that opens late, it was pretty good food. The deep fried chicken don however was hard and felt like it was just microwaved after being deep fried long ago. Other than that, everything else was yummy and the servers were sweet!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And price is reasonable. Good quality. For the amount they charge it can get any better. And also great place to study"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. The donburi meals are very filling. The meat is good texture and the polar beers are interesting. However, it is slightly pricier than other donburi places and service is slow at times."}
{"text":"This is comfort food for hubby and I. Everything we have ordered has been delicious. We started with gyoza (fried dumplings). Hubby ordered their signature beef with add on egg, oyster on a stick and rice ball and I ordered the short rib donburi. The service is always friendly and usually don't have to wait for too long for a table."}
{"text":"I think our mistake was dropping in on Valentine's Day without checking to see what was happening. There was an event happening called 'Sweetheart Cafe'. The servers were dressed as maids and butlers (a la Japanese culture) and you could play games with the servers to collect stickers and redeem for prizes. One of the prizes was being fed by either one of the maids or butlers...take from that what you may.   It made for a very loud and noisy restaurant with obnoxious drinkers.   The restaurant was very busy, there was a camera person and interviews happening, a photo booth, and generally I felt the restaurant was too busy for the space allotted. Our table was looked to be temporary, and was pushed up against a temporary set up they had for their event - meaning the wait staff and event staff were always at the table, we were pushed every minute or so as the chairs for our table were set up right by their utensil station.  Once seated, we were given the set menu for the evening but we declined to join in this and instead looked for their regular menu.  The food was okay, but I've had better - nothing was too memorable but the entrée portion sizes were generous. I wasn't able to finish my food. However, the rice to topping ratio was rather high.  The appetizers were fresh but needed to be seasoned better, portion sizes were also quite small for this - I expected a bit more. We ordered the pork toro skewer and wasabi beef. There wasn't very much wasabi flavour and the pork wasn't seasoned very well.  They also numbered each guest with permanent marker upon entry and specified that we each had to order on separate sheets to ensure order accuracy. It gave the restaurant an overall 'unprofessional' feel. However, they still lost our order and I had to wait a long time to get my complete order.   We were also shorted a salad and soup since our orders were misplaced. I also ordered a signature onigiri which was not very memorable, and I would suggest passing on this next time. This was the last item to arrive in our order and by then it wasn't really worth even having.  We also had to ask for our tea since it was never served and the wait staff didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink. I had to flag them down myself to ask for spoons, napkins, tea, our food etc. No one came to check on us during our meal.  My suggestion would be to have them think again before trying to pull off this sort of partnership in such a small space. I understand and respect that they wanted to create a fun atmosphere but execution is key and this came off more as a bunch of teenagers throwing a party than a legitimate business.   All in all, I think the experience would have been better on a regular day but would caution those thinking of coming to reconsider."}
{"text":"Best curry chicken katsu I've ever had! Highly recommend this place :). Service was excellent as well! I will most definitely be back soon @nomsoftoronto."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the service has been really excellent. However, the food is quite mediocre. The fried cutlets are too dry. Omurice (omelette with rice) has too much sauce on top. The soba noodles sauce taste like sewage water. I don't find the main dinner menu appealing at all. The snacks are the only thing worth eating. For ex) spicy gyu fries, takoyaki, and beef tataki."}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant with a large group last nite. Unfortunately the restaurant never served me the several appetizers which I had ordered. My fellow diners were aghast at the extremely poor service considering that I had arrived early and had placed my order with the owner himself. The server consulted with the kitchen and rudely informed me that my order had been pushed to the back! He then abruptly served me the main course. Rather than suffer the humiliation of such erratic behavior, I felt obliged to politely leave. The bad taste of this experience will linger for a loooooong time."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner the other night. We got the beef short ribs? don, pork katsu curry don, scallop skewer and the chicken fish sauce? skewer. Didn't really pay attention to the names.  Skewers didn't have much flavour which was a bit disappointing. The short ribs don smelled great, flavour was decent, but slightly too salty. My katsu don came a little late and the katsu was a little burnt. Meat was a little dry, but the curry had a decent taste.   Overall, my favourite part was the free ice cream we got when we checked in, but hey, I just really like green tea ice cream. Unfortunately, I probably won't come here again unless there was nothing else to eat in the area. Really didn't feel like there was anything special about the place."}
{"text":"It's been quite a bit of time since the last time I visited this restaurant. Since the first time, they seem to have gotten rid of the cranky granny that used to run the cashier (which was why I have avoided the establishment), and have made the wise choice of hiring charming people with a great attitude! The waitresses made sure we were satisfied and provided excellent service throughout the meal. Although not for those who are in a budget with a large stomach, the food is tasty and is well presented. However, as a big takoyaki fan, I was not impressed with theirs (I believe the sauce was what killed it). The highlight of the meal was the cake set that we ordered at the end, they were elegant, very different and is something to try for those with an adventurous sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant twice and I keep coming back for their famous Donburi Beef Bowl. Such a simple dish but so packed with delicious flavours! Good portion size and ratio of beef to rice and I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to satisfy their Korean Beef Bowl cravings!"}
{"text":"Great place for donburi. I went there on a Friday night with my girlfriend and the service was quick and on point. I ordered the unagi donburi while she had the chicken curry, both were awesome and filling. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food was much better the last few times I came here. However, today I left with resentment. Having a simple $13 lunch, I am more than happy to pay a $2 tip. The issue I was having during the meal is the fact there were 3 workers but only the newer girl was actually working while the other two boys just stood around to chat. Upon finishing my meal, I gave a $20 with only return a $5 and a tooine. Loudly hinting I should give a $2 tip.... REALLY?  No! I gave no tip and no intention to return."}
{"text":"Never had a worst waitress before coming to Don Buri one day..  Normally this place is decent, but they hired one of the worst waitresses I have ever (unfortunately) had to experience.  The place was pretty empty but this lady was still being very rude to us and forcing us to order more quickly to the point of grabbing the ordering paper out of our hands and demanding us to tell her what we wanted.   There's a lot of places in the area to get good food, I suggest you stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Must Try: Oyako Don, Donburi Gyuu Don, TakoYaki (Octopus Balls), Nankotsu (Chicken Cartilage), Beef Tongue  || Rating: (9/10) Food, (9/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    I call this: \"Consistent Quality, even Late Night\". From afternoon meals, to late night cravings, Donburi is always consistent on quality.   As the name suggest, the \"Don\" (Rice Bowls) are the specialties. I am torn between my love for the signature Donburi Gyuu Don, which is a beef rice bowl with some amazing sauce and the Oyako Don, which features chicken and eggs.  The small dishes are tapa style, great for trying but not a large portion. There's a wide variety of options, with Takoyaki and Nankotsu being my two favourites.  There was been some on and off comments about the service. Personally I think the environment is very casual, the servers are great but much more laid back. That adds to the atmosphere of the restaurant. Overall, never had bad service here, but they are a bit more casual."}
{"text":"Had a massive craving for donburi after watching food anime, so came here for lunch on the weekend.   It's OK.  Damn you, Shokugeki, for your unrealistic standards!    There weren't many people here as it was a relatively late lunch around 2pm, yet service was snail's pace.  We waited at least 35 mins for my LG Kalbi Ribs bowl, my hubs' Pork Katsu bowl, and two nankotsu/chicken soft bone skewers.  My don was alright.  Tasted like what you'd expect from any random Korean place, plus rice.  Rice was a little mushy for my taste, was hoping to feel the individual fat, short grains signature of Japanese rice.  The beef was a little bit on the tough side.  The nankotsu was OK, covered in a lot of teriyaki sauce.  I'm going to sound snotty, but I prefer it charcoal grilled with salt to preserve the sort of uniquely crunchy texture that cartiledge provides.   I'd come back again for an inexpensive meal with friends."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and the quality of the beef don has been up and down. Today I taste an improvement with their signature beef don.  Had the beef don and the curry beef don. The rice is chewy and not soggy like before. The portions are generous, enough to pack away for another meal. Lots of beef on the rice and seasoned well.   Curry beef don had less beef but a good amount of curry sauce to mix rice into. It comes with a cabbage slaw with sesame dressing to cut the greasiness. The potatoes are a bit underdone, but otherwise the bowl is great.  They are currently advertising matcha beer for $8.45. Kinda skeptical but maybe some adventurous matcha foodies might want to give it a try.  Quick service, great place for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I really do love this place!   Right at the moment from entering, I felt welcomed, all the way until the time I left. Where you get a huge Japanese goodbye! And it really felt genuine too!   Service is outstanding as other Yelpers have said. The waitress even apologized for the long wait on the dessert which took me by surprise because I think only a minute passed by since I had ordered my dessert!   I got the curry Katsu, and I loved it! (I've had a lot of curry katsu's in my time). Perfect crispy katsu, with rich thick curry sauce!   My boyfriend got the hamburger don, which was so so for him. But I really liked it!   He then got the green tea bruele and I had the Japanese special cake and they were both superb!   I think it's a combination of the extremely friendly staff with a great atmosphere and fantastic food that has tied it all together for me.   Definitely recommended, and I will be back in the near future! I'm really happy I found this place while looking for places to eat at midnight! Haha xD"}
{"text":"First time here and quite enjoyed it. The atmosphere is great with cute drawings from customers on the wall. The service was great too! Our server was very attentive and pleasant. I ordered a bunch of skewers and it tasted alright. I would have been fine without the squid. I really enjoyed the chicken heart and beef tongue. I can't wait to come back and try the rice dishes! Credit is accepted here"}
{"text":"Arrived here on a Friday night around 8:30PM and was seated promptly.  Waitresses were friendly and helpful in providing recommendations and ensuring our glasses of water were always full. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Don which was filling with a good balance of chicken and rice. The egg yolk mixed in with the rice was really good and the chicken skin was crispy.   Would be interested in coming back to try their other dishes and their skewers.  Also got free green tea ice cream for checking in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Taste: Loved the Beef Tataki presentation. The meat was soft and tender and tasted great dipped in the ponzu sauce. I never usually eat unagi but i had to try it in Donburi's Umami Don, and I'm glad I did. The combination of savory flavors in this bowl all went very well together in each bite.   Service: No complaints about the service. Servers were nice and the dishes came out in a timely manner.  Value: Good value. The beef tataki was $9.50 and the donburi was $10.50. The donburi definitely is enough to fill you up!  Ambiance: Just a regular average casual dining spot. Nothing special really."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! When it comes to the food portion, it is huge. The taste is amazing and you can tell the freshness. This restaurant offers wide variety of Japanese style food in small portion ($1.5-$5) so that you can try many dishes without having to pay to much."}
{"text":"Great selection, but the food quality was not as great as the idea of it. The curry beef donburi bowl (and I presume all the other bowls are the same portion) offered way too much rice for one person, and it was overly soft and mushy. Ordered numerous Japas, the bacon asparagus skewer was typical and good, same with the okra. The grilled squid was not hot and had too much sauce on it. Honestly, all the Japas used way too much of the same sweet and salty grilling marinade, so they all ended up tasting quite similar. The edamame was quite interesting as it was seasoned with salt and sour plum, giving it a bit of a special taste-- but overall otherwise edamame tastes pretty much the same everywhere you go.  In all honesty, the free green tea ice-cream from the Yelp check-in was the best part of the meal, and that's saying quite a bit since our group ordered 5 hot meals, and atleast seven Japas."}
{"text":"Good spot for late night snack/ comfort food.  Service was quick and friendly.  Food is always on the salty side though."}
{"text":"Super Size Katsu (deep fried) Chicken I was given a choice of up to 2  flavours to deep fried the chicken. I chose nagoya and the wasabi flavours. I love the wasabi flavour. Other than it looks better in the presentation with the green wasabi on top of the brown deep fried chicken , the taste also makes a contrast and excitement to the deep fried chicken. It also comes with a bowl of soup and  rice. If you are a yelper, you can get a bowl of green tea ice cream for free."}
{"text":"Would have given this place 3 1/2 but 1/2 star isn't an option on Yelp.  We ordered takeout and it came out pretty good. Customer service was decent. I actually asked for the free green tea with the yelp check-in but they didn't wanna give it to me. Making excuses like how it's gonna melt and stuff. I could had eaten there while I was waiting though right?  And also not a full 4 stars because some items wasn't as what I expected.   We purchased 3 rice bowls and wings for takeout.   Nagoya wings were good but they don't give you a lot. They were small and only came with 5 pieces.   Gyuu Don was very flavourful and the beef was very soft.   Unagi Don was also good but the problem was it look nothing like the picture on their website. We got a small piece of eel only cut into small 5 pieces.   Tuna Tataki Don was just meh!!  Was kinda bland for me. Only thing I really taste was wasabi and white rice.   Also, each rice bowl came with a small salad side with some citrus dressing and miso soup."}
{"text":"Great experience both times I've went!   Service was prompt and the food was delicious (albeit very filling lol). The decor inside is also really cute haha.   Love the fact that it's open so late (great for late eaters like myself)   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After ordering first dish up on 7mins. Main course of shrimp curry on rice on at 13 mins  Pretty authentic new retro style Japanese food. Great service, food came quick, needs more decor but for a hidden restaurant, they are more than I expected."}
{"text":"Excellent selection, good food and service. Decent prices and portions."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out since we were having a Japanese food craving.  The place was ok for the most part, service was so-so, they weren't as attentive as would have liked.  I ended up having to refill the water myself.  We ordered chicken karaage, katsu don & omurice.  We enjoyed the karaage chicken and the omurice.  The katsu don could have been better, the rice that was with the katsu don was savoury and sweet.  Value of money spent to portioning I would say that the portions are rather small for what we spent.  As for a repeat visit that is currently up in the air."}
{"text":"Amazing first time experience at Donburi! Thanks to chef Irene for recommending the unagi and takoyaki !"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, fare price , good for a quick meal with friend. Very cultural spot"}
{"text":"The few times I came were they recently opened and I remembered the food was good. But this time I tried, I found out it has went downhill a little. The rice doesn't come with much meat. The skewers are small but taste is ok just meat is bit tough. The worst I found is their cod which doesn't taste well and small. It's slightly less than half a size of a chopstick diagonally. The price ended up around the same as I would eat at Japanese Izakaya but Izakaya has better food."}
{"text":"Very average food. There are also a lot better options in Markham so this place really doesn't impress. I love tuna tataki but their tuna tataki don is too plain.  Their umami don tastes amazing in the first few bites but I get sick of it pretty fast."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, especially their omurice and rice bowls. They are very flavourful.  They play anime on their TV's which is great entertainment."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to eat some nice sushi bowls (stuff on rice) and said it was good. It was not. It seems that people who live in Richmond hill and Markham their wholes lives and aren't \"foodies\" that wander downtown and find best rated places are not able to distinguish good and bad food. I paid ten dollars for a katsu Don (pork cutlet on rice) and it was just that. Like legit it was a pork cutlet on rice with some cabbage. I'm serious. Are you serious? There's nothing else? No. Nothing. Head to tsuki izakaya if you want good sushi bowls. I'm very sad and will never come again. It'll probably take another decade for richmondhill to turn into a place with good food. Sorry for offending anyone who thinks Richmond hill has good food other than dim sum jaulaus and hk cafes. Sorry for your loss."}
{"text":"Really cute place! I came here for lunch with coworkers and ordered the chicken katsu curry. I liked it a lot. The rice was nice and soft and mixing it all together with the curry sauce was delicious. I also thought the portion size was great for the price. They had TVs showing anime and Studio Ghibli movies, which was entertaining. Would come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I come here mostly for their okonomiyaki fries, chicken kaarage, chicken omurice, and bbq chicken bowl. So yummy!! Service could improve, sometimes the servers are too busy and ignore your requests. This place also gets packed during dinner time, and getting a table is sort of a pain. I don't argue with the pricing of the menu as I really do enjoy eating the items I mentioned before. What keeps me coming back here is the yummy food, pretty much."}
{"text":"This place is alright, we used to come here often. But after Grand Noodle opened in the same plaza, I'm never coming back here lol. The curry portions at Grand Noodle are way bigger, cheaper and and tastier than Donburi's. No contest!"}
{"text":"Amazing even on a busy Friday night. Great takoyaki and gyuu! My favourite is the umami don and gyuu don   I've never been disappointed here!"}
{"text":"Wrote this review a little late but hey, better late than never - especially since I wanted to share what a great time I had at Donburi.  We had ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry and the Beef Tongue (Gyu) Soba Noodle Bowl. Both portions were very generous. The chicken had a great crisp to it. I loved the noodle soup and I'm glad they didn't skimp out on the beef tongue 'cause it was delicious! The staff was very friendly and attentive. I was even given an extra bowl of soup because they noticed that my noodles had already absorbed a lot of my soup.  Overall, I was very content with my experience at Donburi and I'll definitely be coming back (especially once they get their liquor license!) This is looking like it'll be the uptown version of Guu/Kinton. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but not great. Maybe even mediocre. Started off with takoyaki. Takoyaki is my favorite so I have to admit I am picky with it. I would give it a 2/5. Nothing special and was not crispy enough. The onigiri was alright but a little bit squishy. The grilled pork jowl was kind of disappointing. The pork katsu curry bowl was decent. Again, nothing special. The donburi special was good. The meat was tender with the right amount of sauce. Donburi redeemed itself with very good service. Waiters cared about every table and took care of all customers. They did not come ask how the food was but were very nice and polite when serving food. Do not think I will go again though. Its one of those one time, fad, places."}
{"text":"The last time I came here was years ago - at the time it was a new place and had a fast food/cafeteria style setup. I was happy to see that since then the shop has been renovated to fit more seating, they've gotten more dine-in, and fortunately the food has improved tons.  The don bowls are a good size, and prices range from $8-$15. There's a myriad of appetizers for the veggie and meat lovers alike, and if you're not into don rice for the day they've got good selection of udons to tie you over as well. Slightly rice-heavy on the don bowls, but the rice was flavourful and satisfying, and end up being an overall great portion size. The udon wasn't bad either - average, nothing to write home about, but no complaints. The skewers are single orders, so the price felt a bit steep, but each one was thoughtfully cooked and plated which gave some extra points. Next time I'll be focusing on the don and calling it a day - I feel it's their main selling point and works well on its own."}
{"text":"Nice food. I like the rice bow and the bbq chicken wings. Also the Japanese style curry rice. Yummy food and nice service.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot, and it's unique in decor with the various paper drawings they got taped onto one of the main focus walls. They also have a tv playing anime, while another played some English teleseries which kept glitching, sadly. Staff was great, attentive, standard with procedures, and food was okay. Ordered the unagi don, takoyaki and some other chicken/rice dish, so it was filling. There's more rice than meat ratio, so don't be expecting them to be THAT generous, but overall it's okay like I said earlier. They also serve matcha beer which sounded interesting, but didn't bother to try. Gets pretty busy for dinner, so good luck with parking around the main entrance, there's free underground parking though but can sometimes get packed as well."}
{"text":"If you want a gigantic bowl of rice, go to donburi. It was awful. Nothin in it.  Also the curry sucks and the cutlet sucks too.  Takoyaki octopus balls were okay... Will never return."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here with great expectations.   We ordered the katsudon curry rice and tempura donburi. The curry tasted a bit watered down and was more sweeter than normal. The katsudon was slightly dry. The tempura donburi was very, if not below, average in my friends opinion. Taste was not up to par based on reviews we have read.  One of the positives are the portion sizes. The meals are decent size with salad, soup and tea to accompany the meal. Pretty cheap especially for lunch special. Service was quick and waitress was polite. Decor was very fun looking while displaying anime on the main screen. However, my friend and I were really looking more towards the food - a bit let down, so we probably aren't returning."}
{"text":"Reallllyyy love this place! I was so excited to see everything they had in the menu and I became really indecisive. Most dons are 10-12 ish dollars and comes with miso soup and salad, which are like the typical fare, nothing special. I finally settled on the curry shrimp tempura don and was incredibly pleased with the portion that I got! They were also more generous with the tempura shrimp than I had anticipated which is always a plus in my eyes! The curry was also really delicious and suited my personal  tastes perfectly. They also have late night menu items, and it seems they are attempting their own interpretation of an izakaya. Haven't tried them yet but they do have a skewer special with purchase of drink after 10pm, so may give that a try in the future.  Speaking of drinks they also have a wide variety of Japanese drinks like Calpico and Ramune along with a fairly wide variety of beers available which is fairly uncommon for similar Asian establishments.   ALSO they have a check in offer for free green tea ice cream. Didn't redeem it though 'cause I was really full. But on the note of desserts they have a variety of Jap inspired desserts as well as daily specials.  Overall a great place to go for lunch/dinner and I shall definitely return to try out more of their menu!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, if you've never had this sort of food it may be pretty good but I've tried similar items from restaurants around the city and Donburi doesn't measure up. Out of the 3 dons I had tried at this location, D1 (beef) is probably the only thing I would get again if I visit again. The chicken is their chicken Katsu don is too dry. Get them to give you a small dish of house sauce to make it more appetizing. Out of the side dishes they had, the quail eggs wrapped in bacon is quite good.  Don't bother ordering items such as beef in ponzu sauce or beef tongue. They were both too overcooked and extremely dry.  The decoration is nice and fun to look at. The place is conveniently located and easily spotted.  The service was poor.  To be honest, what makes eating at Japanese isakayas fun is the friendly service.   Not saying this is even considered an isakaya but their service = drop the food and leave.  There were several times we wanted to get a word out and before we even had a chance they left. Would I come back again? I won't avoid it but there are a lot of options in the area so probably not any time soon."}
{"text":"I was hoping to get some good Japanese food at this place.  The atmoshphere is so so for me though, because it does not have the usual friendly service from a traditional Japanese restaurant.  It was quite average.   When I ordered the chicken skewer appretizer, i was asked, \"you are only ordering one?\" from the waitress.  And I had to explained to her we are waiting for other parties to arrive.  Isn't that a given when there are still four empty chairs at our table?  I was a little bit disappointed with the chicken heart skewer because they were cold when it served.  The beef rice bowl I ordered was mediocre as well.  The beef slices were all over cooked with a slight toughness even though they were thinnly sliced.  The marinated daikon was not that good either.  I guess for $11.50 for the dish, I can't expect too much.  One of the friends who ordered the egg covered rice was equally disappointing, the flavours was just not there.    In addition, we were charged a 15% gratuity automatically even though the food and service were not really good.  I guess that's the common practice in restaurant to charge gratuity when number of guests are over certain number.   I would not go back to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"I got the tuna ahi donburi & wasabi unagi. The wasabi in both the unagi and the donburi wasn't too intense which was great but I did feel it creeping in my nose after a few bites. I was hoping there would be more tuna in the bowl. There was just too much rice. But overall the taste was great!"}
{"text":"Came here around 10pm after a movie , service was much better than last time!!  Must say it was quick and attentive also very helpful.   This time I only ordered skewers, takoyaki and green tea creme brulé which was delicious!  My favourite skewer from here is probably the beef tongue skewer and also the squid skewer. There was one particular skewer that wasn't that good : the toro skewer ( i believe it might be pork belly ) there was way too much fat than meat on the skewer so I felt a bit ripped off ;( ...  But other than that everything went well!! And I will come back  :)"}
{"text":"Service - 4 stars Food - 1-2 stars  I was primarily disappointed with the food because the service was fantastic. Maybe Donburi is just not my thing given all the good reviews.  First the good:  - Greeted with a smile and great service. - Our server was fantastic, so friendly and helpful. Easily the best service for more of a \"fast food\" type place. - The restaurant was spotless and clean with lots of seating variety. - When they served me the wrong Udon dish, they gave me free Tempura.  The not so good:   - The Shitake Udon soup had good quality ingredients but the broth had absolutely no flavour. Even after I loaded it with the Chilli flakes provided on the table it still lacked flavour.  - The Beef Donburi was a shock. The beef was probably 50% fat / 50% beef. I guess this is a really matter of personal preference but that's inedible in my opinion. A total right off.    - Chicken Skewers were OK but again some of the pieces were so grizzly, I couldn't chew it.  Again, not sure if it's me... or if it was a bad day but I  was not a fan of the food. Don't think I will return.  BK"}
{"text":"-- My First Experience --  I have been to Commerce Gate Plaza so many times and I can't believe I have never been to Donburi before. The sign looks like it's been there for over 10 years. When we walked into the restaurant, it looked completely different. The theme of the restaurant is about Japanese anime and manga. The servers were very nice and we asked them a lot of questions about what to order. They gave us a number of suggestions and never gave us any attitude.  -- Food and Drink --  We ordered 4 items in total:  1. Chicken Omurice - I love Omurice! I always find it fascinating to cut open the omelette and watch the rice inside fall out nicely. Donburi's Omurice was very flavorful! The barbecue sauce and mayo on top gave extra flavors to the omelette. I love how their tomato base fried rice wasn't mushy!   2. Scallops skewer - There was a nice char on the scallop. The scallops were cooked to perfection. It didn't taste rubbery/ chewy!   3. Gyuu Don - When we saw the bowl, my first thought was that the portion size was so small. However, as we worked on the gyuu don, it seemed like there was no end to this dish. Of course the dish was very delicious as well!   4. Chicken Kaarage - The chicken kaarage was definitely the best dish of the night. The chicken was so juicy and tender. The outer layer was very crunchy and not oily at all! Love how the spicy mayo sauce gives extra flavors to the chicken! This is definitely a MUST ORDER item at Donburi!  -- Overall --  The wait time for the food was slightly longer than other Japanese restaurants, I appreciate how they take their time to cook. When the food arrived at our table, it was all sizzling hot. I would definitely come back to try other dishes!ack to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"After one of my close friends introduced me to this restaurant, I mentioned to him that we should go and try it; and that was exactly what we did.  Went in on a friday evening and was seated quickly.  I was expecting the interior to have more of a japanese vibe, since the establishment was for a japanese themed cuisine.  Interior resembled similar to a normal chinese restaurant.  We ordered a large array of dishes.  Dishes I would recommend are the katsu don, mussel skewer, chicken karage, and chicken don.  These dishes were above average. A friendly suggestion for the establishment though: Rice to protein/veggies ratio skewed towards the rice proportion for the \"don\" suffix dishes. I finished all my pork katsu and still had a quater bowl of rice remaining.  Dishes to avoid would include the scallop skewer and omu rice.  The omu chicken rice simply speaking was ketchup fried rice with a few pieces of chicken laid ontop with a scrambled egg covered in mayo and more ketchup.  Scallop was alright... heavy seasoned and lack of a scallop taste. I could've mistakened it for white cod.  Overall, not bad for a quick bite with your buds.  Note: check in at the store to receive one scoop of free matcha ice cream.    Enjoy."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant that looks like a casual otaku haven. They have 2 TV screens: one plays Korean dramas, the other plays Studio Gibili movies. They also have a wall dedicated to drawings by customers which is pretty neat.  The staff are pretty nice and attentive to customers--even when you see them casually talking, they are always on the lookout for customers' needs.  We ordered the katsu don, donburi gyuu don, and BBQ wasabi onigiri. The katsu part of the katsu don was sort of disappointing. It was not crunchy and it felt a bit overcooked--the katsu was a bit hard on the outer parts, but at the same time the breading was soggy. The meat closer to the center was juicy and did have nice flavour though, which complemented the caramelized onion and seasoned rice. Other than the katsu, the bowl was good--a smidgen salty but nothing too crazy. But the katsu should be the star of the bowl and it was quite lacking The donburi gyuu don was more on the sweet side. The sauce was a sweet and salty situation and the meat was still moist--not overcooked. The bowl was pretty balanced all the way through and was a pretty solid bowl of don. The BBQ wasabi onigiri was sort of a wild card. It tastes exactly like what you would expect a wasabi onigiri to taste like so I don't know why we thought otherwise. Not sure where the BBQ part came in though, perhaps it was the sprinkle of flavouring on top? The wasabi exterior is diluted wasabi, of course, but it's still enough to clear your sinuses! The rice inside was a plain rice ball of rice (I think), but that wasabi was really all the flavour you need (or could taste).   Overall, I would only recommend the donburi gyuu don from what we tried. Super disappointed in the katsu--I feel a certain type of way when my katsu is soggy. Only the BBQ wasabi onigiri if you're feeling adventurous or have a stuffy nose."}
{"text":"I've never been the biggest fan of curry, but this place does it right.  They have great Japanese appetizers and serve dishes with plenty of food on them to leave you full for days.  The dishes are definitely super sized and the cuts of meat are hearty!   I usually order the curry pork cutlet with rice and the plate always comes out smoking hot.  The cutlets are nicely battered and crispy to the max.  Even as they sit on top of the Japanese curry, they never got soggy or soaked.  Unlike most places they can put the cutlets on the side as well if you want them to keep crisptastic.  They have my new favorite ice cream here as well.  Black sesame ice cream!  If you haven't tried black sesame ice cream you're missing out!  It's the best thing I've discovered since cream soda slushies at 7-11!"}
{"text":"Came here a few times and never fails to satisfy me and my friends. I usually get the umami don or the spicy salmon don, which is my favourite but they sometimes have it or not depending on the time and day you go. The portions were enough to fill you up and came with soup and salad. Also had the super katsu which can feed like 3 people and had different variety of sauces that you can add to it which was good.   This place was comfortable and felt very clean and gave you a Japanese feeling to it, they also played anime shows on tv which i found pretty cool. The service was great, as soon as we sat down we were brought out water and the menu given how busy it was at that time. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice Japanese restaurant for their dons. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Walked into a nice hipster style place!  Anime drawings all over the store? Anime playing on a TV? Too bad I'm not into that...but it is cool! It was quite busy though. 3 servers for the entire restaurant makes it for a pretty hectic place.   We ordered the classic Gyudon and Chicken teriyaki. Miso soup and salad to start it off. Standard stuff. Then the rice bowls came. Pretty good portion wise. But the taste was not that impressive. Beef texture wise was on point though. The rice itself was actually pretty decent. Loved the onions as a little topping as well.   Was actually pretty full going into this meal so I got about 1/3 of it for takeout. Yay afternoon snack for tomorrow? Definitely. Don't forget to check in to get the free green tea ice cream! Pretty big scoops for something free! Prices are actually not bad for the amount of food you get. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Check in for a green tea ice cream! To be honest, just a normal place... nothing special."}
{"text":"I love this place I came here Sunday night with my boyfriend and it wasn't busy we were seated right away (water to the table) and we were not familiar with the menu so they gave us good descriptions and recommendations.    We ordered a wasabi beef skewer and teriyaki chicken skewer. They were about 2.50 each but only a couple pieces of meat on each.  That was okay because for the price the meat was so juicy and tasty.  We also got curry chicken katsu which is like a fried piece of chicken on rice and a lot of curry sauce. Pretty good , average curry.   We also got the signature onigiri which was really good too.     The service was the best part, they weren't busy at the time and they made our experience a lot more enjoyable by interacting with us and inviting us to test our luck with the football game they have I won a onigiri!  It was also Chinese New Year and they gave us an extra salad and soup when we ordered the katsu.   Also we checked in and got a cup of green tea icecream at the end !  Had a great experience will be going back !!"}
{"text":"Got some curry pork katsu rice bowl.  The rice and curry was alright but damn I think they need to fix the oil they use or how long they fry the katsu.  That thing was hella dry and tasted weird AF, probably due to old oil. It looked dark in colour like it was over fried with dirty oil.  2/10 would not want to try again."}
{"text":"Very delicious menu, makes me want to try everything. My favourite is their signature beef rice bowl. Usually my go-to.   Also nice to have free green tea ice cream with the Yelp check in."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant that is of decent size. They several tv around the restaurant where they play anime and a mix of chinese, japanese and k-pop music over the speakers. The atmosphere is relaxing and down-to-earth with friendly service. They have a good selection of donburis (japanese rice bowls) and the portion is very filling. I got the chicken curry donburi and it was flavourful. On your first visit here you can receive a free green tea ice cream scoop :)"}
{"text":"We came here Saturday for lunch. Their portons are pretty generous (I'd give it 4 stars). But the service was quite slow (2 stars)."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some donburi, so I ended up here with a friend! He'd been here before, but this was my first time! Was quite excited for some nice donburi, but the overall experience was a bit lacklustre.   First off, came in and ended up having to wait about 5 minutes for a table. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with this, but there were multiple empty tables. When we got seated, the table hadn't even been wiped down! If you were gonna take longer to prepare a table, it would be nice to have it clean...  Finally put our order in, and eventually got our food. We shared the Beef Tataki, I got the Pork Katsu Curry Don, and my friend got the Chicken Katsu Don. The beef tataki was beautifully plated, with a lovely presentation. Good overall taste, but I've definitely had better. My katsu curry don had a nice strong flavour to it, but not spicy at all. Both dons were quite good, but lacking variety in the bowls. Some more colour in the bowl would make it more appealing!  Each don came with soup and salad, and a beverage as well. Unfortunately, they ran out of cold milk tea, so my friend couldn't even get one. How does that happen? Ran out of tea? Or milk? And this was in the middle of the day!  Service wasn't exactly bad, but not great either. One server didn't speak a single word to us, another was so confused by most of what was happening, it didn't even seem like she worked there. Other 2 servers were alright though.  In the end, the food was pretty good for the price you pay on the lunch menu, but service definitely leaves something to be desired... Guess the free ice cream with the check-in was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 -- Value: 7/10 -- Service: 8/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10  Would I come again? Yeah.  -- Skewers: Mentai Chicken ($2), Chicken Heart ($2), Wasabi Beef ($2.50) - Of the three, wasabi beef was my favourite. Even visually, it stands out with the contrasting colour of the wasabi sauce and strips of seaweed. Both of the chicken skewers were good too, which is a generic description, but I don't remember them tasting like much out of the ordinary. I completely forgot that someone ordered chicken hearts because I didn't notice a taste or texture difference.   -- Renkon Chips ($2) - These lotus root chips were delicious to me in a \"fried beyond all recognition\" kind of way. I like unhealthy junk food, so this fit the bill, but taste-wise, don't expect much.  -- Super Size Chicken Katsu ($10.50) - This was a giant piece of chicken, much like downtown's shiny new Hot Star Large Fried Chicken, but this came with two sauces. We picked wasabi and another sauce with the longest name that was like a sweet soya sauce. It was crispy (although the breading separated from the chicken very easily), flavourful, and moist on the inside.  -- Signature Onigiri ($2.80) - This was probably the most boring thing. While onigiri is literally a rice ball, this was just so plain that I was like...what is the point of this? There was a sweet soya/teriyaki sauce on the bottom and I guess the \"value\" comes from the roe topper, which doesn't taste like much. I feel like it's less of a \"signature\", more of a \"basic\" or \"classic\". I'd skip it.   -- Polar Beer Chicken Wings ($10) - It was 10 wings for $10, which isn't bad. They were really crispy and whatever seasoning was on them was delicious; a little sweet, a little salty. I'm not sure where the polar beer factored in...?  -- Gy?don ($10.50) with extra beef ($2) - I guess it was our fault that we didn't know that gy?don is literally just sauce, rice, beef, and onions, because it was a bit underwhelming. The extra beef came in a separate container, almost as if to emphasize how little they were giving you. Like the Signature Onigiri, this was definitely more on the basic, classic end of the spectrum; thoroughly average and unexciting.  The service was pretty good. Cheerier from the female wait staff. The restaurant is comfortably spaced out and clean, and there's a little diversion in the front door to prevent the cold outside air from blowing in on anyone. While some dishes definitely stood out among others, the worst dish was still good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. From its name, I thought it's just a donburi restaurant. However, the menu is extensive, and has lots of skewer (kushis) items, as well as appetizers, and all were very good. Definitely on par with a great izakaya! The prices were also very good, especially given the quality of the great food!  I came here for an Instagram event, so the circumstances were a bit unusual, so I don't know how the normal service would have been. But I found the staff to be super friendly and nice!  As for the donburi itself, I order the basic gyudon with onsen tamago. Even though I was so full at this point, I'd have to say it was definitely THE best donburi I've had in GTA. This place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"A wide variety of don dishes, from chicken katsu, to gyuu dishes! While the entrees on their own are quite overpriced for 55% rice and 45% topping, there is a substantial amount of choice for lunch specials, which include miso soup. The chicken katsu, both on its own and in the curry dish, is fried to a nice crunchy texture without compromising the juicy chicken. The tempura is also lightly fried to a good texture. The food came in large portions that definitley leave you full. There currently is a promotion for chicken skewers, $5 for three and thus we tried the chicken teriyaki skewers, which came in a fair portion and were well flavoured. Pretty nice service, and good for group dining!"}
{"text":"Had the katsu curry chicken don and it was quite good. Quick service, big portion and comfortable environment. Will visit again and try other things!!"}
{"text":"Went in at predinnertime and surprisingly was the only party there (family of gathering of 7). Ordered the tempura and their specialty beef gyudon bowl.  When I received the tempura, it was not cooked through as I could still see the flour when I bit through a green pepper one.  The beef bowl was also nothing to rave about, using just similar Japanese ingredients to marinade with no ginger like they do in japan. Overall very disappointed even though the staff was nice."}
{"text":"they killed it!! it was am-azing! love the staff , love the food, I'd recommended the lotus chips"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool spot uptown. Service is pretty good and it wasn't too packed here. They have pretty cheap apps and dishes and the portions for lunch are pretty big!"}
{"text":"Location: 505 Highway 7 E Markham, (Commerce Gate) Price: $$ Service: Friendly  This was my first time at the neat restaurant. The place is bright and has a lot of character to it. The server was really friendly and would frequently check if we were good. The price was decent considering that we ordered around 4 plates of food ($35 w/o tip). One of the order was on the lunch menu and it comes with a salad and a miso soup (both were satisfying). Overall, miso soup seems like a simple dish- a lot of restaurants tend to make it really salty and it's like drinking a bowl of salt but the miso soup here was decent. My favourite dish is the squid- it was extremely tasty and it wasn't over cooked. The skewers were a little disappointing. They were really small and it was plain.  I would visit again to try the rest of their menu items. They also had a polar beer and it looked interest- its now on the bucket list...  Verdict: TRY"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time 2 months ago and really enjoyed the food. A bit pricey but it was definitely worth it! I tend to order the curry chicken rice bowl"}
{"text":"Great place with great price and opens till super late. Came in around 1:15 and got seated ordering omurice and the karage chicken don. Not a very busy place which is nice pretty clean and quick service. They have lots to choose from which I absolutely loved! The meal was decent in portion and should fill one persons appetite easily! I definitely recommend:)"}
{"text":"Very affordable place and you get great value. One order of a donburi bowl will set you back just $10ish, but it's WAY more than one portion/meal. I could easy order one bowl and have it for 2 meals. Located in Commerce Gate, it's a great place for lunch especially if you work in the area. There's quite a bit of seating and the service is fast, so you can be in and out quick!"}
{"text":"Came here for my partner's birthday so we shamelessly ordered way too much food and stuffed our faces. Overall, the food was pretty tasty and we got a good portion's worth for its price. The curry sauce for the rice bowl was very yummy - an underlying tone of sweetness that was complemented by very rich spices. The pork katsu, however, I felt was only mediocre. The katsu was thin, the meat was a bit tough, and the breaded batter was too dense. For our appetizers, the best one was the deep fried chicken wings, which was hot and juicy and seasoned just right. The decent apps were: the scallop (quite average), pork skewers (although really salty), and the takoyaki (not bad, but could use prettier garnishing). The worst one was actually the chicken karaage. It wasn't a bad dish in itself but in comparison to the many places I've been to, this one just wasn't on par. The batter was overly deep-fried resulting in an undesirable crunchiness and the pieces of meat were either very small or not tender enough.   I found the interior of this restaurant to be very cute and it was my first time at any eatery that played anime on their TVs. The customer-drawn art pieces on the walls add a very nice personalized touch to the place, making it feel more \"home-sy\". It was a comfortable eating environment and the staff were polite and accommodating throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Been here many times. One of my favorite japanese restaurents. I'm a huge fan of all the cute anime drawings in the restaurent! It looks so cute.   Some of their food is hit or miss, some of them are really delicious like the spicy gyuu fries and umami bowl. Their food is meticulously prepared well, they take great pride in their food. I can tell!  Their portions may look small but trust me that bowl of rice is DEEP and very filling. Things I recommend are the gyu fries, spicy salmon don when they have it, umami bowl and of course try their Katsu curry atleast once."}
{"text":"Their snacks (skewers, side dishes) are delicious and savoury! Their beef bowl's great too :) Staff are prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday and we had a fantastic time. Here are a couple of things that really stood out.   The service was amazing. As soon as we entered, they provided me with a seat and then began talking to and playing with the kids while I was reviewing the menu. When he left, he would always come back to make sure that everything was ok. We were playing a lot of different games while we were waiting for the food. The waiter would provide us with a large box of crayons and paper so that we could continue with the fun.   The decor of the place wasn't anything special. It just seemed like any other Japanese fast food places I have gone to in Japan. It felt regular.   I love skewers. I usually go to Zakkushi in Toronto, but I guess I found a closer place to go for my skewer cravings. It isn't as good as Zakkushi and there aren't a lot of selection like Zakkushi, but the quality of the food was pretty good. The only complaint that I had was that the beef arrived a little bit cold (-1 star).  We got the udon and the beef rice. We finished it all because it was so good. The kids loved the place and we would definitely go back again.   Finally,they have a promotion. If you check in on yelp, they will give you a free scoop of green tea ice cream. I nice thing for desert.   Pro  Great Food Fantastic service  Con  Beef skewer a little bit cold"}
{"text":"I would say one of the more straightforward and easier-to-order places in the Commerce Gate Plaza. Generally, people order a rice bowl and call it a day. I got the Shitake Don, which came with mushrooms, rice, and some vegetables. My friend got the Gyuu Don that had beef slices. The food was satisfying and filling for the price. About halfway into our dishes, he found a hair intertwined in the rice. He immediately lost his appetite. On the bright side, the restaurant was accommodating but this incident made him more cautious and less eager to eat his new bowl, or to return to this establishment.   I would have appreciated a complimentary dessert or appetizer as well. It appeared that it did not shock the chefs, as they continued working without hairnets. Even though other restaurants may not follow these procedures, I feel like they shouldn't have swept this occurrence under the rug and as if it never happened. In other restaurants, I would receive an additional apology from either the supervisor or manager."}
{"text":"Great flavour with great value (as long as you don't order their skewers which can be pricy). Service is quite slow, but it's not too much a big deal when I can get a huge bowl of Gyudon at $9.  Recommend the carbless version, smaller size but also only $7.5. All my friends love it!"}
{"text":"It used to be a great place now items are over fried and the cod shrank to an embarrassing size. Still some decent items on the menu but now there's some items to stay away from."}
{"text":"Just moved up to Toronto with the Mrs.  After a long day of rental searching, followed by a frustrating few hours trying to fill out and scan forms at a FedEx Office, neither of us felt like cooking.  But we wanted some comfort food...  Thankfully, there's Donburi, conveniently located by our condo!  Open insanely late, especially useful after a computer at a FedEx loses half an hour of your work.  Friendly servers, tasty food, and interesting pickles.  I ordered the gyudon, the wife the tendon.  Both came with miso soup, and pickles.  Well, Japanese pickles.  We think both were cucumbers, one was purple, though.  I liked them more than the wife did.  The donburi was just what we needed!  And the asparagus skewer was the cherry on top!  Highly recommend this place for late night or any time!"}
{"text":"Omg so good. I didn't even get a chance to take a picture of my food cause i scarfed it down so fast. This place brought back memories of my wonderful Japan backpacking trip. The waitresses greeted me like they would in Japan.  I love it.  The manager personally came out and helped me check in for a free green tea ice cream.   Got the katsu don for 9 bucks.  I wish the desserts were a bit cheaper. the almond dessert was so good but the portion was such a tease.  I enjoyed my time. Thanks donburi!"}
{"text":"Came here after a day spent at a group meditation and yoga retreat with my friend. I live nearby and the donburi/Japanese franchise concept of the restaurant differs from the common ethnic Chinese/Cantonese food offered in the area so I decided it was worth a try.   The restaurant offered both booth and table seating and its interior resembled the traditional decor of a small adorable Japanese restaurant. Pictures of past guests in its many franchised locations and anime sketches also hung on the walls.   I ordered the gyuu curry don and my friend opted for the Katsu curry don. We also decided to try the teriyaki beef tongue skewer to share for something experimental. The gyuu curry- sweet, salty, and I tasted something like japanese mayo in the sauce. There was plenty of shredded beef sitting on top a bed of fluffy rice with a pool of curry sauce mixture of carrots and onions. Overall, very tasty and plenty of flavor but I definitely had to take a few gulps of water to wash it all down. The teriyaki beef tongue was gamy and had the distinct flavor of- you guessed it, tongue but I personally could've passed on this. My friend also said she really enjoyed her Katsu don and that tongue was just not her thing.   Overall, I'd say it was a pleasant experience if not for the stomach ache I got the minute as I finished my bowl of gyuu curry. :( I don't know if it was a sanitary issue in the food but it definitely was an unfortunate end to the dining experience. I'm willing to give them a second try next time I'm sick of Chinese food, sushi or seafood and am feeling up for some high sodium foods.   Tip: Check in on yelp for free ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"I have lived in Japan for about half a year and have tried the various Gyudon places all over Japan.  In terms of taste, I would say it is fairly authentic and accurately resembles the real deal. However, their dishes are a bit lacking in some of the finer details as compared to Japanese Gyudon. For example, the beef is a bit dry and there's a lot more oil in the broth.  Entrees are served with a side of salad, miso soup and a choice of milk tea or green tea, which is nice. They even have my favourite Gyudon condiment, the ?? chilli pepper powder. Unfortunately, there was no ?? (chilli oil) at the table.  In terms of size, it is by no means a large portion, but it is enough for a light lunch. Comparable to a Japanese \"large\" size.  Staff was friendly and welcome customers with Japanese greetings when they enter and leave (not sure if they actually speak Japanese though).  There are a few television in the restaurant playing various programs from Japanese drama to World Cup soccer.  Overall, I would go back again to taste a bit of Japan again, but I wouldn't say this is something to die for. But since I have not thus far tried any better Gyudon, I would recommend this place to go try if you want some Japanese Gyudon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  very nice, looks like a Japan restaurant  Price:  a little high imo.  $11 for their famous beef rice.  Cod fish small portion $10 (I think I can buy half a fish for that)  Food:   depends on what you order.      Beef udon:  very good, nice large portion, my friend gave some to her 4yr old and still had a large enough portion for herself  Pork katsu:  rice with onions with terriyaki or some type of sweet sauce was good, but the pork was just horrible.   The tempura (or what you call it) skin was dark brown, soggy, he meat was tough, taste was just salty.  I remember eating before at another restaurant a nicely golden orange, tender meat.  When you bite into a katsu, it should be crunchy to begin, then tender as you get into the middle.    I couldn't eat half of this pork katsu dish.  I packed it home so as to not to waste food, but I don't look forward to eating it later.  So, I give this 2/5.   It's good if you order the beef rice, but $10.50 for beef, rice + sauce ?    I don't think it takes that much effort to fry beef and pour sauce on top of it.  At least when compared to Ramen and the time it takes to make the soup base.   Talk about markup.  I'd rather spend $10.50 on a Ramen."}
{"text":"This was my third time coming here.  Or server was great! Lucy Winston was  professional, friendly and courteous.  She took into consideration  about my daughter wanting some crayons and she quickly brought them over.  Food was good.  I found the deep fried  chicken donburi was a bit too salty for me.  However overall everything was heady"}
{"text":"Good portions and it tasted authentically Japanese, although I think the owners are Chinese. We had the omurice and oyakodon.  Omurice was amazing, they put BBQ sauce on it and every bite was delicious, it did feel a little bit too saucy but the flavour was great.  Oyakodon was a bit on the sweet side, but still went really great with the rice.   Next time I come I want to try the gyudon and maybe some side dishes."}
{"text":"This place have been pretty consistent. Especially with the beef rice and the fried chicken is nicely spiced. You will feel like you are back in a HK Japanese restaurant. If you like polar beer, they serve polar beer too. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Very modern and open concept. Excellent service at this new Donburi Japanese Restaurant.  We enjoyed our lunch order with quick and efficient service.  Remember to try their shrimp tempura !"}
{"text":"taste is on point here. the food is good however, do i feel like i got bang for my buck? no. a rice bowl is around $10-15 maybe im just a big eater but i never feel satisfied after having one. quite overpriced but if ur in the mood for something tasty and dnt care much about price then it wnt disappoint"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing.  Quick service, lunch menu that includes soup and tea.  Place is clean and even has few TVs with sports on.  Miso soup was a little bland compared to most, but I'm here for the rice bowl.  I got their specialty beef.  This was done well, beef was tender and well seasoned.  At least they get their specialty right.  Ordered a side fried scallop.  That was a mistake, it was soggy and mushy with no seasoning.  They need to sear the scallops first so it's not full of liquid.  My friend and I wanted to split a sake, but the waitress said they were out of it."}
{"text":"Nice decor, clean environment and J_drama, and Chinese and Japanese music playing. The menus are very Japanese!   The service is very friendly and attentive.   I ordered the house donburi, it was very good. Fatty amd tender just how I like it. I got a rice ball to start, it was the sweeter of the choices. A little too sweet for me. There was a daily special of salmon head for $5 and there was very little meat on it. Cannot recommend it.   Overall pretty good experience."}
{"text":"After seeing all these pictures of food from Donburi on Instagram, I finally had a chance to grab lunch here.   Service was next to nonexistent. You check off your order on a piece of paper. I ordered the chicken katsu curry with rice lunch special, which wasn't an option on the piece of paper. I wrote it down myself as the code (L10 if I remember correctly). I watched as our server wrote \"chicken katsu don\" next to my order,  which I quickly corrected.   Soup and salad came shortly after our order. We also ordered their rice balls. Their signature and BBQ miso. The signature rice ball came first. It was nothing spectacular. Just some rice topped with some BBQ sauce. The second rice ball came about 15 minutes later,  but it was the wrong one (wasabi miso). No quality checks were made and my friend couldn't eat the wasabi miso rice ball. Half an hour went by without our mains arriving, so we asked about our order. The server told us that the kitchen was behind because they were very busy. There were maybe 5 other tables in the restaurant. We also took it as a chance to tell our server we were given the wrong rice ball. We got the right one a few minutes later. The BBQ miso rice ball was alright. Again, just a ball of rice topped with BBQ miso sauce.   Our food finally came about 35 minutes after our rice balls and it was nothing to write home about. The rice was kind of soggy and the curry didn't have a strong flavour. The chicken was pretty good. Crispy on the outside and deliciously moist (I hate that word) on the inside."}
{"text":"I came here when it first opened and I think their food is really great. I highly recommend it. I've talked to the owners a few times and they are very nice folks. I will keep coming back, especially if it's a late night and I need some good food.   The only thing I noticed this time is that they are busier now at the midnight mark but just moving to an empty booth was challenging. I don't mind if the servers have a hard time helping me move my table over since they were busy. I just mind that they forgot after we asked 3 times. We ended up doing it ourselves.   Anyway, I still recommend this place so go! I just hope that as they get busier, their service doesn't lose the warmth it had on my previous visits since they've opened."}
{"text":"Hmm the service was okay. That's me being nice, but needing to tell people about it.. We ordered our food the stir fried beef bowl and some appetizers; the dishes came in fast.   However, we were lucky that's we didn't need anything else because no one came to check on us. We could have another glass of water but didn't want to wait.   Normally I couldn't care less but came time to pay, we had to wave our arms and show some flesh to get someone  to stop ignoring us and ring us up. Anyways, the dishes were good. No doubt.  There is a free ice cream scoop if you check in Yelp. Woo. The guy told me to show the next person my Yelp. He could've just done it then and there but okay I just followed his instruction. Just that we were playing he waiting game a lot."}
{"text":"A few of us yelpers came to Donburi on a Monday night after an elite even in need of something to soak up the alcohol.   Donburi is something akin to Japanese fast food. We were greeted with a warm welcome by the manager who was all smiles from beginning to end. Our orders were taken promptly and I opted for the chicken and egg donburi (rice bowl). The portion that was put in front of me was quite generous; the chicken was fairly tender and had a strong ginger taste. The rice was quite good and nicely cooked; the egg was mixed in with the chicken and kind of got lost. To be honest I would have preferred a whole fried egg over the bowl (like a Korean bibimbap) but sadly this is not what I got. Overall though this was a pretty good meal for a fast food type place.   The restaurant itself is new, bright, and very clean. The food came out quickly and as stated earlier the service was top notch, they even split the bills for our fairly large group. Donburi will not be the best restaurant you go to but if you are in Markham and in need of fast food, skip the drive-thru and come here (they are open late)."}
{"text":"Very good service and the food was pretty good.  The cold soba noodles I had with a quail egg was a little bit more bland than I would have liked it but the xxx dons are quite good. I definitely recommend their rice dishes over their noodle dishes.  Their apps are also very affordable Don't forget to check in to receive free green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"Having a restaurant name like Donburi (Japanese rice bowl) is like having a restaurant name like \"Tacos\" or \"Fish and Chips\". If you're gonna have the same name as an entire category of food, you better be the damn best at making that particular food item.   My boyfriend and I came on a Tuesday night after I've bugged him several times to go (thanks Yelp). The decor is fantastic; like an anime come to life with bright colours and cute illustrations. The service was very friendly throughout the meal and they were happy to give us our free green tea ice cream with check-in.   Between us, we shared two gyudon (beef rice bowl, ~$11 each), a takoyaki (octopus balls, $5.50), a Donburi onigiri (rice ball, $2), a nankotsu skewer (chicken cartilage, $2) and a wasabi oyster skewer ($3). First of all, I have to applaud the fact that you can choose to have the rice in your donburi replaced with finely chopped lettuce and crisp tofu. This fact itself, will keep me coming back repeatedly. The bowls also come with salad and miso soup.   The gyudon is pretty good. The beef is nice and soft and the sauce is sweet and flavourful. I added an egg for a dollar and was glad I did. It comes barely poached in sauce (onsen style). The portions are quite reasonable in my opinion and I actually had to take some home. I was really in love with the takoyaki and nankotsu skewers here. The takoyaki were large and had great sauces and the nankotsu was grilled perfectly. The onigiri was nothing special; just a rice ball with sauce that is reasonable for its $2 price point. The wasabi oyster had a bit of a gritty texture.   Overall, I'm loving this place and see myself becoming a repeat customer. Donburi's donburi is good but I'm not sure it's the best. I've had some pretty tasty ones in Hong Kong. However, without a doubt, this restaurant is a very welcome addition to Markham's smorgasbord of Asian cuisine (did I really just say smorgasbord..?)  (46/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  I enjoyed the Katsu Donburi however for the Teriyaki Donburi I feel like you can get the same quality from Thai Express. For the Udon, the broth was really bland, no deep flavours.. Kinda disappointed . Only thing I reeeeeally enjoyed was the gyoza - it had a different kick to it probably cause of the dried herbs. Very delicious! Service was also great. Overall rating 7/10."}
{"text":"This place has consistently good food, but it can get expensive and the service isn't nearly as consistent. I've been here a few times (like 4-5?) and the food has been delicious every time. The service is really variable, though. It can be rushed and impersonal, although I'll say they are pretty good at filling drinks and bringing you things when you ask for them. The owner is really cool and personable, but they're not always there, obviously. The servers aren't talkative (don't care) but aren't always the sharpest when it comes to clearing plates and dropping the bill at the end (do care).  The food, though, is terrific. I adore the tapas. The short ribs are tender and bursting with flavor, the scallops and garlic shrimp are sumptuous and perfectly cooked, and the miso black cod is a frequent daydream of mine (seriously, GET THIS - umami as anything and more meaty than fishy). The Nagoya style wings have a really interesting spice blend - a tiny bit sweet, a little prickly on the tongue, pairs well with the crisp fried chicken.  The teriyaki chicken breast and nankotsu (cartilage) are good, but there are better things to get. The shrimp tempura is lighter than I've come to expect, particularly compared to other places in the area, but there are better things to get. The onigiri are really cool and non-traditional, but I think they might be onigiri in a technical sense only. The Donburi signature onigiri has cream cheese and (I believe) nori bits on the rice. I wasn't a huge fan - thought it was peppery. Would love to try the BBQ miso, which I have heard is not actually spicy.  As for mains, the omurice is really tasty - I liked the sauces a lot, and the eggs are pleasant-tasting and cooked well. The filling is pretty homogeneous but tastes good. The udon (I've stuck to the katsu udon, but they're all a similar base from what I can tell) is really flavorful - hearty umami goodness that's not overly salty. The noodles are thick and springy. God, I'm hungry writing this.  You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned the actual donburi dishes. Wellllll ... I don't think they're the star here. I tried the beef short rib don during my first visit and found it to be good, but like half vegetable (not enough rice, honestly) with about 60% of THAT being onion. Not my thing at all.  Why 4 stars and not 5? Well, you can definitely wait a while for the food, the service is a little patchy, and the donburi itself isn't actually great - unfortunate because of the name. As I mentioned, it can also get expensive. It's quite possible to pay $20 for dinner for one person, but I think that can be avoided with fewer tapas items.  One more bit: you should ask your server about any specials. There are a few placards and such advertising items like gyu fries and desserts that aren't on the physical menu."}
{"text":"A great place to go for exactly what you expect.  The food here isn't too expensive but it's quality food with a wide range of choices.  Going to be my go to whenever I'm on the area for sure"}
{"text":"I had a fairly good experience coming here a few times for dine in, the rice are nice portion and tastes good, those skewers are small and a bit pricey for what you get, and it really adds up! I haven't tried here for lunch but I heard it's a better deal. But had a really bad experience on a take out, waited 30 mins!! and when we got home, only to find that the kalbi beef was completely burnt, so burnt that you can't even eat it. after all that waiting and starving only to end up with that."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick snack. Similar to Hong Kong Cafes."}
{"text":"Came here on a regular workday to visit my old coworkers for lunch. They only had an hour lunch break and we walked, but thankfully, they didn't have as many guests when we went, so it wasn't extremely busy. However, if it got a little more busy, I'm seriously wondering if an hour is enough time to come here for lunch and head back to the office.   I ordered the curry don katsu for $8.50 as a lunch menu; including tax, it was $9.61. The salad and miso soup came first, though it came a little later than usual because I wasn't even finished these appetizers yet and the dish I ordered for came.   The curry don katsu wasn't spicy - they used Japanese curry, which is very different from Chinese and Indian curry. The dish was a fairly large portion - I wasn't able to finish it, but many people think one portion size is just enough for lunch. The katsu wasn't as crunchy as I hoped for it to be - maybe they can try to serve it separately next time, so that the curry won't make the chicken katsu soggy. Nevertheless, the food was okay, I would come back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I cannot help but give glowing reviews of this little hole-in-a-wall gem of a restaurant. The food is extremely good & satisfying. We've tried almost everything on the menu, and everything is a keeper! You just can't simply go wrong! Even the desserts are fantastic! If I start naming what we liked, I'd end up naming their entire menu. Kudos to the chef!  It's also a great place to drink and have great little side dishes to go with your alcoholic drinks. We looooved the drinks - the Polar Beer: it's like having an ICEE slush puppy & a beer at the same time. They also had a raspberry beer which I tried, and it was so good all the guys in my table ended up getting a glass as well.  Lastly, the reason why I give this place five stars is because of the really great customer service. Their servers are always so friendly with us - consistently! I've been here at least four times, and no matter what time of the day it is, whether it's busy or not, I get great service. Last August during my husband's birthday even though it was just the two of us, they even surprised him with a free birthday dessert of chocolate & raspberry cake!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Donburi in a year and I miss going here, so I thought I'd try them out again. I came here on a Sunday evening and place is a little busy, but we were still able to find a booth.  I want to try their smaller snacks and my BF wanted to get a donburi gyuu don. I find the prices quite high for such a small portion.  And I was reminded of the reason why I have stopped going here for a year: the LONG WAIT! We came hungry and we had to wait 25-30 minutes for our food!  So overall, long wait for food, high price for the serving size, but what could be worth going to is the taste. Their food is tasty I have to give them that. But then again I could say the same for Grand Noodle (which is much cheaper), so whatever."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night at 6:30pm. We were four adults and two kids, and the place was maybe 1/3 occupied. Had it not been for the free green tea ice cream, we would have been VERY dissatisfied. For now, I'll just say I was dissatisfied.   You order yourself on a piece of paper. The menu is mostly rice bowls, udon noodles and appetizers. The takoyaki came first and was undercooked. We sent it back and came back somewhat better but still more mushy than I'm used to. Flavour and toppings were good.   Beef don came next. Good beef flavour and large amount of rice to accompany. Unagi don comes with pink pickled ginger (?) and yellow radishes so if you don't like those things be warned. The beef short rib don was okay but the disproportionate amount of meat to rice makes it hard to enjoy after the toppings are gone.   Chicken wings came next which the kids liked....then adter a long time... My katsu don arrived. How long you ask? Two of the other people were already done eating. Our gyoza app still nowhere to be seen. My empty water glass completely ignored.   Noodles were good but the Katsu was dry. Green tea ice cream was the best thing all night mostly because it was free. We canceled the gyoza by that time. Then it came. Then we tried to tell them we canceled it. Then the guy said its on the house. Then we got the bill... We were charged for gyozas. Then we had to tell them. Then we paid and left. Brutal night."}
{"text":"I would recommend to only come here during their lunch special, because at dinner time it gets expensive and probably not worth it! Lunch specials are a super great deal and they offer a great variety of food. Their decor and design is also super cute! SO thankful for having this restaurant uptown.   I love this place because it's like japanese styled chinese food, LOL. I absolutely love japanese food but I also like chinese food, which is what I feel this place does really well. I don't feel that this place is exactly authentic or can be considered japanese, but it does taste pretty close to it! I have had the Gyuu Curry Don, Takoyaki, and Omurice.   Gyuu Curry Don is AMAZING. Do not undermine their watery curry, because it seems to be watery for a reason. The rice is REALLY good like it's VERY sticky, moist, and short grained. The texture of the curry might be watery, but not the flavour I assure you. When you mix the curry with the rice, WOW!!! Every spoonful is a steaming hot fluffy moist clump of rice that is chock full of flavour (yummy curry) and it's like super duper comfort food. It's drool worthy. The Gyuu Beef is good too, it's sweet and well cooked and has a good serving of onions which I really like. The whole entire bowl is so comforting and so delicious. Takoyaki was rather average and nothing much, there wasn't much octopus and I don't feel it is particularly worth ordering.   Omurice was actually pretty good. The omelette was REALLY good. It was extremely fluffy and almost melt in your mouth! The fried chicken rice on the inside wasn't that good, the chicken was dry and definitely old. It was kind of expected since it was fried rice after all, but I think it could be something that could improve. Wait times for food are okay, not the most efficient but I didn't notice it to be super slow.   Overall, I really do love this restaurant! Their rice bowls are seriously good and this place offers great comfort food. Great place to get your fix for cravings if you're missing some good asian food or even meeting up with friends for food (if you live uptown). It's in a great location, looks super cute (love the comfortable booth seats), and has good food!"}
{"text":"Summary: pleasant looking and friendly vibe, Donburi offers great rice bowls (especially signature beef!) and yummy ongiri in good portion sizes, but deep-fried items taste old  Top Must-Get: donburi gyuu don (signature beef) Top Regret: katsu (any of them!)  Third time here tonight, and second with a big group at night (post-game meals).  You're greeted by a brightly lit location, clean looking shop with cute paper restaurant-themed drawings on the wall (adds a bit of personality to the restaurant if you're into that).  Service is pretty quick, although it wasn't particularly busy on a Wednesday evening at 9:30 pm (3 tables). We got our food after less than a ten minute wait.  But first, you get a mini salad and soup on the house for starters. Soup leans on the salty side (2/5) but salad dressing is pretty good (4/5).  The D1 signature beef is amazing. The beef is very flavourful, and portion size is decent - although you'll need to get the extra beef to get satisfied if you're a big eater. The onions really add a little oomph to the taste and it's hard for me not to get it every time.  The gyuu curry rice is also solid - it has quite a bit of rice in proportion to meat, but the curry is really tasty.  The unagi (eel) don and teriyaki chicken don got a thumbs up from my teammates.  On the other hand, the katsu (deep fried) meals taste disappointing. The oil seems \"old\"  and the unfortunate folks who ordered them felt a bit queasy after.  The ongiri is respectable, but don't order too much - it can get pretty filling if you're using it as dessert and you've already had a don.  The green tea ice cream you get for free when checking in is okay - a bit sweet with a tinge of bitterness that I didn't love. I've definitely had better green tea ice cream elsewhere.  All in all, they do the things they're good at VERY well - but they have some things I'm not quite a fan of (katsu and ice cream). Their signature beef, though, is phenomenal and worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"I started off really liking Donburi. Lately I've been coming later in the evening, and I have noticed the quality of the food I usually order seems to have gone down.   Maybe it's a new cook on the late shift? Maybe I have bad luck? Who knows.   Anyways, tonight has been enough to make me update my review.   I ordered the omurice and the parts of the omlette were raw. I don't really get how parts of the omlette were overcooked and other parts were watery/absolutely raw. There's runny egg white, which I can let slide, but then there is clear egg white. It had both. Literally was not even cooked.   I can sit on an egg and warm it up better than the raw egg whites in my dish.   Nothing like a mouthful of lukewarm raw egg to get you going.   I didn't really want to make a scene out of it. I sighed and ate around it for the most part but did not finish. Paid and left.   Other nights I have gone recently and parts of my dish were warm, like slightly above lukewarm, instead of hot. Soup, rice, etc. The fried food is usually nice and hot at least (since it comes out of a fryer - it better be)   Disappointed. Maybe I'll avoid the place at night or entirely."}
{"text":"Love it here. Another place I found gyudon comparable to Japan. I would def come back here as it's much closer to my house. The service is very nice and the place is really clean.   They have the specials... The gyudon and tongkatsu but they also offer a wide variety of side dishes where you can add on the side. Loved every dish they had. I would suggest sharing everything if you want to taste a lot of items ."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from Donburi before, but this is the first time I've eaten in. I ordered the gyudon without rice. It was $11, if I recall correctly. It comes with tofu and lettuce instead. The gyudon without rice is $0.50 cheaper than the original gyudon and is a menu item unto itself. I actually didn't want the gyudon. I wanted another bowl without rice. I asked if it was doable and was told it was, but that it would cost me $2 extra. I thought that was bizarre. The waitress agreed, but she can't go against management, so being cheap, I went with the gyudon. I was expecting chunks of firm tofu. I got pieces of fried tofu similar to salt and pepper tofu. I also don't think it was lettuce. I'm pretty sure it was cabbage. It was also all covered in mayo. Sure, I may have gone lower carb than the rice option, but it certainly wasn't as healthy as I expected. Tasty, certainly, but not necessarily healthier. There certainly was a good amount of beef though.  All in all, I think they still do the best gyudon I've ever had. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food.   The restaurant is spacious, you can see the chefs cooking, it is very clean although the washroom could use a bit of work. The staff is friendly. My server was very nice and tended to us right away. She took away our bowls quickly when we didn't use them. And they had working tv on with anime show which was pretty awesome. My boyfriend and I tried:   Pork Katsu Curry Rice: the curry sauce was soooo good. Pork was cut and fried perfectly. There was a generous amount of rice and the pork katsu was a really good size.   Gyuu Don: thinly sliced beef with onions and green onions with rice, a special sauce and I added an egg which was perfection. The beef was so tender and flavourful. The sauce i quite enjoyed.  Signature Onigiri: this is a rice ball. Was just one. Rice was not overly cooked and it wasn't too sticky. Texture was perfect. And shaped held.   Chicken karaage: it looked like popcorn chicken but asian style when I first saw this. But I loved it. I wish they had extra sauce on the side. Chicken was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. So far I'm enjoying this size rather than the usual big chunks I usually get when I order karaage from other places.   Sanma Shioyaki: not my cup of tea but still was tasty. I'm not a fan of picking out bones but my BF enjoyed it.   Just a heads up, cash and debit only!"}
{"text":"All in all, this was a great place for many reasons. They food quality was awesome overall, stellar service, and I love the hours of the store.   1. Food (4/5)  I had some of the skewers (around $2), Takoyaki ($5.50), and the BBQ Chicken don ($10.50).   The Takoyaki was actually really good for the price. It would be comparable to the Takoyaki that I got from Guu, a famous izakaya located in North York and Toronto.   The skewers were actually not bad either. They come in about 3 pieces, which you can share with a group of friends if you're feeling adventurous and want to try many more skewers without going over your food budget. However, these do start to rack up and is not really worth it that much to get a bunch of these.  Finally, the main course, BBQ Chicken don. At first glance, the food looked amazing. It was well presented, and definitely instagram worthy. The taste of the don was great too. The mayo that they put on the deep fried chicken with BBQ sauce really complimented one another. My only complaint would be that I wish the bowl as a whole was hotter (temperature-wise). It wasn't quite hot enough for my liking, but other than that, this is a must try.  2. Hours (4.5/5)  Donburi closes really late, and is a great place to go to when you feel those late night munchies. On Saturday, when I went, the place closed at 2am, a bit later than most other restaurants that are in the same plaza, which close around 1am.  3. Service (4.5/5)  The service at this place is great. The servers were very nice and quickly responded to your requests, even though it was pretty late at night. I wouldn't say that the place was packed when I went but it def was not empty. All in all, awesome!  Overall (4/5).   Note: If you check in on Yelp, you get free green tea ice cream!! The was amazinggggg!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a great late night spot but recently food quality has gone down significantly.   The booth at the very back had a lot of fruit flies hanging around and we noticed a COCKROACH on the wall.   Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"i love this place cause i really enjoy their beef don. I get enough beef from it. This time when i went their rice was under cooked. Some rice was a little hard in the centre.   When i went to the assigned table they had some leftover food from the previous customers. Their cleaning can be better. Even though they cleaned the table right away but cleanness should be something very important for a restaurant...."}
{"text":"Honestly, donburi is a gem! I kept seeing beautiful pics of dons/udons/kebabs all over instagram and yelp and I HAD to go for myself.  The service there is super friendly and they go above and beyond to please their customers. She even asked us where we were coming from, since it was a late dinner. They also have this thing going on where you throw a football into a small hole to get free ice cream/onigiri. She was super sweet, encouraging and definitely made a dining experience more fun.   Their menu is surprisingly large and full of delicious looking food. Ordered the chicken terikayi udon (udon dish was nothing special.. pretty bland, chicken teriyaki was perfect and the skin crisped to perfection), wasabi beef kebob (bomb!), nagoya style chicken wings (seasoned perfectly) and umami don (holy.. is this ever good! coming from somebody who can't stand the taste of eel) In my opinion, their food is better than just 'okay' and I'd definitely go back to try more!  Also- remember to use your yelp check in offer to get a free green tea ice cream. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food and I really love my white rice so Donburi is a match made in heaven for me. I have been dying to come here for a while now and I'm so glad I did because this place doesn't disappoint.   If I could have ordered the entire menu in one sitting, I would have. But you know that not really possible, so I'll definitely be back to try the rest of their delicious rice bowls.   For the appetizers, we ordered the okra, nonkotsu, and uzura-maki skewers to try out, as well as the takoyaki, shrimp tempura, wasabi oyster, renkon chips, and seaweed salad. The nonkotsu was chicken cartilage and pleasantly surprised me because it also had a decent amount of meat on it as well so it was definitely satisfying to eat. The uzura-maki was a quail egg wrapped in bacon, and was decent although I probably wouldn't order it again. The wasabi oyster was too heavily battered, but the wasabi mayo sauce had a nice little kick of wasabi in there. Shrimp tempura was light and crisp and the lotus root chips were oddly satisfying.   I ended up going with the umami don which included eel, imitation crab, and pickles served up with mayo and unagi sauce. The flavours are reminiscent of a takoyaki or okonomiyaki - sweet and creamy. I would have liked to see more toppings personally, as there's quite a bit of rice there. That being said, the don is definitely filling.  Overall, donburi is a great place to get awesome Japanese rice bowls and more. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Gyu don was really good, although I think they use lots of MSG in it. Service is not good, I have difficult time to call the server since they just dont pay attention to customers and never check on us. Will come back to try many of their  appetizer size food."}
{"text":"I was craving Japanese food and happened to be around the area so I decided to give this brightly red-themed restaurant a shot. Immediately, I noticed anime shows on a big screen tv which was entertaining. The decor was very lively as well. The place wasn't too busy, and we were immediately sat down at a table that needed cleaning, but the waiters, unfortunately, forgot about us until we decided to ask for a menu and change our seats due to our discomfort looking at the leftover bowls.  I ordered a Pork Katsu Curry Rice ~$7.50, which was delightfully served with salad and miso soup as part of the lunch special. I loved that the pork katsu was crispy and fresh, which is a big part of the experience. However the curry wasn't too memorable, as it was not as flavourful as I had expected. The rice was really well made, but there was a lot more in comparison to the curry. They're open late so maybe I'll try something else, instead next time. :)"}
{"text":"I had an amazing birthday gathering with my friends at Donburi. I had a group of 10 and still sitting comfortably. I made reservation for 7:30pm on a Thurs which I'm glad I did, this place is mad popular (people know where to find good food). They know it's my birthday and made me balloon with \"happy birthday\" on. You can tell by little gesture of how attentive they are with details. Our food came very quickly after we order and they are amazingly delicious. Some highlights of our meals are Ikayaki (grill squid, it's so soft and perfect sponge text and not hard to chew at all), vegetable tempura, I love their curry don (if you like sweet curry, you can't find better one anywhere else) and their Gyuu don, Oyako don... Staffs were super friendly and accommodating. Their effort of running this place had make my birthday extra memorable. I am highly recommending this place to anyone for any kind of occasion."}
{"text":"This Is a good place for donburi. Quality and quantity about average.  The chicken skewer I had was pretty bland but the black cod was very tasty, scallop skewer nothing special.  The beef donburi gyuu don was the best and quite filling. Service was okay the food was hot."}
{"text":"I really love this place!  Their don's are amazing, and so tasty.  I usually get their tofu don, which comes with rice, tofu, and I think cabbage in a Teriyaki sauce. The pricing is also really reasonable, coming up under $10 per don, which good size portion.  The service is okay, depending on what waitresses are working that night.  Some are super helpful and friendly, and some are not as much.  If you check-in you also get a free green tea ice cream.  And they also take Vicinity, so remember to rack up those points!  The only thing that is weird though, is you only get a Vicinity point if you finish your food.  Is this to save on take-out boxes?"}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst. Could be a bit cleaner. Friend food was very dark in colour, oil needs to be changed. Rice was too soggy and wet. Moji is a lot better in quality and taste"}
{"text":"Ha. I did end up giving this place another go and my experience this time was way better than the first. Although I was tempted to order udon again I DIDNT. I decided to go for their gyudon. I also got their takoyaki balls. The gyudon was pretty good. They were pretty fking generous with the meat and rice like damn. 1/4 in and I was like I'm done. I was legit stuffed. The beef meat was actually really nice. It was not tough at all and it literally melted in my mouth. Very tender indeed. Rice was quite nice, BUT it was just a tad bit too um.. watery? It was kind of like congee for me LOL. But yeah other than that, rice was okay and generally the gyudon wasn't too overpowering in taste. Not too sweet, not too salty, it was just right. This is just a personal preference, but I like adding some sriracha or whatever hot sauce for that extra kick (but they don't have hot sauce so *sad face*). If you get this during lunch time, you get a drink which is pretty cool (green tea or milk tea). I got the milk tea (but it was pretty damn bad no offence lawl). For the takoyaki balls, they were alright. For $5.50 you get 6 balls (which is more than what usually get at other places so that's cool). My only argument is that they were not as hot as I wanted them to be.  Unlike last time, the service this time was a lil better. Food came pretty damn fast. Oh and like last time, they still play anime. This time they had One Punch Man on. Not gonna lie, it was pretty annoying having to hear the dude go \"hhhuuuuuuUUUUUUUAGGGGGHHHH\" every time he punched something LOOL. Ah and I found it funny how only one person working there tried to be like the other Japanese restaurants by greeting the customers. He was the only one and it sounded a lil awkward (like come on guys join the dude) but hey A for trying lawl"}
{"text":"I came here because they were opened til 2am. We tried the skewers and the portion was very small, it tasted okay but not worth the price. The rice was very dry and the curry the was very bland. The chicken katsu has wayyyy too much batter and the chicken was just a thin layer. Unless I'm hungry, nearby, and its late, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"a solid 3.5 stars  i've been here several times, and the quality has pretty much stayed the same  pork katsu curry rice the pork katsu was perfectly fried; crispy on the outside but still moist & tender inside   cabbage was a nice contrast & balanced the heaviness of the dish  curry could use some kick though   umami don  basically a rice bowl topped w/ unagi, kabayaki sauce, and spicy mayo and as the name implied, it was definitely savory but the two sauces made it too heavy for my preference   bbq chicken don & unagi don these two were pretty standard  nothing too memorable but still enjoyable and unagi over bbq chicken  overall, donburi is a nice addition to the neighborhood it's great to have a jap place that doesn't specialize in sushi  go during lunch specials though; it's the same quality & amount of food for a much lower price  and check in to yelp for free green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Friday for dinner. We were seating quickly but service was a tad slow.   I ordered the gyuu don and was actually surprised at the portion size. There was a lot more rice than I expected. There was a good amount of meat though.   I like the menus here as there are pictures of everything.  You also write your own order on paper so that limits your interaction with the waiters.  I'll come back again."}
{"text":"I have to say it is very hard to find an Asian restaurant with bar/high tables these days. Due to certain circumstances, I have to look for high tables when I go out and unexpectedly Donburi had them. Awesome! So I have been here in the past and glad to see that it is still around and busy. The staff are quite attentive and we got our food in a timely manner. When you order,  you select your items on paper and give it to the staff whenever you're ready. We all got our own Don and chose a few tapa style items to share- takoyaki, beef tataki, fried lotus root,  skewer of Scallop and okra. We also got gyu spicy fries (Japanese style poutine in my opinion with beef) which was a huge portion but flavourful and tasty. For my main meal, I opted for the Japanese grilled chicken with  egg don.  It was rice with a raw egg and chicken with a lot of green onions- be sure to have gum after your meal lol.  I went away from the traditional and popular Japanese beef rice but my friend who got it enjoyed her meal.  My other friend had the omurice with which I had a bite and it was yummy but lacked the right amount of chicken.  All in all, dinner was good and I would definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Environment: the environment is pretty nice . seats are very comfortable and overall the restaurant is really clean  Food:we ordered 3 dishes the famous beef bowl, fried chicken egg rice bowl, and the short ribs rice. Very good food overall!  Strongly recommend my friends to try it!"}
{"text":"Great place because it opens late, but the rice is a bit oily. Just stick to the regular Donburi and you should be ok. Also comes with soup and salad so you have a complete meal."}
{"text":"I actually like this place a lot because of the spacious tables and friendly staff. I often would come here for studying when I could focus at home, get some food and plug away at my work. Food-wise, it's fairly average but if you're looking for a place to sit then it's good."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim. Pleasantly surprised by the food. Also our server was very nice; she knew how to describe the food well. We had the beef tataki, takoyaki, signature onigiri, tuna tataki don and mentai chicken skewer. All were very good and I would eat them again except the mentai chicken skewer, it was not great. Free green tea ice cream from checking in is a great bonus."}
{"text":"Looking for a late night bite to eat, my friend and I came here for fast food that isn't fast food (ie McDs).  Ordered the BBQ Chicken Donburi - it was ok - it didn't blow my socks off.  Perhaps b/cit was later at night the BBQ chicken wasn't moist (yup used the most hated word out there...lol).   I just felt overall it was lacking some flavour.  But it was quite filling for me - I had to take some home.  But of course it's me so I usually end up taking my food home as the portions are too big for me.  The staff were all friendly and the place was clean.  I do think I will come back and try a few other options - I see several great reviews from some of my fellow yelpers so perhaps just didn't order the best thing on the menu"}
{"text":"This is a cute looking place with fast service and decent food. I ordered the umami rice bowl which reminded me of a japanese version of bibimbap with eel. There was too much terriyaki sauce, making the dish too sweet for my taste but it came with complementary salad and miso soup. I would not order it again but am interested to try some of their non rice bowls.  They also have a lot of snack foods. I tried the scallop, cuttlefish and chicken heart sewers. My favourite was the scallop, it was so juicy! The karaage chicken was yummy as well.  I would come back to try the spicy gyu fries and some more of their snacks."}
{"text":"I had curry & pork katsu don, special rice ball and chicken karage. The karage was really yummy and 100% recommended.   For every order you also get a vegetable salad and miso soup."}
{"text":"I love the service here. Everyone is very friendly and inviting. It's a good location with lots of parking. I come back here over and over again cause the food isn't bad and the price is decent.    But the past 4-5 I was there , the meat is Always over cooked. Hope next time it will be better."}
{"text":"Environment wasn't bad, servers were and polite. But the food wasn't too good, it was average. I wouldn't go back again. We ordered pork jowl skewers, all I can taste was the burned stuff from the grill. It wasn't black at all but tastsed really burnt. The salad they gave us in the beginning was brown and old. The miso soup was decent, normal stuff you can buy from the supermarket and make at home. We ordered takoyaki which was the ones that came in frozen and they just deep fry. It wasn't cripsy enough thou. The onigiri we ordered was the house special one, it was plain, just tasted like rice and seaweed. Something you buy at T&T."}
{"text":"We were craving some omurice and found this place nearby, so decided to check it out. We had the gyuudon, chicken omurice, beef tongue skewer with teriyaki sauce, and the scallop skewer.  Menu: http://donburi.ca/the-menu/  Taste: 8/10  The chicken omurice was tasty and flavourful, although I didn't really taste chicken in there. Perhaps it was diced into really small pieces and there weren't many pieces in there.  If it wasn't called \"chicken omurice\" I wouldn't have known there was chicken in there.  Gyuudon was delicious and we added an egg on top for $1.50. The onion was cooked until it was very soft and there was plenty of beef. Steven found the sauce to be a little weak.  Beef tongue skewer was flavourful and chewy, would get this again. Scallop skewer had some sweet sauce on it, not my cup of tea.  Value: 8/10  $11 for the donburi + $1.50 for the egg add-on. $10 for the omurice. $2.25 for the beef tongue skewer and $3 for the scallop skewer.  Plus the free scoop of green tea ice cream from the yelp check-in.  We were both super full after the meal.  ** Average cost per diner: $15-20 after tax and tip  Service/Convenience: 10/10  Service was prompt, food was delivered quickly. Location is easy to find.  Would go back? Yes, will be back for the rice dishes, Steven really likes the gyuudon.  Would recommend to friend? Yeap.  Similar places: Gyugyuya also does gyuudon, and Petit Potato serves a diff style of omurice  **Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"The flavours are great for all their rice bowls.  Nice decor and atmosphere. It is a lot of rice though and I feel there isn't enough toppings to match the amount of rice they give."}
{"text":"Popped in here late on a Snowy Tuesday, evening.  There were a few tables with patrons, but mostly the place was empty.  I wanted take out, so I asked the host what was popular and she indicated the curry was definitely one of the more popular ones.  Ok, I ordered up the Pork Katsu Curry Rice dish.    The place wasn't much inside, in fact it's pretty basic.  I had asked how long I'd have to wait for my food and the gal said 15 mins.  Ok, I think I waited less than 5 mins and my food was being bagged up for me.    When I got the meal back to my hotel, I was pleasantly surprised.  In the bag was the pork katsu over rice, the the curry and veggies in one container, another container with the salad, and yet another one with miso soup.  All this for $11 !  I pour the curry over the the katsu, and it's delish !  again, $11 !  How can you go wrong with that ?  The curry was flavourful and the miso soup was nice and hot (temperature)!      Overall, I am pleasantly surprised at the good quality of the meal, the speed at which my food came out and the extras (ie: Salad and Miso).  I was honestly expecting only the Kastu.  I think I'll be returning and trying some of the other dishes there. Sorry I forgot to take a photo... wolfed down my food a bit too fast"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, really great quantity for the price you pay.  My friend and I went at around noon and it took us a bit to get seated, despite the restaurant being a bit quiet. Though, the decor of the restaurant did a pretty good job distracting us - there were lots of drawings, two TVs airing Big Hero 6 and a mini stall selling merchandise of the restaurant.   I ordered the curry pork don katsu and I found myself unable to finish the meal. The curry tasted great, there was an ample amount of rice and I was full by the end of it.   Overall, I had a good experience and I'll come back next time to try their gyudon!"}
{"text":"I came here under the recommendation of my best friend :) shes always got good taste in food and she knows what I like best. Definitely enjoyed the food here! It's got flavor and is something new everyone should try!   I'm sad to say i didn't try the curry which as it appears, has very mixed reviews. I got one of the rice bowls with the eel and cucumbers and imitation crab. I forget the name but it's really good!! It's like they took California rolls and put some eel in it and just made it into a bowl of rice! I'm not sure if that's what they were going for but that's what it tastes like! :)  I love the set up of the restaurant. Very open and spacious with enough TVs to entertain but not distract from conversation. The couches are spacious for the booths too!   Service wise, it's average. Friendly people and fast service :)  Oh and check in for ice cream! I'm not a big ice cream fan but it was pretty good!  :)   It's horrible traffic on highway seven for those of us who don't live in that area but I would still return! :)"}
{"text":"Polar beer! they have polar beer.  I ordered their lunch combo, the portion was good, food was yummy.  They have Japanese animation TVs playing in the restaurant, and there was no line-ups."}
{"text":"Went to this place on Sunday night. There were only a 4 to 5 tables eating. Not many customer. This is one of those Chinese operated japanese restaurant trying to imitate japanese food. Food quality is so so or average. Typical Chinese opened restaurant quality or even slightly below.   We tried the store signature Beef Don. Taste was okay. You can only taste mostly the sweet soy sauce. Amount of beef is decent. Nothing special. We also tried the Pork Cutlet with egg on rice (Katsu don) Pork was dry. Doesn't feel like they fried the cutlet fresh. Too salty and soggy. They poured some raw egg white on top at the end. This is not the proper way to cook this. You are suppose to cook this until the eggs are half cooked with the cutlet and veggie together. Not cooked all the ingredient and then pour raw egg on top. Very disappointed. Also tried the Yakitori Chicken with egg in the middle on rice, forgot what they called it. Taste is just okay. Amount of chicken is good. Ordered a assorted tempura. They over did the flour on them. May be they think that they will look bigger on the plate. I had to break off chunks of flour before eating them. I rather they do it properly and just place nicely on the plate. Quality over quantity. The rice they used is like a mix of long grain and short grain rice. Why not just use japanese rice? Tasted weird.  Overall, food is only OK. I think its over priced for this kind of quality of food. Food were very slow. I have worked at similar restaurant before. I know how to cook these food and know how long it should take. The food we ordered are very simple dishes. We waited for like half an hour for the rice. The tempura came another half an hour later when we finished the rice already. Come on. That's ridiculous considering the restaurant is not even half full. At least serve the food together.  They don't give you tea for free. That's abnormal for this type of restaurant.   Service was not very attentive. We waited a long time to order our food or get the bill or get them to give us the change. We have to call them over every single time after waiting too long.   Will not come back to this restaurant. Ever."}
{"text":"Love the clean, white/red/light wood modern feel of the restaurant. Good place for lunch!  Gyuu don lunch combo - comes with miso soup (good) and salad. Love the beef is thin sliced, not dry at all. The sauce and onions give the rice bowl a subtle flavor.. halfway through I just added soy sauce myself.   Katsu don - love the egg and onions. Pork is ok.. batter could be crispier and has a slight taste in the oil.   Pork toro - quite thin but I like the fatty sea salt flavor  Mentai Chicken - liked this better than the wasabi, good spicy and roe texture  3.5 stars.. I would return to try diff menu options.. tons of rice bowls, udon, 'japas' and skewers."}
{"text":"Price is okay but portions might not be big enough if you're really hungry. The sauce was good but nothing too special. All in all an alright place if you're craving rice."}
{"text":"Came here late night and it's the only thing that opened till late in that plaza.  I ordered and chicken cutlet curry rice and my frd ordered pork cutlet curry rice. Around $10 each I guess it's ok. The curry was good and a LOT of sauce to cover all the rice which is good (and lots of rice too) but the chicken cutlet and pork cutlet were over cooked and dry. Meh Service was meh too. Took too long to even get a spoon. Somehow they always looked away rather than being attentive.  Good that they take credit card.   Overall nothing special and probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"Quality and quantity has gone downhill now. The quantity of the pork in their Katsudon is noticeably less and the rice they use is quite different.  My last pick up order with on Oct19 was extremely disappointing - MUSHY RICE!   I will give them another chance, but if they mess it up - THIS IS IT!"}
{"text":"ERMMEGEERD...if I was still a short round anime loving 14 year old I would be throwing dolla bills at the staff here. This place is lit...hold up I am still a short round anime nerd...just 5 years older and with less dolla bills. Regardless I'm making sure to come back to this Japanese eatery  First off the food is boooomb. The karaage is juicy fried bits of happiness. The Siracha mayo and jap mayo add a deeper flavour to balance out that salt  Their takoyaki was fried perfectly with and nice crispy coat and gooey inside. However Donburi suffers from a common takoyaki mistake...there be like only one piece of octopus in my balls. Without it it's just hard balls filled with goo. Not my ting   The show stoppers were donburi themselves. Although the rice could be seasoned better, they give a large portion of it. The curry chicken Katsu is ORGASMAGICAL. The spicy beef bowl also had a generous portion of shredded meat piled on top.   The only complaint is the staff. Although there were only about 12 people seated the food took way to long to come. Think about that night with that guy who wasn't great but just wouldn't finish? Felt exactly like that lol...  Good place to grab lunch and study as they have wifi and outlets. They do have a liquor licence and serve some frozen beer."}
{"text":"Great spot for a solid, hearty and filling meal. I've been to Donburi a few times and would definitely go there again if I'm in the area. Overall if you like rice based dishes you should definitely pay Donburi a visit!  Food 5/5 - From the few times I've been there I've had the BBQ Chicken Don, the Chicken Katsu Curry Rice and the Chicken Omurice (my girlfriend had that). All were pretty good, the chicken for all of the dishes were nice and soft, not too dry. For the Omurice and BBQ Chicken Don there were other garnishes and seasonings on the rice to make it very flavourful, yet not overwhelming. My only (very minor) complaint would be that that chicken Katsu Curry Rice had just a little bit too much sauce for my liking, but it was bearable. The curry was also very flavourful and not too salty.   Service 5/5 - Staff were very friendly, service was great, not really much to say about it.  Price 4.5/5 - I believe pretty much all the items that I ordered were roughly $10. There was a lot of meat, a lot of rice and overall it was very filling and tasty. It is definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Good value at lunch time. It's pretty quiet on weekdays. They even have Hong Kong style tea, which was a bonus, though unexpected at a Japanese cuisine. Food is very average, and service is so so."}
{"text":"I wanted to try their food since the items they've listed on their website looks good. However, I called in and they refused to do food delivery (without even asking me where I live, which is very close to them) because they are too \"busy\". Therefore, they just lost a customer because I will never go to that restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for a very casual meal however, prices were higher than expected for offerings."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while, and give it a try today.  But my friends and I are all disappointed! Gyoza have been over cooked, and both the wrappers and fillings are very dry.  Grilled chicken hearts are overcooked as well.  The rice in the Donburi signature onigiri, tuna takai don and chicken omurice are all very mushy; way too mushy and sticky!  Takoyaki is the only dish that has been cooked perfectly.  Very slow service!!"}
{"text":"Overall experience was okay. One time I ordered a skewer- the chicken was still raw.   The rice bowls were alright. I had their tofu rice bowl before but a bit too much oil in their tofu.  Overall it was okay- the decorations are very anime themed."}
{"text":"Too sweet.  The 3 bowls of rice we ordered were all too sweet.  The beef of the signature beef bowl was nothing special.  Maybe if they didn't strongly promote it, my expectation would have been lower.  The deep fried pork cutlet and the deep fried chicken were both decent.  The sauces on the rice of all three dons were identical, and the sauce was way too sweet.  The rice was well portioned; it was sufficient to satisfy a man of average appetite.  We also ordered a few snacks.  They tasted from average to good.  My favourite was the takoyaki ($5 for 6 balls).  The chicken thigh skewer was fair ($2).  I don't mind ordering it again.  The deep fried oyster ($3.5) was good for the novelty, but I won't order it again.  I enjoyed the snacks more than the rice bowl.  This doesn't sit right with me.  Shouldn't don be the best thing at a place named donburi?"}
{"text":"It's funny how the Chinese name of the Donburi restaurant is called ???, which is a really popular Japanese fast food chain in Asia, known as Yoshinoya in English. The 2 restaurants are not related however, despite them sharing the same Chinese name and are both known for their Gyu Don (Beef strips on rice).  Environment: Upon walking into the store, I immediately noticed that it's very Anime-centric. They have cute Anime figurines and posters and there was even Anime playing on the TV above. It's a really nice environment for both Anime lovers or just regular people wanting to grab some food while hanging out.   Food: Since they are known for their Gyu Don we decided to give it a try to see how this compares with Yoshinoya's. We also ordered some skewers and some Takoyaki on the side. Also, I was delighted to find out that the Yelp check-in offer still worked and I was able to get a free matcha ice cream at the end.  -   The Gyu Don was able $10 and it came with a bowl of lettuce salad and a bowl of miso soup. The portion of the rice bowl was good size and very filling. However, both me and my friend agreed that it still doesn't compare to the amazing Gyu Don that you can get at Yoshinoya, even though it is a decent Gyu Don.  -   I didn't quite like the Takoyaki very much, and for the price of $5.99 for 6 pieces it wasn't a very good deal. I found the batter to be too firm and chewy, and the food didn't taste very hot when I got it, so it may not have been freshly made to order.  -   The skewers averaged $2 each and to be honestly it was severely overpriced for how small they were. For the same price you could get a low more meat at a Chinese BBQ restaurant. The skewers didn't taste so well either, I think we got beef, chicken, and chicken knee caps.   TL:DR -- Decent Gyu Don, Takoyaki and skewers didn't tasted that good and were overpriced for the portion that you're getting, but good dining environment though. I don't think I will come back for another visit unless I'm looking for some late night snacks."}
{"text":"Taste: 3 Service: 5 Value: 2 Presentation: 3 Overall: 3.4 rounded down to 3  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. I couldn't decide between the omurice and the tonkotsu curry but I've been craving Japanese curry for a while so I decided to order that.  Let's dive right into the review.  The dish looked OK, there was curry dripping down the sides of the bowl and it got my fingers dirty. Quite a sloppy job in my opinion. The curry was pretty average but there was more rice than anything else in the dish. I wished there was a bit more tonkotsu.   The waitress came by so many times to pour our water I was surprised. It felt like she was standing behind us with a jug of water just waiting for us to drink our water xD  This dish was more on the pricier side. I think they had too much rice in the dish and I felt it didn't quite justify the price point.   In conclusion, the curry was OK. But all I felt was regret for not getting the omurice instead. That's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago and had the oyako don again, as good as ever! Very fast, and really filling, could not finish it all, the kimchi was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"y"}
{"text":"Good service here. We were seated promptly, they made sure our water was always full and the food came out fast. I appreciate how the menu here has a photo of every item.   I ordered the Gyuu Don which was a bowl of rice with beef on top. The beef was tasty and there was a lot more rice than I expected. I was quite full from the meal, the portion sizes here are good.   I would come back to try out their other menu items.   Checked in here and got free ice cream. yay."}
{"text":"We first tried the food when Donburi had a booth at one of the Asian hockey tournaments back in the spring. Their gyudon is out of this world. Thinly sliced sirloin, perfectly seasoned and cooked, OMG honestly I could eat it every single day. But then I'm a sucker for a good gyudon.   My Mom and I were starving so we went a little crazy with the ordering (for 2 people). The chicken karaage was outstanding, and the spicy sauce they use was so good. Seaweed salad portion was huge. The agedashi tofu portion was also big, I think 6+ pieces? They serve it with the dashi separate so it isn't soggy which we liked. Ordered chicken thigh (momo) and scallop on a skewer, both were delicious. The miso fried onigiri was delicious, not as fried as we would've liked but flavour-wise it was spot on.   Service was slow and our food came out really slowly so by the end we weren't even hungry anymore and we still had dishes arriving at the table. Ambiance was nice though so we enjoyed our leisurely meal and packed up our leftovers to take home.   Already looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - Donburi is good. Perhaps a bit overpriced for what it is, but it's definitely filling and a satisfying eat.   This is located in the Commerce Gate plaza with Kinton, Chatime, Dagu Rice Noodle, etc. near the entrance on Commerce Valley West. It's pretty spacious inside and the environment is very casual and comfortable - there are TVs that play anime or Japanese movies in the background. I stayed longer here just because I was enjoying myself watching anime!  The cheapest donburis (for dinner) are 10 dollars and up. The bowl always looks like it's small but it's actually huge and will fill you because they give you so much rice. I've had the curry katsu here and the unagi don. The curry katsu is okay - I've been spoiled by places like Fat Ninja Bite and Katsuya where their katsu is made with real bread crumbs and so the difference is noticeable. But the curry is Japanese style and sweet and the bowl itself is still tasty.  The unagi don is more expensive at $14 dollars. They give you a decent amount of unagi though I think Hanabi at Midland and Finch gives you a similar amount for only $10. It includes pickled daikon/radish, ginger, and cabbage with a light dressing. The flavors mixed together quite nicely and it was delicious!  Service was friendly, warm, and efficient. I would go back if I'm in the area and wanting a heartier meal! Though I don't think it would be my first choice."}
{"text":"I ate here many times in the pass few years. Seems like this restaurant has been around for a while. Food is pretty good usually, but not impressive.  The restaurant is cosy and comfortable with the usual decors that you would find in a typical Japanese restaurant catering to the younger crowds. I don't like to think of myself as being old, but these styles no longer interest me that much.  Food is ok tasty and the portion is enough but I find that the sauces used over the rice and toppings too sweet for my taste. I know donburi usually is sweet and most Japanese dishes like to add sugar but I had donburi elsewhere with proper amounts of sweetness. Also, the appetizers portion are small and a little overprice I think. I wouldn't make it a mission to return here but I won't object if a friend suggested it.  Taste *** Price *** Portion ***"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say but it was a below average dining experience for me. I used to LOVE their chicken dons! They were very flavourful & delicious! Maybe it was the specific dish I had ordered which made the overall experience a little short handed.   I ordered the \" Spicy Salmon Don\" , this was their current store promotional item. It was listed as limited quantity on the board. Fortunately , when I asked the waitress there were still some available to order.    The service was lacking that day, we had to continuously wave down the waitress/waiter. Their back were constantly towards the customer so they couldn't see us when we wave them down. At one point , I want to stand up and do everything myself without their service. However, near the end of our dining experience the waitress finally started to refill our water.   Spicy salmon don - Raw spicy salmon with cucumber bedded on tempura bits. The sauce for the salmon on top was pretty solid. However, they added soy sauce / teriyaki sauce ontop of the tempura bits which made the overall experience a little unbearable. WAY TOO SALTY!   Final verdict- 3/5! With the service lacking and the food was a bummer. It was hard to enjoy this experience.   Side note : They gave free green tea ice cream if you check in. Brownie points for that !"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night at around 10:30pm. The parking lot was maxed out so we had to park underground. Inside the restaurant only had about 5-6 tables being served. There were two waiters and I found the service to be slightly on the slow side but acceptable.   Spicy Gyu Fries $7 - first bite tasted weird to me but after a few more it really grew on me and I really enjoyed it. Soft pulled beef on top of fries with a little bit of cheese and mayo. My only complaint was that the fries were a bit hard and were missing the crispiness that I would like it to have.   Omurice $8 - eggs were really soft and smooth. I wish I could make my eggs like this. This is my first time trying this dish and I was pleasantly surprised with the overall taste. The size of the dish is pretty decent and would be considered filling for most people. Another dish I really enjoyed. Simple but good.  Katsu Curry $9.50 - nice curry flavour. A very slight sweetness to the curry sauce. The pork cutlet was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. This dish is a bit more filling than the omurice. There was also carrots and potatoes to top off this dish. Tasted great and would be happy to order all the above dishes again.  Meals came with salad and miso soup. Also if you use the Yelp check-in offer you can claim a free scoop of green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price, bright and clean environment and friendly staff.  great place for lunch dinner or late night !"}
{"text":"Donburi is situated at the Commerce Gate plaza, next to many bubble tea stores and many other restaurants.  I sometimes come here for lunch.  They have a pretty good lunch selection for under $10. It comes with milk tea or green tea, soup,  and salad. It had a good meat to rice ratio. I usually get the Oyakudon, which is Japanese chicken and egg in a rice bowl.  It's filling for me, and I usually need to pack up my leftovers.   We usually arrive at 1pm, and the service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"Haven't been back to this place in half a year. A lot has changed since the last visit. Last time I came the prices increased and they had got rid of one of the don bowls, and that was one of my favorite one too. The Karage Don. They now give you the choice of getting a side of karage and a bowl of rice. I  believe it will still come out to be cheaper than buying a don bowl which is around $10-$12 now... before it used to be $9- $9.50 only.   Inflation does make a huge difference..... So I had went for lunch hoping to get karage since I was craving that, and I know donburi was a pretty good place to go for it since i've had it several times in the past. Unfortunately, the staff or kitchen was not serving anything that was not don bowls.......  That really sucked, since I had ordered the bbq don bowl and it's still chicken so I don't see how it's more difficult to make karage... which is also chicken but deep fried.....   The staff had changed since the last time I came. The staff were more friendly before but not this time around. They have more unfamiliar faces from before  and one waitress can barely communicate and understand english..   I'd probably come back here one more time for dinner next to see if there is any difference from my lunch experience but if it turns out to be disappointing once again, Donburi, you guys aren't what it used to be and that's really disappointing...."}
{"text":"Loved loved everything!   Came here for a late dinner on Friday night. Place was not busy, service was great, food came pretty fast.  You gotta try their donburi original rice balls. They're so good with a nice crunch on the outside and great flavours inside. Love crispy rice!   Squid was so tender and flavourful! Chicken karaage was topped with cheese and super yummy. Loved the pork curry katsu rice bowl. $10 and so worth it. Crispy pork strips, delicious curry and just the right amount of rice to soak it up. Also got a few skewers, all good.   This is a great addition to the area for Japanese tapas and rice bowls. Prices were good, found it to be less $$ than other jap tapa places downtown and in north York.   Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Came here once and never going back. I visited in early January with a friend and honestly kind of want to give a 1 star even. I was super disappointed with the quality of the food. Maybe we were unlucky that day but my experience was so bad that I don't plan on returning. The food was so salty and lacked actual flavor. I got the chicken teriyaki and it was basically like I was eating sea salt. The chicken itself tasted bland as if it wasn't marinated plus it was dry. My friend got the chicken gyuu don which comes with an egg. Her dish was also salty. Nothing special about this place. Service was also bad as the waiters weren't even busy and took so long. Apparently it used to be a lot better. Parking is also very difficult to find in this plaza. Don't even bother. It was a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Yummy food and excellent service today!  Our server was very informative and not intrusive.  I had a tuna tataki don that was very flavorful.  I was craving chicken wings so i got those too.  Every bite packed with flavour.  Also the cod was really tasty as well.  Well cooked.  Sweet and delicious.  Definitely going back again.  Highly recommend this place to those who are looking for a meal that will leave you full happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"They have some pretty good rice bowls such as gyu (beef) and chicken and pork katsu, decent curry sauce. Good variety of appetizers. Prices are probably a bit high for what it is, but Japanese food is considered kind of fancy nowadays.  I came with my GF after the Blue Jays won ALDS Game 5, and they gave us free ice cream cause we were in Jays gear!"}
{"text":"This was the perfect late night bite to go to. Open until midnight and the portions are BIG! I love Donburi!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere.  As soon as you walk into the restaurant, you immediately receive a warm welcome in Japanese. The restaurant is bright, clean, and you have a good view of the kitchen area as well. Friendly service and staff.  The prices are reasonable and I would recommend trying and sharing a few small dishes in addition to the donburi and udon noodle dishes. I would have wanted to try more dishes, but there were only two of us and our stomachs were too full, even for dessert! We had:  Soup and salad (they seemed to have put their own spin on the salad dressing which was a nice touch) Chicken gyoza (crispy, not greasy) Ikayaki (cooked well and not too chewy) Beef udon (tender beef with tasty broth) Umami don (very flavourful and beautiful presentation)  For drinks, we tried the strawberry and lime cider (delicious!) and the mango and soju drink (bitter and sweet!).  Next time, I will make sure that I save room for dessert, as I've heard that they have panna cotta and green tea creme brulee. I may also want to try their okonomiyaki fries and other tapas dishes.  Overall, great place visit with friends or family, and it's definitely different from what's available in the area.  I've posted a couple of photos, but after the first dish arrived, I became too preoccupied with eating and forgot to take photos of the other dishes! Next time!"}
{"text":"Been here so many times and always have good experiences. The lunch combo is even a good deal, cheaper price and includes drink. My favorite is the \"no carbs gyu don\". Must try!"}
{"text":"One of a kind in markham now I don't have to go to kinka anymore. There food was excellent starting with my favourite the taoyaki balls then with the udon not salty at all and a sweet succulent flavor. The chicken karage was perfectly crisp and hot so you know they're fresh . There scallop dish is excellent melts in your mouth. There price value is excellent I will definetly come back"}
{"text":"The chefs here seems really lazy; we went for lunch on a Sunday (noon) and they said the chef is not making katsudon today (or any pork cutlet dishes).. wth?  One of our order was chicken curry cutlet... the chicken was pre-deep fried, it was cold and the curry sauce was just room temperature so it was pretty bad, considering they charge a hefty $12.99 for it too!  The whole time the chefs were just standing there not doing much... No one here seem very eager or enthusiastic at all, including the owner; it feels like they just dont care....  I wouldnt come back and i suggest you don't either coz \"Friends don't let friends eat at Donburi\"!"}
{"text":"Went around 11:30 on a Saturday afternoon and the place got packed really quickly. The service was really good in the beginning, the food was not extremely pricey and there were incentives to go back such as freebies! The only downside is they seem to be low on staff at the end of the lunch. Overall, definitely will recommend friends and family to try it."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable lunch specials that come with salad and soup....service is great here, very attentive, the food was fantastic, got the beef which is like their restaurant specialty, half fatty half meaty that melts in ur mouth, surprisingly this place wasn't packed at all when we got there for lunch...will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Negative reviews oftentimes hold greater value than positive reviews.   I had this craving for curry katsu don and saw that this nearby place had decent reviews so we decided to check it out.   We ordered the curry katsu don, tempura don and a wasabi beef skewer. I found that:  - The amount of meat and number of their shrimp tempura was lacking, lots of tempura veggies though - The meat of the katsu was so thin, that if there was a thing as meat-breading ratio, it must be off; it doesn't matter how moist your meat is if there is so little of it  - The skewer was average, it might have been hyped up too much  Other Yelp reviews repeatedly mentioned great service but I didn't find it true. It's a minor detail but I believe the effort in having the customer's cups filled a majority of the time is basic customer care. Heck many restaurants come by to ask you how you're doing. At a time when the restaurant had 4 tables and 2 waitstaff my cup was filled only when the order was taken. Even nearing the end of the meal after I ask for tea the server forgets it until I ask a second time. The entire thing just screams of amateur to me.   Either way my curry katsu craving had been curbed but I will definitely satisfy it elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! I decided to try Donburi for the first time and ordered delivery. Service was great, food was pretty good. Not sure if the lotus chips went soft because it sat in the container for some time (it was at least a 10 minute drive to get to my place) but it was very flavourful.   I ordered the Curry Katsu rice and the Don Katsu. Seaweed salad, and Lotus chips. All were pretty good for the price. I wasn't over the moon, but I'd  definitely order again if I get another Katsu craving!"}
{"text":"The food may be good but not worth it's dinner prices. Go during lunch for a good deal, it's a much better price for the same amount and quality of food.   Service is really poor, I understand that it's tough to maintain tables when the restaurant is busy but they are really disorganized. I would ask for water and the waitress would point out the waitress I must ask in order to get that service. Honestly, go during non busy lunch hours to get your fixins but don't bother for dinner and busy times, not worth it !"}
{"text":"Seriously?! They're opened til 4am in markham??! Why haven't I discovered this place sooner? Their food definitely hits the spot at this hour. Prices not too shabby either. Definitely a good find in this area! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"3.5 Do you like places like Guu but have a young one like I do?  Donburi might be the place for you.  More after the jump.  Pros: Good for families Lot's of \"Japas\" Friendly service Old school anime on the TV's!!  Cons: Portions could be better Nothing totally amazing  Donburi in my opinion is basically a family friendly version of Guu.  Same kind of food but in a more relaxed setting.  You can easily bring a baby during the day without any trouble.      Donburi has a lot of rice bowls to choose from.  It's their specialty I suppose.  There are some udon bowls but rice bowls are the mains here.  Beyond that, they have a ton of Japas which are basically Japanese Tapas, clever eh?  They have a wide range to choose from.    We ordered the Oyakodon and the Katsudon.  Each rice bowl comes with miso soup and salad.  The Japas we ordered were the Takoyaki and Agedashi Tofu.  The food came out quickly which is always nice.  Here's the thing for me, I wasn't overwhelmed or disappointed.  It was basically OK for me.  It's not an overall bad thing but it will be hard to justify coming back again, that's all.  The service was very good though.  The staff were nice and friendly.  We needed an extra bowl for the baby.  When I asked, the waitress knew it was for the baby herself.  She looked around for bowls and ended up going to the back to find a baby friendly bowl.  She even washed it herself which was super nice of her. Extra point for that.  Also. they have two flat screen TV's on the wall.  One is playing what I presume to be K or J dramas.  I don't watch either so I don't know.  The other plays anime which I don know.  It was playing Gundam Wing episodes while I was there which is super cool.    So yeah, If you're craving Japanese this is a nice place to go to.  I'm still on the fence about going back myself.  It will be a good experience though, so give it a whirl if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty decent but their service is god awful. My friend and I waited almost 15mins before anyone acknowledged us at the door. And we were the only ones there waiting. The min another group walked in they were asked how many people and how they were doing. We finally get seated and not a single soul looks our way to take our order. The best part is they don't even write anything down you mark on a piece of paper what you want so it's not even like they have a hard job as servers. As a person who worked in the food service industry this would never have flied with my managers. The group that was instantly greeted was also seated moments after us and given water and menus. We had to keep our hand up for a good 10mins before someone noticed we were ready to order. If they didn't have good food I would never come back. So just a fair warning good is good but terrible service. Negative stars on service."}
{"text":"I liked this place and came back twice in a week.  The short rib rice bowl was great and really hit the spot.  I forgot that they would give us salad and miso soup for the dinner order - and I ordered a side of seaweed salad.   The seaweed salad was not expensive but did not taste good.  The 125m hot sake was okay.   I also tried the shrimp tempura (4 of them in an order) and they were on the greasy side.   This place is of good value but not for you if you are looking for real gourmet and \"snobbish\"  Japanese food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time there's something wrong with the food. Most of the time I have issues with the miso soup. It's a personal thing and for me soup has to be either hot or cold, anything in between is just nasty. Unfortunately Donburi has served me soup each and every time it's lukewarm. I guess its not such a big deal since I can skip the soup. Salad was pretty standard, can't screw that up. I've tried the chicken donburi, curry and tempura on separate occasions and nothing tasted bad but its also not that memorable. Tempura just wasn't freshly fried, it was refried so its hard and kind of chewy. Their food is basically food that's served at a food court for a similar price range or cheaper that includes a drink. That being said, I forget about this place most of the time and just head to FMP's food court. I've never had any issues with the servers here but its not like I ask a lot or have allergies."}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 I enjoyed the food here a lot when I used to come more often, but with so much competition popping up, I just forgot about this place. Rice bowl portions aren't that big, but will generally be filling if you eat every last grain...topping to rice ratio is not great. The unagi smell and taste better than most places, was fluffier but was much smaller.  Skewers are okay, not much to write home about. The experience of this place is overall pleasant, prices are reasonable for the cuisine with lots of options. Inside of the store is decorated to be fun and inviting. Service isn't super attentive, but those anime shows you grew up definitely extends your patience."}
{"text":"The food here is good and somewhat different from what is offered around the area..but business in the Richmond Hill/Markham area can be tough as there are so many different restaurants and cafes around!  I usually get the rice with mayo, unagai, imitation crab..superb..all entrees are served with miso soup and salad.  The only downside is that the service here is very slow..the staff seem to be all over the place when it gets a little busy (i.e. ~30% of capacity). I have never seen this place busy, but it could be due to the service and pricing.. a typical dinner rice dish is around $8-12."}
{"text":"I came here as a group of 4, the food there was decent, I ordered unagi don, and it was good dinner portion, flavorful; however we were not fond of their service.  As we finished ordering our food, it wasn't busy around that hour, there was only about another table there aside from us. we asked the waiter some pricing questions regarding their beer choices; just as we lifted up our heads about a minute later, half way through our decision, the waiter turned around and left to stand by the cash. We tried to wave him down several times to order but he seemed rather impatient and did not want to communicate. The other waitress there was very friendly, came over and offered us to check in on Yelp to get free icecream, we all showed her our check in's and she kindly accepted it. However, when the waiter came back to our table, he did not believe that one of my friend had the coupon, we tried to explain we showed the other staff already, if he could just go communicate to the other staff about it. But he insisted that my friend did not check in, and refused to clarify with the other staff member.  All these miscommunication between the staff/customers have made our group experience not as good. We just wanted a place to eat food and chat."}
{"text":"It's rare to find a restaurant in the city that specializes in donburi and as a huge Japanese foodie myself - I was very ecstatic to try this place out. First off, it has a very casual ambiance and very friendly staff. I got the pork katsu curry rice which was made to perfection. My friend got the gyuu don and she really liked it too. We also shared deserts. We got the chocolate cake which was absolutely delish! And don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free scoop of green tea ice cream! You also get something if you like them on Facebook. They also take pictures with you after you leave so you can be put on the wall. Overall, I had a great dining experience and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a late night bite.  I have had their omurice (Japanese omelette wrapped rice) three times as well as their unagi-don.  I have had homemade omurice from a close friend before and had been craving this comfort breakfast food. The version at this restaurant was made with a thin egg omelette,  with a good portion of chicken fried rice.  It came served with ketchup and Japanese mayo and a side of coleslaw.  This coleslaw is amazing and a perfect accompaniment! I guess you can tell I liked it from my tone of writing and also having ordered it three times!  The portion is a bit small for a guy with a bigger appetite.  Lucky for those men and women,  there are plenty of small side dishes you can order. The unagi son was similarly well prepared.  A good portion of unagi was present,  though there was an even larger portion of short grain rice. I feel the prices for some menu items are a bit inflated, but the atmosphere makes up for it.  I would definitely return for a few more visits.  A word to the wise: the polar beer really isn't great beer,  but it sure is interesting...  However,  think Tim Horton!s ice cap made with milk in this situation - IE the beer will be drunk quickly,  leaving you with a pile of ice."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere here, it feels like a place that ought to be around the corner from a university campus. Especially with the interesting beverage menu: I tried a vodka calpis on my first visit and went to the Asian supermarket on my way home to pick up a large bottle of calpis... \"Japas\" idea is great, reasonably priced appetizers/snacks to go with a meal. I really liked the lotus root chips. Can't really go wrong with any of the mains; I've tried a few and have never gone wrong. One thing I wasn't thrilled with was the skewer we tried: we had the wasabi beef, the beef was overcooked and wasn't a great cut."}
{"text":"Donburi is a busy Japanese sit-down restaurant serving gyuudon (beef bowl) which is much more exciting than it sounds. There are a whole variety of dishes here, but I would wholeheartedly recommend the gyuudon (eg. the one with the biggest picture!) as that's their specialty and very hard to find it done well.  In the gyuudon, the beef was very light and flavourful, tender and the rice was soft. Mixing the onsen egg into the beef and rice bound everything together. The chicken karaage was also good - the batter was light containing pieces of juicy chicken. Salad was very standard. I got to try a couple bites off of other dishes - the curry sauce was good. Unagi was soft and had no bones. I wish the unagi had more Unagi sauce, especially for the rice.  Service was very good and friendly - they were very busy though. Orders are done by completing and handing in an order sheet, which I guess sort of mimics the vending machine ordering ways of Japan? The menu is pretty extensive and has lots of pictures so it's quite hard to decide what to order. For some reason, they had decided to not play the Leafs game that was on the night I was there, instead playing a game between two other random NHL teams.  They do take credit cards and they also have Vicinity rewards rewarding you with a free meal every 10 points."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese spot in York Region. The chicken karaage is great, and the skewers are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Overall service was good,  the servers frequently check up on us to make sure everything was okay. I didn't really enjoy my time at Donburi. It's not a place I would rush back to, and even if I was in the area, I don't think I would visit it either. I have tried their Donburi before and it was quite decent (hence the name of the restaurant). The price is quite reasonable, and with all the family Chinese restaurants around the area, this place is a good addition to the food scene uptown :).  What I ordered:  -Black Cod:  It was so tender and melted in my mouth. The skin on top of the fish was crispy and there was no layer of slimy fat either.  -Ikayaki:  a grilled squid topped with sweet soy sauce. I definitely recommend this dish. The squid was cooked perfectly - very tender, not too chewy and rubbery at all. The sauce on it is amazing and complimented the dish really well.  -Takoyaki: tender and fluffy. Unfortunately there were only bits of octopus, but good thing they weren't rubbery. Although my friend liked this dish, it wasn't something that blew me away, but it was still better than many others I've had. Albeit it was only $5 for 6 balls, I can't ask for much.  -Okonomiyaki fries:  nothing special. Okonomiyaki fries is basically fries topped with seaweed, mayonnaise, and a soy sauce based sauce on top. The ratio of fries to sauce was a bit off, there isn't enough sauce for the fries at all.   -Chicken Karaage: The chicken pieces were nice and juicy, and the breading on it was light and not too salty at all. I wished they had the sauce on the side though, as I love to dip my Karaage and top it with a lot of that thick and rich Japanese mayo.  -Wasabi Onigiri: was okay, there was nothing inside and surprisingly it's not really spicy at all, I would say the spicy level was mild.  -Zaru Soba: was okay, not good and not bad either. It is very refreshing and the flavour is subtle. To be honest this soba dish is actually really easy to make, so I don't recommend ordering it when you are at a japanese restaurant, unless they put a twist on it.  -Skewers: I got cuttle fish and grilled prawn, were not overcooked and they were all well seasoned. The beef skewers were a bit dry and not much flavour, at least the sauce saved it..."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favourite place for Donburi in Markham.  Gyuu Don never disappoints: slice beef and onion in a dashi , mirrin and soy based sauced topped off with an osen egg (+$2.00). The osen egg is a must as it adds flavour to the rice! It's about as good as it gets.   All orders of donburi are served with miso soup and salad.  The plaza gets pretty busy during dinner time, don't forget there is underground parking!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times last year and this year. I have brought my family, co-workers and out of town guests here. My favorites are the supersize katsu -- could request 2 different sauces (half/half), katsu with curry and okonomiyaki.   Their lunch menu is about $1 cheaper than the dinner menu and it comes with drink ( milk tea or green tea, .75 extra if cold) and miso soup. They forgot to ask what drink I want. Good thing I remembered it after finishing my food and ordered it.  Last time I was here, I remember getting a salad, this time I didn't get any.   Difficult to get waiter's attention at times but server came in a few times to clear out soup bowls and plates which is good.   Today, I was disappointed that when I was paying by credit card, the waiter punched in his 12% tip and passed the keypad to me to put in my pin. I thought I would punch in pin then I would be given choice to choose how much tip. the receipt started printing after putting in my pin. Not that 12% is too much but It left me felt tricked.   There is 15% automatic tip for groups of 5. I came in with 2 kids, we were 3 in total. So the tip should not have been an automatic charge.   My tip is to check what comes with your order and follow up on it if you don't get it. Also, check the credit card machine amount before paying."}
{"text":"The food was very average. I ordered the unagi donburi. Nothing stood out. It is not by any means a traditional japanese restaurant. In this area there are many more options to choose from and have a better meal for your buck."}
{"text":"I come here often but today my boyfriend decided to try the super size chicken Katsu and half of it was way too undercooked (it was slimy). In addition, they charged us for it though we did not get through half of it, very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great decor, nice atmosphere but expensive pricing for mediocre food! Waitress was nice and attentive, situated in a great area."}
{"text":"For a good donburi, this place is not. It is pretty mediocre.  The mix of a good raw egg and cooked beef is not present. Maybe it is the food regulations in canada or something, but the mix of an onsen egg is just different. If you want the traditional donburi, going to japan or making it at home is a better option."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just need a quick dish like this, simple and tasty. I ordered Katsudon (fried pork cutlet with egg and rice), comes with the miso soup as well. Very nice  and friendly staff and not too crowded, will visit again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for any night owl who craves some yummy donburi! They provide a healthy option to have no rice on their Donburi (\"no rice Gyuu Don\") which fits my diet perfectly.   Their super size katsu is huge and filled with flavour. There are 5 options for their flavors including original, nagoya, wasabi, spicy mayo and okonomiyaki. Nonetheless, the katsu is very crispy.  Would definitely come back again next time!"}
{"text":"Donburi, the place that me and my girlfriend go to at 1:30am. Yup, this is that kind of place and you'll see why.  To start off, the ambience of the place is casual with a bunch of drawings. It looks like your typical restaurant with booth seats and high chairs with a few normal chairs. This is somewhere you can come and have a late, and I mean really late, night snack.    Much like this review, the food at Donburi is one that has great attention to detail. The don that I normally go for would either be the Oyako Don or the Ten Don. From the rice to the protein, everything compliments each other and has you wondering if you're still hungry or just wanting seconds.  Edit: Changed pricing."}
{"text":"Nice little place for Japanese cuisine and anime. They open till very late so it is good for me. Service was good, they even told me the name of the anime on the screen since I asked. They know what they are doing. The food tasted ok, not bad, but not something I expected. I have to give three stars since I was disappointed with one dish, oyakodon. I can make better one in 15 mins from scratch. The dish I had was not much in term of flavour. Others were a bit better like omurice, donburi beef with rice, etc. If you are a bit tired, lazy, whatever and want some simple Japanese comfort food, then it is ok, though I have to warn you, the price is expensive."}
{"text":"Overall rating: 3/5  After going on a trip to Tokyo and Osaka, I've been searching for a place in Toronto that could serve Japanese curry at the same level. Honestly speaking, this place does not make the cut, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.  I got several skewers (Scalop, bacon warped asparagus and porkbelly) as my appetizers, With the scalop I thought it was well seasoned, a little heavy on the salt like the other apps which I ordered but it may have been just me being a little overzealous with the wasabi salt as dip. The bacon wrapped asparagus was my favorite, you can never go wrong with bacon anything. The porkbelly was a little disappointing, my friend and I were expecting something with a lot more juice, rather it was dry and quite salty for my liking.  For my main, I obviously was looking for good Japanese curry so I ordered the curry chicken katsu in a rice bowl. I must admit i was surprised to see it served in a bowl and two, the portion size is very generous and I was not able to finish the entire bowl, the rice to curry ratio didn't allow me to finish all the rice with the limited amount of curry. To start, the curry was very on point, I felt like they did an excellent job with the curry sauce however I would have liked to see more curry in the bowl. The cutlet itself was a disappointment, it didn't have an authentic taste which I was hoping this place could have provided given the other reviews and the name of the establishment but I was a little disappointed with the low quality chicken batter used. The cutlet's texture was very dry and the chicken wasn't enjoyable unless soaked with the curry sauce.  Overall, it was alright nothing amazing, don't think i'll be making a second trip.."}
{"text":"I had the classic Don Buri dish called Gyuu Don, which comes with sliced beef and onion with the soy based sauce, it was only $9.50 and you can get additional toppings for $1 like an egg or extra beef for $2. The bowls look small, but they're pretty filling!   I've had this dish before a couple times, but nothing is as good as this place. The beef is really soft and basically melts in your mouth. The sauces is also super awesome and the rice was made perfectly. A simple dish, but every part of it was good quality, tasty and hot.  We had the chicken Karage and Takoyaki as appetizers, they were average in my opinion. The Chicken Karage felt too dry and tough and the Takoyaki was too soft and not solid enough. But the main Don dishes were perfect so outweigh the mediocre appetizers.  I've been twice here already and will definitely come back in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, we ordered a Katsu and a short rib bowl.    Short Rib Bowl - Taste was okay but portions was small, rice was a-plenty.  Pleasant surprise to see that we got some veggies in this dish.  Katsu - Super dry, and I'm not talking about clothing.  Stay away unless you like eating cardboard.  Checked in and got ice cream!  Pretty good ice cream, highlight of the meal!"}
{"text":"Donburi is one of my favourite restaurant in Commerce Gate to grab a quick bite. Their Japanese Rice Bowls are absolutely comforting and satisfying, and service is always friendly and courteous. The atmosphere at this restaurant is causal, spacious, and welcoming.   Gyudon beef bowl is probably the most famous type of donburi, and it is my all time favourite go-to dish at Donburi. Gyudon features thin slices of beef simmered with onions in a mildly sweet broth, and served over a bed of Japanese rice. I can seriously eat this all day lol. Other items I enjoy are Kalbi udon, Pork cutlet on rice, and Onigiri rice balls :) Yes, you can tell how much I love rice lol.  The owners are very innovative, and often times they will come up with new creations for the customers. Items are usually available for a limited time only... so catch them whenever you can ^^ I recall the Soft Shell Crab Tacos, Cake Omakase, Polar Beer, and Matcha Beer. But the most memorable one would probably be the Unicorn Rainbow Omurice - definitely points for creativity!  I also enjoy watching the Anime playing in the background; I tend to stay longer than I should because I am so into the show! I often prefer to sit at the booth because there is an outlet next to the wall (my phone always dies!). Surprisingly, the outlet is not under but at table level (+1 for that!).  Overall, a very homey place to dine in. Check them out when you are in the area :)"}
{"text":"Donburi is located in commerce gate, sat here at 730 with 2 tables in the restaurant. The entrees or rice bowls came before the skewers which is odd. Asked what beer the polar beer was i think they had to call someone to ask which took awhile to get a response.  Price point is decent but the food is ok. Nothing spectacular. Pork katsu with curry was not too good, pork was over fried. Skewers for beef and pork were good. Chicken was nothing great. Service was nothing great.  Definitely no plans on going back. That would be a one time thing."}
{"text":"Quick casual eat with my son after his sports practice late Sunday afternoon. Reminiscent of the Japanese roast skewer places my wife and I went to in Taiwan. Reasonable prices, decent food, casual atmosphere, big screen TV showing a World Cup game. I can see this joint as a place for a younger crowd to congregate in.  We ended up with a few skewers and some apps. Not spectacular enough to wow us, but to be fair, at this price point, at this price point, I would bring my wife the next time we want something casual, with a beer."}
{"text":"I tried the curry pork katsu and its very delicious nd filling..didnt try the black sesame ice cream but i will on the next visit. I love the curry though thats for sure..."}
{"text":"They put fish flakes on chicken dishes without asking you first.  It totally ruined the dishes.  Yuk!  Even the dishes without the fish flakes, were just alright.  The staff hardly spoke English and they didn't know the menu.  The were not Japanese either!  The decor is DISGUSTING!  They have big white food pails as you come in the door with \"not garbage for umbrellas\" written in magic marker (and they did contain garbage). They also have a huge household style floor freezer in the restaurant and they go into it from time to time while you are trying to enjoy a meal.  OMG - no common sense!  I WILL NEVER EVER GO THERE AGAIN.  RIDICULOUS."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now. First time I went in based on a co-workers recommendation. Having been to a few different establishments in the complex, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor /atmosphere /staff. The effort put in shows. I don't remember what I ordered for my main the first time, the second time I ordered the vegetarian with egg option. The staff was very helpful with the tips on how the meal is normally eaten. I actually wrote this review and had it saved in draft, i've gone two more times since and will keep coming back. Service is great, food is good, atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I must say this is my first 5 star given and i don't hand them out lightly!  PRICE: Donburi has a pretty cheap menu selection, like $2 skewers. I had gotten the chicken katsu curry which was about $9 at the time and it came with rice, salad, miso soup, and of course the chicken. The bowl was extremely tasty! Some nights they offer a super sized katsu for $1 more and $3 for the sides. Dont be worried if you think its not going to fill you up!  I also ordered the chicken thigh skewers w/ teriyaki  sauce and it was so moist and delicious! Must try! I also got the beef wasabi which was also really good.  Customer Service: They service was great and friendly. Since it was me and my girl's first time here and we were sharing food they gave us another salad and miso soup with out meal. :) It was also during the super bowl time and they had a game to win food prizes which was also awesome. Long story short; food quality, price, and service i rate a 5/5  Will be returning a lot!"}
{"text":"Kind of a hard place to park in as this plaza is very popular in the Richmond hill area. First time here with my sister and her best friend.  Got the tuna tataki rice. It was absolutely delicious! Wasabi mayo wasn't strong so it didn't take out all the flavor of the tuna and the spices that were put in there.  For appetizers I got the takoyaki (with lots of squid inside- very rare to find in other restaurants) and the beef tongue skewer. Both were delicious.  Next time I'd like to try the udon next time and the agedashi tofu !  Definitely recommended !"}
{"text":"We narrow down our dinner choices last night between Kinton Ramen or Asian Legend.  Both located at Commerce Gate plaza so we figured that we can decide when we get there.  I couldn't believe all the Asian food places in this plaza.  This is definitely a plaza for foodies!  As soon as we saw this place, we decided immediately that this is it.  I didn't even know that this place existed.  Finding the best Gyudon (Japanese beef bowl) is definitely on my \"To-Do List\".  The Gyudon for $12.50 is a little pricey but it was really good.  Totally worth it!  It would have been nice if they added complementary pickled red ginger instead of charging a $1.  We also ordered the grilled squid which was nicely spiced and the seaweed salad was refreshing topped with fish eggs and a light mayo dressing.   I was a little disappointed with Katsudon (deep fried pork cutlet), salty and over cooked.  We'll be back as there are still more dishes to try.  Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get your complementary green tea ice cream!"}
{"text":"I love going here since it's always open late and in the area. The staff are always friendly and efficient at what they do. I usually only ever go for the Umami Don or Terriyaki Tofu Don and they are AMAZING!!! There's also a bunch of side dish options for those who don't want to eat to heavy which includes: terriyaki squid, numerous flavours of onigiri, skewers, and even agedashi tofu!   You can also use your Vicinity points card here as well, which is another plus. 1 point per don, with every 10 points earning you a free one!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there with the family. The quality of the food is good but the portions of of meat on the two Gyuu Don was poor. It was mostly rice in the bowl, there needs to be better consistency."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times and every time it's been pretty consistent. Service is efficient and staff are friendly. The restaurant is very spacious and you wouldn't have to wait forever for a table since they're rarely fully packed. Come weekends though they are busier, especially at night.  As soon as you step in, you will be greeted by a group of friendly staff. The place is brightly lit, clean, and spacious. There is plenty of seat available but not to the point that you hit everything moving around. Menus are user friendly and not sticky where a lot of places tend to get after opening for a period of time. They have a somewhat open concept kitchen that you can see the cooks working in there; the place though doesnt get too warm because of the open kitchen (ie. Kinton). The air flow is pretty good in there and of course important for a restaurant.   Food'wise are pretty much the basic Japanese dishes you can find in the area - grilled dishes, udon, rice bowls, those kinda things. Flavours are pretty nice; not too salty or bland. They also have dessert menu but not too many choices since the focus is on their savoury items.   Their hours are pretty flexible too; if you're in the area and want a late night bite, Donburi closes pretty late. Some of the stuff are a bit overpriced, but otherwise you get what you pay for. Portion sizes are pretty decent too so you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I came here based on the positive reviews, and was pretty disappointed. The menu has a rather wide variety of items to choose from. The food was OK, but not stellar. We got the takoyaki, katsu (pork cutlet) udon, and a beef and scallop skewer. The takoyaki was pretty good. The udon was OK, but the pork was very rough and dry with not much flavour. The scallop skewer wasn't bad, but the beef one was once again rough and dry.  Now to the service, which was abysmal. I'm not sure if it's because we came rather late (around 11 pm), but there was only one waitress and she didn't seem to care about customer service. Our udon was ready on the counter for 20 minutes before she decided to stop her cleaning and get it for us, by which time it was cold. She also rarely responded when we called to her, except when it came to paying the bill... She kept hovering around our table, which is highly unprofessional and annoying especially considering the aforementioned bad service.  Overall: meh food, terrible service"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday with my friend. Not super busy so we got seated immediately.  Yum! I had the katsu donburi. It came with miso soup and salad. Plus the check in offer for free green tea icecream. The icecream was really frozen though and small but oh well it was free lol.   Service was okay. We had an elder waitress serving us and there was bit of a language barrier but she seems polite lol.    They have cute fanart on the wall, making a very homey place.   If you're a vicinity member, they have deals for you!! My friend basically got a free meal.   Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese appetizers and donburi bowls. Sometimes their rice serving is overwhelming do if you're not great with consuming a lot of carbs I highly recommend the carb-less gyu don buri which substituted the rice for tofu."}
{"text":"Tried the Gyuu Don, did not live up to expectation. I was expecting something similar to the gyuu don in yoshinoya. The beef was okay, but the sauce was on the greasy side."}
{"text":"don-bu-ridiculous!   I frequently come here whenever I'm in Markham to grab a meal - good food & portions, usually not too long of a wait, and just a good vibe.   I can see some ratings less than 3 stars from some of their other items (ex. Curry) but you go to this place for their don bowls! Their gyuudon is delicious by itself or with any of the toppings offered. The serving size is generous to say the least and a side benefit is that it is still a great meal a day or two after because the sauce keeps the rice nice and moist.   The other items on the menu are hit or miss but I'd highly recommend trying some of the items. I like a good beef tataki and some good onigiri, both which are good choices. Another yummy option is the chicken karaage, which is good to share as an appetizer.   The service and staff are more than friendly - the owner came out and made sure that all was well with our meal! The anime playing in the restaurant is also some good minor entertainment.   All in all, I highly recommend this place! Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I stopped by lunch and ended up trying out their Oyako Don. O.M.G. It was the best Oyako Don I've ever tried in my life. If all of the other items on the menu taste as good as the Oyako Don, this place totally deserves 5 stars. Can't wait to go back to have another bowl of delicious rice with chicken, egg and onions. Not to mention, the service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go in the area, food is delicious, and price is decent. It is very clean and comfortable, the service is great, the server is very attentive, definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Came here a little after dinner time so it was empty. We were greeted by a waitress who didn't bother getting up from her chair. (Meh, no biggie. Maybe she's the owner?) We were evetually seated by a different waitress in a booth seat.  Ordered Beef Gyu Don and bbq chicken Don. I didnt find anything special about their dishes and the taste was mediocre. (Beef Gyu Don was good but again, it's just a simple meat over rice so nothing special)  The service was ok. After the food was served, we were forgotten. Oh wait, the waitress came by once for water. Then waited awhile to get the waitress' attention to get our bill.  The ice cream was delicious.   For a mediocre place like this, I'd rather eat somewhere else or even at a food court and will most likely not come back."}
{"text":"I quite like the omurice groom donburi. It's simple and has flavour. It's been a while since a had decent omurice, so I came by twice in the past 2 weeks. Ajao thanks to yelp check in for the free green tea ice cream. I also tried the mentai chicken which was pretty good as well. Interested in trying their other menu items."}
{"text":"My boss always went to this place so i decided to give it a try. Yet, never again.  1. Service - rude, slow and indifferent Staff always pretend that they did not see you waving your hands. Never smile and refill tea (not peak hours, almost empty)  2. Slow!!! we ordered 3 items only, and it took 45 minutes for all of them to be delivered. The staff were busy on the take out... even if I asked many times, the staff just asked us to wait and wait..  Try other places.... this restaurant does not worth going and spending money."}
{"text":"Donburi is a decent place for lunch or dinner. I've tried their Unagi Don, the BBQ Chicken Don, the Beef Short Rib Don and the Katsu Don. They're good and the flavours are all there. Though sometimes the flavours are a bit one-dimensional and not exactly the most eye-popping experiences. They're about what you'd expect from what you see. The menus haven't changed for a while so I wish they mix it up a bit more; they have frequent drinks specials that aren't shown on the menu though the food options are more limited. The prices for their Japas items are also just high enough to deter me from placing an order. From the pictures, it doesn't seem like you get that much. Service at times is not the best as I've been there a few times and sometimes they bring you water right away and other times it takes much longer (even though it's not packed)."}
{"text":"Came here because I have been craving Omurice since my last visit to Japan. We get seated quickly and we order. Our mains were Omurice, Beef bowl and chicken Katsu with curry. We also ordered a few Yakitoris - chicken thigh & leek w/ teriyaki was the favourite, everything else was average. Our mains get here, and they forgot our beef bowl,  after 30 minutes we had to order it again. My egg on my Omurice was a tad over cooked and the rice inside was alright, although the texture of the rice was kinda mushy, 5/10. My sister ordered the Katsu, overall katsu and curry were good, but it came with way too much rice - at least for the amount of curry/katsu to rice ratio 7/10. The beef bowl just looked sad. The pieces of meat just looked like it lacked a bit of everything, it needed some major tlc :( and once again too much rice.   Service is where they lose some stars, I came here again the next day, because my boyfriend and I couldn't decide where to go - and he has never been. We waited 30-40 minutes just to get our Gyoza and fried chicken. Gyoza was typical and the fried chicken was definitely not the best. It looked and tasted like dehydrated chicken, as if someone sucked out every little bit of water/juice/oil/life out of the chicken. Our mains were BBQ chicken bowl and the Katsu bowl. Long story short, get the Katsu nothing else. Anyways back to the service, the table of two beside us had to watch each other eat because one bowl came out before the other, the guy was already done when hers came - she asked twice about her order. It started to get little busy,  assuming that's why everything was slow, but oddly, there were 4 people in the kitchen and this place isnt that big. A table of 4 came in and they sat them at a table of 6. Then a couple came in - all tables of 2 were full, so they told the couple to share the 6 person table with the group of 4, while parallel to them were 2 empty tables of 4. I get that sharing a table is a typical Asian thing,  esp in really crowded/busy places but they could have splitted the table of 4 and made a 2 person table. Boggled my mind a bit.   Overall, Katsu was good both times and service was meh."}
{"text":"After reading Darren S. review of Donburi, I just have to try it.  As I am more of an audio video journalist, I don't know what to write and won't even try to be nearly as eloquent as other writers.  Regardless, every trip to Donburi I always ordered the Takoyaki.  Also their Japanese curry sauce is the best I've ever tasted outside Japan (and i've tried various kinds of Japanese curry sauce in Canada, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, USA, Dubai and Kuwait)"}
{"text":"3.5 star  Donburi brings back a lot of memories... I ate their rice bowls growing up in Hong Kong and ended up having one during my last visit to Tokyo. ..  Beef Rice Bowl Lunch Set ($9.99) serves with soup/salad and coffee/tea. One can upgrade for Japanese pop or coffee for $1.50.  The sauce was just like how I remember it suppose to taste...sliced beef had a good mix of lean and fat. Rice portion was generous.  They also has different items: Katsudon, Soba and more.  And if you want Japanese breakfast, they are open at 8 am serving breakfast sets at $4.99 and up with tea/coffee.  I want Japanese Onigiri (sushi rice balls) as breakfast!!!  Service is a little green, but they just opened yesterday! The staff is still in training..."}
{"text":"The beef gyu don really tasted like Yoshinoya in Japan. The rice had the Japanese taste to it as well. Very friendly staff and awesome service!"}
{"text":"The chicken and egg rice was very dry and I had to put a lot of Japanese spice ??? and soy sauce to make it tasting better."}
{"text":"I am actually quite glad that Danburi is open in Richmond hill. The food taste delicious and filling for the price you pay for. You can also order some side dishes to complete your meal like quail eggs wrapped with bacon skewers, etc. Not to forget, you can get some polar beer here too!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a cheap lunch. You can get a lunch combo with their donburis with miso soup and a drink for less than $10. Considering this place is in an extremely high traffic area, and their decor is pretty nice and clean, I'd consider that pretty good. You can also get free green tea ice cream if you check in on Yelp!  My favourite donburis are the curry katsudon and tempura don. You can't really go wrong with any of them though. They have some cheap appetizers and skewers on the side if you want a little snack too.   It's not really a place I'd go for dinner but the bright colours and cute atmosphere make it a great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I decided to go here with a friend of mine and try it out since we saw some appetizing pictures from a friend. The service was decent and the atmosphere was pleasant.  We order, we got the omurice, pork cutlet curry and rice, a skewer and a side of fried chicken. It's not that the food was bad or anything, it's just that we've definitely had better elsewhere. The cost of everything was decently priced so no complaints on that.  I probably will not be coming back here as it doesn't suit my taste."}
{"text":"3.5/5  From an objective perspective, Donburi is really great. The menu is diverse but not too big to keep you sitting there for a long time, the interior design is extremely clean and welcoming, and the food came in a fair amount of time and tasted good.  The Udon is MSG free and the soup bases (although they look the same) have different tastes, which highlights the restaurant's good flavour profile.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of dishes that consist of rice and meat, but that's exactly what makes up most of their dishes. However, if you ARE a fan, definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Didn't even notice this place until we got hungry and decided to go in and try it out.  The shop is cute and I love the drawings stuck on the wall to honour the restaurant.  I tried the matcha beer and it was surprisingly pretty good considering I'm not a beer fanatic.  Also has he rekon chips which were also delish.  Great place to come and eat for sure."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my go to places for dinner if I don't wanna cook. Tonight, we came here and had a disappointing dinner. All of our meats are overcooked: dried and over-fried katsu pork chop, dried pan-fry chicken. They used to make really good rice bowls (don)... Sorry Donburi, you will be out of my list for a while."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo garbage. The worker(she) has attitude hated her so much. Service was terrible and slow. Felt bad for a group of people that was there before us some of them didnt get their food. Price is not worth it at all, the portion is small and food took so long i forgot what i ordered. Dunno how alot of people say this place is good, you people must be from some third world conutry or something.  Overall I think i enjoyed my glass of water more then my food"}
{"text":"I ordered a Gyudon take out last night. After I ate it, I threw up and had a stomachache. The food is not fresh at all. They used the sauce to cover the taste of the beef from the refrigerator."}
{"text":"The environment is good and lively Service was excellent.  In my one hour stay they checked up on my a minimum of 6 times and water never empty.  The staff were extremely friendly.  Definitely 5 out of 5 for customer service.  Not your typical Asian place service.  We felt valued. Presentation of the food is excellent. However the taste for me was so so. I ordered the tuna tataki don at 11 dollars which tasted blah.  It was definitely missing a char taste from grill. Just ended up tasting like ponzu sauce in rice afterwards.  Presentation is excellent though.  I would come back and try another dish."}
{"text":"Donburi is a late night Japanese cuisine eatery located in the plaza with all the bubble tea places. What I really liked about this place was the interesting decor and young vibe it gave off when we walked in. It also closed late which is a blessing for a group of hungry souls.   Service was very good by the waiters. I believe the owner was there as well helping out and he was very attentive and provided great service.   We ordered skewers and takoyaki and for the main I got the BBQ chicken don. The takoyaki was pretty good. I would order again. The skewers were decent. They are cheap little things for side dishes but they have a few pieces each so you can share with your friends. I wouldn't order a lot though. The BBQ chicken don was good, but my only complaint was that the dish was lukewarm and wasn't hot. I'm not sure how that happened.   I give this place 4/5. I would love to see an extended menu of more tiny appetizers and that the food was hot when we receive it. Very excellent service though and would come again.   P.S Get the green tea ice cream for free on Yelp! It was actually so good."}
{"text":"Probably the best late night place to eat. I usually come here after working out at GoodLife. Haha. The food is great. My favourite is the gyudon!!  if it's your first time going there, try to order the different skewers. The prices are reasonable... You're probably gonna spend $10-$15 per person    Tip: check in on yelp. Free ice cream. The server gave us the sesame one instead of green tea. Amazing"}
{"text":"Overall average food and environment. The setting was  ok but wasn't too clean. The food sems average for what you get but that is around all the same in that plaza. The only surprising part was the deep fried oyster which comes with a wasabi sauce which makes it really stand out.  Remember to do a check in to get your free ice cream."}
{"text":"Ordered the katsu udon because I saw the waitresses there eating that. Worst decision ever, I should have just stuck to the gyuu don instead. The katsu was didn't have enough batter and it was overcooked. The pork itself was rough and dry, and the udon was bland. Disappointed because not only the food was mediocre but it took them more than 30 mins to make it."}
{"text":"Dropped by for dinner after wanting to come for a very long time. Ordered the unagi don and it was very delicious. I'm not one for rice dishes unless it's sushi so this was quick to impress. The unagi practically melted in your mouth and there was enough to accompany the rice.   I also got the scallop ($3 ea.) and beef with ponzu sauce ($2.45? ea.) skewers which were okay but not worth the money, in my opinion. Beef was tasteless.   Next I got the ikayaki which was a bit salty than flavourful. It's not bad but I probably wouldn't get it next time. Service was great, and despite the dinner hour, it was fairly empty on a Friday evening so I was well-looked after. And of course the complimentary Yelp ice cream you get for checking in finished my meal nicely.   Overall I'd come back but not for their other dishes, just their dons."}
{"text":"Good price and good food! Will definitely go again! Lunch combo is good,, comes with soup, salad and coffee or tea."}
{"text":"Went here twice in a row with rushed service.   I have to admit you get what you pay for in terms of food quality versus price. However the server we had was rushing through things and considering there was practically no one else in the restaurant it made the experience uncomfortable.  Maybe because the last two times we came in with just the Chinese looking crowd they gave us the older Chinese lady server that just made what would have been a five star yelp review down to three star."}
{"text":"My rating fluctuates between a 2 and a 3. I haven't been here in years, so this is based off my two recent visits within the last month. The first visit could have been better. We arrived around 10pm on a Wednesday night and I ordered the Beef Short Ribs Don for $12.75. My friend ordered the same. I like that they play anime in the background. It creates a homier/relaxed environment. I was watching OPM for half my stay. What set me off about this visit was that I barely had any sauce on my rice while my friend had too much sauce in hers. I ended up eating plain rice for a good third of my dish...that was bummy.   On my second visit, I went with the safer option that I always purchased years before: Donburi Gyuu Don for $10.50. This time, my dish was well seasoned. Issue? Our service was next to nonexistent. There were two or three servers at the time, and the restaurant wasn't full so I'm not sure what was happening. They looked busy serving other tables but hardly ever made it to ours despite us trying to flag them down. I think we only got their attention by putting our hands all the way up and waving fast. They did a great job splitting the bill though, so kudos.   If you want a semi-cheap filling dish, this is worth a try, but I'm not sure you'll want to come back."}
{"text":"I like this place. I come here often. Great food, great prices, and the owners are wonderful. Its a Japanese restaurant, hmm who knew there were other items in japan besides sushi and tempura?  You can get a donburi, which someone explained is actually a type of dish. Rice bowl with meat and a sauce. I'm explaining this wrong. There's udon, the soup with thick noodles and other things in it. Funny story. I can't eat it. I cant work chopsticks, soup, and broth all at once. It takes me forever to eat and tend to wear most of it. I've had it here before. Delicious.  They also have a tonne of appatizer type dishes. Skewers of meat and hearts. Yum. Edamome, seaweed salad, agedashi tofu. Yum, little fish, black cod, rice balls yum. Beef ribs yum  My pictures are all of the app stuff. I've never had anything I did not like.  Note: best congee I ever had was from here. On Saturdays and Sundays Irene puts on a pot of congee in the morning. If you are extra lucky you'll get to have a bowl!!!"}
{"text":"Their special super chicken katsu meal.. $10.99 +$3 for meal. When they say super they really mean huge! It was a huge chicken fillet... It covered the whole plate and the rice, salad and soup for extra $3 is so much food, definitely enough for two people. Their takoyaki was really good lots of sauce and toppings, there was a huge piece of octopus inside. Free wifi and free scoop of green tea ice cream if you check in on yelp was really nice. Overall , had a great meal!"}
