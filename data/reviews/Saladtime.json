{"text":"I use to work near this place and order a few salads from there, I've never ate the whole thing because they always serve me sub-par lettuce, once I had our other manager pick it up for me and when I got it I could see thru almost every leaf that they put in the salad. I have not been back since. Yuck."}
{"text":"I usually only write reviews based on food not service, but I've been here about 25 times and they have messed my order up on average every other visit. It should be set up like subway so you can point to the topping then it's added because the young kids that work here don't really pay attention. They have even messed up \"signature\" salads where the toppings are pre determined. They probably only get paid minimum wage though so who could blame them. They have however given me free food in response to the screw ups which is cool, but that many times cmon. I've returned so many times because of the healthiness of the food selection for a fast food joint. The Wraps and salads are good but factor in you might only get what you ordered half the time."}
{"text":"The prices are a bit on the high side or I would have to give it five stars. The salads really are better than you will find anywhere else. The topping selection is excellent, and for the most part the employees know what they're doing. However, the service isn't exactly great -- even when it's not busy, you'll often be expected to fill out a form to place your order. They could also stand to add a smaller size salad to the menu as the smallest they sell is still too big for many people.  The Greek dressing is amazing, and make sure to try the Acai Berry smoothie. It's surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week.  Great salads with fresh ingredients.  Staff is friendly and quick.  And unlike one of the other reviews, I have not had any issues with them messing up orders, and I frequently order 3-4 salads at a time for my office."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, delicious! Friendly staff.  The manager stopped by to see if everything was OK which is rare nowadays for even high end places.   More expensive then fast-food? Of course! Fresh, healthy food made to order is always going to be more money... And worth every penny! The sign said \"Soups made daily from scratch\". I'm going to try next time for sure."}
