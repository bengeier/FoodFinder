{"text":"Came her for dinner on a sunday evening. We got a patio seat in the back as the front patio area was full. It was much quieter without much foot traffic on the side street. 

The waiter was prompt and look our order. Soon after our order, three families were seated, and we could see that the poor waiter was having a hard time trying to keep up with everyone's requests. It was sad to see that some people can be really rude when they don't get attended to right away.

As for the food, the roasted beet salad, our starter, was quite nice. It had both red and golden beets (don't think it was roasted though). The feta, onion and arugula on top was a nice addition. It was perfect to share for two people.

Hubster had the spicy pollo pizza ($15), He felt the thin crust was overcooked. I would have to agree with him. The roasted peppers and goat cheese on top was nice with the spicy chicken. I really like the roasted wild mushroom salad ($18), the spinach was glaced with a balasamic dressing. They did not skimp out on the mushroom, which was my favorite part. There was a large piece of goat cheese on top of the salad, which added a nice tang.

Overall, the experience was pretty good. I was a bit surprised how busy it got on a sunday evening for dinner. I think it would have helped to have two waiters in the back patio area to attend to everyone. The food was good, but there was quite a repetition of feta and goat cheese in our dishes. I would have like some variety of soft ripe cheeses. Otherwise, a nice meal at a good price for the portions that you receive."}
{"text":"Went there twice with the family. Had a great experience at this place. The service was amazing. Food was amazing. Would go back here."}
{"text":"Had the fish special and it tasted like a sponge left in dishwater.  Also, Main Street is closed from Hwy 7 and nobody working these had a clue as to the best way to go around it.

The code they gave is for the WiFi did not work.

$100 without wine."}
{"text":"This is my third time having dinner here but the first time eating outside. I think for the price and the menu choices there should have been better choices for dining outdoors. The restaurant is elegant indoors but not outside, which is casual but the menu choices remain the same. I would like to have seen more casual offerings while eating outdoors. Overall the place remains on my list of places to revisit. The staff are always courteous and anxious to please. The food is always flavorful. The ambience in eating outdoors could use some improvement. Plastic furnishings were used for this upscale restaurant seemed out of place."}
{"text":"Horrible wait time for everything.  We made reservation for 8:00pm and got seated at 8:25pm.  We ordered drinks , drinks came quick but food wait time was for 2 hours to be served , waitress was nice and stressed from customers complained .  I did complained with management or owner she told us a bunch of excuses, that there is a festival going on, and she added there is no microwave and blah blah.  We requested for the bill but the managers insisted that the entrees will be serve promptly .  I'm so surprise they still open for business with such a poor management.  I wouldn't recommend this Resto ."}
{"text":"Had reservations for Saturday night with a group of friends...waited about 20 mins for our table.  Once we sat down, had to wait another 10 mins for our menus...finally, server came by to take our order.  I understand it's a busy day but the bread we ordered took 30 mins to arrive, it was good but nothing special...this was just the beginning of a long night.  When we asked about our food, the manager/server kept saying it was a busy night.  In summary, we waited 1.5 hours for our entrees to arrive.  The manager offered an apology but our experience was already ruined.  Food was ok but service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I was shocked when I came across Trish O's review from several months ago.  Now, be assured that I live in Unionville (for 25 years) and have been going to Blacksmiths since it opened 15 or more years ago (we can walk there). I have no connection of any kind with the current owner, and I feel I DO know something about food, despite Trish's assertion that anyone who likes this place knows nothing about food.   We go there for dinner at least once a month, more in patio season.  I find the owner is a pleasant person, always has a friendly greeting for us, and has even agreed to have the chef cook items that had been removed from the menu.  Recently we arrived at 5PM, and my wife really wanted a sandwich.  They accommodated her by letting her order it from the lunch menu, which of course was not in effect at that time.   The food always makes us happy....they make a great Spinach Salad with blue cheese, and most recently I had an excellent pasta with seafood.  Service is usually  fast and efficient and friendly... but not 100% of the time... and that is why I have rated 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I had the chance to stop by this place after seeing so many positive reviews, but I have to say that I was quite disappointed.  My friend and I stopped in during mid afternoon on a Sunday, and found the place to be completely empty, so we assumed the service would've been great since it would just be the two of us being served that afternoon.

I ordered a personal pizza while my friend opted for some pasta.  The food wasn't anything too impressive, and the service wasn't certainly any better.  During our meal, we had to call over our server 3-4 times to ask for additional napkins, refills, and even for dessert despite the fact that were basically being ignored the whole time we were there. Not once did the server bother to check on us when we were the only CUSTOMERS there.

Overall, the food was ho-hum, and the service was terrible. I would hate to think what the service would be like if there were more customers. I will not be stopping by again even with a gun to my head."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Italian restaurant and I think this is not the best I've tasted. This place is located on Main Street, unionvielle which is a very beautiful location, the inside of this restaurant is very nice  as well. Services are good and seats are comfy. The pastas are okay, they come in small portions but with an expensive price which I'm not very happy about."}
{"text":"Blacksmith's Bistro is a quaint restaurant located on historic Unionville Main Street.  The restaurant is split into two floors, with the second floor seating more guests.  The best table in the house is on the second floor.  It's the one right by the window overlooking Main Street.  This table is very popular, so you'll have to try to book it ahead of time!

The restaurant itself is pretty cozy, but not cramped.  Dimly lit, but not dark.  Good atmosphere to take a date, although they do have space for a larger group if that's what you need.  The d√©cor isn't modern by any means, but it's tidy and complementary.

Where the failings lie are in the food and service.  Our server was at times befuddled, other times plain lacking.  Orders needed to be repeated, despite it not being loud in the room.  He did not tell us what the soup/risotto of the day was.  Appetizer orders were put in random places on the table.  In one particularly humourous incident, he asked my friend if he would like some wine.  My friend answered \"yes\", only to have the server promptly turn on his heel and walk away, wine bottle in hand!

At some restaurants, service is like this.  I know.  But we're not talking Jack Astor's prices here.  Blacksmith's Bistro is not an inexpensive restaurant - in fact, more expensive than several highly respected restaurants downtown.  Higher prices should buy you higher quality service (amongst other things), and high quality service was lacking here.

Another thing higher prices should get you is a decently prepared meal.  Not always the case, true, and unfortunately, it wasn't the case on my visit.  The Caesar salad was decent - fresh lettuce, generous with the parmesan cheese, and the right amount of dressing.  The rigatoni with beef ragu was a disaster - some pasta felt just short of done (but other pieces felt okay!  I wonder if it was sitting under a heat lamp for too long).  The beef in the ragu were the driest pieces of meat I've eaten in a while, which is a tough thing to pull off in a ragu.  

Informally polling those sitting around me, the chicken fusilli was good for one friend, but the risotto was poor for another.  If you want something more resembling a pilaf, then get the risotto as it was devoid of the rich, creamy texture one would expect.  The rack of lamb came out cold.  Such a waste.  The steaks, however, were well prepared and enjoyed.

Overall, I can't recommend Blacksmith's Bistro.  At this price point, I expected more on every level, and you can definitely get better for less elsewhere.  True, maybe not right on Unionville Main Street, but locale is probably the best thing they've got going for them.  It's definitely not the value."}
{"text":"The food here is very good, the staff are friendly and were very accommodating of our son (9 months old at the time).  My only issue is the Heinz Ketchup, when you try to come across as a high end restaurant, you should be making your own Ketchup."}
{"text":"Please for your sake do not think about getting the calamari.. tasted like rubber. Waste of $14 and ruined my appetite. Your welcome"}
{"text":"Came here after a nice stroll in Unionville. A decently average restaurant, with patio seating available at the front and back of the place. Food is pretty average, ordered the Pollo Picante pizza, and bison short ribs; both of which were mediocre. The $5 bread basket (who charges for bread?) was good. Comes with two dips- hummus and wild mushroom. 

Service is a bit slow, but reasonable as there's only a few chefs cooking in the back. What's not reasonable is having to ask for both the food and drinks menus."}
{"text":"One time last summer on a beautiful sunny day I went with my neighbors kids biking over to Main St., Unionville to check to see if they had a favorite imported chocolate bar at a chocolate store---yes it was me and for adorable kids, ages ranging from 4 to 10. The little ones parked their tiny little banks near the gated fence at the blacksmith bistro and ran inside the chocolate store, they were inside total of only less than two minutes because they saw a mediately that they didn't have the chocolate they wanted,I stood back and watched the bikes to make sure they weren't stolen while my 10-year-olds watched the little ones inside the store and as the six-year-old girl was about to run inside the chocolate store the owner of the blacksmith bistro came outside, looked at the bikes nearby, and freaked out and took out all his frustration on this sweet little six-year-old blonde girl. He screamed at her for at least two minutes yelling at her that there was clearly a sign saying no bikes... By the way clearly there was no sign there whatsoever, he added that one week later. Therefore he was screaming at a six-year-old girl preemptively about a sign that doesn't exist yet. None of this makes sense in any social or financial way, clearly if we were biking there it means we live nearby enough that we could be customers at his shitty restaurant, and if you live in Unionville you're already financially liquid enough to afford his ridiculously over inflated prices. Instead of thinking about any of those things however he took out all his frustrations and screaming fit on a totally innocent six-year-old. By the time I got to her she had burst into tears completely understandably. I started yelling at that asshole owner, right in front of all his customers as his patio was completely crowded. Then of course, like a typical asshole sexist misogynist pig coward, he backed down and started saying yes yes of course yes thank you OK anyway have a good day-  trying to usher me away. So everybody couldn't hear.. So I kept yelling to make sure that all the customers knew exactly what was wrong... They were financially supporting a restaurant that is owned by a complete asshole misogynist pig who likes screaming at six-year-old girls he doesn't know for absolutely no reason. I so miss the days that Carol vasilovsky used to own this restaurant and Ran it well. And I know from all the staff I've talk to you they all miss her too. Can you imagine working for such a jerk? He deserves all the bad karma coming to him."}
{"text":"We also ordered the special that evening which was a rib eye steak, and it was TERRIBLE!! The flavors were ok, but WAY OVER COOKED. To top it off, we told the waitress that it was not Medium Rare as we ordered and more like a medium well to well. She brought it back to the kitchen. Minutes later the owner of the restaurant returns with our dish INSISTING that the steak was done perfectly. The waitress was so embarrassed she ignored us the rest of our visit there."}
{"text":"You can't spell Blacksmith's Bistro without the word \"consistently amazing!\" Ok well maybe you can but that's not to say that this place isn't just that - amazing!

I returned for another spell here yesterday evening with Crystal H as I showed off the coolest points around Unionville Main Street to my Vancouver friend/colleague. This was my first time dining inside in the magnificent upstairs dining area and I was impressed with how spacious and luxurious it was...Beautiful...simply beautiful.

I don't know what it is about their menu but after reading my first review of this place from the summer I realized that both times I've been here for a meal that I have had one type of fusilli pasta or another! Last night I had the fusilli with chicken, prosciutto, sundried tomatoes and I believe spinach all done in a white wine cream sauce! Amazing!

Being Italian I am somewhat picky when it comes to my pasta and my sauces and Blacksmith's Bistro is 2/2 in the \"Impress an Italian with your pasta\" category. I also learned that they also have free wifi  AND a different speciality Risotto every Lunch and Dinner, every day of the week!! As if I needed more of an excuse to come here. 

This cosy little bistro also makes a fantastic intimate date spot and for all you fella's out there looking to impress you gal, I'd say this Bistro is a no-brainer!

{"text":"Had a great lunch experience here on the weekend. Lot's of parking at the back of the restaurant. The restaurant is located in a charming old home. The first floor has limited seating, open kitchen and bar area. Lots more seating on the second floor.

Service was good but there were only three tables of people. The seating downstairs is a little crowded. Some may call it cozy, I call it crowded. You hear everything your neighbours are saying. Luckily the food is great so I can overlook the seating arrangement.

Appetizers were excellent. We had the beet salad - the best i ever had. Two kinds of beets and at least 20 large beets lining the bottom of the plate. Add the cheese, hazelnuts and pickled onions and I'm a happy guy. The PEI muscles were also fantastic and a huge portion. You can use the homemade bread to dip in the muscles wine sauce.

For the main course I had the Rigatoni. My large portion was perfectly cooked and included tender pieces of beef. An excellent dish. My fellow dinner had the grilled chicken sandwich which was also very good. The sandwich included yummy bacon, cheese and avocado served on home made bread. 

A great overall experience and I will be back for sure. Prices are above average but well worth it in my opinion.

{"text":"After reading so many positive Yelp reviews of Blacksmith's Bistro, we were a bit disappointed by our dinner on valentine's day.

First of all, since it was a busy night, I'm willing to let the rushed service and the epic wait for our meal slide. This is somewhat expected on a night like Valentine's. I do, however, take issue with how tightly the seating is crammed together. I assume that the tables are like this for the rest of the year, and it's uncomfortable. You hear way too much conversation from the neighbouring tables inches away. I also expected a better atmosphere; for such a nice heritage building, the interior is surprisingly unremarkable.

In terms of drinks, there's a decent wine list, beer list and selection of cocktails. Pretty standard stuff. 

The food is also where I think Blacksmith's falls short. There was a special valentine's menu, but we just ordered off the standard menu. The Charcuterie Platter was surprisingly bland, and only had one type of cheese. There was also a very limited choice of unremarkable meats. The portion sizes were generous, but for $18 this plate really fell short.

The $35 New York Striploin was also very unremarkable for the price. It was cooked medium rare as requested, but I just wasn't impressed with the cut. It just didn't have the flavour or tenderness you would expect at a higher-end restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the better establishments on Unionville Main Street in my opinion, and always has me coming back for more.

They have a really nice seating area inside, with an upstairs as well. With a nice patio that stretches from the front to the back, it can accommodate quite a large number of people.

The menu is quite extensive, covering lots of different kinds of foods, but their starters are all really good. Have come here many different times for different dishes, and they are always amazing. The chef will do some daily specials as well, which are definitely worth trying.

The service here is always quite good, with lots of servers that are friendly and attentive. They speak with customers very casually and are always really nice.

Definitely one of my favorites and worth a visit if you have never been."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be exceptional.  I came back here one year later and there seems to be something different.  For some reason the quality has dropped significantly.  There wasn't anything wrong with the food, there was just nothing that stood out.  My friend and I ordered the grilled calamari (best part of the meal) and my friend also had the soup of the day (minestrone).  My friend thought the soup was extremely bland.  For our main course I had the rainbow trout which was on special (okay but very small) and my friend had the margarita pizza with prochutto.  My friend felt that it was a 6/10.  Service was good but nothing special.  The manager did come over to see how everything was and we did not complain.  It was just so-so.  As an aside, we were seated by the kitchen and saw the cooks on their phones texting during meal preparation which I do think is a little unprofessional.

This used to be one of those places that I had to go to whenever I visited Markham.  Maybe it was an off night but it just seemed like the care that they used to take was not there."}
{"text":"A charming bistro in the heard of Unionville \"main\".  Downstairs has a casual vibe, lots of people opted to sit outside as it was a beautiful summer day.  Upstairs dining room is more formal looking with white linen, yet relaxed and comfortable enough for a family dinner.  

Our group had a good experience despite the long wait for food and everything (there was only one waiter and a bus person for the entire upstairs dining room).  

App. -- Korean short ribs taste like, well, Korean short ribs you can get in Korean restaurants, Chinese dim sum places, or \"Japanese\" AYCE, but with a beautifully arranged plating and presentation.  Spicy salmon tartar is delicately seasoned to compliment, not to kill, the fresh fish taste.  Steamed mussels are tasty, although the mussels are quite small and tend to get overcooked if left in the hot broth.  

Main -- Rack of lamb was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, accompanied by a creamy goat cheese plenty wedge.  We also ordered two medium-rare prime rib dishes, when they came out looking more like medium the waiter quickly and sincerely apologized, and had the dishes remade.  Smoked salmon pizza was well executed; liked the crispy thin crust.  The daily special fish dish wasn't all that memorable. 

Dessert -- luscious Belgian chocolate cheesecake, do save room to try it!

All in all, Blacksmith Bistro is a nice place to stop for a casual bite or a formal dinner."}
{"text":"This is kind of an update of this restaurant. We used to go here a lot and it has been one of our favourite restaurants in the general area. I think they changed chef's atleast 2-3 times since we last went here and while I don't fully blame anyone for the this review, I will just say in this review what OUR experience was like. It's kind of disconcerning that this used to be one of our favourite restaurants and now it's just a pass for us. In the past month we've come here for 2 times now and those 2 times have changed our opinion of this place.

Firstly, the second time we there, there was a party at their private building, so our food came a bit late and we weren't really attended to. If you know that you're going to have a big party come in, they should have had more help with the process. But then again, I don't fully know the extent of the service, they might have been short that week or someone might have called in sick for that day, who knows? 

The main reason why this review is actually being written is because of the change in food quality. While the presentation is still good, the taste and quality has gone down. One of our meals here I ordered the Rack of Lamb and my girlfriend ordered the Lamb Spaghetti. My lamb had mushroom risotto on it and it was bombarded with rosemary, to the point where it was really really really overpowering, aside from the rosemary bomb the risotto was heavily salted and unedible, I actually didn't eat it after the first few bites. The Lamb was cooked too much, I ordered Medium Rare and it came to about Medium-Medium Well. My girlfriends spaghetti was also the same, rosemary was a bit heavy, but not like mine, and it looked very dry from the get go, which was weird. We also had the crab cakes for starters, and they were good!

The other time we were here was a bit of a slow day for them, so we were much more attended. I ordered the Filet Mignon and my girlfriend ordered the Mussels. My Filet Mignon was over cooked, again I asked for medium rare and this time they gave me well-done. Which was a shame because the meat was really good, it was just over cooked. My girlfriend had no complaints on the Mussels though, which was a good sign. 

Over-all, this place was really a heart break. It was one of our favourite places to visit in Unionville and now has gone down in quality. We might as well eat in the Keg. I still give it a 2 stars because there are still some okay choices on the menu, just bear in mind that you will have to search for them."}
{"text":"Was craving pasta and decided to check this place out. Upon entering we weren't welcomed by any waiter, so we decided to wander in and look for a waiter ourselves, once they noticed us, we were told to have a seat anywhere we liked. 

After having a look at the menu we decided to start off our meal with a salad, hearts of romaine ($11), and we originally wanted beetroot maple cured salmon but they didn't have any cured salmon so they offered us smoked salmon ($15). Then we had spaghetti al frutti di mare ($27). To be completely honest, I wasn't a fan of their smoked salmon and I was quite disappointed but once the spaghetti came, it changed my opinion about this place. It included a decent amount of seafood which included mussels, salmon, squid and shrimp. The salmon was cooked just right with a crispy bottom, skin side up. The squid wasn't chewy, and the shrimp was cleaned very well unlike a lot of places they don't bother to remove the gunk off the shrimp's back. 

Overall opinion, great experience, definitely will be coming back once the weather begins to warm up because they also have multiple tables outside, perfect for those patio brunch days!"}
{"text":"A great place to dine, not to mention that their steak was absolutely delicious (I got the cast iron steak, you'll love it if you love your food spicy).  Conveniently located on the beautiful Main Street Unionville next to the Old Firehall Confectionery, this place will not disappoint.

We sat on the patio and enjoyed the nice weather, and the hosts made sure to frequent the outdoors as well so we virtually never had to wait for someone to pass by when we needed something.

Plating of the dishes were also spot on.

All things taken into account, this is definitely a place I'd recommend and I'd come back here any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Great service and attentive waitress.  Food was okay needed more seasonally.  It was like they where afraid of salt.  Had the seafood bourgeois. Portion small compared to Marche version and more $$"}
{"text":"Any place on Main St Unionville is going to have a quaint, \"oozing with charm\" kind of environment, and Blacksmith's Bistro lives up to the expectations. And the food is right up there too!

Not a big menu, but it had a pretty wide variety of choices that were all very interesting and enticing.  I defaulted to the special pasta, a fusilli and ground sausage.  The pasta was a perfect al dente, and the sausage was robust and hearty.  The sauce was delicious, and packed a touch of heat to raise the interest level a bit.

Considering the Jazz Festival was on and all the roads were closed, the staff was able to direct me to a sneak parking spot just behind the restaurant, making it downright convenient."}
{"text":"Great variety of food !  Good service and cozy environment and atmosphere. It is our go to place in Unionville. Really enjoy their pizzas and main dishes. We like their prix fix menu as well"}
{"text":"My family and I popped into this unassuming spot Unionville for lunch. Quarters are a little tight and it is a little dark, but the food was worth it.I had the grilled cheese which was the perfect blend of salty and sweet; it was stuffed with fresh spinach and the most delicate layer of fig marmalade, so yummy. The grilled calamari with capers was delicious, and the beef carpaccio was described by my uber-discerning brother as 'amazing'. Service was prompt and friendly but I think we may have been the only customers :) So maybe go during the less busy times of day to really have an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"After the menu went boring and plain, they seemed to have changed things up greatly in the past 6 months. We have had dinner there with our three kids now a couple of times and the menu is fantastic, every time. We have tried most of the apps and about half of mains and all were tasty. Its an eclectic menu with a mix of lots of things, but all done excellently. Staff friendly  and prompt and you can tell they are all seasoned professionals because of the way they server you. Service can be a bit slow when they are extremely busy, but if your not in a rush, enjoy the surroundings and take your time and savour."}
{"text":"A friend who is Italian and grew up in Markham recommended this place along with Il Postino for good Italian food. 

We had the Catch of the Day which happened to be swordfish and boy was I pleasantly surprised!

I've never had swordfish before and let me tell you it was the best tasting fish I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked, and a nice cut of the fish.  I'm told it's totally fresh, and if it's not eaten up by the end of the day it's thrown out.

Note we had a seat upstairs next to the bar area.  It was pretty noisy especially as the night went along.  I would recommend a seat further from the bar if you'd like a nice quiet romantic setting.

I wanted to come back here again for the swordfish, but seems it's luck of the draw what the catch of the day is.  When I phoned in to ask, they say they don't know until the day prior.  Guess I'll be calling them every week from now on  :-)"}
{"text":"Fusilli ($20) and Ravioli ($22) as main dishes. The Fusilli had large pieces of chicken and a nice amount of cream sauce (4/5) The Ravioli was not what I was picturing in my mind when we ordered it. What arrived at our table was 3 super-sized ravioli. Literally the size of a persons hand and each stuffed with a good amount of spinach and cheese (4/5) The cheese cake ($7) was just not to my expectation (3/5), maybe because I was a bit full. Overall the food was good and right beside the Old Fire-hall Confectionery. I can never say no to the Old Fire-hall. Always end up getting something there while walking Main Street and always end up buying a little extra so to keep the good times rolling while at home too. But yeah, read up on my full review for the Fire-hall."}
{"text":"Went here last night and ordered crab cakes as starters, and two of us had spaghetti al frutti del mare and another had the flat iron steak. I was excited to come eat here because the Yelp reviews seemed to hype the place up. You guys let me down lol! The crab cakes were small (if you make a circle with your thumb and forefinger, that's about the size they were) and didn't have the acidic hit from lemon that you need to cut through the richness. There was no description on the menu to indicate that there were only two crab cakes and the three of us were intending to share so it was a letdown when the app was served and there were only two small cakes and a small mound of coleslaw on the plate. Fine, we could have asked the server before we ordered it but this app is too small for even one person to feel satisfied. The taste was okay but not memorable.

My mom and I ordered the spaghetti al frutti del mare while my dad had the flat iron steak. The seafood was cooked well although the sauce was bland and could have used salt (there was no salt shaker at the table), fresh herbs, acidity from tomatoes/wine or even a splash of olive oil to brighten the dish. As it was, I couldn't even tell what the sauce was made of. For $27, I was expecting a standout dish but it didn't deliver. I've had better seafood pasta at chain restaurants for less. 

The flat iron steak looked good when it was presented to my dad in a cast iron skillet pan. There were roasted potatoes and mixed veggies at the bottom and slices of steak were fanned out across the top. He didn't say anything bad about it but I tasted a slice and DID NOT like the funky taste of it. I think they put blue cheese on the steak as it was cooking but my mom thought it was because the meat wasn't fresh. I think it was blue cheese though. This may be one of the worst things I've eaten and I can't believe it cost $27. 

This is the first review I've left on Yelp and I wouldn't have bothered doing it but my mom said it was the worst meal she's even eaten, especially for the price. Maybe we're just in the minority since most of the reviews for this place are very good, but I'm not going to recommend this place to anyone or go back."}
{"text":"The menu was different but not especially enticing, and a little on the pricey side. Service was good, attentive and friendly. We sat on the front patio and enjoyed a warm summer evening with friends."}
{"text":"This is our 5th or 6th time here. Amazing food, good service and really nice atmosphere. We love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my birthday meal at this place. 
I thought the restaurant was dead and then the hostess took us upstairs and the place was intimate and buzzing. 
I had the seafood linguine - and it was the most decent seafood pasta I've ever had.  Usually I expect 2 shrimps and then LOTS of pasta - but this meal was balanced out. 
Scallops, Shrimps and Mussels topped with just the right amount of creamy tomato sauce. 
This place is great for a date or something for those special occasions. 
They give you a decent glass of wine which is aways nice :) 

The waiter was friendly and made our experience very pleasant. 
I will definetely come back here to try other dishes AND because I love Main St Unionville."}
{"text":"Food = Surprisingly Average,    Service = TERRIBLE,    Price = expensive for serving sizes.

Hate writing poor reviews.....but we had anticipated a better experience for a Saturday nite. Arrived at our reservation time .....drink orders taken and they arrived quickly, appetizers arrived about 10 min after they were ordered (so far things were okay. Thereafter, the main courses took 1+1/4 hr to arrive. Asked the waitress for updates.....she brusquely said we need to understand this is Festival Time, we're very busy so be patient. Finally food arrived....given the Yelp reviews....we expected both higher quality and larger portions (and we are relatively lite  eaters). Overall....okay food but certainly not great. Moreover....when I left, I was still hungry

Decided to speak directly to management.....they did apologize profusely....and said the kitchen was really backed up. Interesting excuse as the restaurant was not full when we arrived....the front & rear outside patios were busy.....but upstairs, there were 4-5 empty tables when we arrived....which eventually filled up at the end of the 2 hours we were there.

Management said the waitress was partially to blame..... she was new and did not provide the right service level (no way to verify this....but it is not a classy way to deal with a problem the wait staff has no control over). IMHO....management is responsible for hiring, training and guiding wait staff....so this shouldn't be used as an excuse. 

Management said that they wanted our NEXT experience to be better...... and offered to provide free appetizers the next time we came in. Nice gesture.....would have been much stronger gesture if it wasn't just verbal.....or a card/coupon for the next time. 

BUT....in a city that boasts 10,000 restaurants and more opening all the time......the 1st experience is often the last if things don't go well.....and all 4 patrons agreed, we would not be returning.

RECOMMENDATIONS to MANAGEMENT:
(1) Don't blame the kitchen or the wait staff for exceedingly slow service. Deal with it.
(2) If you are going to have a busy or  slow nite.....tell the patrons BEFOREHAND so they can make a choice and change their reservations.
(3) If suddenly, everything gets backed up and delays happen (this occasionally will in any restaurant)....come up to the table and EXPLAIN the situation. Better yet, offer to remedy it immediately.....offer bread or some other appetizer to help tide people over during the delays....(NB....bread is offered at $5 per basket and we did not want bread......but after a 45 minute wait and the ladies starting to get headaches....we told our waitress to bring it......turned out to be the BEST PART of the meal, warm and tasty.....go figure!!). 
(4) If you genuinely want someone to come back a 2nd time to try getting a better experience, take the patrons name or number down to show you really mean it."}
{"text":"The definition of 'meh'. 

Popped in with no expectations. My expectations were, nevertheless, met. 

The food was average to below-average. Pizza was slightly better than pizzaiolo and soup/salad was nondescript. 

The place itself was pleasant and charming and the only fair justification for the price of anything on the menu. 

By far the worst aspect of the visit was service. When attended to (which was rare) I got the sense that I was being rushed which was rich considering we waited almost an hour at the bar after our host had told us that they were clearing our table. When our bill came (we had not asked for it) I asked that it be split between the members of our party. After refusing to at first (after which I so politely insisted) our server reluctantly went back to draft up another. 

When asked why our bill couldn't be split, our server responded verbatim: \"Because we have better things to do\"."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate our anniversary.  We picked a table upstairs by the window which was very romantic.  The food is great the ambiance was romantic.  Would highly recommend the sharing platter!  Enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, my wife did not. Mostly because her food had spice in it and she does not like spice, especially in her pizza. 

I had the pasta and I have to say it was really good. We got lucky too, a band started playing next door and we had a nice view on the patio. That might skew this overly positive since I don't see that happening often. 

When the waitress came back with our food, it was very good and very fast. I really enjoyed it. Too bad the pizza was spicy, perhaps they should label that on the menu?"}
{"text":"Came here quite by chance as I was spending a girls day out with a dear friend for her belated Birthday.  We had originally intended to dine at Il Postino but it was closed and on the kind recommendation by the counter lady at the heavenly Old Fire Hall Confectionary we decide to try Blacksmith's Bistro.  It's elegant, cozy and definitely fit in with the general smalltown chic vibe of the Unionville posse.

Upon entering we are ushered upstairs to intimate dining quarters. Actually it was quite romantic complete with senior make-out tunes like Por Ti Volare piped in the background, it's hard not to think about Will Ferrell in Step Brothers when I hear that song, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR6Z6q8RjBs&feature=related  I digress...

My dear friend and I share an appy of the Panko Crusted Crab Cakes
Shaved Fennel & Orange Slaw, Lemon Caper Aioli ($15) The Crab cake is perfectly crisp outside and nicely textured with crumbles of veggies, plus the refreshing accompaniment of the fennel slaw adds a nice zing along with the flavourful aioli.

For our mains my dear friend orders the Rack of Lamb and myself I order the Mediterranean pizza with roasted red peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, feta cheese  ($15)  My carnivorous friend's appetite is well sated by the medium rare lamb along with it's roasted veggies and triangles of baked polenta.  I too am very satisfied with the thin crispness of the pizza crust along with the freshness of the toppings. I just wish there was more of that dreamy smooth goat cheese and less of the mozzarella, which I felt dumbed it down, but only by a little.  The service was choppy, with all too frequent albeit civilly polite visits from 3 different servers. Thankfully the last server was good enough to give me the bill so I could treat my friend to a great Birthday meal :)

All-in-all Blacksmith's Bistro is a charming dining experience and the perfect way to round out your visit to the quaint trappings of Unionville."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem to find in the suburbs.  The upstairs dining room feels as if you're in a rustic cabin or some upscale restaurant downtown.  The food here is fantastic and waiters are friendly and attentive.  I got the margarita pizza and was delighted with it.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Blacksmith's Bistro is cute and charming. 

I opted to sit upstairs in their dining room  right next to the fireplace which gives it a warm and homey vibe. The downstairs where the open kitchen located is kind of dark and more casual without the white table cloth settings.

There is no business hour posted outside the restaurant, so I was there a little too early for lunch... 15 minute before it supposed to open at noon. The staffs were really welcoming and more than willing to sit me and the chef  was ready to cook too!

Parma Pizza (Prosciutto, Bocconcini, Arugula, Roasted Red Peppers, Pesto)  $15 was a little disappointing and overcooked. The crust was thin but so crispy like eating a flat bread crackers. Wish there were more Arugula... I am thinking about similar pizza I ate at 7 Pizzeria Enoteca (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/7-pizzeria-enoteca-oakville#hrid:l4nvKG0WnKuy--I11SwMlw/src:self) which was loaded with Arugula!

I ended up washing down the pizza with water and I was kind of full... so no dessert.

I might need to come back again for dinner and try other items on the menu, as it is unfair to write off Blacksmith's based on just a pizza.

BTW, there is \"Seafood Pasta\" on the menu, I know who will be coming here with me!"}
{"text":"Loved the chicken fusilli. Pasta was cooked well and the sauce/toppings were flavourful but not heavy. 

A little pricey for the location. The patio area could use a revamp."}
{"text":"I've been to the Blacksmith's a fair amount of time over the years.  Unionville Mainstreet is a tough place to open up a shop and keep it going.  There are so many great places to dine and hangout...and a few that I wouldn't recommend.
In general, they have a small but decent selection of draughts and nice stock wines.  Their patio between the restaurant and their backhouse is spacious and well exposed for the sun worshippers and well shadowed in areas for those who just want to be outside.
Their food fare is more upscale and quite delicious.  I'm partial to their pizzas and salads.
They have plenty of parking in the back of the restaurant so don't do anything crazy on the main strip.
Whether you want a night out to relax or entertain clients, BB delivers on both counts."}
