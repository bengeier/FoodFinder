{"text":"Love this store!  
Hard to beat for gluten free, local foods, and supplements.  Great staff.  
Yep prices are a tad high, but what do you expect, they are a small local business without access to volume chain prices from the distributors.  Sure beats the alternative, which is having no access in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great store that makes travelling from South Carolina a little easier.  We don't have to bring raw milk and grass-fed beef anymore, because they have it.  The raw grass-fed cheeses are always awesome!  I usually bring back at least 10-15 blocks to savor back home.  We don't have any place like Sunny Bridge here in SC, so the cost does not seem to bother me as much.  We can only choose from poorly run grocery stores and there is one health store 30 minutes away that is not nearly as large as Sunny Bridge.  Positive attitudes rule and that is what matters to us.  Thank you for coming to McMurray!"}
{"text":"I look forward to the day when they aren't out of stock of multiple desired items every single time I'm in there. Doesn't matter if it's keto bread or Solaray or TwinLabs supplements or essential oils. The owner refused to order enough stock at the same time. Depression baby maybe? Their prices are also not competitive compared to a health store I frequent in Dormont."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Today was my first time checking out Sunny Bridge and I know I'll be back. I recently started the Paleo diet and my sister works out by this store and suggested I check it out. I found many Paleo items that I can have including desserts! The store isn't huge but the inventory is great, there's so much stuff! The store includes healthy, organic food as well as organic beauty and health items. Then, there is a little caf√© in the store with freshly made smoothies, juices, coffee, salads, wraps, etc. The prices are a little high but I don't mind because I know I'm getting great and beneficial products! All of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Sunny Bridge pros: A large selection of gluten free products, local honey and raw cow's milk, good vitamin and supplement selection, great boxed tea choices, some bulk food and a juice bar. The cons: They're expensive, which goes with being a small business, and they freeze the raw milk that they get in, which makes me nuts. Lately I've noticed they're keeping some of the raw milk in their refrigerated case, and that's probably because they got tired of hearing me bitch about it. I choose wisely when I shop here, as many of the dairy products, cleaning products and beauty products that were once only available in health food stores, you can now get at the Iggle.  The staff is helpful with varying degrees of knowledge."}
{"text":"This is a natural/ organic/vegan grocery store that has a little cafe with fresh made to order wraps, sandwiches, smoothies and little pizza. 
I just loved their roast beef lettuce wrap with feta and Swiss. Truly delicious. The wrap and the coconut water cost $13  which is a little more than I used to spend for lunch but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great hidden treasure for this area! SB has a huge selection of natural foods and supplements, and a fantastic cafe that offers breakfast, lunch, and pastries!"}
{"text":"Probably the most Paleo friendly natural foods store in Pittsburgh. They have a wide selection of grass fed beef as well as having almond flour and coconut flour bread in stock.  Awesome smoothies as well! Downside is it's expensive."}
{"text":"I really want to support & shop local.  I encountered Sunnybridge at a health expo and I was excited to finally become familiar with the products they sold.  I figured they would be like DeWalt's as I have passed Sunnybridge several times on 19 but never stopped.  One of the products they had at the fair piqued my interest so one day in passing I finally stopped.  None of the staff was helpful as I walked in, and I was left wandering the store for that one particular product.  When I finally went to leave, I was asked for assistance and I asked for the paleo Coconut flake cereal I had seen at the expo.  They didn't know what I was looking for and it seemed like they didn't have the slightest clue what I was talking about.  I thought that was totally odd and a bit unnerving as they were questioning me about whether it was a real product.  Just not welcoming.  

I felt bad leaving empty handed, especially at an independent grocer, so I bought a small bag of the bulk trail mix.  It was stale and expensive.  I chose the bulk bins because their prepared foods were not even ready.  It was a Saturday around 1:00 PM.  To me, that's the prime time for prepared foods, but I guess I was wrong.    I likely won't be back.  

My advice is anyone from the store reads this is three fold:  (1)  Educate your staff on the products you will be displaying at the trade shows so they know what people might be in looking for; (2)  actually stock said products; (3) rotate more aggressively the items in your bulk bins to maintain freshness."}
{"text":"I only shopped the store and did not visit the cafe. I was able to find everything that I was looking for, and then some. They offer great options for those who are avoiding a specific food such as meat, dairy, gluten or want a nutritional supplement. They offer the greatest selection of natural dry goods that I have ever seen, they are fresh and sold loose by weight. I went crazy trying everything. I walked in wearing jeans, tee shirt, and athletic shoes, and felt horribly under dressed, as compared to the other customers. The items that I purchased were pricey, but if you want quality, you must pay."}
{"text":"Wonderful little store ! I love having the availability of gluten free and organic products in the neighborhood. I have purchased various items and always happy. They carry some hard to find brands and the customer service is GREAT ! I just wish the prices were a little lower. Hopefully a volume of customers will help that."}
{"text":"I love everything about Sunny Bridge Natural Foods.  They have an incredible selection of hard-to find items, such as raw milk & cheese, local and organic meats, organic produce, natural supplements, health & beauty, and they specialize in gluten-free items (that I purchase for my wife, who is gluten-sensitive), and even Beelzebub's Salsa, which is fabulous, and is locally made in N.W. PA, and is very hard to find in the Pittsburgh area.  The cafe, juice bar and bakery (dedicated gluten free) are also wonderful.  I love supporting small, locally owned businesses, and yes, the prices here may be a few cents more than the big box stores, but remember, you are supporting the local economy when you shop here, because the owner and employees are all local, and they buy as many products from small local farms, and local food purveyors as they can, many that you just simply cannot find anywhere else.  Shop local, support local . . . cross the bridge to Sunny Bridge Natural Foods!"}
{"text":"I am grateful that we have this store in our neighborhood.  They're really trying hard to give us a good selection of healthy, natural and organic packaged and fresh food.  I haven't tried anything prepared.  Their selection is ok and they will order things for you.  Their prices are high though and it really bothers me to no end.  I wait to go into the city to go to the East End Food Co-op if I possibly can but in a pinch will run in for something.  The staff is friendly and helpful and maybe if more people shopped there they could lower their prices?  It's a chicken egg scenario I am afraid.  If they could do volume, they could probably charge less but would they?"}
{"text":"I think it's really nice to have a specialty health food store in \"Pittsburgh.\" However it's definitely a drive, even for someone who already lives in the South Hills (Dormont specifically). 

I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and am very new to the whole gluten free lifestyle. Therefore, I thought it would be wise to go to a specialty store to see what was offered and maybe stock up on some staples for gluten free cooking. 

It's very small, so while I imagine gluten free living in Pittsburgh isn't huge, it has what seems to be a small selection. What I wasn't a fan of was the organization. I walked in and asked where the gluten free section was, having never been there. The woman at the front said hesitantly, the back four freezers and the one aisle in the back. 

Okay... got it. So I walked back and while it wasn't marked (none of the aisles were), I found a couple random things scattered in the aisle that was and wasn't gluten free. I was pretty confused, so I just started wondering around. Pretty much the entire store has a scattering of gluten free items. But here's where I think it gets really confusing. I found gluten free muffin mix in one aisle, then found other brands in the next two aisles. Why not put all the gluten free muffin mixes together? The same goes for other random items too, all spread between multiple aisles. There's not a paleo section necessarily, but paleo items are scattered throughout the store. Since it's a small store, it's not that big a deal, but for the super organized OCD person, this is going to drive you crazy!

They also have a small bakery and cafe. There are lunch and dinner items like salads, meatloaf, and even grape leaves (I tried them, they were good). There's also baked goods like cake and cookies, which is great. Plus, all the grab and go items are gluten free. Some are soy and dairy free, but not all of them. 

I picked up some muffin mix, turkey meatballs and a couple other various items. I have yet to try them, but I'm curious how they'll taste and what brands are even good. Like others have mentioned, it's not cheap. But I don't expect it to be for a small grocery store selling very specialized items. I'm sure I'll be back for special visits, but since it's a journey out here, I'm not sure I'd be out every week per say."}
