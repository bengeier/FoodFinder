{"text":"First time here. Ordered Rasta pasta with shrimp. When my order came up the employee asked what goes on the pasta and the line worker said chicken I corrected her and said shrimp and she told me I didn't say shrimp and proceeded to tell other  employee to give me chicken. I let it go because I was on my lunch break and didn't want to wait for the shrimp. You want to support the community but customer service is clearly lacking. I won't be back."}
{"text":"-Very nice looking restaurant, nice decor.
-Very nice, friendly and helpful employees.
- The best Jamaican food I've had and I've tried 3 other places. This one tops them all by far. Very generous portions, various meal options, easy online ordering but best of all.....the food was amazing!! All of it!! From the Rasta Pasta to the Jerk Chicken Box to the Jerk Chicken bowl. The food is presented very well and it's all delicious. I'll definitely be back to try more of their menu options."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! As soon as you walk in it is a fun filled environment with great authentic food. Made the experience worth it and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very clean place!  My favorite is the Jerk chicken bowl. The food is so good I am there once a week sometimes two. I try not to eat out that much because you really don't know the quality of food your getting; however, you can ask the owner what type of meat he uses (all natural, antibiotic free, etc), where he purchase from or the type of ingredients and he will tell you. I've heard in the reviews some say that the owner Omar need better customer service but he is really a nice guy with a sort of stern demenor. Try conversing with him next time your in there - he is really a nice guy. I've been eating here for about a year now and what I like the most is the consistancy. Even while at Richmond Mall the food was always the same and well stocked. I love supporting professional black businesses and will be a life long customer!"}
{"text":"I am happy to see a new place in the Neighborhood. I have been here twice and so far the food has been really good. The ingredients seem very fresh and the prices are reasonable. Bowls weight a ton and are enough for two meals."}
{"text":"Decided I wanted Jamaican food but something Authentic. I drove all the way from the west side up here and the drive was worth it. I got a bowl with jerk chicken which had rice and beans and cabbage with it and some type of jerk gravy. Also got a chicken curry and all of it was amazing. The people there were very helpful with me making a decision. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Bruuuuuhhh this place is the bomb!! I have been here so many times and the food is great.. the plantains are my favorite thing in the menu but their jerk chicken is definitely up there. 

This is definitely a place you want to try. The environment is also really chill. Definitely make me want to become a rastafari lol"}
{"text":"I love the food here! I usually get a bowl with curry chicken and the mango salsa is just excellent. I love plantains so of course this is a big plus for me being able to get them less than 5 min from home. The prices are reasonable and the decor is nice. 

So, why the 4 stars and not 5?

Customer service. The customer service is bad. No one greets you when you enter and it's almost like don't ask questions, you should know what you want. The guy, who I think is the owner is always yelling to I assume the cooks in the back and today the young lady stared at me when I walked in and didn't move. After a few minutes she says from her seat \"do you know what you want?\"  Seemed as if I was bothering her. 

The customer service is what keeps me from going as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Only been here once. Food was pretty good, prices were good, place was packed. My jerk chicken was a little too spicy for me, sides were good, I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Plantains are amazing, cabbage is so good. The jerk Mac and cheese is absolute tastebud insanity"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my short list of places to try, seeing as though it's less than 10 minutes from where I live. I was visiting a friend nearby on a Saturday night drove by and noticed the restaurant was still open. I decided to stop in, just a little bit after 8 after noting that they close at 9. I was a little leery thinking that it was pretty close to closing time and maybe the food would not be so fresh, I was definitely wrong. The menu board has lots of items to choose from, I opted for a rice bowl with jerk chicken for $6.99, the portion was huge, definitely enough for two people. Upon checking out I also got a Jamaican beef patty, my entire total was less than $10.  I ate the Jamaican beef patty in the car and it was tasty, the pastry shell was adequately flaky and the filling had a nice spice level. I arrived home to eat my entree. Generous portion of rice and peas, also a large portion of nicely spiced jerk chicken which was tender and tasty, topped with perfectly seasoned smothered cabbage. The entree also comes with plantains. I asked for those on the side, I like to eat my plantains as dessert. They were nicely cooked perfectly sweet and the perfect ending to a really good meal.  I can't wait to return, there were also options for wrap sandwiches as well as traditional Jamaican entrees. The two young ladies working were very nice.  All in all this was a really good meal!"}
{"text":"Omar is the best he is a good humble dude and takes care of his customers. The food here is authentic and tasty. If you don't know he was located in Richmond mall but moved to the new location on East 185th. This is good Jamaican food and I would not going any where else. The new restaurant is nice inside and the smell of greatness hits you the moment you walk in the door. The new location even has more food items you can try even bowls. You can't go wrong coming to this place. I support this guy and his food I'll always be a long time customer."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I was impressed. It was clean and there was Reggae music playing which added to the ambiance. I wasn't really hungry so I was happy when I saw that I could just order sides. I got a side of rice and beans along with a side of curry chicken. Let me just say I was very happy with the portions. The food looked and tasted great. This will be added to my list of go to Jamaican restaurants."}
{"text":"I got the jerk chicken with rice beans and cabbage. It was fresh hot spicy good.  Service was quick I will be eating there more often."}
{"text":"Wow. A combination of classic Jamaican cuisine combined with modern presentation.
I can only eat so much, but I say ask about the soup of the day. Like many Jamaican places, have a full menu, but they only serve part of it does this seem to be cooking constantly."}
{"text":"We have been hunting for flavorful, progressive Jamaican food. Lo and behold within minutes of our home was the deliciousness we needed. We both had Jerk Chicken, Cabbage, Plantains and rice and beans. The portions were huge and had an umami element. The heat was presnt but not flamethrower to the head heat. Go to the islands for lunch. We did and we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Ahhh, this is the type of place I really want to spend my money at. Ire Jamaican is everything that you desire in a local, mom and pop ethnic eating establishment. These are the same owners that once  had a place at the Richmond mall. No one believed that you can have friggin bomb Jamaican food in of  all places, in the freaking world the Richmond efn mall. I was fairly pissed when they closed, but that's because it was in efn Richmond mall who's best years were a couple of decades ago. I'm so glad that they opened up and this seems like a really good location.

Let's just start with this place is super clean. The owner Omar, makes you feel at home and you can tell he really wants you to have a great experience. His workers are super nice as well, that tells you that the help is treated well and they do not mind being there.

From what I can surmise  just about everything is made from scratch. They have a lot of standard Jamkn fair, including oxtail, chicken and shrimp curry, beef patties,   cabbage, beans and rice. , veggies fresh juices and much much more. You can get a combination platter or chipotle it up with making your own bowl with a nice amount of fresh toppings. I even noticed a vegetarian option but obviously I did not pay much attention too. 

Being the jerk that I am, I went for jerk chicken, and this jerk chicken was really really jerk ass good. It had a decent level of spiciness with lots of flavor and a subtle smokiness. My side was the cabbage which was fantastic as well. Omar asked how everything was and made sure I was happy while I was scarfing down this bomb ass Jerk chicken. That is what it should be called, Bomb Ass Jerk Chicken. It's settled it will be referred  to as Bomb Ass Jerk Chicken. 

Oh and for all you cheap asses out there, the portions are tremendous and price point is extremely reasonable, it a down and dirty steal if you ask me.

If you are in the area, pick some up, even of it just for lunch the next day, you will not be disappointed. Oh and they have a small counter you can eat at if you do not feel like waiting."}
{"text":"Was walking in my neighborhood and decided to stop in with my daughter. We had oxtail and it was good. The cabbage and plantain was delicious. Great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Guy serving food needs better customer service! When he came out from the back and I stood at he counter he just looked at me, no greeting, no smile didn't even ask \"how can I help you\". IF I COME TO PATRONIZE YOUR BUSINESS THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS SMILE AND GREET ME women at register was good though. Food was below average for me. Jerk chicken was not seasoned very well lacked spice and heat. Rice and cabbage were ok (ran out of beans so I didn't get to try those)."}
{"text":"The restuarant is neat and very clean. The food was very good  as were the portions as were the prices. I had left my wallet and didnt have enough cash to pay for my food AND the drink i ordered and the young lady who waited on me paid the dollar that i was short. I will CERTAINLY return and reccommend that you give them a try."}
{"text":"I've only gotten the jerk chicken here, but it's the best in Cleveland. My fiancee's family is from Kingston, Jamaica and she agrees. The prices are very reasonable and they now take online orders. There's not much seating in the restaurant so I wouldn't come here with the idea of having a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Living in Euclid I heard a lot of ppl talking about how much they like this restaurant and i LOVE curry chicken so I had to try! I ordered the curry chicken bowl, jerk chicken box, beef patty and a side of oxtails (for my parents...not my cup of tea lol). My mother loved them! Food was good! I lovvve the beef patty and cabbage. Chicken was good also. I had my water for the jerk chicken. Has a nice kick lol the plaintains were great too. I previously tried them at a different restaurant and didnt like them so for me to like it IS BIG. I enjoyed the decor and reggae music playing. (I LOVE REGGAE) had to stop myself from dancing....overall great customer service and food! Will recommend!"}
{"text":"First time eating Jamaican, had a jerk bowl with mango salsa, loved it. Staff was helpful and courteous."}
{"text":"can we say nasty!!!!! and over priced. the jerk chicken was nasty it has a slight fruit taste to it like either pineapple or mango flavor as how that might sound good let me say not in jerk chicken. as Aretha Franklin would say \" the pie was nasty\". The curry chicken taste like it was boiled in water it had no authentic curry taste. I would not recommend this place. if you really want some really good jamaican food go to Ochio Rio on Ivanhoe. and let me please say I do not work for them I am just saying don't waste your time at this place. I am sitting here and I keep trying to eat this food and I keep asking my self why it is not good plus the customer service was not good I was not greeted or acknowledge until I said something to the man at the register. because he was preoccupied with a conversation with some girl that was sitting in the restaurant not buying anything. plus they don't offer a small size they are completely over priced for their nasty food. don't go there until they get some cooking lessons from Ochio Rios or some real jamaican cook."}
