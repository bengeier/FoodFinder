{"text":"I loved everything: the quaint environment, very friendly staff, extremely talented chef and amazing food. I will definitely come back and try the lunch menu (we went for dinner) and I highly recommend it to lovers of Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Nakamori tonight. Afterwards, I was berating him for not coming here sooner. Chef Nobuyuki Nakamori had prepared a gourmet level feast for us. Honestly,  it was the best Japanese food I had tasted in a long time and not surprisingly, Mr. Nakamori had worked at such notable establishments as Ginko and Bent. So you know what he produces is of high quality. Enjoy this hidden  gem in Scarborough. It is worth it."}
{"text":"This is hands down THE BEST sushi place in TORONTO.  The menu has many different takes on rolls which make for interesting flavour surprises!  It's not the cheapest place but definitely worth the money.  My favourite roll is butter teriyaki scallop.  Thought I died and went to sushi heaven!  We've also done the tasting menu which left us full and immensely satisfied.  Don't let the neighbourhood fool you this place is definitely class all the way."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was on a Saturday night around 7pm; the place was not as busy as expected.  

However, their service was unbearably slow; 4 servers were present at the time. We had to wait almost an hour for our final order to come through. No tea/water was provided, not even after the food came out. The tea cost $2 btw. 

Our server couldn't speak proper English and was not attentive at all. 

The food, on the other hand, was pretty good. 
I have to say I am not satisfied with my overall experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered pineapple teriyaki chicken, it tasted so salty and the Chicken was all burnt. And the sushi are all sticky and are not fresh.  And my friend's curry was too salty as well. The service and food is not deserve such high price. I definitely will not come here again."}
{"text":"I really really like this spot. The chirashi is a very fresh selection of fish beautifully presented. Now that spring has arrived their menu has also changed. I really enjoy going to a restaurant that changes up their menu to reflect the season and availability of ingredients. Have enjoyed the Saba now on the menu, Nigiri. The broths are very rich and complex.  This is a great stop for lunch. The music is also not what you would perhaps expect. It is upbeat, quirky and fun. Will attend for dinner as they have a very interesting list of sake's I would love to try when not on a working lunch."}
{"text":"Had a few different signature rolls they were very flavorful . The Sashimi and beef ribs were excellent. Good fusion options and very good service. It's just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Must give it a try.  Food was excellent - the jerk chicken appetizer is a must.  Save some room for the home made ice-cream (loved the Miso Caramel).  Presentation of the food is outstanding.  Service was exceptional -  very attentive.  The chef came around himself to inquire if the meal met our expectations.  The decor (flooring in particular) could use an update but the place is very clean.  Give this place a try; you'll love it."}
{"text":"ghetto location next to some run down stores, enough of that....amazing food, delicious rolls and great service....thumbs up...havent tried better and dont think I will!"}
{"text":"Every dish was fresh and incredibly flavourful. Fish was succulent and rich. The sushi chef was amazing to watch and the support staff was incredibly attentive and friendly. 

The dishes were incredibly beautiful and different. The Sake menu was impressive and all of the ice creams are home made."}
{"text":"This review is for June 2017. My boyfriend treated to this restaurant because Niji sushi was jam packed with no seating. It was a bit more expensive but much quieter with a small seating section with tatami where we sat. We had the Chirashi, Spicy Tempura Salmon Roll and Grapefruit Saba with sauteed vegetables. Everything was perfect. The waiter was super friendly. His birthday was coming up in August and I honestly should have brought us back here for his birthday meal instead of where we actually went. If you are looking for a peaceful romantic atmosphere with quality food, this is a place to consider. I just hope they have more tatami seating in the future or renovate the table and chair area."}
{"text":"Back in the day I used to go to scarborough's first premium sushi joint called Zen. It was right on Eglinton and was ranked a top 5 sushi place in all of Toronto. Of course they moved to Markham 2 years ago. In its place came a little unknow place called Nakamori. Wow. As I watch shows like chefs table i see chef Nakamori keeping tradition alive but also exploring new flavours and keeping up with the dempgraphic that is Toronto. I was impressed and my taste buds were tantilized as well as wowed by the amazing and complex flavours of chef Nakamori's sushi. Missing from my photos is a wonderful lobster cali roll which had hints of lime and chilli onnthe lobster. I think one of his signature tatses is the fresh herb garden he has behind the sushi bar which adds a little flare to each bite. Having been to Cafe Michi and Aoyama I can safely say that this is the best sushi on scarborough hands down. Light lovers rock reggae playing in the back ground was a nice touch. All very affordable ( as you would expect from premium sushi) and the service was stellar. Attentative while not being obtrusive. I will be back again and againfor this special gem hidden in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and great food. This is a tiny restaurant with an emphasis on great service. Dont go if you're in a rush. They have 1 (maybe 2) great chefs who take their time in putting together a great meal. Many of the dishes included cooked fish so make sure you ask questions if you want a traditional sushi meal. Definitely a place to watch; I will be back."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin.... great music and atmosphere, the sushi is outstanding; you can taste the freshness! Cozy yet elegant decor. 10/10"}
{"text":"I decided to give Nakamori another chance since I was in the area and I'm glad I did. I had a good time here this time by focusing on the basics - good fish, which this restaurant has in spades!

The chef really likes his mackerel, and I agree. Since it can be too fishy for some so it's not extremely popular and some restaurants buy prebought marinated saba or do it half-assedly. Not so here! Robust but not overpowering flavours and excellent texture on this fish. I also had a piece of succulent fatty tuna belly. 

Their chirashi is beautifully presented and comes with a plethora of fish ranging from more tuna and salmon to lightly-seared scallops and two variants of shrimp. I will complain about the imitation crab, but in the future I can just tell the chef to serve me something else (it'll probably cost extra, but it's worth it!)"}
{"text":"Nakamori took over Zen Japanese Restaurant's old location while keeping the exact same look and feel. Menu is quite different as there's a bunch of fusion dishes like this jerk chicken karaage, seafood ceviche tacos, gyoza ravioli, and tempura fish and chips.

I really enjoyed the jerk chicken karaage. It's the dry version but it's very flavourful with the jerk spices which balanced well with the mango aioli.

They also have some fancy rolls like aburi saba, hamachi tataki, butter teriyaki scallop and spicy lobster california rolls. My favourite among the 4 is the aburi saba.

Sushi variety is very limited. When we went, they only had salmon, tuna, saba, scallop, hamachi, botan ebi, uni and unagi.

I find this place is above Korean owned Japanese restaurants but still below my favourites like Zen."}
{"text":"Creative and high quality sushi. A true gem.  Will definitely make it a regular favourite."}
{"text":"Although the location and surrounding vicinities look very questionable and sketch, the experience you have here is very intimate and fantastic! From the service to the quality, and freshness of the food - I thoroughly enjoyed my dining time here and can't wait to come back! 

My guest and I ordered the Omakase set dinner which included an 8-course meal. Everything was beautifully presented, and we were lucky enough to sit at the bar and watch the chef make our dishes in perfect action. Some of the other dishes were made in the kitchen with respect to the sushi, and I took a great liking to the fact that they use fresh ingredients and garnishings - their greens came from an indoor garden plant they had at the bar next to a sign. 

The miso soup included salmon and it was very tender and so flavorful! It had some hint of lemon and orange which I absolutely savoured! The beef and rice dish was cooked to perfection and had just the perfect amount of rice. Even the servers kept coming back to circulate and kept refilling our waters. Everything was absolutely delicious and I am highly recommending this place, as well as coming back!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that I came to visit this place. It was on Saturday night around 7pm. At first, my boyfriend and I felt the location was creepy. But after we got in the restaurant, the environment was actually quite good and the interior design was nice too! The server was so nice and friendly. 

We ordered Seafood Ceviche Tacos, the sauce surprised us, it's really match with the Tacos. For the main course, we had Wasabi Beef Steak, this was totally amazing! I will highly recommend this dish because the sauce was perfect! Of course we did also ordered sushi & sashimi deluxe (with butter teriyaki scallop). We both love it because the taste of the roll was quite interesting. It's huge but there's different texture inside the roll. Lastly, we tried their homemade mixed berry ice cream. The dessert was perfect too! 

Overall, I would give 5 stars to this restaurant. The dinner is around $50-60 per person."}
{"text":"This was Zen's old location, and we only knew about Nakamori because of Zen's waiters who told us about it. Chef Nakamori used to work downtown with Sursur Lee and created a lot of fun dishes with sushi. The first time we tried Nakamori he gave us free steak which was delicious; however, in the beginning there was no miso soup or even any salad (except for a thin slice of kumato) and we stopped coming. 

We thought of trying Nakamori again after a while, hoping they have now perfected their previously rather limited menu. The fish was always fresh since the beginning, but there was little else to eat. But we were pleasantly surprised that the menu has changed and included salad (which was delicious) and miso soup, and the wasabi prawn was excellent. the fish was super fresh, the price was not bad now that it actually includes soup and salad. I am so happy with this place. Will definitely come back and it is now one of my favourite hangouts!"}
{"text":"Service is slow! The waitress did not serve water while waiting for our friends. I had to ask for water! The deluxe was great and surprisedly filling but it was a bit pricey. The chirashi was very delicious, they provided some premium pieces like himachi"}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming to this restaurant.  The food is top notch and the service is courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"We came here thinking it was Zen sushi but discovered that the owner has changed. We took a chance and tried the omakase,  which means you do not order food and let the chef choose/make the food for you.  

The food was so delicious and filling,  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. The owner/chef is very friendly with amazing skills. His knife looks like a small samurai sword, which he told us it was custom made for him. He makes this very unique but delicious sake cake that is a must try if you go."}
{"text":"A friend mentioned this restaurant changed from Zen (since Zen moved up to Markham in needs of a larger location), so we decided to check out the new place for a friend's birthday dinner. The set-up is similar to Zen and they still have the 2 tatami table booths in the back. We sat at one of those booths. Our server was new but very polite and attentive to our needs. They have many interesting and unique menu items on their dinner menu. One of the friends I was with had already came here for lunch and definitely told us we should save room for their handmade ice cream with different Japanese flavors each day. The server and head owner/chef were very accommodating to our requests. One of our friends was pregnant and they were good about warning us to avoid the raw sushi. We ended up going with the asian salad, jerk kaarage, fish and yam chips, and the sushi sampler platter with 6 assorted pieces of sushi from the chef's choice and 8 salmon maki. Out of the entrees, we really enjoyed the jerk kaarage and the Asian salad. The sushi sampler platter is nothing to rave about for the price but the quality of fish and presentation was quite excellent. We loved also how they fried the kaarage and the fish/yam chips. The batter was nicely fried and not too heavy. The chicken was very tender and the spices just right on the jerk kaarage. What probably made this also lovely was the authentic green tea they served in a really nice teapot and the Musoka brewery beer we could order as one of their bottled beers. They also had a good assortment of non-alcoholic beers which we didn't get a chance to try.  The best part to end off the night was trying the different flavors of homemade ice cream. We ordered three different scoops of ice cream of roasted green tea, balsamic berry and maple cinnamon taro. We would recommend the balsamic berry and maple cinnamon taro. The combination of flavors were divine. As well, hats off to the chef and server who did not kick us out when we stayed past the time of their closing time of 9:30pm and left the restaurant a little after 10:00pm without realizing the time. Though this restaurant is more pricier for dinner, we do think it's great for special occasions and the service is excellent. We also had the opportunity to chat with the owner and you can tell he takes real pride in making this place a truly authentic Japanese place."}
{"text":"If I was a bulimic billionaire I'd just sit and eat here all day and night.

Came for the New Years Eve set meal. Was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Really enjoyed the sake pairing too.
They had a rice beer, didn't want to ruin the sake pairing, but will definitely try it next time."}
{"text":"My visit was on a Wednesday around 12:30pm. I had high expectations based on the reviews and pictures. So I ordered what most of the folks did...the sushi lunch roll set $17, the bento box $25, and the signature hamachi roll $15.
Unfortunately, I have to say that it was just an ok experience. I have had better signature rolls elsewhere. The bento box was creative and pretty but did not wow me at all. 
The bill totalled $78 for 2 people (after tax & tip) 
At least I can say I tried it- but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"An amazing experience. One of the most satisfying meal ever. The quality and service are well worth the price. Japanese chef, trained in Tokyo brings an authentic twist to the dining experience.

The sushi and sashimi platter, along with the lobster signature roll was exquisite. Beautifully presented in its simple execution but the attention to details by the sushi chef was much appreciated. Each piece was artfully put together, perfect in texture and temperature. We also ordered the pork ribs kakuni and the jerk chicken karage. The ribs were utterly fall of the bones tender, and the complex layers of flavor gave a pleasant mouth feel. Eating this in conjunction with the sushi platter wasn't a bright idea as it was quite heavy and took a bit of effort to cleanse the palate. However, as a stand alone dish, it definitely would have held on its own-you will have to order the rice separately. The jerk chicken karage was an interesting fusion of taste. The batter was flavorful but not light. It was a great appetizer but might be overpowering if you have sushi and sashimi. The complimentary salad an miso was very delicious - still tasted fresh even at the end of day. 

Overall, the warmth and intimate atmosphere, friendly service staff, and amazing offerings were well worth the travel. The chef/owner took the time to talk to his guests, and patiently explained all our inquiries. We had an amazing time and thank you for making our 2 yr anniversary celebration experience, one worth remembering."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh. You can eat sashimi and nigiri here. Rice was good. Seaweed was not the greatest.  Wasabi was descent. Price was very good.  

They offer omakase at 60 - 80 per person and recommend a 24 hr reservation for omakase.  

You don't need a reso to eat here it's not as busy as zen.  Whose location they have taken.  The food was good. The service was slow.  I will return to try the omakase."}
{"text":"Update: 4.5 stars

So I was finally able to come try the dinner omakasa and while the items that we tried were pretty much the same as the lunch omakasa, (which is where they lost my .5 star cost difference $20) where they lacked in variety, they definitely make up for in precision,beauty and consistency. 
Chef Nobu did not disappoint, his creations are always bursting with colours and flavours. 
Tonight we side ordered the spicy lobster roll and the grilled Saba with grapefruit ponzu sauce. 
Both were not only aesthetically pleasing but was bursting with flavour!
The spicy lobster on top of the California roll with yuzu tobiko was the perfect seafood and citrus match. 
The grilled Saba was just amazing. Saba can have a very overwhelming fishy fermented taste/smell. My hubby, who does not like Saba for the that very reason, loved it. The yuzu ponzu sauce got rid of the overwhelming fishy taste and replaced it with a zestful grapefruit, and fresh fish taste. The layers of flavours were amazing on the palate. 
The dessert from the omakasa was a matcha green tea tiramisu with their signature roasted green tea ice cream. My goodness what a matcha!

Am I coming back? My goodness when?!"}
{"text":"You guys! My belly is FULL!!! Nakamori is amazing....really! It's not I. The greatest location because the high quality sushi and ambiance is very...well....something you may expect to find on Queen Street or in Yorkville. We started off with the jerk chicken karaage and it was so flavourful! A tad salty for me but the different flavours just danced so nicely in my mouth. We (2) then shared the sushi and sashimi sampler ($45). It was s filling. No room for dessert :(. Maybe next time because there will be a next time. While the place is fusion-ish, there is great detail still on basic sushi flavours and presentation. I'm so glad this great place is in my area. The service was spectacular. The servers were extremely attentive. The place was not busy but we loved that. Oh and the music is fantastic. I've never heard reggae in a sushi joint but LOVE it! You must try this place."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Everything we ordered was delicious and at a fair price point for the quality."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here. An improvement over the previous restaurant at this location. Very impressed with young chef."}
{"text":"Food quality does not justify the price. We had the seared scallop roll, which wasn't great. The scallop wasn't as sweet as what the price entails.  Chirashi wasn't bad, but at $33, it's pricey for what they served.  Service was somewhat lacking and can be improved. Overall a lackluster experience for our second visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. My wife and I had the $80 and $60 omakase and everything was delicious and imo a great value. The only thing we found was that the jerk chicken karaage was too salty, and dishes were served at quite a leisurely pace. But still not worth dropping a star."}
{"text":"Pros: The chirashi was really fresh and probably the best fish I've ever eaten in my life! The homemade roasted green tea ice cream was also really good. 

Cons: The food took a while to come, and they forgot our order of rolls, but the rolls weren't that amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing food prepared by an amazing person.  Chef Nakamori prepares each dish with love and care.  The quality of food far surpasses anything else in Scarborough.  The food is always fresh, well presented and most importantly tastes amazing!
Went again last night for the new Udon with tempura lobster tail and nearly fell off the chair, thats how good it is.
Do yourself a favour and try this."}
{"text":"I love where I live now but the biggest failure is food in the area. Where I was before there was a great selection of fantastic grub. Here, if it wasn't for Fabbrica (who never let us down) and Black Forest or Canyon Creek for a slab of meat I'd be starving. 
This place opened at Brimley and Eglinton, Japanese food with a twist. Finally today I had the opportunity to try it and was not at all disappointed. I ordered the Omakase for $40 had a sakepolitan and the house Toronto produced sake along with a bottle of sparkling water.  The food was incredibly flavourful and delicious. The salmon ball and the seared beef dishes being my top two choices. I will be going back and encourage friends in the area to check it out. 

Upgrading to a five star because I've been again and it was even better. 
I just wanted to be sure before giving full marks. 
They remembered me from my last visit. Explained my food to me on every dish and made my taste buds quiver with delight. 
I need to drag my food loving pals to this place.  It is not just another all you can eat sushi bar that's popping up every where. The owner prepares your food and serves you and treats you splendidly. This is beautifully thought out, prepared and presented Japanese style the Chef's way. 

It will definitely be my monthly treat to myself. 

New menu items that you must try. Salmon which I don't eat at restaurants due to being picky on prep. It was perfect"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Nakamori, since Zen moved uptown. The ratings here were high so I did have expectations coming in and I'm so glad that they didn't disappoint me at all.  We were seated in a booth, at first I was a bit hesitant as when it use to be Zen, I would always sit at the sushi bar becuz I felt seating at the tables, the quality and service was subpar. I had a preconception but Nakamori didn't have that issue. 

I ordered the seven course Omakase for my friend (as she doesn't drink)  and the Izumi Omakase for myself with sake pairing...the food was the same, we were first served with a mini seafood ceviche taco, mini tomato with boccocini cheese,  it was explained well and the food was delicious. Seafood ginger miso soup was delicious, the taste was bold but it sodium wasn't overpowering. The salmon was what really knocked off the star as the salmon was overcooked and was a bit subpar comparatively. 

Everything else was delicious and the service was great!! Without doubt, I will come back for special occasions and birthdays!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! We ordered the deluxe sushi and sashimi platter, it came with soup and salad as well, which was just the right amount for 2. Green tea was amazing too, definitely not the kind from a tea bag."}
{"text":"If you like Japanese food, treat yourself--this restaurant is worth driving from downtown.  We've been twice for dinner, and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared.  


The Jerk Chicken Wings Karaage is a standout dish--couldn't stop munching their addictive saucy crust.  The braised pork ribs appetizer is equally creative, and a huge serving.


The chef is justifiably proud of the quality of his ingredients and his work and is very welcoming."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to numerous Michelin-starred restaurants in Tokyo, so coming back to Toronto, it has been difficult to satiate those cravings. Thankfully, Nakamori hit the spot. The 7-course omakase was particularly delightful. Light, thoughtful flavours with great depth and complexity. Layers of subtlety result in bites that evolve with character as you eat. Highly recommended, and would return for the miso soup broth alone!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN, NAKAMORI.  YOU'RE TOO SLOW, TOO EXPENSIVE AND TOO UNCOMFORTABLE...AND ONE OF US GOT SICK AFTER.  ENOUGH SAID.  

We came back to Nakamori for a family dinner (6 adults, 3 kids).  Making a reservation for a party of 9 on a Saturday evening was a breeze which was great for us as many restaurants don't take reservations anymore (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, Fratellis, Keg Ajax,...etc).  We wanted the family to try chef Nakamori's \"exciting fusion\" cuisine that he himself had spoken so highly about during our previous dining experience at his sushi bar.  So we decided to give them a try as we were celebrating an early Mother's day.  

First of all, the dining room here really needs some updating.  When you're paying an average of $50+ pp, you expect a certain amount of comfort which Nakamori does not provide.  The space looks almost exactly the same as when it used to be Zen.  With the amount of money their patrons spend here, I think they could afford to invest some of it back into a better dining experience?  I'm not looking for anything fancy but chairs and tables that don't wobble would be a good start.  Since we were a large party (for the size of this restaurant), we were seated along one wall of the restaurant with our table extending right out to the restaurant's entrance which was less than desirable.  

Then came the excruciatingly slow service.  I could see at least 3 servers in the dining room which had at most 30 patrons dining in and they could not manage the room.  We had to take the lead on ordering our drinks and food which came out erratically and painfully slowly.  We ordered some sushi and sashimi that came out first.  The appetizers (jerk chicken karaage, fish and chips, duck hotdog on a bao) took a good 30 min to arrive.  The rest of the mains (chirashi, Yuan salmons, wasabi steak, teriyaki chicken and beef curry) came out over the course of next hour.  We had to remind our server that two of the entrees (teriyaki chicken and beef curry) were still not out after almost 1.5 hours.  My beef curry was one of the last to arrive and I couldn't understand why it would take them almost 2 hours to make this dish.  There were 6-7 small, over-cooked steak pieces swimming in a dark curry sauce which I could have sworn came from one of those pre-made curry cubes you can buy at any Asian grocery stores.  I'm pretty sure they don't start making the curry from scratch when the order is placed?  Other mains, such as salmon and steak (both cooked to rare without asking for our preference) still took them over an hour to make.  The food was not bad, just nothing special.  Our mom who had the salmon that was cooked too rare got sick later on that evening and spent a tiresome night battling stomach cramps.   

After spending $450 on a meal that was just ok for most part, made our mom sick, wasting 2.5 hrs battling challenges with the servers and being stared down by a line of patrons waiting for their tables (thanks to how our table was set up), I have come to a conclusion that I will never return to eat here again.  

Dining out is not just about the food but also the entire experience of comfort, service and good food.  Nakamori misses the mark on at least 2 of those and that's not good enough."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem run by chef Nobu and family in Scarborough. For true Japanese homestyle with Scarborough inspired fusion elements- you can't go wrong here, no matter what you try 

Omakase menu and Izumi sake tasting options are also available for a deeper experience."}
{"text":"I don't know this area very well, so I used my yelp app to look for a good lunch spot and came across Nakamori. I'm glad I did! It's easy to miss as the sign is not very large. Basically, it's in a small plaza on the SE corner of Eglinton and Danforth (next to a spa called \"Temptation\"... gotta love Scarborough!). 

It was not busy on a weekday around lunchtime, so service was really polite and attentive and the food came out relatively quickly (keeping in mind this is a slightly more upscale place, not your typical budget sushi in and out joint). 

I went for the daily bento lunch for $25. It was a lot of food and a good variety. I couldn't finish everything! It came with miso soup, salad (not your typical iceberg lettuce and over-sweet dressing... it was baby arugula with crispy fried tofu), sashimi, 4 pieces of nigiri, tempura, chicken terriyaki, and a Japanese version of caprese salad (with some yuzu which added such a nice flavour!). Nothing too out of the ordinary, but the fish was melt-in-your-mouth fresh, and the quality of the ingredients they use is evident. The only disappointment was the tempura which was a bit too heavy/oily. 

They do have some interesting sounding fusion-y items on the menu, like a Chicken Terriyaki made with jerk spices. I'm also curious to go back and try their omakase. 

The chef came out at the end to see how I liked the food. Also, their green tea is really good. I felt like I was in Japan again. They serve it in those fancy cast iron teapots and cups. 

Overall, a peaceful spot with good mid-range Japanese food in an unexpected location!"}
{"text":"I went there twice.

My first experience was awesome. Decent and delicate food with pleasant presentation. Japanese waitress is very polite and friendly. The restaurant owner came to say hi as well. It was a perfect dining experience.


However my second experience was very bad. The quality of food was still good but it took forever to came. Waiter got attitude, because we didnt order a lot this time (i ate before joining the dinner)"}
{"text":"Nakamori has become my new go to place in Toronto. It has it all, great flavours and good prices. The menu at first glance is not your typical Japanese fare. The chef defiantly embraces local seasons and Toronto vendors.
I went in a group of 5 people. And just to make it clear I am Japanese and I know what good innovative Japanese food tastes like. This restaurant isn't zen, and in my opinion there are many great zen like Japanese restaurants in Toronto now. So Nakamori is such a fresh breath of air. 
We started off with the spicy salmon and tuna tempura roll ($15). And I'm a huge fan of spicy salmon and this roll definitely did not disappoint. I loved the watermelon radish and yuzu. Such a fragrant and delicious roll.
We had the dynamite roll next ($14). Not your typical dynamite roll, it was so unorthodox (not that there's anything orthodox about a dynamite roll) but it was simply amazing. You get 5 rolls with 5 huge tiger shrimp. I've never seen a whole shrimp tempura per person in a dynamite roll. 
Then We moved onto a bunch of starters. There's so much soul put into the kitchen menu. We had the kumato caprese ($8) just decadent. Then the agedash tofu ($7) which I must say was done just right. The fried outside thick and crispy with the sauce perfectly seasoned. Then the seafood ceviche tacos ($11). 3 tacos (salmon,tuna and scallop) possibly one of my favourites on the menu. I love ceviche and this one just had the right acidity to it. Then we had the jerk chicken karage ($7) not too spicy which is exactly how I like my jerk chicken. And such an interesting take on karage because as much as the jerk seasoning was evident it still tasted Japanese to me. Then we had this soy braised pork that's been braised for 8 hours. The meat literally fell off and still makes my mouth water. 
We finished off with their sake kasu cake ($9). It was the first time I've had it since Japan so I had to have it. And it ended being my favourite dessert in a Toronto Japanese restaurant. It also came with a scoop of green tea ice cream. If you've never had sake kasu cake you're in for a treat. It's slightly similar to cheese cake but less heavier and deeper in flavour. I would defiantly recommend the cake even if you're stuffed after dinner. 

I will be returning back to Nakamori's very soon. It's still a new restaurant with some kinks to work out, but those kinks are definitely not in the menu. I was very impressed with everything that I ate. Also Nakamori has a sake exclusively from Izumi (the distillery sake company) and I typically hate sake, but we tried the Nakamori sake ($48) and I must say that I would order it again. It was very similar to a Riesling white wine, very smooth. And I'm also glad to see local restaurants supporting local venders."}
{"text":"This is probably my best lunch in 2016: so good you'd slap your sensai for it. I came after reading \"Chowhound\" East-end expert \"Googs\" call it her new favorite place in Scarborough. The space has lost a little of its cozy ambiance from when Zen occupied this space (more open now), but the fusion dishes here make the place worthy of its predecessor. 

The \"jerk chicken karaage with mango aioli\" appetizer would be a meal in itself and is a must-have if you come for lunch OR dinner. 

The sushi rolls are equally inventive. I recognized the maki and the California rolls, but the unrecognizable ones were real stars, showcasing some real talent by the sword-wielding chef. 

Earlier reviews noted the lunch bento was $21, which is a better fit with my lunch budget then today's price of $25, but it was a very filling meal, making it still a great value with lots of variety: teriyaki, tempura (I LOVED those shrimp with green sauce - can't believe another reviewer complained about these), veggies, sashimi and on and on. 

No room for desserts this trip, but photos here on Yelp look great. The sake menu also looked great for a dinner here, but this summer heat has me sleepy enough after lunch without sake."}
{"text":"We are on vacation in Toronto and we do not know where to eat.
We found this restaurant thru YELP. We do not know what to expect but the reviews are encouraging so we decided to try.
And boy!!!!! This restaurant is simply worth going back again and again. We were here last oct 26 and came back again in the 28th. On each occasions we tried different items on the menu and we were satisfied, all were very good.
Exceptional are the grilled octopus salad and the spicy lobster California.
The price is worth the taste.
The location, simple and clean.
The staff, very pleasant and friendly.
Surely will come back whenever we're in Toronto.
Love this restaurant.
(I don't normally write reviews but this time  I just have to, I have very high appreciation for this restaurant)"}
{"text":"I had an AMAZING dinner here... And I don't even like seafood.

I went for the five course omakase back in March (this review is 3 months late) and each dish was so perfectly satisfying. There was a plate of appetizers, miso fish soup, beef on rice, chicken and shrimp, a sushi platter, and brownies with ice cream for dessert. Apologies for my underwhelming description-- please see pictures instead.

The mackerel was too fishy for me, but everything else I enjoyed much more than I expected to. This is very high praise coming from someone who normally avoids seafood.

The food was delicious, presentation was great, ambiance was great, service was attentive and food delivery was well paced. Nakamori is a wonderful option for special occasions and I would definitely love to go again."}
{"text":"When i went in i had the feeling I was back in Tokyo in a sushi bar, the atmosphere was perfect, staff was really polite, and the sushi was some of the best iev had around.  Definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you; this place is great.  The food prepared by Chef Nakamori is both unique and delicious.   He adds his personal touch to each dish.  Not just another sushi spot, but a very special place.  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars **
I came here with high expectation based on the good reviews on Yelp. My review is based on my recent visit during lunch time. 

Good - 

Very attentive service. Since I had children with me and the staff even brought some ice to cool down the boiling hot water for them. I really appreciated their consideration. 

Chef was very creative on the dish. Since the neighbourhood has different ethnic groups, his dishes were Japanese fusion, e.g. Jerk chicken Karaage ($8).   We enjoyed this appetizer very much. 

House made ice cream ($4 per scoop) was very delicious! That is the best matcha and Roasted brown tea ice cream I had in Toronto so far. I would come back just for the dessert. 

Presentation of dishes were aesthetic which was standard for authentic Japanese restaurants. 

Teriyaki chicken on rice ($15) - we opted for no jerk spice from the original menu. The chicken was grilled nicely. 

Average -
Veg Tempura ($9) - the batter was thick; the sauce was not flavourful. My child commented it was just okay. 

Lunch sushi roll ($17) and sushi Nigiri ($18) - freshness of fish was just okay. The tuna in the roll looked a little too red and texture was meshy. The sushi rice was just okay. 

Price is on the high side especially in this neighbourhood. For this price range, I would expect better quality sushi and rolls."}
{"text":"First time here at the previous Zen Location. I have tried Zen's chirashi and thought it was only ok for such a highly regarded sushi restaurant. This Chirashi was surprisingly good and authentic. With lots of options. Glad they have amberjack, scallops, squid, and octopus as they are my favourites fishes."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends to try the $80/person Omakase.  Was really looking forward to it as the only other time I've tried an Omakase was in Seattle and it left a very favourable impression on me. 

From my brief understanding and experience, Omakase loosely translates to \"chefs choice\".  This is great, I'm all for leaving it up to the chef to be creative and make up some dishes.  

Had I known this Omakase meant the chef picking dishes off the menu and giving you a sample, I would have probably not tried this option.  The restaurant is a small space located in an area where you would not expect to find a high-rated sushi restaurant.

First dish, a sampling plate consisting of 1 ceviche taco (can order on the menu $14, probably comes in threes), an Asian Caprese salad and a spicy salmon ball...tasty, artistic presentation but doesn't leave a wow factor.  I don't get the Asian Caprese salad.  It had tomatoes, mozz cheese, and *maybe* mint to replace basil but still tasted like a Caprese.  I would probably not order this if it was on the menu simply because I could go to an Italian restaurant and get a far better version.  Just like I would probably not go to an Italian restaurant to order a sushi roll.

Second dish, Seafood Ginger Miso Soup...very tasty miso soup with a hint of ginger that doesn't overpower but is enough to balance and add another level of flavour.  But again, it seems like you can order this dish off the menu for $7.

Third dish, Wasabi Beek Steak...available off the menu ($29)

Fourth dish,  Jerk Chicken Karaage (one piece) and Wasabi Tempura Prawn (one piece).  The jerk chicken was very tender and moist, well seasoned and packed with flavour.  But again...you can order this off the menu as an app for $9.

Fifth dish, a plate of assorted sashimi (fewer pieces) and sushi.  There was uni, fish roe, Japan salmon, mackerel, tuna, octopus and yellowtail (hamachi).  While most of the stuff on here were quite tasty, there weren't any fish you couldn't get at other restaurants and you can also order this off the menu too.

Sixth dish was dessert of cookie dough ice cream and green tea tiramisu.  These two were both quite delicious.  

With the spacing of the meal it was enough to eat but we were still hungry after so we ordered the sushi and sashimi combo...which had all the fish we just ate with the Omakase.

When you factor all this in plus one beer, taxs and tips, our bill came very close to $500.00 for a group of 4. 

Here's the thing, I really believe we could have ordered most of the food off the regular menu and paid HALF the price.  This Omakase, for the price they charge, leaves A LOT to be desired.  The other food that you can't order...well, to be honest, I wouldn't have miss it...okay fine, the dessert was pretty spectacular.  

The service wasn't terrible but wasn't memorable either.  You would expect the waiters to know their dishes pretty well for an Omakase but several times we had to ask, \"what are we eating, again\"?  and then met with, \"it's probably salmon, let me check.  (comes back) Yeah, it's salmon\".  The other times, the waitress had a thick accent and it was difficult to understand most of what she was saying.  I know she's trying, I don't fault her for that.  She did, however, a great job making sure out tea pot was constantly filled.  

You go to sushi restaurants because you want to try their fish; that's my staple for what makes a great sushi restaurant.   There weren't any fish on the menu or part of the Omakase that you could not get at other sushi restaurants of similar quality.  

It's a nice restaurant but it doesn't justify the insane prices it charges."}

Food:5/5
The food was simply great. I ordered the chirashi  bowl. It had two each of the following items: egg, shrimp, scallop, mackerel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, one eel and one surf clam. Everything was fresh, beatifully presented and tasted delicious. The yellowtail and mackerel were my favourite. The salmon also stood out. I normally don't like salmon sashimi because I find it too \"normal\" but the salmon here tasted much better than the usual salmon sashimi.

After dinner we had unique flavored ice cream. Roasted green tea for me and Miso for my fiance. The roasted green tea was epic. It tasted like green tea ice cream with a smokey roasted flavor added. If you've ever had chatime's roasted milk tea, you know the smokey roasted flavor I'm referring too. The Miso ice cream was also very good. It tasted like salted caramel with Miso mix added for flavor. Both flavors were made from scratch in house. Overall, great food experience.

Service: 5/5
Service was amazing! When we walked in we were greeted with smiles from the hostess and the Sushi Chef. We had two waitresses help us and both were very polite, helpful and got anything we needed without any hassle at all. My fiance asked for half a lime and they brought us half a lime, a sauce bowl, and a small lime/orange hand juicer in case we wanted to use it.

While eating our desert, one waitress and chef Nakamori came over to ask us how everything was. They also explained where they got ingredients for the ice cream. Chef Nakamori even stuck around to chat with us for a while without imposing on our meal.

Cleanliness: 5/5
The place was very clean. No problems with hygiene at all. In particular, the washrooms were spotless. The building is a little older so I expected the worst but I was pleasantly suprised. It looked like I was the first one ever to use it.

Definately I will be going back. I highly recomend trying at least once."}

This review is based on my lunch experience at Nakamori. 

Bento Box ($25) which is a lunch special offerings has a lot of food:
- miso soup and salad
- sashimi
- bento box: Tempura+Chicken Teriyaki+4 pc of sushi

I enjoyed most of the elements aside from the heavily batter tempura with the sauce 

Home Made Hojicha Ice Cream ($4) was the highlight of my lunch with creamy and full of roasted tea taste!

There is a charge for green tea ($2) but worth the cost as it was served in a nice cast iron tea pot and with nice aroma.

$40 Omakase during lunch seems reasonable with 24 hours reservation notice but I would ask the chef to skip tempura

It is worth giving Nakamori a try if you are in the neighbourhood and wants some decent Japanese food. Nakamori is probably your only choice around here."}
{"text":"Given my wife is Japanese we always love to try new Japanese restaurants.   Nakamori takes over the space previously occupied Zen Sushi which moved to Markham.  While the fish was fresh, that is about the only positive we have.  The wife got the sampler ($21, 7 nigiri, 1 maki of your choice) I got the spider roll ($16)
1) Given they inherited a turnkey operation from Zen, the ambiance and decor were very disappointing.   Someone decided to paint the walls white and do a poor job.  The rug was not cleaned and was coming up.   Why mention?   It just opened, some renovations could easily have been done.   
2) The waitresses did not know their product.   I am no sushi expert, but I can get the terms down.  
3) The price was exorbitant for the portion size.   Sushi is all about the rice!  The portion of rice with the nigiri had a tiny portion of rice and some of the fish atop was actually coming off when served.  That is two strikes for presentation and preparation.    
4) The maki is tiny also, again the rice was not what one would expect.  The tuna scrapings within showed the chef was trying to conserve resources.
5) My spider roll was cut so thin per piece, it was clear they were trying to stretch out the presentation.   Having stated that, the roll was falling apart.  Definitely fake crab (I expected that).   For $16 not worth it even at $8.
6)  No self-respecting Japanese would ever serve a meal without miso.   Think Italians without the bread (or maybe pasta without the sauce).   You get the picture.
7)  Bathrooms need an overhaul.   Again, I realize they are new, but they took over for Zen and Zen was top notch, perhaps the best in Toronto.
8) Slow service.  They place was practically empty.   
9)  Japanese traditions like 'slippers' were not respected.   BTW, the slipper cubby holes from Zen where still at the entrance.   Fail!
10)  Menu very short. 
11)   Being a Japanese restaurant with Japanese staff, a doumo arigatou gozaimashita at the end of the meal is warranted.   Given my wife spoke Japanese to them, definitely a requirement.   

All in all, major disappointment.   Will not return or recommend!"}
{"text":"Toronto is food heaven! Strongly recommend Nakamori, food is soooo artsy, fresh and yummy, they grow some of the veggies in house and cut them in front of you to put it in your dish! They put cumin on chicken karaage and fresh floral peddles on salad and dessert. And there's no lineup for now cuz its newly opened"}
