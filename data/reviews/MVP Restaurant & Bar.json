{"text":"Loads of TVs. They show all the games and PPVs. Friendly staff and very accommodating owner, Brendan, who puts the sport you are interested in on the TV by your table. Reasonable drink prices and great pizza from the in house oven. The place to watch sports on Cresent!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to sit at the bar and watch a game.  I enjoyed myself there to get a little tipsy then hit the night life. Overall I recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the game.  Place was pretty empty when we got there.  Prices are decent and place is filled with TVs.  I got the all dressed pizza and poutine.  Staff was slow and overworked but was friendly. Love the popcorn they provided."}
{"text":"I had one of teh worst Pizza's of my life there- so bad that i ate around the bland sauce and the flavorless meat to eat the crust. I also had 2 pitchers, neither of which was a full pour,  of beer. my total tab was 75$. I checked my pants to make sure I wasnt given a handjob and had forgotten.   Worst sports bar in the city and would never recommend it."}
{"text":"MVP is a large sports bar, if the name didn't tip you off to that fact.  Pretty standard bar/pub food at a decent price.  They also do drink specials on game nights, which are always nice to take advantage of.  Plenty of TVs, lots of space, decent service.  All the makings of a decent place to grab a brew and catch a game.  It's located on Crescent however, which means it will definitely fill up on weekends... but that should go without saying."}
{"text":"Walking on Cresent street in Montreal, this was the only place that had vacant seating outside.  It was a gorgeous spring day and a couple of us just wanted to chill with some cold brews on a lively street.  Im rating this place 3 stars based on the experience and not the food or restaurant quality.  Beer was a little warm (like every place we went to in Montreal) and we were served midget wings.  Prices were above average, but I can understand with their location.  Overall, our server was gorgeous and very nice to us which made this place enjoyable.  The owner needs to give her a huge raise."}
{"text":"I had Coors Light here and nothing off the menu.  First off I did not like that my boyfriend's pina colada was served in a martini glass, although he didn't seem to mind, I felt he got less drink for our money.  The Coors Light was Coors Light .  When we first got to MVP there was one other patron that I could see who was sitting at the bar, but still we waited what felt like a life time.  Total tourist trap $6.00 Coors Light Draft bar. Nothing else to say here"}
{"text":"I was pointed to this bar as an excellent \"quiet\" place to watch the FA Cup final and it didn't disappoint. Perfect for an afternoon viewing of a soccer match."}
{"text":"Giant spot ...3 floors of draaankin and eatin.  Small 2nd floor terrace  Smaller 3rd floor terrace  $8 vodka sodas  Great burger and fries.  Seriously...they eat burgers in French Canada?!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in Montreal over the weekend and we went down to rue Crescent the first night. After going into a few bars down the strip, we ended up at MVP. We absolutely loved the atmosphere, the food, and the drinks. The waitress was so sweet and she went out of her way to cater to us. The drinks were very well done as well. Will definitely be coming back here next time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I am here for a conference from the states. The beer selection is average. The burger was good and the Mac and cheese was great. The atmosphere was good for what I was looking for: a laid back sports pub for a bite and a few beers. The only problem $41 for a burger and 2 beers. WTF"}
{"text":"Je donne un 1 sur 5 pour le peu de présence du français et du non respect de la loi 101. Le menu est écrit en genre de franglais mais c'est sous entendu que l'anglais est priorisé par le personnel et le propriétaire malgré que la majorité des clients sont francophones. Les serveuses te regardent d'une façon méprisante et parlent dans ton dos quand tu demande un service en français. La nourriture est quand même bonne mais le service est mauvais et lent. Le prix est relativement élevé et la bière est un peu tiede."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Let's start with the good...the Fries are AMAZING!    It's all downhill after that. I could not understand why the place was empty the first two periods of a Habs playoff game ....but now I do. They served burnt popcorn.....really?   My buddy sent back French Onion soup food that tasted like a bowl of salt.  He also found a piece of lettuce (from the dishwasher I guess) in his glass of water....serious?? I sent back my Cajun Chicken that tasted like it was rolled in the Dead Sea - it was disgustingly salty. Simply put, they take no care in the food they serve and it's totally bad.  Our waitress tried hard to keep us happy (we are not complicated guys) but the food was horrible. This place needs Gordon Ramsey to show them how to cook."}
{"text":"Good ambiance for a sports bar, food SUCKS! I've seen enough to finally make a generalization I guess - DON'T order a sandwich or burger at a Canadian restaurant. They all suck at making them. Instead, go with a pasta and wine the french way."}
{"text":"We were driven to this place since it showed a lot of curb appeal as a sports bar. Yes, it is one. The walls are decked out with memorabilia and it's an awesome place to watch a hockey game for sure. The bar tender was very friendly and fast in getting us some drinks and good service.   For some reason-the place just seemed dead for a Saturday night, especially during game 7 of the western conference finals. There were two large groups in the seating area who added to the chill atmosphere, but it appeared that they were eating food that wasn't even from MVPs kitchen. There was no music playing and barely any sound coming from the TVS that played the game. it seemed that our bartender was the only one working. I can't personally vouch for the food but the service was exceptional.   We left after we finished our drinks, and saw what else crescent had to offer."}
