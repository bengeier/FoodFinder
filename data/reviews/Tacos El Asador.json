{"text":"Soft chorizo taco: The chorizo didn't taste like chorizo to me but the taco was good. 

Soft fish taco: I liked this one better than the chorizo even though I chose the chorizo. 

Overall, I liked the soft taco shell because it didn't taste as store bought as many taco places. There aren't many seats (6-7 picnic tables) but worth a try anyway. Tacos were $3.30 so it made for a good snack for us."}
{"text":"If 'soy-sauce' is authentic 'mexican' sure, enjoy....
The fish burrito was a total let down. After all the hype I was very excited to try this place... But it was over priced for what you got, and nothing special.
The burrito consisted of a mostly (90% no joke) mix of bland rice/beans with one strip of fish buried in the fold of the burrito.
Seriously, I had to OPEN it to make sure I hadn't received the wrong order. My dining partner had 3 pork taco's, which were better... But nothing special.
Rebozos makes better Mexican....and their fish didn't taste like it was seasoned with a packet of soy sauce, left over from another places take out.
Whannnn whannnn. I give it a 'meh' out of ten."}
{"text":"I arrived here before my friend did and so I parked myself on one of the unoccupied benches that serve as dining tables. This was about 6:15ish. After sitting there a little while one of the employees politely asked me if I could get up because other people needed the spot. I understood and went outside and waited out front for my friend. A few minutes later when we both entered and sat down, this same employee apologized profusely. Almost a little too profusely. Clearly this is a man who cares about his customer service.

You can argue over the relative deliciousness of the food here (an argument that is centered around how good it is, rather than IF the food is good) but what is not open to debate is the authenticity of the experience. This place is so Mexican it hurts. After eating here it made me question whether I should see a doctor to check for swine flu. It's that Mexican.

A stop here would be incomplete without a quick crane of your neck up to the tv screens showing Mexican television. When my friend and I ate here we spent most of our time trying to piece together the obscenely convoluted plot of the Mexican soap that was on. 

Little did my friend know, I am secretly in love with her sister while about to be married to her other sister even though that sister spurned my best friend after he got her pregnant. But I am definitely not responsible for the poisoning of her father, that was her jealous uncle who has always wished it was he, not his brother who had married her mother"}
{"text":"Authentic, but I wasn't that impressed. Had the beef and pork, the prok was dry."}
{"text":"As a Salvadore√±o I know how much Pupusas cost and $3.05+tax each is ridiculous!!! Most Restaurants charge $2.50 $2.75 at most! I'm sorry this place is ridiculously over priced"}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh food at a cheap price! This is a tiny place and can get very busy. I recommend for 2 people (4 if you can wait a little). Line up, order at the front, wait to be seated, once you're seated they bring the food to you. Once you're done eating, pay at the cash (they take CASH ONLY). Service is fast and friendly. They also do take-out.

I recommend the shrimp and fish soft shell tacos, but my absolute favourite is the Pupusa (mixed) - it's like a stuffed tortilla pancake with beans and melted cheese on the inside. I will definitely be back for those!"}
{"text":"This place makes absolutely scrumptious South American food. Totally authentic and delicious. They tend to be quite busy, but well worth the wait. A true hidden gem- hole in the wall establishment. Cash only! Only two tables in the place, so I recommend doing take-out."}
{"text":"I was getting tired of pizza and burgers on our visits to Toronto so we asked for a good Mexican place. 

It was a little way out of our way, but once we found it we ordered a little of everything, to sample of course. 
The place was small but was full with customers, and there was a steady stream of people picking up to-go orders. Good sign!
After trying some food, it was ok. I hate store packaged tortillas.  I'm Mexican and for me that's a sign of a \"Taco Bell\" Mexican place. The guys working the counter were Salvadorian not Mexican, close enough I guess. The Salvadorian \"pupusas were very good though. Stick to what you know guys!"}
{"text":"Very authentic, made fresh. This place is the best as far as central american fast food goes. Delicious food, great service, and house-made horchata to boot!

I've been going since I first moved to Toronto at the beginning of 2009. Unfortunately, the place seems to have become quite popular (which is well-deserved).. and the small space is now overrun by 'gringos'.. and you can smell the proverbial stench of unwanted change the hipsters are bringing along with them. 
Still the same great team behind the counter and in the kitchen, though."}
{"text":"Restaurant reviews are usually pretty subjective and really just the opinions of the writer but here are some facts about this place: It's always busy, it's almost always full, and it's often lined up. If you want a nice quiet place, this is not it, there's a steady stream of people coming in for take-out or waiting for tables to come free.  Most places figure out what time business starts to slow down and then close accordingly, this place has to turn people away when it's closing time. You don't stay this busy constantly by having bad food or by being over-priced."}
{"text":"I was in mexico a few years back and ordered a taco sampler platter at a local restaurant. I still dream about one of the tacos I ate there. The waiter couldn't explain what exactly the meat was in the taco and for years I've always wondered what it was.

The other day I went with my fiancee and friend to try this place out and to my surprise I discovered that Tacos El Asador has the type of taco (al pastor) I've been drooling over for years.

The beef tacos weren't that great but the fish, pulled pork and al pastor were all amazing. 

Also, Inca Cola is awesome, especially if you love those banana popsicles they used to sell at Beckers.

It's really tiny so try to avoid going during peak hours."}
{"text":"The staff were not friendly at all ... And their tacos is well over priced ! Wasted my parking fee and my time"}
{"text":"Food *** - Service ** - ambience *

I found their tacos rather mediocre. The GTA has some really fantastic taco places. But i am told by my mexican friends that this place makes food that is closer to being authentic than most other places. I would certainly return for their tacos, simply because it is decent for the cheap price. 

They only take cash which is a bummer.

{"text":"Small space, but wow the food is authentic. Great tacos, great burritos......and you can wash em down with a Dos Equis....awesome. Highly recommended if your a fan of proper traditional Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Easily in my top 3 favourite restaurants in the city. Yes, the location is small, but the food is amazing and the customer service is always great. Recommend Tacos El Asador to anyone looking for a quick bite in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city, I've probably eaten 100 of their shrimps tacos. Try the shrimps tacos. The guy at the counter (the owner?) is the nicest dude too. A bit of a cramped space, but worth it. Just get em to go."}
{"text":"This is a great non pretentious hole in the wall serving good basic tacos. Don't expect a Grand Electric crowd or food though .... it is what it is, namely basic foraging fare in a take out type environment.
If you want a quick cheap bite this place does the job admirably."}
{"text":"I'm lucky that this place is so close to my work. I love heading there for lunch or even if I need a snack during the day. 

Every time I go in there I always get the transitional soft shell taco's in beef or chicken. I'm convinced they are the best. When they give you the food they also give you this great sauce which I usually put a lot on. 

If you are looking for real, authentic Mexican food than this is your place! Just be warned that it is a small place so it gets busy and packed fast. Here is a video I found of the place http://bit.ly/yrcmty"}
{"text":"Did the original owners sell??? The food tonight was not good....the meat was gross verging on Scary! I ordered tacos and a burrito. The guac tasted like onions and a bottle of table salt...YUCK
Typically the food here has consistently been cheap and cheerful YUMMY food. What happened?????"}
{"text":"If you walk down Bloor street from Bathurst to Ossington you will notice one thing...Korea. This pocket contains one of the largest Korean x-pat populations in the world. There is more Korean advertisements then English (by a long shot). And yet some how hidden in Korea Town is arguably the best Mexican joint in Toronto.

I tried a little of everything when I visited El Asador. A pork taco, a chirizo enchilada, a beef quesadilla, and a bean pupusas. The taco, enchilada, and quesdilla were all phenomenal. The pupusas was average (to much dough) but the homemade salsa made up for that. I paid 15$ and was barley able to eat it all.

Toronto has some quality white plate Mexican restaurants but I have been to Mexico twice and stepping into El Asador in my opinion is the best way to be transported straight to DF. Asador is small..very small, the kitchen is almost in full view of the dining area and a few ceiling fans (with that classic subtle wobble) keep the place from being a sauna. My suggestion would be to get your stuff take out and head over to Christie Pits when the weather is nice.

A picnic with tacos? Not typical I know but neither is an unbeatable mexican dive in Korea Town."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Casual vibe and friendly service. Shrimp tacos 4ever."}
{"text":"Not a lot of seating but the service is friendly and the food is fantastic. Best nachos in the city. The burritos are excellent too. Be sure to bring cash as they don't take credit or debit."}
{"text":"Really tasty, great prices and has a very authentic feel. I think there was soy sauce in fish taco, a bit of a surprise - but delicious overall, with fresh fish.  We ordered a bunch of things and then went to Christie Pits, for an impromptu picnic. Made for a really nice meal. 
Dying to go back for the breakfast!"}
{"text":"We go here at every other week.  Food is good &amp; cheap, vibe is casual and pleasant.  My faves are chorizo tacos &amp; chicken tostadas.  Always order a side of plantains &amp; watermelon soda.  Yumm......"}
{"text":"Tucked in the heart of Koreatown at Christie and Bloor is Toronto's best burrito. Perched on the corner of Clinton and Bloor  between dozens of Korean BBQ restaurants and cheap, designer knock-off stores is El Salvadorian eatery, Tacos El Asador.

The d√©cor is minimal with brightly painted picnic tables for seating, TVs mounted in ever corner, an order desk and a few small fridges stocked with beer, water and South American sodas make up the whole restaurant.

The menu includes burritos (chick, veg or beef), soft or hard shell tacos, breakfast, guacamole, soup and salad and chorizo.

In the summer it's tight, sweaty and loud if there's a soccer game on. Place your order at the cash and have a seat. You pay when you're done eating. Meal plus tip, tax and beer works out to $12.

My suggestion: chicken burrito with guacamole and an apple soda. Make sure you try the hot sauce, they make it in-house and it's delicious.

Open 12PM-9Pm daily except Wednesdays and 2PM-6PM on Sundays."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, yet last night was just A-OK (3 stars).

Generally, the main guys at the counter are efficient, friendly, and give great service to anyone waiting in line or at the small tables.

Yesterday the meat was excessively dry - from the Al Pastor to the Chicken, I was dousing the meat with hot sauce to give it some movement from mouth to stomach.  Which, of course, hid the real flavours and only made my mouth and tongue less able to taste.

I must say one thing however: I tried Grand Electric for the first time last week and was absolutely blown away by their tacos.  I understand it's a new place that is kind of 'fusion', and isn't truly Mexican - BUT GOOD MEAT IS GOOD MEAT, and I think anyone dealing with it should do it well.

I will be back, but will order the fish tacos from El Asador only.  They were the best part of what I ordered."}
{"text":"Ive heard so much about the place and have been here twice. I really want to like the food but i find it just lacks salt. the service is great and the place is really cute but the food always seems to lack just the basic seasoning. Otherwise, the quality of the meat is good and the tacos and pupusas are cooked very well. Plus, its amazing value for money"}
{"text":"Love the vibe in this small restaurant. Picnic tables were a nice touch. I had two beef tacos and they were very good. The meat was cooked perfectly! They also brought some extra spicy salsa and jalape√±o toppings, which is cool. I came on a weekday afternoon and there were only two picnic tables occupied, so this is definitely the best time to swing by."}
{"text":"Such a great place for a few quick tacos. Simple, authentic, and oh so tasty, the only downside is how busy and crowded it can get in there. But in the summer I like nothing better than to grab a few tacos and head over to Christie Pits to mao down. I make a point to stop in every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Though restaurants like La Carnita and Grand Electric are all the buzz in Toronto's Central American cuisine, Tacos El Asador offers an authentic and reasonably priced alternative to those hour-wait hot spots...

{"text":"Finger licking good authentic Tex Mex with some added more authentic Latin cuisine like the Papusas. 

This place is good, cheap, too small and stuffy, never open on time, bare essential, great food, simple service, no washroom, hole in the wall type of place that you go to when you just want to stuff yourself with good cheap food regardless of the less than perfect atmosphere. 

Don't go here expecting perfectly clean fast service! Go here for grub a tub tub or better yet, call and get take away so you get the cheap good food without the crap atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had. Very authentic. Reasonably priced. I usually order in advance and eat them in Christie Pitts park with company."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live nearby so we've eaten at Tacos El Asador several times, probably about 7 times in total. We are pretty big fans. We haven't tried all the menu items, but we have developed a \"favourite order\" that is currently:
2 Chrispy Beef Tacos
2 Al Pastor Soft Tacos
2 Chicken Enchiladas
That comes to $20.30 after tax and feeds two people quite well with some nice variety between each dish. Occasionally we'll get a Jarritos but they are way overpriced (they cost $1 each at Wal-Mart at Dufferin Mall).  

The place can be pretty cramped but if you get a table away from the counter it's perfectly fine. Several yelp reviewers felt that Tacos El Asador tacos are too dry. After visiting a few times, this is occasionally true, but more often than not we've found that El Asador tacos are a masterpiece. Remember, applying generous amounts of salsa to your tacos is a must."}
{"text":"A cute place with a homey atmosphere.  I tried the vegetarian food- tacos, burrito and enchiladas all of which tasted good but were similar in taste. Great value - a filling dinner for two came to $20. I would come back here!

Watch out for the bathroom, could have been cleaner."}
{"text":"The guys who work here are great and it's a pleasure to be served by them.
Being latina and growing up in the southwest U.S. I know my Latin American food and Mexican food, very well infact because my family is Salvadoran. 

Burritos are really American, don't go to a Mexican/Salvadoran place for burritos, infact the best place for burritos is probably a place where YOU can customize your own since people are specific about how they like their burrito. Most Toronto places use a lot of fillers like rice and beans or even potato and sweet potato, so know what you like and tell them..but again I wouldn't recommend this place for hardcore burrito people.

Try to go for the Salvadoran dishes or even tacos when you're here, remember this isn't your typical American hole in the wall fast food joint, it's a bit more authentic so they don't use sour cream or tons of cheeses you might expect from a Tex-Mex place. 

Jalapenos, Guacamole and the salsas make everything 10x better. Cash only."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. I've been going here for a decade and I have never had a bad experience. The food is tasty, the service is prompt and the staff are friendly. 

My favourite thing to get is the goat tacos. Over the years I've tried most things on the menu, and they're all tasty. The fried plantain makes a great side. 

I really like how they leave jalape√±os, onions and hot sauce on the table so you can spice things up to your preference. 

The picnic style tables make it feel like a family dinner if you go with friends. It also makes a great quick takeout if you don't want to cook for one."}
{"text":"It is clearly better choice to go there than pay $7 for some chain fast food places.

Pretty reasonable price and taste nice. 
Topping was tasty especially one that green paper and  onion.

People were friendly, I guess the shop is family-run.

I would like to go there again when I visit Korean-town."}
{"text":"Bland, boring food. This place is over-rated."}
{"text":"Reviewing this place makes me feel like the old fart I could so easily become: Tacos El Asador has unquestionably fallen from it's Pre-Yelp-Days status of \"completely awesome\", to a mediocre-at-best joint that is run by the owners' younger generation....for the younger generation. Kids, your burritos are filled with filler....and the prices are higher for lower quality.

Long ago...even ten years ago...this place was run by the whole family: Mom and Pop did the cooking, Gramma sat on a stool in the back making pupusas, and the brothers minded the counter....and the food was freakin' AWESOME. Chicken burritos were made with -- get this -- CHICKEN. Not a combination of mostly beans & rice + a bit of bird....but actual chicken. Pupusas were made not just with higher quality ingredients, but with the loving touch of an old El Salvadorian grandmother, who would churn out quality pupusas like nobody's business. Everything else on the menu was kick-ass as well. And cheap. 

Tacos El Asador was our go-to \"gotta eat cheap\" place long ago....and the only reason I returned (after hearing about the brothers taking over) was that Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu across the street had a line out the door...

The bottom line is that the owners, as nice as they are, are banking on people who don't know any better, and who thinks they're getting a good deal on good food. Meh. It's your choice."}
{"text":"great 
please buy next door and extend your dinig room"}
{"text":"I really love this place - the food's delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed. My favorites are the veggie soft tacos and the spicy black bean soup."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and definitely one of my favourite spots for cheap eats. The staff are also very nice and the vibe is laid back. It can get very busy, but it generally doesn't take long to get a table if so."}
{"text":"Love the vibe here, and the tacos. The fish tacos are amazing, and the veggie burrito, at $4.70 for a big-sized burrito, is one of the best deals in the city."}
{"text":"Cramming myself into the tight spaces of Tacos El Asador makes me wonder if the owner visits Seven Lives and thinks \"they should put five more picnic tables in here!\""}
{"text":"tacos are great. very good salsas. would not recommend papusa, was bland and just meh. still prefer 7 lives tho!"}
{"text":"Although I like the vibe of this place with its tiny size, Spanish language soap operas and picnic benches, I have to say that the food is only so-so.

Tacos - frankly a bit bland, and I partially blame the fact that they double up on the corn tortilla (which I know is authentic), meaning that there is way too high tortilla to meat ratio. The meat was decently flavoured (I tried the tinga and the al pastor) but a bit dry and the hot sauce could have been more boldly flavoured. 

Pupusas - much better than the tacos and worth the extra 5 minute wait. 

The biggest plus here is the price - as you can get a solid meal and a drink for less than $10.

In short, this place is worth stopping into if you're in the neighbourhood, but if you want more flavourful and authentic tacos you're better off heading down to Kensington and hitting up El Trompo (best in the city in my opinion) or the back of Perola's grocery store (where tacos and pupusas are made over a hot plate)."}
{"text":"The staff here are very friendly and it's a great location (near Christie Pitts park). I have only tried the tacos on their menu but they are fantastic! Looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Walking into this place feels like being in local small restaurant in a tiny village in the South of Mexico.  The walls are painted a tacky colour, and either tvs are blasting in Spanish, or some really bad Latin pop is playing, while all the staff speak Spanish loudly between themselves...but in a strangely satisfying way.  It all adds to the overall experience.

The food is simple and authentic.  You're not going here for some magical culinary adventure, but for traditional Mexican tacos, tamales, or whatever else 

The only thing that I have never liked are the hours.  Half the tacos that were fed to me in Mexico were at 2am, because that's when a lot of this food is meant to be consumed.  Yet, this Tacos El Asador closes at 9pm....definite disconnect here.  Also, they serve breakfast, which is delicious, by the way, yet only open some time after noon.  I say some time, because I have yet once to see them open at the time written on their door."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing food. The tortilla's are delicious, best taco's I've had in the city. The pupusa's are also excellent. The chorizo burrito is great comfort food. Service is always friendly, and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about El Asador.  I've been eating here for a year and a half and every single time I've left satiated and happy.  The food is delicious, fresh, affordable, and consistent.  The staff is amazingly friendly. 

I've tried both the Mexican cuisine and the El Salvadorian cuisine and I'm not a great fan of the El Salvadorian cuisine.  It doesn't mean it's not good, I just prefer the Mexican.  The crispy pork taco is one of my faves, and the guacamole and salsa are a staple for me.  If you've never tried Mexican Cola, I recommend you do.  It tastes like coke married root beer and beget this divine pop.

Asador is almost always packed, but you won't have to wait long for a table.  If it's a nice summer day, you can order take out and dine in Christie Pits.

I don't usually give out a 5 star rating but El Asador has been so consistent, it deserves it."}
{"text":"Although the place very small, only takes cash and only one person can understand English, I go here quite often. I love their chicken plate, loaded with huge pieces of seasoned chicken, rice, salad and tortillas. Their homemade salsa is amazing and I love how onions and jalape√±os are always accompanied with your meal. The service can be quite slow but the wait is worth every bite. Also love how it's in Korea town so I can add kimchi to my tacos"}
{"text":"Let me start by just saying that if you are a fan of onions and spice, you will LOVE this place. They started each table off with a bowl of hot sauce and a bowl of an onion and jalapeno salad.

You were hit with the sweet taste of chopped onions after each bite into the fish burrito. The burrito was a good size and eating it was like digging my way through a tunnel of deliciousness. The texture of the fish was perfect and by the end of it, I was still craving more. One of the things I notice about the burritos here were that it wasn't dry at all from the rice.  Each piece of rice was comfortably cushioned in between the guacamole and bean sauces.

Overall, I would say that this place offers a great experience in Mexican cuisine and would be perfect for a late night meal. The burritos were only $7.50, and they sure filled me up for the entire night!"}
{"text":"Everyone I know who comes here loves it! It's rustic and small, but the energy is huge. The food is really delicious and SO cheap. I had a big meal for under $10! Including tip! I highly recommend!!! A must-try."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and price. If you want a great burrito and for it to be reasonably priced..I always digest better..anyway, already lineups outside especially good weather.  I go early or wait."}
{"text":"I went here with high hopes and was really let down.  The ambiance is cool, nice and informal, like a family kind of place, and the picnic tables were packed.  Usually a good sign.

My friend and I ordered a variety of tacos, a tamale, and a pupusa, and everything looked real authentic, but was pretty bland without salsa.  The al pastor was pretty good, though, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars, and since I live in the neighborhood I'll actually probably hit them up for some al pastor tacos sometime again, but yeah.  Way overhyped.  The fact that this won as NOW Magazine's best Latin restaurant is pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"Yummy food and awesome friendly staff! But eating there in the summer is hard cause they have no ac and it gets HOT in there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Whenever bf and I are in ktown we always drop by for something to eat. Great prices, great food, just don't forget to bring cash!

Because I am currently sick, we came in yesterday and ordered 4 chicken homemade soups (yes 4, 2 for takeout), fish tacos and a chicken quesadilla. For me, their soup ALWAYS stands out because I've never had anything so rich in natural flavour, it's hearty and made with lots of love. By the end of the night I had finished all the soup with ease. 

It was my first time ordering the fish tacos and quesadillas, but it did not disappoint. The fish tacos ($3.50 +tax for 2) were SO GOOD, I wish we had ordered more. I also wish I had some right now."}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy. I had the chicken burrito. He had something else. The burrito was passable. The attitude of the owners reminded me of the Latin guys who would try to pick up any female who would come to salsa at Babaloos. Rico Suave attitude towards the women that's simply corny. And a sense of derision and competition towards the men. Buddy and I each bought things that were in the $5 range and his came to about $10. He was too polite to object so I did. Supposedly it was due to the Mexican can of pop he had purchased. It was about $3.50. They said it was expensive because it was imported. I get pop from Turkey and it cost the same as pop from Canada. Makes no sense that Mexican pop would be so expensive. Seemed that they were overcharging as they wished. Ridiculous. Won't be going there again and I certainly don't recommend it to anyone.  

P.S. My Mexican buddy invited us over to his place and the food he prepared was tons better."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and wicked tacos. Much better than all the overpriced places scattered throughout the city."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall. I didn't expect this place to be this small in terms of the seating area and also a very crowded seating area. There were no where to stand to wait for the food but this doesn't stop people from coming. Don't dress fancy or bring big purses as there is no where to put it. This place was packed and we were already here during the later hours of lunch. But the food was good, very authentic. The nachos platter was awesome, with lots of avocado, cheese, sour cream, salsa. The side of hot sauce and chilli was extremely hot, my Indian friends said so and I do not dare to try it.

I also had the pull pork taco, there was so much stuff in it, was spilling everywhere, very messy meal so not a place to go on a date! But we didn't care, licking our fingers to get all the sauce of goodness into our stomachs. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I went here tonight, seeking out tamales. (Our 5 1/2 year old wanted to try them.) It was great! The pulled pork tacos and guacamole were especially good, but we liked everything we ordered. Cash only, super cramped, as others have said, but a quick turnover at the tables."}
{"text":"Great, authentic mexican is hard to comeby in Toronto and this place is not too shabby. I have had the tacos (obviously) and the front runners are really the al pastors. I remember the guacamole being decent and the tamales I did not care for. Good spot for a quick taco fix, but there is much better popping up in the city."}
{"text":"Tiny little taco shop with a great casual atmosphere (i.e. Latino soaps playing on TV), great food, and friendly service.  Not crazy about the soft tacos - I've never been a corn tortilla fan - but the enchiladas and tamales are excellent."}
{"text":"Tacos are well worth the visit.  Try crispy! You get a choice of meats, or shrimp, and they're served in double shells. Accompanying them are hot sauce and sliced onions and jalape√±os.  The seating is a bit small and tends to be full at peak times, but its worth it.  Note, these are el Salvador owners, so flavor profile different than Mexican, try the other dishes on menu including the bean soup!"}
{"text":"ok for the price, authentic mexican food, got the soft taco and enchilada nothing special. the place is tiny, around 2-3 picnic tables, the service is friendly, the portions are kinda small. apparently the nacho's are really good, so might go back for a try. 
we were sort of kicked out right after we were done eating, i guess with a space that small, they can't have ppl hanging around when there're ppl waiting to eat their food. i'd say the small cramped space is overwhelming, so take out is def the better option. 
have to add - i'm not a fan of mexican food, but liked this place. 
must try: burrtos & nachos - around $7-8 per person."}
{"text":"Solid taco joint. Not fancy or overly clean. Both soft and hard shells are good. Self-serve beer fridge is on the bar. If you are in an adventurous mood, try the menudo soup which has tripe, kidney, liver, beans in a spicy tomato broth."}
{"text":"Crazy busy when I went (around 7pm on a tuesday). Had to stand around and wait for a while before a table freed up. Had a pork soft taco, a chorizo soft taco, and a squash pupusa. Not bad at all, but nothing to write home about. The meat in both tacos was a little dry. The salsa was good though. Drenched them in that. I think my expectations were maybe higher than they should have been given the crowds. Friendly service, although they never brought the beer we ordered. Nice and cheap. If I go again I'll definitely be trying a burrito. They looked a bit better than what I ordered. Not too big but mostly full of meat. Anyway. A-OK. In order from worst to best: Street Taco in San Francisco - this place - La Taqueria in Vancouver - basically anywhere in Mexico or Central America. Just in case that helps."}
{"text":"Old school but reliably good
Messy burritos with more meat than toppings, isn't that how it should be anyway?
Fair prices, great food. Can't wait to see the new place across the street. Hoping for more seating because really that's my only complaint"}
{"text":"Friendly hole-in-the wall serving comfort food. 
Their fish tacos are my fave. Some of the others a touch dry. No attempt to steer away from the traditional, which is fine by me, as there are lots of places already doing that in TO."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place any time I have a craving for tacos.  I've tried almost all the taco joints in the downtown core, yet I keep coming back to tacos el asador time and time again.  They've moved to a new bigger location across the street and it's definitely nicer to have more space to sit.  The service is always very friendly.  The food is awesome - there isn't anything I've tried on the menu that I didn't like.  My favourite tacos are the goat taco (they sometime sell out of this) and the cripsy chicken taco. Oh!  And ask for the hot sauce and the onions & jalapenos."}
{"text":"The taco is so dry. Why? 

It's so packed. Why? 

What a weird world we live in here in Toronto, right? 

El Jacal is much, much better. Even Mexitaco is far superior. Go west young tacophile!

My friend says that the soup is good. Which soup? Dunno. 

If you like this place and have ever been to any part of the world with decent tacos then I am going to have to seriously reevaluate my whole thing. Honestly, everything will be changed if you read this and say anything other than: \"It's true, I love their tacos, but I've never had a taco in any city that had any kind of taco reputation, and the words \"taco reputation\" also mean nothing to me so I am very surprised that I just used them\" then I will have to start back at square one. I'm prepared; are you?"}
{"text":"This is a great authentic Mexican joint.  I went last night, grabbed a table before going in line, and was very impressed with the friendly service and food.  The ambiance is pretty authentic Mexican too.  
I only wish they had a smaller (read:cheaper) side of guac to go with my $5 burrito..."}
{"text":"you'll be hard pressed to find solid mexican food in Canada. Thank you"}
{"text":"Best chicken burrito ever. The whole restaurant is tacky and gross, a whole in the wall, but it's one of those places that is purposely ugly and makes great food. Hang in there. The hot sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"I'll keep my review simple because the place is fairly simple, in a good way.  
Great little place to eat.  Food is fresh and well made.  Prices are great and you can grab a couple of items.  Service is quick."}
{"text":"Authentic and amazing food, friendly service. Don't get upset there may be no seats because they do get busy- just means they are that good!"}
{"text":"Sorry for 2 star but it was not that great tacos experience for me.

I would recommend seven lives tacos place in the kensington market!

First of all they were not busy at friday afternoon but service was little meh..
And the guy at the cashier counter was not nice.
The atmosphere was not stable.

Second, food was disappointing.
I order beef,fish and shrimp tacos.
The beef quality and portion was little miss and fish in the taco was so small and soggy.
Just only shrimp taco was good not great.

I think I would never come back here again."}
{"text":"Definitely one of those don't judge the book by its cover place.  The Mexican dishes are so authentic, it make you worry about sharting after you eat..but don't worry, food is super clean.  They recently moved so there are more space.  Why spend thousands going to Mexico when you can go here.  The bean breakfast is the best, don't think you won't be fill because you will regret ordering extra."}
{"text":"At only ~$3 per taco, I wasn't expecting too much. But the taco shells were soggy and broken, the beef was dry and bland; ditto for pork. The fish was mediocre at best, and though is probably more authentic than food court fare, I can't honestly say it tasted much better. 

The very so-so food coupled with bad service (one of the staff practically showed me the door) nailed it for me. I say: save your $3, there's so many other great taco options elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was like I was in Mexico. The food was fresh and authentic and inexpensive, the atmosphere was lively and service was fast. I ordered two soft tacos, one beef and one chicken and it was roughly around $3-4 each. It had great flavour and just a heads up, their hot sauce is really spicy. This is a great place for lunch is if you feel like being transported to Mexico!"}
{"text":"I have been enjoying the food, service, and ambiance here for many years. It's the closest thing in Toronto to feeling like maybe, juuuust maybe, you're in Mexico. And by Mexico, I mean El Salvador, obviously. 

Super casual, comfortable and friendly, this is the place to go for tacos. I sometimes wake up craving them. I get the crispy vegetarian tacos with guacamole added, and they are delicious and filling without fail! Easily made vegan by omitting any cheese or sour cream. Love the fried plantain and the hot sauce, too!  And my main man Smokey always serves up some charm with my tacos. 

Best part:  food comes hot and FAST!
Worst part:  they don't open until 2pm on Sundays"}
{"text":"Tacos el Asador was the place to go before the burrito blitz that has taken over the city.  We really liked the take a trip up to Bloor and Christie area to chow down on these cute little tacos, papusas and plantains.  However, in retrospect, the food doesn't have that much flavor. I've always had a love-hate relationship with the salsa they provide. I love the first bite- lots of flavor. However, immediately after that, I can't taste anything else and without salsa, it just tastes like bland papusa dough. I like things HOT. There is just something missing when you don't have salsa on these things, and when you do, you can't taste them for the burning in your mouth.  Alas, it is still quite the experience. We still pop in whenever we have a car for take-out or eat in."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. I've read so many amazing reviews and was super stoked to finally get a chance to come by Monday after work.

It's a cute little place with lots of decor and tvs on the wall - quite cozy actually with pinic like tables. Staff were nice and friendly. Place is clean and well maintained - looks like they're about to move across the street to a nicer and newer place.

We got two al pastor, a chorizo and chicken soft taco ($3.55 each), a cheese quesadilla ($3.25), a guacamole ($7~) and two horchatas. We ended up spending almost $40.

The al pastor was dry, over (or pre) cooked and was not anything like the juicy, tender al pastor cut fresh off the spinning wheel like the way it's supposed to be done. One of them had a pineapple (thank you) but the other one was neglected. The chorizo was very dry, I had to douse it with sauce to make it edible. The chicken had some juice but everything overall was lacking flavours. The guac was whatever and on the expensive side as well.

The horchatas wasn't what I expected. It lacked flavours, watered down sadness in a cup. My favourite part of the meal was the salsa - it has a nice kick to it. 

I will not be returning because I do not feel that this place is \"authentic\". Maybe traveling to Mexico and LA has spoiled my taste buds but I am determined to find the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Charming authentic Mexican. Squash pupusa, tamales, grilled plantain... It's only fault is that it is so small and always so busy..."}
{"text":"Go here.  If you can get a spot, definitely try to grab breakfast - it is unbeatable for the price.  Very friendly staff.  The obvious problem is the seating situation here - or lack thereof.  The staff seem to handle it pretty well, but try and go early to avoid that unpleasantness.  Very hot salsa/dip for the tacos - amazing."}
{"text":"Small & tight place, roughly 8 tables for 4 + a counter for 3 or 4 persons (?). Kitchen staff is literally pressed back to back & easily visible to everyone. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad that the place is small because everyone running that joint was efficient & we were assured that seating was no problem. 

After placing our order,  we shared a table with other guests. Food was top notch quality. We had 3 soft tacos & a burrito. we'll be coming back to try their pupusas, tamales, nachos & some more tacos &  burritos.

Certainly one of Toronto's best!"}
{"text":"Saw this place when I was in the Annex after having dinner at Maroli.  I dropped by again the next day to give this place a try as it was seriously crowded for a Tuesday night (and so it had to be good).  I went there during off-hours but it was still almost completely full.  I ordered their beef tacos.  They gave me small bowls of salsa and what looked to be marinated onions, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers.  When my tacos arrived, I was definitely generous with the condiments and dug in.  The jalapenos had more heat than I had anticipated as it's not the spiciest pepper around (wasn't complaining though!).  The salsa wasn't the most memorable and I didn't particularly care for the addition of the wilted lettuce but the meat was nicely cooked (it looked grilled to me).  Service was friendly and they had a big screen tv where i watched some kick boxing while waiting for my food.  A very solid place overall."}
{"text":"Petite perle mexicaine √† 2 pas de la maison! Oubliez les cha√Ænes Taco Bell et KFC rhymant avec assassinat gastronomique et abonnement longue dur√©e aux toilettes....
Les cantines sud am√©ricaines  que j'ai fr√©quent√©es √† Paris √©taient au top : je pense en particulier au salsa rumba; le plaisir est retrouv√© ici avec el asador.

// Little mexican pearl located at 5 minutes from my house. Forget all about Taco Bell and KFC which sound like murder in your stomach and long subscription to the bathroom....
South american cantinas that I used to go to in paris were very good : thinking especially about the Salsa Rumba. Pleasure of mexican food is found again at el Asador.
Ordering food is quick, the menu is simple and the food is awesome. Beef burrito and porck taco are delicious. One negative point on the bottle of Dos Equis at 5$, welcome to Canada where you have to pay high prices for import beers."}
{"text":"The staff here are incredibly friendly and nice. There space doesn't accommodate many people so most get take out. 

The food is delicious. It's a change to eat a different style taco and nice that they have pupusas."}
{"text":"Had to go meet a client in the area, and had not had lunch yet. Decided to try this place. Had three fish tacos, one beef, and two chorizo (sausage). Overall, quite good, but the meat ones were a bit too dry. It was somewhat expensive for those and a drink at 28$, but given the area, I suspect it is reasonable. I would recommend the fish tacos over the meat ones."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in the city are served here. Plus they serve beer too! Nice little hole-in-the-wall that cranks out some amazing Mexican food - possibly the best I've tried. There is plenty of seating and even though the place gets packed we have always been offered a seat, even sharing with others because of the need for cooperation. Step inside and get greeted with mouth-watering aromas and soft lighting urging you to get close to the counter and peruse the menu. Even though the selection appears average, the effort they take with their fresh ingredients and careful presentation always blows me away. On the table you will find a bowl of chopped onions and hot peppers, along with a bowl of red hot sauce, both excellent. So far I've tried the shrimp, fish, pulled chicken, and chorizo tacos and a tamale. The soft shells are doubles and the hard one is a little more difficult to handle but has a nice crunch. Either way, delicious! I've been told to try their soup as well as it's supposed to be very good. 
The service is top notch. Love their style here! Go order something. Sit down. They plop it in front of you. Eat it, and if you're half way done, stop and order more if you're still hungry. Then get up and pay and leave, so great! Super friendly dudes working there - with big hearts. Decent prices. No wonder the stellar reputation at this taco stand."}
{"text":"Nice clean little place with decent taco and the pickled veggies are great compliments."}
{"text":"Best El Salvadorian tacos in the city! I have been going to this place for a long time now, and it's very consistent. I usually stick to the combos, it's a good value and a pretty large portion of food. And Grand Electric isn't better unless you like overpriced tacos, snobby service and holier than thou attitudes in a place where you are SPENDING YOUR MONEY. Would rather support this amazing family, whose handmade tacos have supported their livelihood for at least a decade, will possibly be passed on to the next generation and are very authentic. 

Tiny place! The atmosphere is very lively, and if you can find a table, it's a fun place to relax and have a few beers on your own personal picnic table. A movie will most likely be on their multiple tv screens.

I really want to try the breakfast one day, that's one thing I haven't had a chance to try!"}
{"text":"Feel like going Baha?! Then Taco El Asador is the cantina for you!  Situated in Koreatown, this quant charming little taco bar is a fantastic authentic Spanish eatery.  The space is small and seating is limited but the atmosphere is warm, welcoming, friendly and fun!  Upbeat classic Spanish music is often playing making you feel like you are truly south of the border.  The food is delicious and affordable.  The menu offers typical Mexican fare: tacos, tamales, puposas, enchiladas, and guacamole galore.  I highly recommend the crispy tacos and the corn tamales.  The crispness of the tacos flakes off perfectly when you bite in and the tamale has a lovely melange of starchy sweetness. Delicioso! The staff is extremely congenial and kind.  

I highly recommend Taco El Asador! Muy bien!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish and shrimp tacos. Al pastor is on point and the staff are the nicest people!"}
{"text":"Love this place it's 100% AUTHENTIC. I see a lot of people commenting go to Grand Electric etc and sure go and do that but if you want an authentic Mexican experience this is your place. Having lived in Mexico I can without a doubt say that this is where you want to go, it's like being at home. 

Amazing staff and better food. They have plenty of regulars that are well... Regulars and are always there. And for good reason. This place is the bees knees and a little hidden gem for authentic Mexican. Hands down. 

Stop by Sam James after to get one of the best coffees in Toronto also."}
{"text":"To be honest, the tacos were just not that good. We went at 7:15pm on a Monday, and were pleased to see there were two tables open. Service was quick, but the food itself... meh.

We started with the gucamole, which was a decent portion, but only came with 15 chips. Yes, I counted. I ordered 3 tacos, the al asador, the chicken, and the chorizo. The Al Asador wasn't bad, but both the chicken and the chorizo were really dry. Really really dry. I was disappointed. The flavour wasn't great, nor was the texture. The tortillas were nice, but not nice enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever! I lived on Clinton street years ago and would pop in often for a veggie burrito! Seriously tasty and very affordable as well. I for years just got the burrito and take and and more recently i have been back and each time i ask who is working to recommend something new so i can branch out. The best thing is they are so super friendly and helpful. You can feel that they are into what they do and love food! 

I recently tried the crispy chicken (i know its called something else :/) and it was super yummy! I would have never ordered it on my own but took the suggestion, he said it was available fried or soft.. I so went fried! bring it on!!! I also got the cheese pupusa which was quite plain, i thinks thats just how they are, but added their salsa and it was out of this world. Those two items totally filled me up and I think it was around $7 pre tip. It was fast and friendly, i was in a rush to get somewhere right after, and the guy i ordered from checked in on how i like things and we chatted a bit about other items. 

If you like a casual and friendly atmosphere I totally recommend it. Very low key in and out and you can share tables with other customers which I like when I am alone, even tho its so not a north american thing to do :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork, al pastor, and fish tacos. the three tacos were very filling, the taste was good, but nothing spectacular. I also had the Mexican soda.

I did like the customer service. They were friendly, provided quick service, and gave me my own table even if it was busy hour and I was alone. 

If you're in the area, it's worth trying out."}
{"text":"Having lived in LA before, I have pretty high taco standards. Didn't have high expectations for Toronto, and I've actually been avoiding them here just to prevent disappointment. I'm glad I tried this place, because the tacos are really good. 

I tried the fish, carnitas & goat. The fish would have to be my favorite. I'm not sure what ingredients they added to the fish, but it was a great combo. The goat was good too, although I expected it to be more gamey. I'll probably pass on the carnitas next time. 

They are really flavorful, and quite big (although I need about 3-4 to fill up). I like the atmosphere of the restaurant too (except for the compactness of the place.. its really cramped). 

Ordered a horchata too.. I'm not sure if the El Salvador version is meant to be different, but I didn't like that as much as the version I'm used to getting at Mexican places. That being said, my wife enjoyed it. It comes in a pretty big mug. 

The tacos are not as good (and more expensive) than my favorite places in LA, but they are still delicious. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. My faves are the birria, a nice slow cooked goat taco that really just melts in your mouth, the al pastor, and the \"chrispy\" chicken, which is more of a rolled tacquito than a usual hard shell taco but it's super tasty. 

I also usually get the side of beans and tortilla chips, it's such a big portion for the price. Their hot sauce is vey spicy and the fresh onions and peppers that they give on the side is a nice touch. Quality hasn't changed since the move. 

Other highlights for me are the shrimp and fish tacos, they're really good. I've had the papusas here and they're very good too, and the enchiladas are more like tostadas and tend to get messy if you don't eat it fast enough (the tortilla gets soggy), they're tasty but I usually just stick to the tacos."}
{"text":"Alright, don't burn me here, but this place was... fine.

Let's do a thought list together here we go:
-Cash Only
-ATM on-site
-No hot sauce anywhere
-Sub-par fish taco, not enough flavor contrast (no sweet, acidic element)
-Rice was okay, peas in rice throw me off
-Tecates are expensive in canada
-Veggie taco was okay and fairly price
-Pupusas were good, bean and mostly cheese, and came last in our meal.
-Plantains were good and very sweet and I don't know what I was dipping in. 
-Everything came out at different times

Nothing deeply distinguishable from any other taco spot except the pupusa dough was very well done. I wish they came out sooner. I wish I ordered 5 pupusas and that was my dinner. So yeah, definitely try the pupusas."}
{"text":"Yummy fish tacos. Feel toasty and cozy inside on a Saturday night. Good place to drink. The guy at cash didn't want our money on our way out though. We had to wait a bit. Coming back to try other things."}
{"text":"The food here is near perfect, came here since it was in 'now magazines: best of Toronto' and since I keep hearing about it. 
We got a bunch of dishes, the one I personally liked he most was the chicken soup(10$ u get a combo with drink and taco) the soup had every thing in it!! Super hardy! Super tasty! Perfect just perfect soup! The only problem I can find with this place is really the washroom, could have been much cleaner, and the door locked me in for min. The fact that u order cafeteria style may be a turn off to some as well, I had no proem with it however! Much check them out!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! very cosy and small... I think it might be family run, but the food is delicious. My favourite is the hard fish tacos. The salsa is also very fresh and tasty. If you're looking for some quick and casual mexican food, this is the place."}
{"text":"I feel bad saying this but I agree with Justin S. this place is overhyped. The ambiance wasn't that good but the prices are not a one $.

Fell in love with soft tacos from my experience at Mexican Salsas in Kennsington. So I tried it here. Despite being bigger (and cost more) is wasn't as good. I tried the chorizo, biftec, and chicken and it wasn't as good as I expected. I had take out and walked to my car to eat while I drive (don't worry it's not dangerous) and it was lukewarm.

My 3 tacos came to $9 and change. While it's not expensive and a reasonable price it's not the the one $ I was expecting (Others feel the same see KV). You can get better value at Mexican Salsas or Ravi Soups (I know it's different but Ravi Soups is similar quick serve experience).

I will try this again and next time try the nachos people are raving about.

Food 3/5

{"text":"The Chrispy (yep, that's how they spell it) Tacos are outstanding and really what make this place shine. DOn't go in expecting your traditional Mexican taco because this place is actually El Salvadorian. I love the bowl of freshly sliced Jalepenos, Onion and hot sauce on the table. Pupusas are soft and not too greasy. Unfortunately, the nachos are topped with that really gross 7-11 cheese. I wish this place was bigger and open later but I could easily eat myself sick on their tacos any day of the week."}
{"text":"After eating here the other night, all I have to say is... 
\"OINK OINK!\" 

I'm a pig! 

Sometimes I amaze myself. You should have seen the spread on our table. Crispy pork tacos, crispy chicken tacos, chorizo soft tacos, cheesy chicharron papusas and plantains. Did I mention that there was only 2 of us? And trust me, I ate my share. 

Very casual look from the inside and out. But don't let the lack of ambiance fool you. There is no lack in the quality of El Asador's food. Authentic Latin American eats, personable and mindful staff, comfy atmosphere. And all for a price that can't be beat. 

There's always a line up, but I'll always wait as long as I have to, to order their food.

I'm a Tacos El Asador regular for life!"}
{"text":"Super tasty, we've loved everything we've had. There's often a line, and only a few tables, in the summer it's easier to bring your food to Christie Pits than wait for a table. If you are sitting, avoid the middle table near the cash, people will bump into you constantly while waiting in line. 

Cash only, be prepared."}
{"text":"My husband thought I was crazy for wanting to eat Mexican food in Korea town but this place did not disappoint.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but this tiny restaurant has a lot of flavour!  It was packed too!  We had fish tacos, beef tacos, chicken burrito and chips with guacamole.  Chicken burrito was so so - chipotle is better but the rest were deeeeeelicious!  They also give you a large bowl of super spicy salsa and another bowl of onions and jalape√±o peppers."}
{"text":"Papusas, papusas, papusas...

This place is legit. Authentic tasty, family run, as spicy as you want to make it, and packed with a frenetic atmosphere that one can't help but love and hate.

Sure the place can be cramped, yes it's weird that you have to order before you sit down, and sure, the cash only thing is no fun for anyone BUT if you like authentic food this place is the tops. I don't know anyone that is into this kind of food not come back and back and back."}
{"text":"Hidden secret and a gem. Did you know if you ask they will make Pozole? ( $10.25).
They have their own rules about seating. - Order first then you can sit."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, authenticity.

Super tasty food, at a very good price!"}
{"text":"A coworker recommended I try this place for a quick bite. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. I ordered 3 tacos (pork, beef, chicken). The pork was fine but overall the tacos lacked flavour. They also just didn't look that appetizing. The soft tortilla was soggy and white, almost as if it wasn't even cooked. The entire meal was basically lukewarm at best. 

Service was also sketchy. I dined in, but wasn't really attended to at all. I thought maybe there wasn't formal table service but other tales were being fully served (order taken and all), so I was a little confused. 

For $12+ tip, I think there are a lot better choices nearby."}
{"text":"Always packed but you can totally get why once you're eating there. The tacos are cheap and come quick but they are teeny and I need at least 3 to fill me up, maybe 4. Also, even though it's so packed you can barely comfortably get to a table, people are really nice, they don't overstay once they've eaten, and the staff is really, really friendly. Definitely a great spot to eat or get takeout in the hood."}
{"text":"Totaly kick-ass tacos. I ate at the Combine on the Danforth a couple of times in the last year and was so disappointed. I haven't had the stones to try to get into Grand Electric (or deep down know it can't possibly live up to the hype.)

But,  honestly, I don't feel that I need to try now. I came in here with a girlfriend around 6 PM on a Saturday after she swore up and down that she had tried every taco joint in the city and that El Asador was her firm favourite. It didn't disappoint in that regard.

I had 
- one of the daily specials (goat)
- an alpastor
- chorizo
- fish

Each taco came with a double tortilla which made the eating experience less messy then I'm used to. The goat taco was one of the best things I have eaten in months. The alpastor was a little dry, but the pineapple was a welcome flavour. The chorizo and fish were very good. I noticed they had mexican coke, and beer was very reasonably priced. Ordered at the counter, and service was friendly and FAST.

Subtracting one star only because the amount of filling in the tacos was a little inconsistent. The goat taco was borderline burrito size, while the alpastor was a bit on the skimpy side. This being said: everything was delicious.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Finally went to this place after seeing the rave reviews.  It's reasonably priced, good food, though I was a bit disappointed in that it isnt what I would expect from a \"Mexican\" restaurant. 

I got combo #4 which includes 2 pupusas, a choice of an enchilada or taco, and a drink.  I chose the enchilada.  I was confused when it arrived, because it looked more like a tostada than any enchilada I have seen.  I was looking forward to a chewy, cheesy, enchilada and its not what I got.  

According to Wikipedia, their version of an enchilada is a Honduran version.  It tasted good, but I just wish I knew what i was getting before I went.

All and all I enjoyed my meal, but keep in mind their cuisine is more in line with El Salvadorian (pupusas) or Honduran (enchiladas) cuisine."}
{"text":"El Asador is situated in the middle of Koreatown. I mean, completely surrounded by Korean restaurants on every side, as far as the eye can see. Strange? Who cares, as long as they have good mexican food!

Wow is this place busy. Wednesday night, and there's a constant flow or traffic and the 8 or so picnic tables they have are constantly full! 

When you walk into this tiny corner restaurant, it transports you to the mexican dives commonly found in the states. It's the type of place you'd expect to find authentic Mexican fare, and the type of place I typically love. I really don't understand why people go to \"upscale\" mexican places with fancy decor to get poor quality food. Anyways... 

The crispy tacos ($3.25) are good, and the beef was definitely better than the chicken. Double layer, homemade taco shells made this a crunchy delight.  But the soft taco ($2.75) was mediocre, and the chicken was very bland. 

The pork pupusa ($2.50) wasn't very good, floury and bland, it was basically eating bread.   I'd pass on this next time. 

The nachos and guacamole were great, though the pricing is strange. $6 for nachos, when a burrito is only $4.50?

the toppings and salsa they give you in bowls were great, good amount of heat (too much for some of my friends).

the prices at this place are pretty good, you can get 3 quality tacos for under $10.  

Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"This place rules. Dive taco shop with non - hipster prices. Super basic home cooked tacos and hot sauce. Do it!"}
{"text":"This place is not far from Christie Pits on the north east corner of Bloor and Clinton.  If you want to eat inside there are I think 5 picnic style tables so it is pretty tight in there to begin with.  You have to line up and order at the cash register and pay there and then they bring it out to your table (if you were able to get one).  

It's not that expensive for single items but usually a person like me will get like 3 or 4 different things because each item is too small for a full meal.  There are many ways to fill whatever your order whether it's burrito, tacos, etc.  Personally I like the cheese pupusa and I think they even have corn tamales.  We've had the fish before as well.

If you're a group they will bring everything to your table.  They have salsa and sides of fresh jalepenos, onions and other things for different dishes that you order that go with it such as cabbage for the pupusas.

They have Mexican sodas and beer like Dos Equis and Corona too.  Overall I'd have to say if you get a variety of items it will be something like 10 to 15 dollars a person not including drinks.  

Also it's El Salvadorian as opposed to Mexican I think.  I don't really know what the difference is but either way I like this place and I've been going for years."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS

If you're looking for a place with Instagram worthy $10 tacos, this ain't it!

The food is fresh, authentic and reasonably priced.

I had a chorizo burrito which was delicious. The flavours were fresh & blended together well and it was the perfect size (not disgustingly large and overfilled with rice).

Their new (not so new anymore) location has much more seating and a liquor lisence! Their only downside is that they only take cash."}
{"text":"I expected better. My tacos were cold and the meat was too chewy."}
{"text":"This place is okay very basic. The charizo taco was like boiled meet and very salty and shrimp taco was tasty."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have had the chance to go in over many years now. The food is OK, nothing spectacular. I think the place has a reputation that's disproportionate with the actual quality of the food. The nachos are good but more than once they chips have been stale. The shredded lettuce is often dry. What I really have an issue with is the owner/employees' attitude. I've encountered enough instances where they chose to be rude or raise their voice for no apparent reason that I now avoid this place at all costs. There are way better places, with better food, service, attitude, seating, and prices all around the area."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!...the worst thing about it is the lousy service!...tacos topped with feta cheese are not what one expects either....and the nachos came topped with a tasteless processed liquid cheesewhiz type product instead of the \"shredded cheese\" we were promised!....
Total failure, never going back there!"}
{"text":"Short version: Whatever you do, don't order the birria. (Unless you're only here to warm yr flu chills with some hot meat broth.)

Silver lining: Have a pupusa.

Long version: Was really excited to try this place after recommendation from friends and since the reviews were so good on Yelp. Was hoping it would become a go-to taco place in Toronto.

Me and my dining companion are gigantic fans of Mexican birria and were excited to see a goat version on the menu under \"soups,\" so we started thinking about foregoing the tacos. I asked the waiter about the portion - you never know when something labeled \"soup\" is going to be meal-sized or what. The waiter didn't provide any info, so I made a decision based on the price - and since the soup is $11.00 - one of the more pricey things on the menu, apart from the dinner platters - I assumed this soup would be substantial enough for lunch. I wrongly assumed that this birria would be very meaty - like Mexican birria usually is - meat with broth ladled over it, usually served in a low dish.

This birria was served in a deep soup bowl. We were given a few cut limes and some warm tortillas on the side. The broth was very flavorful and contained some diced onions. But once I started fishing around for meat in the broth, I came up mostly empty. I got about 3 big chunks of bone with some scraps of meat and fat hanging off of that. And this definitely isn't a complaint about the existence of bones and fat in my soup - I love them both. The problem was that there was no meat to speak of in my soup, and what morcels there were were dry and tough. This \"birria\" soup gives birria a bad name. And quite a sad offering for $11.00. And while the side tortillas were warm, they were the usual bland factory-made ones. This lacklustre commitment to meat and to tortillas dashed our taco hopes.

The waiter asked how the soup was, and I responded honestly as above: I was disappointed there wasn't more meat in it, that it was pretty much bones and fat, that it seemed a bit expensive for mostly broth. He commiserated by making a disappointed look, too, but that was all.

Since we were still starving after all that hot broth, I asked to see the menu again. We each ordered a pupusa (cheese, beans, chorizo) ($3.40 each). These were pretty good, and came with the usual shredded cabbage and dixie cup of tomato sauce. The negative here (more comedic, really) was that the pupusas were served with plastic cutlery on a plastic plate with holes in it in a waffle design, making the hot pupusa impossible to cut.

The place is cute and relaxed, but served us a less than mediocre lunch for two for $32."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Tacos El Asador?! The service is always friendly and helpful, the atmosphere will make you feel like you're eating tacos in El Salvador, and the food is sooooo yummy! I love the little spice/salad and salsa combo that they put out on every table. I also love the veggie tacos with beans and cheese, the fish tacos are always very yummy, and the papusas are comforting, authentic, and mouthwatering good.

The best thing about this place is you get good tacos without any pretentiousness and at a fair price. I love Tacos El Asador!

Bonus: you can get Mexican Coca-Cola here, which means it's made with real sugar, which means it's reaaaaal good."}
{"text":"My love for Mexican and Salvadorian brought me to this little hole in the wall restaurant ... I think the first time I ate here was about 10 years ago. My family is Salvadorian and I've eaten in some pretty amazing places in El Salvador .. including my aunts & grandmother's kitchens. The pupusas, tamales and plantains are as good as back home. They even have horchata which everyone has to try at some point in their life. My only gripe is the space and awkward seating with the picnic tables .. good luck if you're wearing a dress or skirt! When it's warm out and the restaurant is full (and it gets packed) it gets hotter than hell inside and doesn't make for a pleasant dining experience. I wish the owners would consider a larger space. Then this place would definitely be a 5"}
{"text":"I went here on a cold Friday lunchtime and was expecting to wait for a space but was pleasantly surprised to get a table. 

This place is probably what a roadside taco stall would feel like somewhere in Latin America , right down to the pop choices. I had 3 soft tacos ( 2 chicken & 1 beef). The shells tasted like they were made ten minutes before. They bring lots of salsa and trimmings to your table. It is a little cramped but it just adds to the atmosphere. You wouldn't linger here for long but it's not what this place is about, just fresh and quick El Salvadorian/ Mexican food."}
{"text":"After trying other taco places in Toronto, I must say I have these tacos are the most authentic ones. The ambiance definitely made me feel at home, the service was great and all the staff is very friendly. Out of all the tacos they offer, the fish tacos are the best tasting ones. The pupusas are also very tasty, and the beer and drink selection is great as well."}
{"text":"While writing this review I have encountering feelings: In one hand, this place was used by my husband 2 years ago in order to remember the Mexican flavors he enjoyed while we were together in Mexico (he told me he biked to eat at \"tacos el Asador\" almost every week because he missed Mexico...)

He ate Birria everytime he went.

Birria is a really fulfilling stew&soup, 100% comfort-food when is made with love. I dare to say that it is an alternative to the \"healing\" properties adjudicated to the chicken
soups, because it makes you feel less decrepit when you are: hang over, suffering the flue, starving (they give you tortillas and it is suppose to have so much tender goat meat floating, that you can make tacos out of the straight plate of soup...)

Going back to the joint, I love hanging out in there... It really feels like home. So the ambiance is really authentical, and they have beer... And they even had the gem of the beers this summer: modelo especial!!! 

I feel bad giving a bad rating because we have been there many times, and I see they have a nice multicultural supporting clientele. They are really busy for been a small joint and it seemed that they are popular with the food to go.

 This is a wake up call for this establishment.

Every customer and everyday counts. If the product is not ready to serve, use diplomacy; apologize, and offer another option that makes your kitchen and effort proud. Keep and treasure the trust people has on you, otherwise they won't recommend you.

We went there before they even opened and there was a couple with a stroller waiting outside because they wanted to brunch in there. We went to the park and ate a 3 dls korean empanada while wating for the birria...

Once we went back to 'tacos el asador' almost all the tables were taken, just one empty bench waiting for us... I was salivating for the meal we waited for... 20 min and no birria in our table, lots of to go food, lots of calling no our names, and when the birrias finally arrived, OMG. I started to play with the spoon to cool the birria down, but I caught a horrible circle of bones, meat, and everything together piece of meat... A second one... Ohhh... it looked horrible and I wanted to take a picture, but I forgot my phone in the car, and Mateo was too kind to suggest to try the soup first.

As usual, my husband (thinking he is more Mexican than me) put two spoons of sauce before even tasting the soup. When I tried it:  just water, no flavor at all, no condiments, no salt, no dedication, no love, just raw onion and cilantro floating in the most disappointing soup I have ever tried. When my husband tried the birria, his opinion of the place also changed, and we decided to just go and leave the place behind to never go back.

I went out and my husband payed 20 dls for those bowls of water. He said one of the crew asked: \"you didn't liked it? Cuz is the same soup\"... Yes sure... Hasta la vista and to my black list."}
{"text":"I went for lunch one day.  A friend has recommended I try the goat taco.  The guy who took my order just got me one to start.  The salsa they brought with it was good and the taco was flavourful.  I'd go back...after reading some reviews..I think I'll try the fish next.  
I found them to be very friendly and laid back. :)"}
{"text":"Having lived in America, this would rate slightly below average for a taco joint, but at about 2x the price. Maybe that's a good deal for Toronto, but I don't consider this place a good value for the quality"}
{"text":"Seriously, one of the best places for a tasty and cheap meal El Salvadorian style. Why I love it: Friendly staff, delicious cheese and bean papusas, warm and bumpin atmosphere, and all under $10!!!! I recommend the combo meal #4-2 papusas and quesadilla with yummy cheese and beverage for the wonderfully low price of $8.75."}
{"text":"Simply the best south american food I have had in Toronto. 

As soon as you walk in  you will feel a big change from the outside world and almost will be forced to take a look around. Good news is you can scan the entire place in about 5 seconds. On the flip side you might not get a table, specially if you arrive during busy hours. During summer ti`s not a problem, you can take the food to go and walk over to Pitts and sit in picnic table. Picnic table is what you will eat on if you get a seat inside.  Even for people who don`t like negotiating their way around tight quarter, the food here is well worth it.

Food is tasty tasty tasty............did I say tasty :-). It is very reasonably priced. They give you handful of corn chip and unlimited amount of kick ass salsa to snack on while you wait for your order."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city, hands down. Authentic, delicious, great value."}
{"text":"Their interpretation of Latin American fast food is not bad at all. They're serving plebs however, and for the most part, Tex-Mex-esque food sells best. For the price, though, the portions could be better. I understand that they need to pay for overhead and the million staff members, but honestly the portions are tiny and largely unsatisfying. Bring a 20 if you plan on leaving with a full stomach.
The fact is, a lot of wannabe hipsters come to this joint and get a little rowdy- they love it, but they really don't know any better. I'm sure the majority of patrons could be tricked into paying 3 times as much for Taco Bell if I repackaged it. If you're hispanic or a fan of genuine Latin American cuisine, the menu might not be your cup of tea. Holler at the dude at the front, and ask him to make you something else, and he'll probably oblige."}
{"text":"This is the best taco place in town. I strongly recommend trying chicken tamal and goat soup! Shrimp, fish and goat tacos are my favorite. Great service too."}
{"text":"This is my spot. If you're looking for great, simple and homemade food this is the place. I've had absolutely everything on the menu,  so it's hard to pick the stand out. I personally didn't love the El pastor,  but wouldn't complain eating it."}
{"text":"I came here for a late weekday lunch and they weren't busy at all - my 2 friends and I had no trouble acquiring a table right away. 

Service was pretty good. The waiter was prompt in wiping down our table before we sat down and gave us our menus quickly. He was also floating around and being attentive in case we had any questions about the menu. Ordering was simple, and our food came out very quick (within 10 minutes). Other than this, there is basically no other table service - water is self serve.

I ordered 4 tacos - chicken, beef, carnitas and fish - and I had a horchata to finish off (total, $20). Each taco was a good size, and was wrapped with 2 soft tortillas. The portion of meat inside each was also generous. However, the meat was dry, dry, dry, dry...and oh, did I mention DRY? I know that these aren't stewed fillings, but I'd hope that the meat would be able to stand on its own without a sauce - but they did not. The meat tacos were disappointingly sauceless, with only a bit of salsa to make them go down (and not without a fight - I hate wasting food). Out of the 4, the fish taco was the best. The fish was tender and flakey, and it had guacamole and a chipotle sauce on top. 

The horchata was okay - it was creamy, but lacked any distinct cinnamon flavour. 

I am genuinely confused about the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Got a craving for AUTHENTIC tasting Mexican food? This is your spot then! Randomly came here with a friend and I'm so glad I did because this place is everything! From the food, to the service, to the decor and open kitchen concept, everything was great. I got one shrimp taco, one fish taco, and one pupusa--everything of which I enjoyed. My friend got the chicken tostada which they also enjoyed. We also got the chips and guac and omgggg it was the best guac I've ever tasted--you could taste the fresh avocados and lime. I'd honestly go back just for that. I'll admit I got a drink I didn't really like but I'd still go back to try other drinks and eat again. It also helps that they guy who cashed us out was hot lol. 

Keep it the awesome food and service! I'll be back :)"}

Inside was nice, casual yet unique. I ordered the vegetarian taco plus recommended my friend to try pupusas for the first time just so I can snag a bite :)

Delicious and packed full of flavor. I do what I always do and split my taco filling across the 2 tortilla and it was still a good portion. 

Reminds me of the pupusas in San Fran!"}
{"text":"Maybe more like a 3.5-3.75 star place but I think it is one of the better Mexican restaurants in town.

Once you go inside, you'll notice that it is very cozy and has picnic table-style seating.

The menu is quite extensive as far as the usual Mexican food you would find such as tacos and tamales. The taste is definitely authentic. I also like to order the horchata as a drink but they have a limited supply available on a daily basis.

The service is friendly and it's pretty good for what you get. It might not be the cheapest in the city but certainly not the most expensive."}
{"text":"If one door is blocked, use the Asador. I mean the other door. If they're too busy, go somewhere else, it's not like it's some big disasador. Amiright?

Thanxxx to Lambert for telling me to eat here. He was right. And he's like, the only person in the world (I never exaggerate, 1,000% of the time I do not exaggerate) who seems to get that it's Salvadoran, not Mexican (cough, cough, Yelp tag). He's related to Paul Lambert, Christopher Lambert, Adam Lambert, Miranda Lambert, and Adam Levine... oh wait... but yeah, so he's usually right.

What to get: Pupusas, absolutely. Ignore anyone telling you differently.
What else: Their Horchata is unusually amazing for a Salvadoran place.
What do you mean Salvadoran?: This place is Salvadoran, not Mexican. Ignore anyone telling you differently. Permanently ignore.

(I have to say \"ignore anyone telling you differently\" on Yelp quite a lot. Lately more than ever.

Big problem is the wait time. It is endless when they're not so busy. But they're usually packed out the door, and then it's endless times twelve. If you have some time to wait and want to rub shoulders with, well, everyone, but especially the hipsters pretending they know what authentic tacos are, then come in here and wait. You'll have the smirky grin of someone who knows they are one of very few people in line that are there to order what the place is actually good at, and actually makes authentically. Pupusas.

If you're coming in here looking for \"real authentic Mexican\" then get your \"Ass-out-the-door\" of Asador, because it's not. As much as I love Torontonianical people, they generally don't know a taco from a pizza slice from a chicken wing. Now if we're talking Portuguese bakeries and dumplings and donuts and Greek food... they got some perfect ones. And if we're talking Body, then I agree with what Tove Lo said about Toronto girls. (Swoon)

What they do have here is fantastic Salvadoran food mixed with some questionably not-quite-Mexican Mexican food that is made in somewhat Salvadoran style and also somewhat homogenized, anglicized, Hipster-ized, gentrified for the masses, since the masses in Toronto are generally neither Mexican, nor Salvadoran.

The tamale (which is usually a Salvadoran specialty, and so much better than the Mexican versions), is just okay. However, the Horchata (which often isn't as good in Salvador as Mexico) is an absolute winner. It's one of the better ones I've had anywhere, and goes straight into my top ten list. That's a rice drink that's popular all over Mexico and Central America, by the way. Made differently in each region, to some degree.

However the star of the show here is the Pupusa. Pupusas are fried and delicious and dirt cheap. Discs of corn filled with cheese and/or beans and/or pork. Get it with whatever sounds good, pay next to nothing (although more than you would in most Salvadoran places that aren't quite so popular or trendy), and enjoy the absolute heaven as you combine it with pickles and the infectious red sauce and slip away to bad-for-you food heaven.

Ignore what all the locals order... most of them don't know the cuisine. They come here for tacos. The tacos are decent, but you don't go to Salvador for tacos. They're the sideshow. Pupusas are the star. Horchata is perfect to wash it down. Go. Try. See what you think."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast on my day off. Soft tortillas, plantains, eggs, black beans..."}
{"text":"You'd miss the place if you aren't actually looking for it but the place sure is busy at dinner. A different dining experience where you order first, get seated, eat then pay after. 

I got fish soft tacos and cheese pupusa. The fish was okay. I'd have better. Definitely enjoyed my pupusa more. I'll get the bean and maybe another cheese next time. I'll try other soft tacos too. The pupusa was very corn-y which is what it's supposed to be. The sauce that came with it goes well with it. Whats better was the red chili sauce that was on the house for the table. It was spicy at first but once you keep eating it, it gets addicting. I deff slabbed that on my taco and pupusa."}
{"text":"This new location is a big improvement from the small quarters of the last spot. The restaurant is now well lit, cleaner, with plenty of seating for larger groups. 

I ordered the pastor taco (spiced pork with pineapple) and a mixed pupusa (cheese and meat). The pastor was a disappointment; it was bland and the pineapples tasteless. The pupusa however, was delicious and the perfect size as an appetizer. The tacos came out quickly, with the pupusas arriving about 10 minutes afterwards. Their hot sauce is also worth commenting about. I think it's made in house and delectable. 

They've got jarritos of various flavours. A must have for washing down the tacos. I always gravitate towards the tamarind flavour. 

They have gluten-free options that are free from cross-contamination for those who have gluten allergies. 

Overall, the experience would have been okay had it not been for the poor service I received. The owner who was at the cash charged me for an extra taco and then proceeded to roll his eyes and huff and puff when I explained to him that he was mistaken. Our waiter had taken down the order incorrectly and wrote down an extra taco when he forgot to bring me my order when he brought out the other ones.

Parking can be found at the green p lots nearby or on the many side streets."}
{"text":"Ok went here hearing all of the hype about how amazing this place is. The first time I went I mistakenly ordered the burrito. It was really nothing special especially considering all of the great burrito places in the city. It was pretty much just beans and rice, but after I told the people who had recommended it about this they could not BELIEVE that I would have ordered a burrito, they said you MUST try the tacos. So a few days later I went back and had the fish tacos, they were incredible, simple and delicious with an authentic taste. The guacamole was really good but kind of expensive for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Super delicious!!

The fiance and I have been visiting this spot for a few years - not sure what took me so long to write this review?!

Anyhoo, this small spot offers reasonably priced and very yummy homemade tacos, tamales, and papusas.

I normally order a tamale and a salad - so good!

It can get super busy here and tables are tight but don't let that discourage you, they do take out too! :)"}
{"text":"I'll admit it. Sometimes, I get tired of being charged 5 bucks a pop for a fancily topped aesthetically pleasing taco in a dimly lit restaurant. Pupusas and tamales aren't pretty and I don't care. They taste good. Sometimes, I want to just wear unattractive clothing (not that I often do) and eat authentic tacos that are cheaper because let's face it, I can't afford going to have $5 tacos all the time.

That's what you have at Tacos El Asador with their picnic tables indoors and the super laid back vibe. It's cute and more importantly I'm comfortable. I like that you get your money's worth (and instead of buying 2 $5 tacos, you can get 3 tacos for $11/12). I also like that I can get a bottle of corona with my taco and not have to choose a locally brewed special on the tap kind of beer. 

But most of all, I appreciate that the food that I eat is coming authentic. I know someone out there is going to call me a racist but it's the same way that I'm a born and bred Vietnamese person and so when I go to Pho restaurants, I want to know that it's a Vietnamese run restaurant who knows what they're doing.

So if you're ever in the area and want tacos without feeling like you're not pretty enough for them (baby, you're always pretty for tacos) hit up this spot because it's awesome!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere of this place and the variety on the menu had me really excited. Since there were 2 of us, we chose to get their first 2 specials which gave a selection of different items and seemed to be the most popular things ordered by the people ahead of us. I think we ended up with:

Biftek Taco
Chicken Quesadilla
Chorizo Enchilada
Pork Burrito

The service was quick, the people were friendly, but unfortunately, the food was bland and flavourless. I couldn't even eat more than a bite or 2 of each and left the place hungry with lots of food left on our plates.  :-("}
{"text":"So delicious!
I had the beef and chorizo taco both with hard shell.
The meat was well seasoned and tender. 
Great amount of spice and flavors with the fresh toppings. 
Even the shell was yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.
Finally got to try it after hearing and reading so many good reviews. We went on Monday around 6pm, and it was already getting crowded. 

We ordered pupusa, quesadilla, tacos x3, enchilada platter between 2 people. At first it didnt feel like much, but it was actually a fair amount of food for 2. Our bill came out to be around 30$, so its not bad at all for 6 items + 2 drinks. 

Staff was great and friendly service.
Environment felt very local, with 2 TV screens; 1 playing popular reggaeton mix and the other sports."}
{"text":"This place has recently moved to a new location (dont worry.. just across the street). The newly renovated place has much more spacious compared to the old location so you can now come with a larger group (not a party though). The old location was very pinch, only like three picnic size tables. 

I ordered the chicken burrito, which costs $6.65 and the portion is HUGE! I had asked for extra hot sauce (I love a good kick) and I loved the hot sauce. The chicken was not dry and I did not feel gross after eating the whole burrito! I would definitely come back to try the other items.

The staff is very friendly. I came shortly before 12 p.m. and the door was open so I went into the restaurant. The manager came to me and advised that they did not open until 12 p.m. and that I had to wait outside. At first, I was not too happy about this but I still wanted to give this place a chance. When the restaurant opened, the manager explained that the reason they cannot allow customers to be inside before 12 p.m. due to the liquor licence rules and that someone had accidentally left the front door open. He was very apologetic and then comped my lunch meal. 

The food, alone, will have me coming back but the service will definitely keep me happy every time I do come back!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of hub bub about this place.  It's an authentic Latin American eatery, which is primarily a take out joint, but has a handful of picnic benches (indoors) for you to eat at if you wish.

They make good burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas and, of course, tacos.  I've read (in NOW and such) that this place is known for its spiciness, but I've never found the heat to be a big deal.  Certainly, you have the option to add spicy salsa (red or green) to your eats, but it's not a requirement.

I've enjoyed the food on a handful of occasions, and this is easily one of those spots that you wouldn't expect to be as good as it is.  I think part of that is its location.  It's located right in Korea town, and nothing in the vicinity hints at a Latino vibe.  It's both a good spot on its own, but even better when you consider there's nothing like in nearby."}
{"text":"Still loving it! Love the pupusas, love the beans, love the platanos con crema. I can't wait to try the tacos."}
{"text":"Torontonians know the best place to get Mexican is smack dab in Koreatown. I've never been to Mexico but it's how I would imagine Mexico to be like...crowded, Mexican soap operas or sports blaring on the aged tv, bright walls, cramped seating, older Mexican ladies working and laughing in the kitchen, good beer, friendly service and awesome food. 

Other than the crispy tacos and the non-dirt cheap prices, I'm told by many that the menu and atmosphere is pretty authentic. Either way, I would still wait in line and eat my chicken burrito in Christie Pits because there is no seating. I always go for the chicken burrito. I went for the beef once and it wasn't as tasty. The burrito size is neither too big or too small so you feel satisfied without feeling like you want to explode. I don't know about you but I often have the 'I want to explode' feeling after I eat Mexican food. When I'm feeling extra adventurous I'll get the guacamole. Very yummy. So yummy that I'm in a good mood for at least two days afterward. Make sure to top everything with their homemade salsa that they bring right to the table.

I love this place because it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. It's all about the food. They know it, we know it and now you should know it too. Be prepared to spend  $30ish for dinner for two. Beers, burritos and guac add up!"}
{"text":"It was ok, food was fast, service as well, but i was not impressed with the taste of the food, but if you want something quick at an affordable price, this is the place"}
{"text":"Chorizo tacos... mmmm... 

This El Salvadoran place is as basic as it gets. The small space is filled with wooden picnic tables and there's a counter where you order. But just because it's basic and simple doesn't mean the food is. 

The tacos are full of flavour. The guacamole is creamy and sooo fresh. Try the pupusas filled with cheese. It's grilled cheese latin american style. If you like the heat, go heavy on their homemade hot sauce. I like heat but I like my tongue better so a few drops suffice. Plantains and refried beans are good accompaniment to the tacos/burritos. I wasn't a fan of the tamales. A little stingy on the meat and the masa needed a little more seasoning. Drink it all down with a Jarrito or a Dos Equis and you've got yourself a fine lunch or dinner.

Lunch and dinner gets packed. So come early if you want a shot of the picnic tables."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexicans restaurants in Toronto, great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"The last time I came here they were still at their old location. Unfortunately since they've moved I feel like the quality has gone down a little bit too. I ordered 3 tacos on my last visit: fish, beef and pulled pork.

The fish taco was absolutely delicious. The pulled pork taco was decent, pretty juicy but I definitely needed to pour on some of the sauce to make it better. The beef taco was kinda disappointing. It was pretty dry and flavourless, and I couldn't finish it. 

If you're going to this place I recommend the fish tacos and perhaps something else off the menu besides tacos? I want to give this place another chance so we'll see if I come back again"}
{"text":"Good for them, bad for me; too busy!
Honestly I think they have the best burrito I've ever eaten, tacos also excellent.
I pass them all the time but rarely enter; the line and tight, tight, crammed space is claustrophobic.  I want to go more often but the line is brutal.  Be great to see them take a vacancy next door or down the street, there is nothing cute/quaint about the location/decor, it's just super busy with limited seating/space."}
{"text":"The most authentic tacos I've had in Toronto. 

This small little shop welcomes you with delicious aromas that are a great introduction to the authentic flavors offered. I came here at 7pm and it was super busy but the wait wasn't too bad. I managed to snag a seat in 10mins.

This place is not the nicest but it definitely has its charm. There are 6 picnic tables crammed in this small space with Spanish MTV playing and wood everywhere. 

The service is usually super fast and super friendly. You order at the counter, grab a seat and the food will get brought to you accompanied with some hot sauce, onions, jalepenos, and hot peppers. 

The food is amazing and is the closest thing I've had to a real taco since living in California. Absolutely authentic and delicious. Definitely try the chorizo taco.

Overall the prices are great while the food is better. If you're looking for a place to get delicious Mexican food look no further as this is THE place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tacos El Asador ever since I moved to the Annex 4 years ago. If there is one thing on the menu that is my go-to item, it would be the chicken tamales!  For such a simple meal, it is so flavourful! It's served with a very spicy salsa and jalapenos and onions.

My other favourites include the black bean soup and the chicken soup, both of which are available in sizeable portions, served with fresh homemade tortillas and avocadoes. 

Smokey always takes order with a smile on his face regardless of how arrogant customers can be. An attitude like that makes all the difference in having repeat customers!

The only downside is that this place is not equipped to handle groups as it is quite small and narrow, making it more ideal for takeout. Thankfully, Christie Pitts park is nearby for an impromptu summer/fall picnic!"}
{"text":"Decent taco place with lots of variety, but be warned that it is very small with limited seating. Good for a quick meal"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a tasty take-out lunch of bean soft shelled tacos and two kinds of pupusas: zucchini squash and bean. The tacos came with accompaniments of salsa (green and red), fresh sliced onion and jalape√±os, and mixed pickled cabbage. Fresh ingredients and the pupusas made to order so they were hot and had a great texture. Cute place, will be back to enjoy the charming interior next time!"}
{"text":"I stop by for lunch here occasionally and have recommended others to this restaurant.

Affordable, authentic Mexican food. I always get the fish soft tacos here. (Approx $3.50 ea). Definitely need to add the lemon, salsa and onions to these for extra flavour. Two tacos are just enough to fulfill my hunger.
Another thing I always order is the Chicken soup. Very filling, probably my favourite go-to item there.

Overall, good place for a quick bite in this area.

Downside: Cash only"}
{"text":"We used to order take-out from this place all the time at my old job. I would always get the chicken burrito. In fact, I would get two chicken burritos because they were so damn good. I would also get an horchata to wash it down, but for some reason I think they discontinued that drink.

Now I tend to pop in and get a variety of things as take-away, but the chicken burrito is still my favourite. Only complaint is the place is super tiny and very popular -- which makes for a tight situation."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican in Toronto. I went to university in SF so I know my Mexican food. Decor is perfectly inline with the food, bright colors and park bench seating. Hole in the wall means all emphasis is on the food - just the way I like it. The burritos (el pastor or chorizo are my favs) are the best deal. The salsa is genuinely spicy and not gringoed down. Beers are available as is a wide range if Mexican/Latin sodas."}
{"text":"This place has character. This is a great laid back taco, quesadilla and burrito place. Nothing fancy but everything is good."}
{"text":"Went back today and it was much better than before. The chicken in the tacos I had was a little dry, but the beef burrito was amazing. And when you learn to take it easy with the salsa that has habaneros in it - wow! It adds enough kick to make me sweat without actually causing pain. Delicious.

I take back my previous lukewarm review and kick this up to a solid 4/5. Stay away from the chewy chicken and you're golden."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years, one of my fav spots in the city for quick, cheap, filling eats... Have been enjoying the Al Pastor tacos lately when I come.. Always friendly, efficient service. Place is always busy so if you are coming for lunch make sure you get there close to opening if you want to get a seat."}
{"text":"Tacos are nothing to write home about. Loses hands down to 7lives taco in Kensington.

One star for \"pork\" pupusa. \"Pork\" inside was foul-smelling crap. Perhaps it was from yesterday? (I came early). 

Beware of the sign (The \"Best\" tacos in town, with quotation marks), the sign does not lie."}
{"text":"I'm Mexican and I really didn't like it. The tortillas are fresh and tortilla with salsa is always a winning combination but the filling needed seasoning. We tried the beef, chorizo and shrimp tacos and everything was so-so. The guacamole was good but it was really expensive ($8). In the end we all agree that the relaxed atmosphere was the best thing about the place but because of the lack of flavour we very likely won't come back."}
{"text":"This is an average taco place. It is not particularly cheap, although the vibe is clearly \"festive, cheap, Mexican joint\".

The food is surprisingly bland. You will need a dollop or two of their spicy salsa to make the soft chicken taco taste more lively than a Tim Horton's breakfast sandwich.

They have cold bottled beers, good (not great) chips and guac, and a decent fish taco. The burritos are a huge mound of beans, rice, and lettuce without much meat and less flavour.

Seating is limited. Service is counter service. Pay after your meal.

The prices here are comparable to Chipotle, which is not known for being cheap. (You can buy smaller items for 3-4$, but will end up needing more to be full) Chipotle is cleaner and has better food."}
{"text":"Best mexican food I`ve ever tried. Friendly staff..even though it`s a very tight space it`s worth it. Prices are reasonable. Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I have always had amazing good at tacos el asador! The guys who work here are great, the ambience is so lively and fun and each of their dishes are amazing!

I recommend the crispy fish tacos and the soft goat tacos. Both are delicious. It also goes without saying that guacamole is a must. No regrets."}
{"text":"I only had 2 tacos here: fish and al pastor, so my review is narrowly focused.  

Actually, the tacos are pretty okay here.  Old fashioned and simple are the descriptions.  And these descriptions fit my concept of tacos well.  My concept of tacos is that tacos are very simple, every day food.  A good taco must get the 2 key components right: the tortilla and the protein.    Otherwise, all the excessive quantity of gourmet toppings can't save the day.  The fish taco I had contained a big fillet of white fish, pan fried.  1 star.  The al pastor was grilled to lean, marinated with spices, and served with pineapple (yes, old fashioned).  Another star.   The tacos were served with 2 soft corn tortillas.  The tortillas were store bought/off the shelf tortilla.  But considering each taco costed only $3.55, and the tortilla was soft and at room temperature at least, I was happy.  Third star.  If there is any complaint, it is that the ingredients, though not too old, could be more fresh.  The fish taco was a little bland as a result, to which I resolved with lot of lime juice.  Freshness can significantly enhance the flavours and enjoyment of simple food, such as Mexican food.

I am looking forward to returning to try other offerings at Taco El Asador, so that I have reasons to revise my rating higher.  Until then."}
{"text":"From the outside, Tacos El Asador looks like a convenience store. Inside it isn't much nicer. Eight picnic tables crowd the albeit colourful room as the sound of CNN Espanola natters in the background. And yet, every night around seven, it's one of the busiest spots in Koreatown when the Salvadorian smells from its minuscule kitchen coax you off of Bloor street and into a sense of comfort despite d√©cor. Delicious food; fabulous guacamole and chips, papusas, burritos and enchiladas made with beef, chicken, bean, pork or chorizo filling, come served on pink plastic trays with a side of the hottest hot sauce and a bowl of chopped jalapenos. Extinguish the fire with a Dos Equis or one of the weirdest juices/sodas from South America. And CHEAP! Their \"Chrispy Beef Tacos\" (at $2.70 each) are amazing. True taco lovers (like me!) will find a home here."}
{"text":"Taco season is every season. 

Oh Tacos El Asador, how I love the hot, crowed, hole in the wall atmosphere of your restaurant. 
I love watching you all hustle and smile while you do it. I love your no seating until you have ordered policy.  I love your chrispy beef and pork tacos as well as your shrimp soft tacos.   I love your nachos and other soft tacos a little less. 

I do not love your bathroom nor that pesky cash only policy I see too often in Toronto. 

It will be interesting to see how your move to the bigger location across the street will change things.    I hope it doesn't change the authentic feel I love so much about your current location."}
{"text":"If I could rate zero stars I would. 

We went for dinner tonight and were seated. Nearly 20 minutes passed before anyone even came to speak to us again, meanwhile several other groups that arrived after us had already gotten drinks at a minimum. 

My wife and I were attempting to make eye contact and get their attention the entire time, to no avail. When they started taking the order of yet another table that arrived after us, we gave up and left. Thankfully there are a number of great restaurants in the area that actually know how to serve their customers."}
{"text":"The tacos were really good! I ordered the chorizo and beef hard shell taco and it was roughly around $11 - 12 which is not bad because the tacos did not disappoint :) 
I would recommend getting some nachos on the side because the 2 tacos really did not fill me up! The tacos were really juicy and the meat was cooked just right 

My friend got a soft shell chicken taco and said that she regretted getting it just cause compared to the beef it just was not as good and it fell apart really quickly so that's just a heads up..
 The restaurant was tiny but gave off very chill vibes so I definitely enjoyed my time at Tacos El Asador :DD 

Would recommend to anyone who is in the mood for some good tacos."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on Yelp and liked it even better than El Trompo.  The tacos are cheap, great tasting, and come in about six choices of fillings.  Great quesadillas too.  Looking forward to coming back and perhaps trying the posole or the Salvadorian pupusas.  What I really like is that everything is priced a la carte - you don't need to get beans or sour cream if you don't want them but they are reasonable if you do.

Very friendly service - eager to please.  Lack of atmosphere creates an atmosphere - order a bunch of tacos, sit down on the picnic type tables and enjoy."}
{"text":"I've eaten here loads of times and it's never disappointed me. Love this place."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review, exciting! 

So I recently started a new job and one of my coworkers mentioned this place that had really good tacos. Me and my other co-worker went here yesterday. It's a fairly small spot but the food is great. I had 3 tacos and a guava Jarritos and was stuffed by the end.

It's a pretty authentic spot. The music playing was in Spanish. The men working in the front spoke to each other in Spanish. The guy I talked to also explained what was in a chorizo taco. The picnic tables are a cute touch. 

I did find it odd that two of my tacos didn't have cheese. We were wondering if that's how an \"authentic\" Mexican taco is made?? Idk. The chorizo taco was by far the best of the three I had (also had chicken and beef). I also saw someone with what looked like a shrimp taco. I'm gonna try that next time.

It's a decent spot and I'd go again. The menu has other stuff I'll probably eventually try. In regards to pricing, the tacos were $3.50 each. My meal came up to $15 even. Also, bring cash!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at Tacos El Asador was when they were in their old, cramped quarters across the street. Well, they've upgraded big time as the new place is spacious. They've lost that hole in the wall feeling but the food is still good.

The wooden picnic tables are a cute touch and it's actually way bigger than I thought.

Lots to choose from on the menu: tacos, burritos, tostadas/enchiladas, quesadillas and pupusas. Wish we had time to try the pupusa, they were great last time. Soups, salads, tamales and platters round things out.

- Birria (goat) and fish tacos ($3.75 each) - we got one of each but J likes her tacos crispy. I got mine soft style, which are doubled up, and obviously the better way to eat them. Fish was soft and tender. Goat was good too.

Solid spot to grab take out/have a few tacos. I'll try one of their platters next."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food, and service. The space itself is quite small, so you're pretty cozy with everyone else in there. Overall, it's a fun environment with a lot of great eats and people."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if my review is fair because I haven't tasted tacos before this but I'll say that it was a great experience. I had a pulled pork taco and my sister got the shrimp taco. The pork wasn't that great but the guac that came with the shrimp taco was heavenly. I've tasted many guac so I'll say, they have the best guac! The waiter did hover our table to check in with us which made my sister and friend a bit uncomfortable. But the staffs were fun and interactive. You can really feel the staff's chemistry. All in all, it's great. The food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a long time and adore their food.  Always an easy way to satisfy a Mexican craving.  They are normally packed, but the tables turnover quickly.  I'd recommend putting your order in and hang by the bar while you wait for the next table to come available.  Normally by the time the food is prepared, a table has cleared out.  Cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"All the best of El Salvador without the pesky civil war-relic landmines or CIA death squads.

By far and away the best Central American food available in a city full of spectacular options.

The best thing here in my opinion are the pupusas.   But everything seems to be excellent....

Inexpensive.  Delicious.  Tecate.  Hot Sauce.  Cha cha cha."}
{"text":"Fantastic food
Love this place and the people are amazing"}
{"text":"Good lord, those are some tasty tacos. The crispy tacos melt in your mouth, and the toppings of onion, cilantro, and peppers are a great compliment the delicious filling.

Admittedly, seating is minimal at best, they only take cash, and it is a claustrophobe's nightmare.  I've never tried any of the other items on the menu, but I'm sure they're just as tasty."}
{"text":"No idea how 4 tacos guac and 2 beers cost $50. I miss NYC and my ex this is bad news. Gimme hermanos on Starr over this any day sigh."}
{"text":"This is the place that made me start typing yelp reviews, y'all crackas have NO taste buds, much less the hipsters....
This place is as legit as they come I'm telling you as the Spanish person that I am.
It's a shame that they cater to the hipster crowd which is making them anglicize their menu (u want a burrito seenor!?) 
Honestly anyone that would prefer xhipotle over this should just STOP writing reviews.

P.s it IS A MEXICAN-SALVADORIAN restaurant soooo BOTH n yes there is a difference which makes it GOOD"}
{"text":"The tacos al pastor alone are worth a return visit. Super friendly staff (I half thought the guys would come sit down and have a beer with us). Its a family run operation so its fairly authentic (I believe they are from el salvador). I hope they will have the tequila flavored beer they were telling us about next time :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! 

I got takeout with friends on Friday night and we were all very impressed. Portions were large for the price and dishes were good quality. I tried a fish taco and three types of pupusas; all great and the total was about $15. Everything was wrapped up well to take away and sauces/condiments were provided on the side in little containers. All the staff at the restaurant were friendly and polite. 

Be aware there isn't really anywhere to wait for your takeout order; I'd suggest ordering ahead if you can (or just eating at the restaurant). 

It's great to find a place in Toronto that makes delicious pupusas - can't wait to go back again and introduce this place to more of my friends!"}
{"text":"Food was really good price and so good. Tamales were amazing and tacos were really good. Goat one especially. Chilaquiles took a while to make and we're alright, would rather try the tacos."}
{"text":"This place rules! Pupupas just like the ones in El Salvador! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I live super close by, so Tacos El Asador is one of the restaurants that I frequently visit. 

I've tried almost everything and I'm a fan of most of what's on the menu - but my absolute favourite are the crispy beef tacos. They're the best I've had in Toronto, and have become my go-to.

The tortillas are awesome and crispy, with the excellent texture necessary to complement the filling. Flavor is subtle - but it's all about the texture here. The beef is nice and thick, and super flavorful. 

These tacos are simple, with very little additional garnish, but that's what I think makes them great. You can opt to add a bit: onions, jalape√±o, salsa, lime, and/or cilantro, but you will not get massive helpings of guacamole or cheese. The veggies they do add provide that extra bit of crisp freshness necessary to cut through the mix. 

There are a couple things I don't like that are on the menu: chicken and pupusas (which I know people love). I find the chicken dry and flaky - both of which combine to create a sub-suboptimal taco. The pupusas are just more of a taste thing - I don't generally like pupusas."}
{"text":"Pretty Authentic no-frills Mexican food. I just wished they served salsa and chips with your meal."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after decent reviews on Yelp. The staff are very nice, gave us some recommendations. We went for early dinner so it wasn't busy at all. I had the fish tacos which were good, my partner had the beef plate which was decent but not worth the price. I'll come back for more tacos and to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't want to knock this place, bc it's a blast (we had a hilarious waiter, seriously loved him), but I gotta say I was not blown away by the food. We ordered nachos, pulled pork, chicken, pork and chorizo tacos. The service was prompt and there was very little wait between ordering and being served. 

The nachos were alright. I'm not a big fan of queso instead of actual cheese, kind of bland and there was not much of a fresh, crispy element (couple pieces of onion) but the chips were tasty. 

My partner had three different kinds of taco, and all three came w lettuce, onions, various sauces and cheese on top. My pulled pork came w nothing but a piece of lime and a bit of pickled onion, which would have been fine if the pork was more flavourful and less dry (for example, I love nice sweet carnitas on corn tortilla w a squeeze of lime and some cilantro, so v simple), but it wasn't :( 

This place has such good reviews that I feel weird about not having my socks blown off, and the atmosphere is really nice and unpretentious, so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I don't know! But I've certainly had better tacos in Toronto. 

Still worth a visit, imo! Fun, chill, and fairly reasonably priced (nachos, two sodas, and five tacos came to $40 for us, which seemed a tad steep but I'm also broke affff and will say w no illusions that this colours my opinion about price greatly. Still tipped the guy more than 20 per cent for such great service)."}
{"text":"4 star food
3 star pricing
2 star service and ambiance

Great tacos. Had the goat and pulled pork but at 4 bucks a pop, it's a bit over priced.
9 bucks for a burrito 
The tortilla soup was solid
Staff can't speak English :(
Cash only :("}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving tacos so decided to give this place a try since it was highly suggested. The ambiance of this place is real cute... the seats were picnic table style (so you can fit about 4 people). The decor was also really cute; home-y and comfortable. The servers here are really nice, always available for any questions and were so quick to pick up our dishes once we were done. The menu was also pretty straight forward, just a good selection of mexican foods. I got a Cochinita (pulled pork) taco ($3.90), fish taco ($3.90) and 2 mixed pupusas ($4). Our tacos came first and then the pupusas came a little later which I think is normal here since reading it in another review. The Cochinita taco was my favourite - the pulled pork was juicy and went well with the corn tortillas (DEF recommend). The pupusas were also really good, filled with cheesy goodness and fresh to order. I genuinely didn't think the 4 things I ordered would fill me up but as soon as I finished my meal I was STUFFED (the pupusas are pretty heavy). I definitely wanna come back and try out their hard shell tacos. 

Any downsides? It is a bit pricier than I had expected but the quality of the food, ambiance and service made up for it."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and I'm all for pupusas whenever I can get them. The service is quaint, like a bunch of friends have opened this place to serve their friends great food. Just cozy homey restaurant feel. 

Before I lose everyone in this review, let me tell you, the goat tacos are great. I mean dream about them for weeks later great. The meat is stewed and topped with raw onions and cilantro. The meat is juicy and tender and with a splash of their house hot sauce, it's just perfect. I was less impressed with their carnitas and pastor tacos, but still good choices if you don't like goat. Which you should though. 

Their pupusas and tamales are also solid choices to add to your taco dinner. I really like the zucchini and cheese pupusas, but you can add beans and chicharon to it too. As with any pupusa I've had, they come with a mild salsa and some cabbage slaw. There is a huge selection of soft drinks in the back fridge to choose from. I think I even spotted some Mexican Coca Cola, which just gives me another excuse to come back for even more goat. :)"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and well seasoned.  The enchiladas were open faced which we weren't use to but they were really good!  Shrimp taco and pork taco did not have as much meat as we were expecting,  but the flavours did not disappoint. 

Cramped seating area but the vibe of this place is huge!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was so hungry after work and wanted something warm to eat. So glad that I dropped by here!

Service: Great! The staff welcomes you right away. I was greeted by a young man who took my order. I was told that I could pay after I finish my meal (I was not used to this, I was like....huh??)

If you are here, just order and sit down. One of the staff will bring your order to you. 


Food: I ordered chicken burrito and waited by a table nearby. It took a couple of minutes but was worth the wait. The burrito was much bigger than I thought! It was as long and as thick as a 6 inch sandwich. 

I took the first bite and I could taste the freshness of ingredients oozing out. I added some hot sauce to try. It was yummy and filling.

As I paid for my order, one of the owners asked me about my meal and thanked me for coming by. I really appreciated the kind gesture and the freshness of ingredients. I can see why people come to this place! 

I can't wait to come back and try their hard and soft tacos, nachos, and etc!

**important note**: this place is cash only!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, but I'm pretty syre the buzz is mostly generated by cash strapped university students in the area. The prices are reasonable, so I could see why students would be attracted to it. But the tacos lack flavour in a big way. You need to add the onions and the salsa they provide to achieve any kind of taste sensation... I would recommend hitting up Grand Electric instead, or one of the new food trucks out there such as Gourmet Gringos. Oh, and the guac was okay... but how hard is it to smash some avocados and add some salt and lime/lemon? The fact they have picnic tables is cute though. I'll give them that."}
{"text":"I love this place and come here every time I come to Toronto, which is often.  It is as authentic as authentic gets, by which I mean this is Latin American food, not a Californian gringoised interpretation, so it is slightly bland until you add the salsa and squeeze on some lime juice.

There is a gratifying absence of gringos working here and everything on the menu is cheap and very real.  The tortillas are all home made, the tacos ($2.70) are the crispiest I have ever had, their salsa picante is hot and vibrant, the onions and jalapenos crisp and fresh.

The pupusas which are stuffed El Salvadoran corn bread parcels are wholesome and filling, chatting ( in Spanish) with the guy at the counter there, he mentioned that in Mexco they have something very similar but called a gordita, I laughed and in English said, \" a fat girl?\" and then we both laughed.  

I love this place and whether you come here to eat \"a fat girl\", or come here to enjoy the tacos or the burritos or anything else on their menu, if you have ever lived or travelled South or the Border, then I'm sure you will love it too."}
{"text":"It's not that great. The fish tacos are palatable. I've had better Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is about as authentic as you can get! 
A real gem: truly Mexican food and atmosphere, great taste and very affordable, it really doesn't get better than this!

Make sure to mix it with some Desperado and plantains!"}
{"text":"Place is in the middle of koreatown, but not a korean taco place with hipsters. Its a legit taco place. Tacos are about $3.55 / $3.65 each. All were pretty good. Fish taco was my favorite. I couldn't tell the difference between pork and pulled pork. (Got the pulled pork at the recommendation of the cashier). If you get soft tacos, they double tortilla it. 

There were people waiting outside of the restaurant just before 12 to get in, and most of the picnic tables inside were occupied by the time we left 20 minutes later. They got modelos and jarritos. Water jugs on the side. The workers are nice and they play soccer on their tv."}
{"text":"My go to taco place. One of the only places that has hard shell tacos (other than chipotle and taco bell) my absolute favourite is the crispy fish taco. I could inhale them for eternity if my stomach permitted it. The staff are super nice and if they have the cookies... Get them. They are some of the best cookies i've ever had. The place itself is little with some picnic tables you order then when you eat you pay. It's cash only so bring them dolla bills."}
{"text":"Best Mexican/El Salvadorian food in Toronto.  The character of the interior is awesome.  You feel like you've stepped into a different world.  It can be hard to get a seat, but they're pretty good about helping you find a seat, and cleaning up spaces quickly.  The beer selection is impressive, and the staff are extremely friendly.  The freshness of the home-made tortillas is something I will never take for granted, and I love all the vegetarian options on the menu (ie. beans or avocado instead of meat).  Prices are more than fair.  I'd love to see this place expand one day."}
{"text":"I guess you can say this place is authentic but it doesn't translate to good tacos.....

We had the asador, beef and fish tacos. Everything tasted like they have been cooked in water. Tasteless with no texture at all. Toppings were not great. Hot sauce that was provided on the table can't even save the bland tacos because the sauces were not great either. 

I really wanted to like this place because it seems like a local and a family owned restaurant but we walked out of this place throughly dissatisfied. Service was quick though hence the two-star."}
{"text":"Judging by other reviews, Tacos El Asador is about authentic as you can get in Toronto. I've never been to El Salvador so I'll have to trust that this is true. But, authentic or not, I'm not really feeling this place. The food is good but not great. I just found things a little on the bland side.

In two visits to Tacos El Asador I've had soft tacos, crispy tacos, and papusas. The crispy is definitely the best. Everything is served with decent salsa and a mixture of onions and jalapenos for those that want to increase the heat. In all cases I had the vegetarian versions, which I realize might be the cause of the blandness, but I had a bite of a friend's pork crispy taco last time and wasn't super impressed with that either.

Service is quick and everything is fairly inexpensive. I'd probably go back to Tacos El Asador but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The ambiance is very relaxed and the service super fast and friendly. Had the guacamole nacho (which I ended up sharing) a chorizo crispy taco and a soft pork. Everything super tasty and dirt cheap. Will be back for more"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, service was fast, and atmosphere was lively- felt like Mexico City- too many people, too small a space- it goes to the authenticity though right?!

Each taco is about $3.50 and about 5\" in diameter, they fill 'em up so 2 tacos will give you enough to bite on; order another taco, pupusas, enchilada and share or keep it to yourself if you're really hungry. 

Don't bother with the nachos and guac- though the guacamole is wonderfully fresh and full of chunks- it's just not worth the $7.55 for about 20 chips and half a cup of guacamole. Besides, they load up the tacos with the guacamole anyways- so you won't miss out.

Beer was a bit expensive, about $5 a bottle.  

Salsa served at the table is really spicy- about 4 chillies, so stay alert!

They have unusual hours so you have to make it there between 12pm-9pm.  The turnover is quick so you wont stand around for too long for a seat.

I'm also loving on the \"family run\" atmosphere of the place!"}
{"text":"Ah nomenclature in Toronto. I actually ended up going to El Trompo (Tacos El Pastor) instead of here at first. Too many \"El's\" for this blonde. And totally my fault. 
At least it's right near Christie Station. 

VIBE 
It's bright and busy. I love the picnic table set up. It makes for a great casual date or good night out with friends. But you have to go to the counter and order yourself then they'll bring it to you. Didn't know the process before. 

WE ATE/DRANK
I think I needed the Corona to get through the meal. It was really, really bland. Maybe I've been spoiled with the likes of El Trompo and Grand Electric (way better value in my opinion) but shredded chicken on two flimsy taco shells does not a taco make! 

This was the first time I had to put salt and pepper on my chicken taco. I had the \"El Asador\" which was crispy pork and one chunk of a pineapple. Again...MEH. 

The quesadilla was not much better.  Just a goopy, unflavoured mess and they give you the toppings on the side but don't tell you what to do. Is it a topping? A salad? Explain! 

Dining companion got the guac and I had a small taste. I can make it better myself. We actually ended up going to El Trompo so I could show him how real guacamole should taste! It should not taste like unmashed avocado with 5 chips. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
You get what you pay for. I think it's a great cheap eat place but I think there are better places in the city for your dollar. Their sign definitely should not say \"best tacos in town\" because that title belongs to Grand Electric. 

Frowny face."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.  It's the cheapest Mexican in town (the way it should be).  The chicken is flavourful.  Our faves include crispy chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, any pupusa, guacamole, and burritos.

It's small, so be ready to wait if need be.  Very friendly, casual, and cash only.

Great for take out.  They separate all the sauces so nothing gets soggy on the way home."}
{"text":"Walking into this place brings back memories of San Salvador.  I only slip in on blazing hot weekday afternoons for the complete experience and to ensure myself a free table.  

My favourite snack on this planet consists crispy tacos, of which I eat plenty. Overall the tacos are okay here as I find them a little on the bland side. They come with side dishes of salsa and hot peppers but they just add heat and no flavour. I prefer to the chorizo tacos to remedy this problem.

I've never been a fan of pupusas as I find they taste a little like dirt.  They're adequate here and on occasion I will toss a few into my order for some variety.

Taco El Asador doesn't quite match up to other authentic experiences I've had say in California.  But I'll still continue to make it a late lunch summer destination."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now and always leave satisfied. One thing people have to realize when they say this place is not as good as [insert Mexican taco place here], El Asador is actually El Salvadorian and not Mexican, so there are differences.

The whole menu is pretty darn delicious. My favourites are the fish tacos and chorizo tacos. The fish is a pretty recent addition, within the last year or so I believe so I'm really happy they decided to stick with it. Last time I was there, my friend ordered a goat taco, but the taste and texture were very beef-like...Either they got our order wrong, or the goat is just beef. Pupusas take a long time to make (we finished our tacos and had to wait another 5-10 min for them) so keep this in mind. I've only ordered them once or twice and have ordered the \"mixed\" pupusa (with beans, cheese, and meat) but it always tastes and feels like cheese only...confused about that. I've also tried the tamales which are pretty good, very authentic and tasty. Tacos are by far the best items on the menu, so stick with that if you're not sure. I love that they always give you a double layer of tortilla, both soft and crunchy. Awesome!

People here are criticizing the ambiance but I think that's the whole charm of the place. It's a little run down and old, but it screams authenticity and I love that the TVs are tuned to Spanish channels...I've caught a dramatic Latin soap opera or two there. Lots of fun. The one thing that bugs me about the place are the very large picnic tables set up there. They feel pretty authentic, like a real taco stand in El Salvador would have, but they take up so much room and sometimes only 1 or 2 people sit at a table when it could easily seat 4 or 5. This also makes wait times for a sit-down meal reeally long. That's why a lot of neighbourhood locals order take out, but how unfortunate for the non-locals who trekked out there for a yummy taco meal!

People are also writing that they thought their meal would be cheaper, but just because the decor and atmosphere are low-key, it does not mean the prices are comparable to fast food or low end food. They use fresh, good quality ingredients which I think are deserving of the prices they charge.

Writing this review has made me hungry and now I'm planning my next trip. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Tacos El Asador. The  grungy, hole in the wall vibe just screams 'gritty dope tacos'. Well...they're gritty alright. Which would be fine, if they didn't cost $3.55 a piece. I mean I love a questionable taco, when it's authentic, sold for $1 out of the back of a van, like the next girl but don't charge me what Grand Electric charges for pork belly and beef cheek. And it needs to be mentioned how much authenticity these tacos actually lack. The 'chorizo' was colored with what looked like pink highlighter fluid. If a gringo did this I would blame their ignorance, but the staff here knows better. It's shameful. Even if the prices dropped in half I wouldn't return because quite honestly, the food just isn't good. It's unfortunate because there is certainly charm and novelty (which is the only explanation for its 4 stars) and the staff is great. But a word to the wise (and the not so bright folks who rated this well) stick to Taco Bell if you're in the mood for mystery meat. At least you'll have enough cash leftover for plenty of Pepto."}
{"text":"We went back for lunch. I had three fish tacos, and my girlfriend had the breakfast. It was under $15."}
{"text":"This was a great gem, worth the drive if you crave some authentic tacos!

I was a bit surprised to find this well run taco joint amongst all Korean restaurants but it really works!

Lots of bench style seating easily fits 4, but gets squishy as this place fills up at lunch time. The service is quick, the food came fast and hot and for tacos, quesadilla, burrito type foods, but our pupusa came after tacos, maybe cuz of table room? Cuz they certainly not a dessert dish. 

The warm corn wraps were so so good, guacamole was fresh and the perfect green and texture. I had to try one fish and one shrimp taco with a squash pupusa(pan fried puffy corn tortilla pancake like thing? served with a pickled cabbage slaw and hot sauce salsa) and was ok full but ordered another shrimp taco just in case 

Easily you can start lunch less than $4, but really takes 3-4 tacos for a good lunch which run closer to $15, they have good combos for certain days which is nice and take out was very popular while we were here. My girlfriends all agreed the fish was best of the tacos, and would easily come back tomorrow after our seminar."}
{"text":"$7 gets you only 2 spoonfuls of guacamole, decent guaco I must admit, but for $7 I'd expect at least half a bowl of this stuff. 
As for everything else, it's A-OK at best. Burrito was rather bland, tacos was actually just one single taco, small like the rest of the things we ordered. Overall $25.35 wasn't enough to get enough food for two, maybe sufficient for one, but then would you want to spend $25 per person on takeout quality food? I know I don't."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cute atmosphere, great staff and reasonably priced delicious food. I have the goat, carnitas and fish tacos - each was a delight.  Will definitely go back for the fast service!"}
{"text":"Always the laid back vibe, even with this new location that they moved into for just 3 months. The washrooms alot cleaner and it holds more tables for seating compared to the older location.  They've also expanded their alcohol and food menu. You can be entertained by the big TV while seated down eating. There's still as many orders to fulfill for take out. Food is consistently tasty and delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is over this place. It is certainly always busy so it's obvious some people love it, but I'm not feeling the love. It's A-OK. 

Tiny little restaurant packed with mini wooden picnic type tables. Every time I eat here it's always impossible to have decent conversation with my dining companions. Too much elbow bumping and boisterous laughing from someone sitting at the next table 18 inches over.

Food is decent but I feel like it's slightly overpriced for what it is.  I'm not huge on Mexican (pardon me, \"El Salvadorian\") food so I don't have much basis for comparison. But it does look/taste authentic to what I've had in Mexico.

The guys that work here are awesome. Very friendly and quick to help with suggestions if you don't know what to order. Plus, the guy usually working the cash is pretty cute.

I see lots of people getting take out, maybe that is a better option."}
{"text":"I got two tacos. The first was steak. The meat was good, and was topped with nice potatoes. The second taco was chorizo. It was quite disappointing, with little flavour. The tacos were served with a nice side of onions and jalapeno and some hot sauce.  Each taco costs $3.55, but they are generous in size.

However, I had several complaints. For starters, the corn tortilla was not good. Moreover, it got soggy in no time, and completely fell apart. The second complaint was that the flavour was not really there. For me, tacos should be about big bold flavours, but these were bland. However, all of these would have been forgiven. My main complaint is that this place is not clean. One trip to the toilets and I lost my appetite. I usually try to focus my reviews on the food, but I'm sorry, this place could use a good scrub."}
{"text":"Cash only, which isn't bad just inconvenient. We had the chicken, beef, fish and chorizo tacos. Soft taco shells were dry and the filling wasn't impressive. We had take-out and the service was fast and friendly. Next time I'll try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here all year 'round. 
I always order the nachos & crispy chicken tacos, tried a few other things on the menu but I know this to be consistently amazing.
Fair warning, you'll likely smell like food after you leave this joint. I suppose that's cool if your date likes the smell of tacos in your hair and on your clothes :-P"}
{"text":"Went there Thursday for lunch and was not disappointed. I ordered a beef burrito, beef tostada and a horchata. My mom orders a chicken soup and a pork tostada. We shared nachos. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"Tacos El Asador is a reliable place to go if you're looking to sample El Salvadorian and Central American cuisine. It's more of a fast food diner than a real restaurant, but it appears that they're moving across the street soon (hopefully into a building that is more spacious and accommodates more seating). The small dining area which is packed tightly with picnic tables and benches, can seat about 15-20 people.

The laid back, casual atmosphere is part of the attraction. The other part is definitely their nicely priced selection of soft/crispy tacos, burritos, quesadillas, enchiladas, tamales, and pupusas, among other items. Eating here will definitely go easy on your wallet.

Must-try items:
Tacos (Beef, chicken, fish etc.)
Enchiladas/Tostadas (Beef, chicken, etc.)
Pupusas

Service is friendly and fast, considering the volume of customers that frequent this place on a daily basis. There are a couple of flat screens as well as music that plays in the background, making it feel like you're in someone's living room. 

If you're patient enough, try waiting a few minutes so you can sit down and enjoy your meal. Other patrons usually eat quickly and don't spend too long lingering at their tables. Sauces and additional toppings are brought out to your table, and you are given the option of paying before or after you eat your meal. The food is quite good for the price, that's for sure."}
{"text":"This place truly lives up to their sign saying they're the best tacos in Toronto.  This is the first place I've had the opportunity to eat a handmade tortilla outside of California (and Mexico of course) and they were pretty good.   This place is really authentic as its a Mexican family that runs the joint.

I had a pork taco, chicken taco and the nachos.  The pork was really good but I found the chicken to be a little dry, like it needed some guac or sour cream on it.  The only other negative was that this place is really small so Mike S. and I had to get our tacos to go and eat them out in the cold on a nearby park bench.

You may want to try the \"chrispy\" tacos.  Yes that's right \"chrispy\"."}
{"text":"Good neighbourhood gem. Fish tacos were definitely my favourite."}
{"text":"Good and cheap mexican food. The real thing. What I really liked is the authenticity of the place, like you're in a real taco joint in Mexico. Even the servers look Mexican. 

I love how small their servings are that you can get to try a lot on their menu and the food is really what I'm not expecting for the price. I just wished they have a bigger place because they're pretty busy. What it just needs is a bigger dining area with some mexican band playing on the background and you're all set. It's really cramped and it gets pretty busy so expect that you'll be sitting with strangers in one table. You have to gobble up your food as you won't be able to sit down for a long time unless you keep on stuffing food in your mouth. That works too! 

Anyway, I'll come back for sure. I still have some stuff in their menu that I have to try."}
{"text":"I like this place and would probably give them just under 4 but rounding up.  This place in homey and quaint, with quality bites.  Tables are hard to come by be prepared to get your items to go.  Pupusa with chicharones was delish and their signature tacos were good.  Ive even had their menudo and was satisfied.  Complimentary salsa has got a definite bite and food has been very solid the few times Ive had the chance to dine here.  Would recommend and have"}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone downhill lately. The past few times I've gone to Tacos El Asador, the tacos have been cold, and the salad hasn't been fresh, and the chicken has been way too watery.

I'm still a fan, but I don't think the tacos are as good as I thought they were. Maybe I've outgrown Tacos El Asador. Who knows. Maybe I've just tasted better tacos somewhere else. It happens.

They're still pretty delicious, and I stand by my original review. Tacos El Asador has the best tacos in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place totally rocks. 

I went last night for dinner (my second time) and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

The service is very prompt and friendly.
The salsa that comes to the table is hot and tasty.
They also serve up a salad of jalapeno and onion.

I had the squash and cheese pupusa, as well as the black bean pupusa. I preferred the squash, but both were tasty and were served with what looked like a pickled cabbage slaw.

The guacamole was average.

Overall - very good food. 

One thing - why does everyone call this place Mexican?
It's Salvadorean.

Next time, I am going to try the tacos.

Oh, they also have good selection of beer! 
Dos Equis Amber Ale, Lager and Negra Modelo were available during my visit."}
{"text":"Just OK. Very small portions (toddler size) and expensive for what you get. We tried it once and won't be back."}
{"text":"I had 3 different types of tacos & they were all dry and awful. Never again. 

If you're looking for a real taco place, go to Seven Lives."}
{"text":"Wandered into this jam-packed taco-joint Friday night pre-Clinton's (FNPCs). Standing ass-to-ass we shout-ordered a mega-load of crispy tacos. Seating consists of a few small picnic tables so it's better suited to groups of four or fewer. 

Amidst the 110 dB rabble, we waited. Our order took a long time to arrive, but it was well worth the wait. The tacos were crispy and had a unique flavour, and there were so many varieties; I can't wait to try their other options.

Obligatory Title Pun: More like TACOS el AWESOME-dor!

Menu Readability: On a board high above the counter. They have a lot of selection, but it was too busy to quiz the staff on their offerings. Maybe next time.

Need to mention: The prices are incredible. I had a filling dinner and a beer for less than $15.

What this place teaches me about myself: I don't know what papusas are. But I intend to find out."}
{"text":"I have a thing for Mexican food, done the authentic way with corn tortillas.
This food is so cheap, how is that even possible.
My chicken quesadilla was great, and purono(?) was unusual, and totaled maybe $8.
And that salsa? I slathered my food with salsa, but don't be fooled, that 'slight' pepper creeps up on you!
The place is small and choked, but with that at-home feel to it."}
{"text":"So we walk into the this place on a Friday night around 8 pm. The reviews we had read were great and we were hungry!

The place is small and cozy, it was somewhat crowed -but not too much-, was playing loud Latin music, and all the staff were either from Mexico or El Salvador. Not only that, but everyone was super friendly as well.

We ordered guacamole and tacos and had really high expectations. We enjoyed the guacamole but the tacos were just plain blah... We were so disappointed! The double tortilla made the tacos dry and the meat and veggies inside just didn't have any flavour.

We didn't try the pupusas but when you have \"Tacos\" in your name you'd assume that's their specialty.

This place gets 2 stars for the speedy service and warm staff but unfortunately Toronto just doesn't have a good place for tacos and El Asador is no exception..."}
{"text":"Finally my friend brought me to this place to eat an El Salvadorea dish she has been raving about since the day I met her. Now that we work together it was a no brainer to go for some PUPUSA'S!! We hoped on the bloor-danforth line and arrived at cristy station. It was only about a 5 min walk to the restaurant and if you didn't know where you would going you would probably miss this Latin American gem located in the heart of Korea Town. 

The restaurant itself is very tiny, and probably mainly used for take out. We were fortunate to arrive their before the rush. We were able to get a seat among the tiny picnic tables located in the place. Each wall was painted a different colour but looked authentic. 

So because I clearly do not speak Spanish my friend went up to order me 2 Pupusa's  which are flour tortilla's stuffed with cheese, pork and re-fried beans. After you order you wait in your seat and the workers deliver it. They were served with red pickled cabbage and salsa. I couldn't believe how filling they were. They are definitely deceiving because they looked tiny but BAM! They must expand once eaten LOL. When they arrived they were beaming hot! That's when you know they are fresh and straight from the kitchen. I was a little disappointing in the actual flavour of these little patty's. I personally thought there would be filled with a bit more spice, maybe its the fact that I love things full of spice so I expect it. I recall packing  on the pickled cabbage and the salsa but then again maybe that's what you are suppose to since I saw my friend do that. Maybe I should try the other options as this one was the Mixed one (cheese & beans & pork) There were just cheese, just beans, just pork and squash options.

All in all I would go back to try a new thing on the menu when i'm in the area or if my friend is down to grab some food after work :)"}
{"text":"I would probably enjoy this restaurant a lot more if I wasn't a vegetarian.  My husband is a meat eater and seems to love it.  Still, I enjoy the spicy food and friendly service.  The only complaint is the lack of seating."}
{"text":"Ever since I drove by and saw the sign advertising the city's \"best\" tacos (only the word best was in quotes, pretty much guaranteeing a submission to The Blog Of Unnecessary Quotation Marks), I knew I had to try Tacos El Asador.

Despite Yelp's warnings to NOT go at 7pm, I found myself inside at precisely 7pm along with about thirty other hungry patrons, many of them Hispanic, making me increasingly confident that I'd be getting an 'authentic' experience. I dilly-dallied about my order selection and finally decided on the \"strictly vegetarian\" black bean soup (soup of the day!) and a bean and squash pupusa. 

Luckily for us the folks in the kitchen fire out food at such a mind-numbing pace that it wasn't long before our dinner was ready and brought out to us (in waves, might I add, as we received a few unexpected add-ons like a bowl of onions, avocado slices, some weird salad with jalapenos on it and a brown slurry that may have been hot sauce...or soup.)

The black bean soup was fairly brothy (not a puree as I'd been expecting) and brimming with rice and whole black beans. It was a bit spicy and the portion was enormous so I didn't even get halfway through it before I had to get started on my pupusa. 

According to what Wiki tells me, pupusas have been around for nearly 3000 years and were eaten by \"the natives\" back in the day. They're a thick, hand-rolled maize (corn) tortilla that kind of looks like a pancake or a crepe, but is stuffed with a variety of things like \"chicharr√≥n\" (fried pork rinds), cheese, beans or ayote squash, which is green and stringy like zucchini.

Unfortunately I wasn't a huge fan of the pupusa - it was too bland for my tastes. It was in dire need of a flavour intervention by way of chilis or hot sauce. Even sour cream would have helped its cause. 

The entire meal was made more entertaining by the inclusion of a Mexican Telenovela on the big screen TV. I have NO idea what the name of this soap opera was, but it was hilarious. It was super dramatic, every actress burst into tears at least once per scene, and the entire thing took place in a hospital. At one point there was even a flashback montage of freak accidents like electrocutions, gasoline fires, radioactivity and gas leaks. It was a wild ride!"}
{"text":"Its hard to hit Koreatown and skip the tasty bulgogi and bibimbap dishes, but Tacos El Asador is definitely a gem.  Go with one of their platters for a little variety from pupupas to quesadillas and burritos.  They serve it with a side of peppers so you can enjoy your food at your own level of spice which is nice.  From what I can tell, the food is pretty authentic but I am troubled by their nachos which are served with fake cheese which I found very strange.

Watch your head when going down to the bathrooms."}
{"text":"This place was fresh and delicious. Definitely lighter options. The hard tacos are the best thing on the menu. And it was super cheep. The soft tacos were a little chewy. The service was really fast."}
{"text":"Just had a last minute family dinner here for my birthday. The food was outstanding. The chicken soup is my go to every time I'm here and I always take one home for the next day. The plantain was perfectly fried, tender but not greasy. The burritos are huge, I recommend sharing one. The service is always friendly with familiar faces I've seen working there for years. Thank you to everyone there for such a wonderful dinner! And thank you for just smiling and nodding when my mother made random weird requests... :)"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding !! Super small inside, but i love the menu, the prices are really good, and the nachos beef are my favourite if you love Mexican tacos or nachos you gotta come try this place out !! I think you will fall in love for it !!"}
