{"text":"What a terrific staff! Very knowledgeable, always helpful. If you have any interest in a new bike or supplies, definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"Terrific spot just off the Montour Trail -- ideal place to stop for an ice cream cone when trail riding with kids.  Friendly, helpful staff and a terrific selection of bike accessories and equipment.  Plenty of picnic tables, bike racks and a big gravel lot if you want to start or end a ride there.  Rentals, too."}
{"text":"Right off the Montor trail.  Good ice cream, friendly staff, pleasant experience.  Help out local businesses like this!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and great options for ice cream right on the Montour trail!  Outside seating and places to stow your bike while you are there.

The food (basic grill food) was closed while I was there, so I just got ice cream. 

There is also a bike shop where it looks like you could rent a bike or buy other items for your bike. You can also rent a bike here."}
{"text":"Left a bike for repair the 2nd week in June for pick-up the first week in July cause I was gonna be out of town. Bike was not ready three weeks later. Never got a call, never got an e-mail. Then when I did pick it up two days later, the rear brakes were defective. Now, they may have been before (although I never noticed it) but obvious that no one test rode it. They essentially sent me out on a bike that was dangerous to ride. They did repair brake while I waited for 40 more minutes. Worst repair of a bike I have ever had - and I am an avid rider."}
{"text":"Really reasonable rates for rentals, and a great location right on the bike trail. Helmets are included in your rental, and you sign a release that says you agree to use the helmet. 

The woman at the counter suggested we go left on the trail, that way we enjoy the tunnel plus the coast downhill on the return trip. It was a great tip, and I believe I rode an entire mile coming back without using the pedals. 

There's a repair shop there, as well as a wonderful place to buy ice cream and BBQ. 

The trail itself is quite scenic, and there's a mix of runners, bikers and walkers. It's an enjoyable outing.

If you are tall like me,  they may not have a good fit for your rental. The attitude is \"one size fits all, we can adjust the seat.\". That works to an extent, but I would have enjoyed a larger frame."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's right on the trail. The guys working there are friendly knowledgeable and helpful. Whether you need air for a tire or a new bike they will help out. Had my bike serviced last summer and it was a quick turn around and done right. Highly recommend a stop by."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Ice cream is very good and always has different unusual flavors.  Great selection of bike equipment."}
{"text":"The Tandem Connection is a great little shop conveniently located along the Montour Trail in Hendersonville.  Housed in the historic, 100+ year old building that used to house the old Champion Coal Company Store, it is now a bike shop, rest-stop, and snack bar.  I have purchased a few bike accessories, eaten both some BBQ and Ice Cream here, and have also enjoyed just perusing the literature rack too.  A great place, and I am so glad it exists."}
{"text":"Today I rode with a group on the Montour trail and we started here at Tandem Connection.  There is a large gravel lot adjacent to their building for trail users to park their cars.  At the end of our ride, we ate lunch and talked about our ride outside at one of their picnic tables. The tables all have umbrellas so you aren't in the direct sun.  They have a nice BBQ menu for 6$.  I had BBQ chicken which was a whole breast between two thick slices if bread (looked like potato bread), a refreshing watermelon slice, and slaw.  It tasted great, especially after riding 30+ miles.  I followed that up with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream.  Made for a great end to the bike ride!"}
{"text":"Stopped for some Perry's ice cream before our stroll on the trail. There was about 10 or so flavors to choose from. We tried both the lemon sorbet and the bittersweet sinphony (coffee ice cream with fudge swirls and chunks). Service was fine, price was average, taste was fine, nothing special. If you craving ice cream on the trail it's a nice spot to stop. If you have to go out of your way I'm sure there are better options."}
{"text":"Tandem is right on the Montour Trail at the bridge over Morganza Road.  Nice to have Tandem open up.  You can get some food & beverage.  We have stopped to get a beverage and some ice cream (Perry's).  Coffee, lattes, cookies and oatmeal available.  Roadside BBQ sandwiches are also available.  

If you need to rent a bike or are looking to buy a bike, Tandem has both.  Bike accessories on sale, too."}
{"text":"They rented me the worst bike possible... It kept squeaking, gears didn't shift properly and the chain kept falling off.. Worst, most non-relaxing experience ever!"}
