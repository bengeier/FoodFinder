{"text":"Nice place! I had the soup (which comes with their signature sticky bun) and a salad (which was generous). The atmosphere is clean, bright and comfortable and the service friendly."}
{"text":"Having 30 years of food and beverage experience I was excited to try this new restaurant . The space itself was very clean and tastefully decorated. I found the menu lacked creativity . We ordered a few of their most popular sandwiches the Reuben and a pastrami portions are large and a decent value for the cost .however they lacked any real flavor or pizazz. The soup French onion was extremely salty ( maybe a minors broth )  it did not taste homemade . A little bit of color on the melted cheese a top the soup would have been a nice touch . Service was fast and friendly ( even though some of our food was staggered to arrive ) I would have been less generous and rated 2 stars but the warm sticky buns served at the beginning of the meal were friendly and very tasty .  I am not certain we will try again based more on the menu than anything else ."}
{"text":"Oh my ! It was worth the wait. I've been wondering what this was all about as I watched it going in.  Russ,our server,was too good to be true. We thought he owned the place. Talk about first class service in an upscale casual atmosphere ! He was a delight. Food was unbelievable, fresh, plentiful, and beautifully presented for casual dining. Bay Village has a new gem people need to know about. And to think we almost went to DQ instead."}
{"text":"Restaurant was not busy but poor service.  Had dirty spoon in soup and waitress took 10 minutes to check on us after bringing soup.   Also they brought the bread with the meal not with the soup.   Lastly, soup tasted like it was from a can not home made.  Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new 'deli' open in Bay, which the city really leaves us with nothing but a 10 minute drive into Westlake any time we want to grab something to eat.  After it opened a few months ago, there were a handful of Facebook badgers saying it wouldn't last more than a few months.  Not knowing what to believe, I'd always peek in the window driving down Dover to see a steady influx of people eating inside.  It appeared more people were giving positive reviews online, so I decided to try it out.    For a whopping 9 bucks, I got the Reuben sandwich that came with soup, hot rolls, and fries.  I must say, the sandwich more than impressed me!  The meat was definitely fresh, juicy, and very thinly sliced.  The fries and soup were also seasoned well.  You can't beat it for the price.  Good luck getting past the McDonald's drive thru window for less than 9 bucks!    Great job, and I'd definitely want to try more of their food"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my daughter.  We both ordered the capreise sandwich with chicken.  The sandwiches come with a cup of soup, sticky buns, and fries or coleslaw.   Everything was delicious and the service was warm and friendly.  The sandwiches were big enough that we took home leftovers.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is at the end of my street so I was really hoping it would be good... It seems reviews are all over the place, so my husband and I thought we would give it a shot. We were terribly dissapointed. The waitstaff was super nice I have to say... We went for brunch and the food was just egh... The presentation was mediocre and there was no butter. Nothing was hot, eggs were overcooked. The vibe was just off and I can't say why, the owner quietly stood around just watching everyone... Itwas dead at 11am and the music and art is weird. I was still excited to try the sticky buns people rave about - well they forgot to give them to us until I asked. I don't get what the fuss is about. They had two cheesecakes, both had nuts. They looked like they were frozen and bought from a large food supplier, nothing looked authentic or homemade. For $16.95 we were so bummed - would have much rather spend $46 (w tip) somewhere else. Too bad... We will not be going back though."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the atmosphere and service are terrific. The food on the other hand is mediocre. I had the hot pastrami which was very bland along with the French fries. This sandwhich is served with soup and a sticky bun which is pretty cool but those were also mediocre. If the food gets better my rating will as well!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The entire place was very clean. Staff was friendly. Very pleased with overall experience. Loved the fries too."}
{"text":"Happy from the minute we walked in !! Group of 10 and accommodated us with smiles, complimentary soup of the day and sticky buns with every meal to die for !!!! Every was so friendly, amazing service ! The food was hot and just delicious. Will be back, one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I was looking forward to another option for beak fast as the Bay Diner can have long waits. Sunday, food is served buffet style. All food on the buffet was cold to lukewarm other than the omelets made to-order. The sweet rolls at the table and chicken noodle soup were both good as well, though still not as hot as I would have liked them. Service was spotty. Like other reviewers, I hope they're just working out their kinks. For $16.95, I would expect much better."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem when it comes to sandwiches. They are MASSIVE and delicious. My favorite is the chicken club. And what's funny is that the best part about that sandwich is something you don't even realize is on it until you take a bite. They put ham on this club and wow, just wow. It's the best honey baked ham I've ever had. It takes the sandwich to a whole new level. Why it isn't featured by itself is beyond me. Throw in the complimentary soup and sticky buns for good measure. You are not leaving here hungry."}
{"text":"Senior Citizen-ish  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not that young.    This is a place I would take an elderly person to because the food is kinda bland.  Good for sensitive stomachs.  Even the sticky buns seemed kicked up institutional with added spices.  The soup was a tad salty (prob a Minors broth like a previous review mentioned).    I give it props for a very pleasant and clean decor.  More props because I'm sure they had to jump through fairy hoops to get around Bay Village's maze of red tape for their grand opening.  Must have been awful getting that place looking so new from the previous tenant.  I will definitely give this place another shot because I think it has potential.  The menu is simple, but I like that.  After all, food is just food.  I don't need crazy techniques with smears of sauce and a sprinkle of parsley to appreciate flavor.  Hopefully, a few tweaks from the kitchen will bring this place up to snuff for a fussy demographic."}
{"text":"Love this place. I was recently visiting family in Bay Village and we decided to try this restaurant. The hostess and waiter were incredibly welcoming and the food was so tasty! They serve sticky buns a la Miller's back in the day."}
{"text":"Interesting experience for dinner on St. Patrick's Day. Going to a Greek restaurant on a Irish-American national holiday in a very Irish-Catholic area we weren't sure what to expect so we entered with an open mind. We arrived about 90 minutes before closing (they close at the right time for a bedroom suburb 8:00PM) to find a upbeat, friendly, but tired staff after what turned out to be a very busy day for them. They were out of the 2 meals we wanted:  mini-Reuben's which is understandable on St. Patrick's day but they were out of gyros also. Fascinating occurrence at a Greek restaurant. Nevertheless the burger and pastrami sandwich were excellent. The sides of fries and cole slaw were delicious. Food delivery was slow but not unexpected late on St. Patrick's day on the West Side of Cleveland. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great take out service. Since there's no menu online the hostess took the time to go over the menu w/me , was ready in 15 minutes & i ordered a lot of food for Lunch! Lobster Bisque was AMAZING! Sticky buns were too ! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting my mom in Cleveland and she said we got to go there they have good sandwiches so she gets the chicken salad sandwich which is awesome and I got a mango salad with goat cheese which was out of this world wonderful and they serve these little sticky buns that you can't stop eating so now I have a problem -a huge addiction to the sticky buns.  Everything was perfect it was a delicious meal Russell our server was amazing great place great place I recommend it highly"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a couple months and finally had the opportunity.  The four of us walked in at about 5:45 on a Saturday evening.  We were a little surprised that there were only a few tables occupied.  We were seated promptly.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders.  We told her it was our first time there and asked for recommendation.  She made a few suggestions and we asked a few questions.   We asked for a few minutes.  She came back for our order.  At that time I asked about the gyros.  I asked if the meat was off the spit or frozen strips.  She said it was off the spit.  I love gyros and order them whenever they are available, but I cannot stand the pre-formed frozen strips.  I was hesitant, but finally ordered the gyro.  When it finally came out, I opened the bread to find what I believed to be the strips that I did not want.  The amount of meat seemed a little light.  All of the strips were the same size, same shape (a bit rounded in the ends and came to a point) and the same thickness.  I don't care how good you are with a knife, nobody can cut meat off the spit so precisely that each piece is exactly the same.  I asked her to take it back and i ordered a Ruben Sandwich.  All the meals came with a cup of soup.  The soup was Potato -Leek.  We expected the typical creamy potato soup, but this one was broth based with big chunks of potatoes and carrots.  The soup was very tasty, but it was only luke warm.  They served the table a basket of sticky buns.  They were warm and were very good.  They were served with a nice soft butter that was easy to spread on the warm rolls (I hate when restaurants serve butter so cold that it is impossible to spread)   The service was a bit slow, considering there were only a few guests in the restaurant,    One person in my group ordered the Mango Chicken Salad, which was enjoyed.  The greens we fresh and it was loaded with chicken and fresh fruit.  Another ordered a Tender Chicken Wrap.  They were happy with the wrap, but, like the soup, the fries were only luke warm.  The youngster in the group ordered the kid's cheeseburger.  The burger was a really nice size for the kids version, but it looked a little overcooked and dry.  This boy has never met a burger he didn't like, but he did complain that the bun was \"kinda crunchy\".    When my Ruben came out, it was delivered by the cook, not the waitress.  He took the opportunity to tell me that they gyro meat was off the spit.  When I pointed out the size and shape of the meat, he said \"that's because I cut it in half\"  HUH?  Sorry, but the only way I would believe that meat was off the spit is if I saw them cut it myself.  It seemed a little defensive that the cook had to come out to deliver the sandwich.  I was definitely put off by that.  On to my Ruben, it was one of the best I've had.  it was right up there with the Simons, Corky and Lennys and the Slymans.  There was a ton of corned beef on the sandwich and it was sliced perfectly - wafer thin.  The rye bread was grilled nicely.  My fries were nice and hot.  There were some issues but they only charged me 1/2 price for the gyro, and of course didn't charge me for the Ruben, even though the Ruben was $1.50 more than the gyro.  it wasnt necessary, but it was a very nice gesture.  Everyone in the group said they would go back and order their meal again.  I haven't decided yet, but if I do give them another shot, hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to find a reasonable brunch on Easter after calling around and many places were charging $35-$40..  We ended up at Panorama.  From the minute we walked in we were treated so very nice by everyone from the Hostess to our Waitress.  The food was fresh and delicious and their price was $16.95.  Very reasonable for an Easter Brunch.  Their chicken noodle soup was homemade and delicious.  We will be going back to try some deli sandwiches in the future.  I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in for an early Saturday breakfast with some friends.  They both got omelettes which looked good, especially with the other half of the plate covered in tasty looking home fried potatoes. I got the corned beef hash with poached eggs.  Best corned beef hash ever!  FINALLY, someone got the ratio of corned beef to potatoes right.  There was a LOT of corn beef and just enough potatoes to keep it interesting."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant because I had read some reviews where people where negative but I have to say, try it, you will enjoy it!   The place is clean, fresh, not overly crowded and the food is delicious. Freshly prepared with generous portions and prices that are affordable and worth the amount of food. We will be back, great place to enjoy family time."}
