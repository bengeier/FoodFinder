{"text":"This place feels like walking into a warm hug. Super friendly staff, cute furniture/decor. I can't wait until I have a weekend free to bring a book and order multiple rounds of magical sweet treats. I always love a place where you can watch people prepare things right in front of you. The first time I went I had an egg sandwich and a side of charred squash. Both exceeded my high expectations. I then also had apple cake which blew my mind.   I used to go here a lot in grad school when it was the Sandwich Shop and drunk-eat pancakes at 2 am. I'm so happy to see this spot in its current iteration to match my more... grown-up lifestyle."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in at this new luncheonette with farming roots, but kept missing their schedule.  Today I finally got to see the inside and ordered coffee and a veggie hoagie to go.  The veggie hoagie is a standout - the flavor coaxed out of each element was really well done!  Too often a veggie sandwich is a gloppy formless monolithic thing, but this bread was substantial (held up until lunch time, and didn't get soggy), and you could discern the distinct textures and flavors of pumpkin, radishes, carrots, and a lightly dressed lettuce and herb mix.  I loved it.  The folks inside were delightful, too.  I will look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Charming space, hilarious staff, and some truly great food, whether it's a donut and coffee for breakfast or soup and a sandwich for lunch. Places like this are rare and special, don't sleep on it"}
{"text":"Great Concept, Quaint space.  On a busy weekend, carry-out is a good idea.  Certain dishes are lacking that little something to separate them from most make-at-home breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Scrappy little place.  Just had their breakfast sandwich and coffee.  Very flavorful sandwich with lots of greens, egg, thin sliced potato and baguette like bread.  Very good coffee. Reminds me of Brooklyn.  Love this type of place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Quaint little cafe / breakfast spot with great food and coffee at a good price point."}
{"text":"I only have fantastic things to say about this dive of a diner! I'm a huge breakfast/brunch foodie and my breakfast here on a Sunday morning was hands down the best breakfast I've had in Pittsburgh. I had the bottomless coffee (in a quirky mug selected from the mismatched mugs), an egg breakfast sandwich, and a whole wheat doughnut. Everyone who works here is so pleasant, making the entire experience just perfect. I absolutely want to go back and experience seasonal menu changes. PRO TIP: Parking in this area is free on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars but I just can't.   The food is good but nothing magical- I tried the egg & sausage sandwich, the vegetarian sandwich, the vegetable soup, and the cabbage and apple salad.   The place itself is very small and intimate, which I like but the seating itself is awful! The benches are wobbly, small, and not confortable at all and one of the tables is positioned so that the bread rack is right over one of the benches making it easy for someone to hit their head (like my mom did)  If anyone from luncheonette is reading this please invest in new tables and chairs!!!"}
{"text":"I've never posted on Yelp before but my experience here compelled me to do so. My $6 + tip vegetable soup, which I got to go, is in a container that is less than half full. Not to mention it is the most tasteless thing I've ever eaten and that is not an exaggeration. On top of that, the service was slow. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice little space on the main drag on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield. Their sandwiches are really tasty and full of flavor. The place's ambiance and decor is very hipster."}
{"text":"This place is everything. Becca's vibe makes the neighborhood more real. Love you kids."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for lunch and were pleasantly surprised with great food, strong coffee with refills, and good vibes. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here, and it is absolutely delicious. So far I've gotten the breakfast hoagie, the parsley donut, the griddled potatoes and the hot herbal tea. All of them - delicious. You really get that farm fresh feeling when you eat here, plus, I love the cute decor that makes me think I'm eating at my great grandmother's house (complete with kitschy mug selection).   The *only* thing I wish is that there was a larger menu, but considering the size of this place, I completely understand why it's relatively limited. I also wish it had longer hours, since I hardly find myself in this neighborhood at this time of day, but considering it's a \"luncheonette\", I get that too."}
{"text":"Really cute place! The food is made with fresh ingredients and the staff is really friendly and attentive! I had the chicken salad sandwich and winter tea and both were delicious. I was there until they closed and as I was leaving they gave me a bag of donuts for the road on the house- so nice! There is very limited seating as it is truly set up as a luncheonette."}
{"text":"Great local spot for breakfast. Staff was friendly even though the little place was packed. We had the French toast and sausage breakfast sandwich and both were delicious. Coffee was served in the mug you grab off the shelve of unique ones."}
{"text":"This simple, thoughtful, playful restaurant has provided me with the best couple meals I've had in Pittsburgh recently.  The space is small, but well laid out with a counter and a couple tables.  Both times I've gone on a weekend before 10 am and didn't have to wait for a seat as a party of 2 or 3.  It's a charming combination of rustic and your weird aunt's kitchen from 1962 that hasn't been updated.  The music has been consistently bumping.  The food: yes, the menu is limited, but I would much rather have 12 phenomenal choices than 50 mediocre ones.  You can tell that each dish is built around its ingredients, which are all top notch and beautifully highlighted by the Chef's balanced preparations.  Whatever the griddle cake is, get it (turnip and carrot were both equally wonderful, like a fat pancake full of tender root veggies.  I know it sounds weird but it works so well).  The smashed potatoes are a vingarey delight.  Every pastry has been a fun surprise: none ever too sweet and always highlighting some flavor other than simply sugary.  The service: On my second visit, I was greeted like a regular.  You can watch the Chef run her efficient line, and just tell that everyone who works there seems to being enjoying each other and the food they're putting out.  There was a slight mix up in our food on my second visit (which just happened to be with my mom who was in from out of town), and we were sent home with a bag of donut holes and a couple other goodies gratis for our wait (which really wasn't much of a wait at all).  MORE OF THIS PLEASE.  Y'ALL ARE AMAZING."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast but pricy. If you are going to treat yourself- do it. If you don't like sitting near people- don't go here. I give all edible places in Pittsburgh a 3 stars but this was memorable. Not a big plate of food- but I really don't need that. I am still gaining baby weight and Dani had the baby over a month ago. If you are still hungry after eating here- grab a box of Cheezits. Or Goldfish. I mean seriously- those things should be illegal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place! Stopped by for Sunday lunch and was in awe by the vibe and friendliness of the staff. I love love the mugs, glasses, and plates. It speaks to the quirky feel and made you feel at home. We grabbed a coffee and tea (strong and tasty coffee and delightful herbal tea) and and ordered a breakfast hoagie and veggie hoagie. The breakfast hoagie is out of this world good!! Hubs got that and the veggies with the egg and potato patty was just amazing. The veggie hoagie was outstanding. The ingredients aren't warm, so keep that in mind if you're looking more for hot food. They bake their own bread and we were both wowed by it  If you come in as a pair and both get hoagies, I'd recommend sharing so that you each get half of one. It's served cut.  The ingredients are fresh and there is a lot of love in prepping. The staff were all in good spirits and that resonated throughout. They really set the tone for the place.   It's small, but the tables do turn pretty quickly. It's aim is for a diner type and it works well.  Hubs says \"it was yummy in my tummy.\""}
{"text":"AMAZING. Went twice in 2 days- soup sandwiches potatoes iced tea- everything is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. Good options for the vegetarian crowd. Had a donut, a veggie hoagie, and an egg sandwich. Very messy with lots of greens, but all delicious. Bread is great quality and fun to see it cooking at the back of the restaurant. Kind of reminded me of the quiet storm (dating myself there), in terms of atmosphere of collected 70s kind of stuff. Would have liked a different coffee choice."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place and I can't wait to go back!   I was so excited to check this place out when I heard it was opening. The owners have an organic farm just outside of Pittsburgh in Verona. I spoke to the one owner when I was there and he said what they are not able to grow or make themselves, they try to get from other local farms or vendors. A great way to support local! They make the pastries, the bread and anything else they can.  We both tried a breakfast hoagie, mine vegetarian and my partner's with sausage. The sandwiches came out topped with greens tossed in a light vinaigrette and shredded parmesan cheese. It was fresh, it was unique and it was absolutely delicious. We split a side of breakfast potatoes which had bits of toasted up bread on top to give it a nice crunch. We also split a ginger chocolate glazed doughnut because I couldn't pass that up. I don't have a huge sweet tooth and I couldn't get enough of it. One of the best doughnuts I've ever had--crusty, flaky and a perfect hint of ginger.   The menu is small, so I wouldn't recommend it for super picky eaters or someone looking for a traditional diner bacon-and-eggs breakfast. Some folks might think it's expensive if you compare it to...say...Denny's...($30 for what I described above plus a coffee and tea)...but believe me, you are paying a few extra dollars for GREAT quality. It's quite a small space, so expect to wait a little, but I promise it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are awesome. I also appreciate the super hipster vibe. However, the extremely limited menu leaves something to be desired. I consider myself a foodie and will eat anything but I would like more than 1 or 2 options for lunch.   This place is also super expensive. I am all for paying more for quality and ingredients. But I cannot justify coming here for lunch weekly and spending 12+$ for a small sandwich with no side. A lunch with a drink and side are over $20.   Overall the food is 4-5 stars but the prices and lack of options lowers my rating."}
{"text":"We were really excited to check this place out. Had coffee, scones, donut, griddle cake, and veggie hoagie. Everything tasted so fresh, really complementary flavors. Space is quaint, great colors, home-grown feeling. Wished I didn't live 5 hours away from this place."}
{"text":"I would eat here everyday if I could. The food is simple but astonishingly delicious. Many things have micro greens and thin sliced onions and some sort of magical vinaigrette on house made grilled bread that will put a huge smile on your face. It's small but we didn't have trouble getting a table and the people are lovely."}
{"text":"Charming little breakfast/lunch counter with fresh veggies and well-sourced meat... and lots of quirky personality.   Also, best coffee in Bloomfield BY FAR!!! I'd definitely recommend stopping in here instead of Crazy Mocha before your morning commute."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the breakfast and experience at bitter ends! The place is small and cozy, with the kitchen in full view. We were welcomed and directed on how to order by Sarah, who was super helpful and attentive. We got there right when It opened and could sit right away, but with limited seating It did start to get crowded by the time we were finishing up.   They offer commonplace coffee - yum! And you get to pick your own mug from their collection, something different that I thought was super cute! We ordered the sausage sandwich, the veggie hoagie, smashed potatoes and the bread pudding. All were delicious! The homemade bread really made the sandwiches. We ended up ordering food to go as well!   The menu said It was a daily menu so I am excited to return as see what the will offer next!"}
{"text":"The food at Bitter Ends is easily some of the best I've ever eaten. I just tried the breakfast hoagie and chicken sandwich and there was an incredible amount of flavor packed into every component of both. Check it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What's not to love? There's delicious food made with fresh ingredients, delicious bottomless coffee poured into a mug of your choosing, friendly service, and a cozy atmosphere. The pastries are homemade, the bread is homemade, and the veggies are locally grown.   I treated myself to a whole wheat donut and whoa, I've never tasted anything quite like it. It's been 24 hours but I already need to get my hands on another one. I also tried a veggie sandwich that was piled high with perfectly dressed greens, a perfectly runny egg, and perfectly creamy goat cheese. The baguette was out of this world.   If you're looking for an extensive menu, this isn't your place. But if you're a fan of thoughtfully curated dishes based around farm fresh ingredients, then this will be your jam.   Bitter Ends Luncheonette has everything you need for a solid, yet dare I say elevated(?), diner experience.   Also, whoever is in charge of the music, please let's be friends ok?"}
{"text":"A yeast and carb driven wonderland! Each dish my husband and I tried was creative, vegetal, and generously portioned. The well seasoned potatoes and leek frittata sandwich between two slices of masterfully perfected Tuscan bread were delightful. Also a highlight was the carrot glazed yeast doughnut...spongy and sweet goodness... a little less impressive was the vegetable soup, the stock fell flat despite the wholesome sprouts and radishes lovingly lavished within. The decor is shabby making space for the food and warm friendly service to take the center stage.  We will be back and thanks luncheonette for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I don't know what my favorite thing about this breakfast spot is. Maybe it's the early morning hours in the cozy atmosphere. Or sitting at the bar and watching your egg cook to perfection while you drink coffee out of any quirky mug of your choice. Or maybe its the fresh made bread, locally grown produce, delicious and meticulously made morning pastries.  I really love the egg sandwich and the dressing on the salad and the freshly shaved cheese that is piled to a mountain on top.  Breakfast here is the greatest, alone or with a friend. It's all my favorite thing."}
{"text":"Had such a fabulous lunch at Bitterends--was so happy to see their new spot in Bloomfield! I was always drawn to their stand at the various Farmer's Markets around town, and often heard friends rave about their food. They weren't kidding. Everything they make it simple, fresh, and SO flavorful. They take it back to basics and truly prove that it's all about quality. I believe just about every single thing on their menu they grow. Their new store front is super quaint. Order up at the counter, menu posted up on the wall, with one little table + four chairs, some counter seating for eating, and a long bench along the wall for seating/waiting. For lunch I ordered the vegetable soup, vegetable hoagie, smashed potatoes, and iced sumac tea. 10/10!!  Portions were small and the items were pretty basic, but everything was cooked to perfection. The soup was more of a veggie broth, with a few onions and potatoes. Crazy how something so incredibly simple could be so good. Not sure how the soup is seasoned, but it was fabulous. The vegetable hoagie was chock-full of flavors, fresh + toasted to perfection bread, some awesome vinaigrette, truly so simple but amazing. The smashed potatoes too were just perfect! Even the flavor on those was different but so great. Great spot for lunch, so happy to welcome them to the neighborhood! Will definitely be coming back regularly. Oh staff is so sweet and welcoming as well. Tons of different baked goods, coffee, etc. Welcome to the neighborhood, can't wait to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is so quirkily (is that a word?) quaint! Little quick eats breakfast and lunch joint. Delicious Commonplace Coffee is available, and the best part? You get to choose your own mug from a selection of silly options.  You kind of feel like you're just hanging out in someone's kitchen, not a restaurant. Minimal seating, but I think that's an asset as it gives the location a cozy feel.  Their baked goods are on point. I haven't tried a sandwich yet, but that's next on my list to try. The farm fresh eggs looked to be super yummy and the freshly baked bread is on display for everyone to see.  Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"So happy there is a place in the neighborhood to get a great veggie sandwich!!! Service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was cheerful"}
{"text":"Nice little spot opened up in the old DJ's sandwich shoppe.  Open for breakfast and lunch Wednesday thru Sunday.  They use fresh farmed veggies from the Bitter Ends Garden.  Small menu with 3 sandwiches, some pastries, bread, and dessert.  The menu today had a beet sandwich, a veggie hoagie and a egg with spinach and you could add lamb sausage on the menu along with a couple types of scones and a pumpkin desert.  Only about 10 seats and a church bench; the same as DJ's. I had the egg sandwich and a ginger scone.  Both were very good.   Nice little place that adds to the neighborhood."}
