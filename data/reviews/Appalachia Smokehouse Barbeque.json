{"text":"Smaller sister restaurant to the one on the Queensway. Doesn't have much street presence so blink and you'll miss it, but this place is a legit top quality bbq joint. I've been a few times now. It's a case of keep it simple, but do it well here. 

The have 3 sauces - Mild, Bold and Gold. First two are BBQ, the Gold is a mustard based sauce that goes best with the chicken. 

The core is pulled pork sandwich, pulled chicken sandwich and baby-back ribs:
Ribs - as good as you'll get, have only had them with the bold, but fall off the bone, meaty and sauce is great
Pulled Pork - Very large serving of pork topped with coleslaw, goes well with the bold
Pulled Chicken - My fav of the two sandwiches. I like the gold sauce with it, but the bold is the one that really stands out 

Well impressed with the fries, they're hand-cut, avg size and VERY crispy. The coleslaw is slightly creamy with a red cabbage base, pretty good. They also do sliders, chilis and soups, but I haven't tried them. 

Staff are very friendly and it's a nicely done little place inside. I'd go for the fries alone, but no way can you miss out on their bold bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I was very happy that a BBQ place opened in our neighbourhood, but unfortunately this was the absolute worst ribs we've ever had.  The ribs were nice and meaty, but the preparation was an insult.  The ribs were cooked in water and coated with a HORRIBLE  sour tomato sauce.  There wasn't even a slightest smoke flavour, and what was even more insulting that they never even been barbecued!  No grill marks, no BBQ flavour.  Do they think that we are idiots and won't recognize this?  How could you call yourself a smoke house, or a BBQ place?!  Seriously, ribs cooked in water.....?  And you won't even through them on the grill....?  We ended up washing off the horrible sauce, put our own BBQ sauce on it and put it on our BBQ.   That's a whole lot of work for take out food, not too mention $28 for a rack!  We just returned from the US, where we had plenty of amazing BBQs, but Toronto has some good ones as well.  Appalachia you have a lot to learn!  Please do not insult your customers!
A tip for customers, ask them specifically how long have they smoked the ribs.  The real smoke houses smoke their meat 12-16 hours.  Also look for the grill marks!  This might have been a fluke, but as a new establishment is not the way to introduce yourself."}
{"text":"Very happy to see this place thriving. Ribs are excellent, fries always made fresh, slaw is not too greasy and soup is savoury. Mac and cheese pretty good too, albeit not my bag.

Also, great staff."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighbourhood! Friendly and fast service, reasonable pricing, good food. We had a rack of ribs - decent sized portion, wished there was a bit more sauce (personal preference) and they were a tad more tender; coleslaw - fantastic, crunchy yet with sufficient dressing; chicken soup - very hearty; fries were good but needed a dash more salt. Overall a great experience, especially the service. Will return, and suggest you check it out :)"}
{"text":"Went for a brisket sandwich. \"Sorry sir, we're out or brisket.\" Settled for ribs and mac n cheese
The ribs appear to have been cooked in a oven and then re-heated and given a thin spritz of BBQ sauce. The mac n cheese was decent but a smallish order for 6 bucks. The coleslaw had a nice red colour but no flavour. The girl at the cash was also the one preparing the food. I expect that at a Subway but not at a BBQ joint. This place is no Black Camel. For a place just starting out in the area you would think the owners would be more hands-on. I left very disappointed."}
{"text":"I been to the other spot on queensway, but it's been a couple years, so thought I'd stop in to the lakeshore location since it's close to my place. Extremely disappointed. Got a simple pulled pork sandwhich with \"gold sauce\". I put it in quotes because there was no sauce there, just a pale watery dull yellow coloured liquid. I opened my wrapping to have a handful of mush with bread and meat. Added my own sauce to it. For 11 bucks? Give me a break, this was awful. It can't be smoked, had to be crock pot or baked, why the hell would there be so much water? You lost
My business."}
{"text":"Great great ribs! We preordered takeout, and one rack was more than enough for two people. Best I've had in a long time.

 Pulled chicken is my favorite. Also the fries are fantastic. Absolutely great sauce."}
