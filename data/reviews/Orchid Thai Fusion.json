{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Decor is beautiful, salad/desert bar just killed me and the time it took for my food to come out wasn't bad at all. Every plate looked beautiful and tasted great! Brought my friends who had never gone there before and now they want to go back :)"}
{"text":"All-You-Can-Eat anything always leaves me feeling ill (due to overeating, aka getting my money's worth). However, when it came to AYCE Thai food, this was unchartered territory for me. Admittedly, the menu is not by any means limited to \"Thai\", though everything does have an interesting Thai flavour to it.

Aside from your expected spring rolls (the crispiest and probably biggest surprise of the meal), salads, varied curries and pad thai, some slightly more unexpected menu options include dumplings, rack of lamb, crab legs and pho. *Note: the policy with the crab legs and lamb is one per person, per seating - lamb is good, crab legs could be fresher.

The food is good and the ambience is very welcoming and clean, with bright lighting, graceful white dishes, and tall vertical floral arrangements. Service, however, is a tad lacklustre. When some shrimp arrived undercooked and requesting for it to be microwaved a bit to doneness, the wide-eyed young server took the shrimp without so much of an uttered apology. Tea is also overpriced at $2.50 each.

If you're in the area looking for good food, perhaps try this place out for the atmosphere and selection of Asian \"fusion\" fare (you can always do the A La Carte menu). You'll be leaving deliriously full at the very least."}
{"text":"Went there recently for lunch, appearances can be deceiving, outside was kinda bland, but once entering what a surprise, very nice atmosphere.  Food came out in good time and tasted great. Very extensive menu from Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, all prepared reasonably well. Service was OK , mainly do to inexperience. Overall good, will be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible. Last time I was there with at least 20 people. the waiter was so pissed off that we had more than 40 crab legs was separately order and threatened to charge us if we don't finish. Obviously 40 legs werent enough. I mean it's an all you can eat... ~_~"}
{"text":"We celebrate my wife's birthday here, with 18 guests including 5 kids under 6. Worked out well in fully inclosed(kept the kids in, lol) private dinning room. They have an all you can eat salad bar, & then dishes to go. We were all satisfied & full. Great value, & service. You have to love these family run restaurants. It's right next to montfort."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The setting is beautiful.  The food is always fresh, hot and delicious.  I really recommend the Chicken Peanut Sauce and Green Curry, both on Coconut Rice.  Every dish I've had is fantastic.  It's one of my favourite places; great ambiance and often very quiet.  Never had a problem getting a table."}
{"text":"An absolute hidden-gem.  The service is prompt and efficient.  The food quality is top notch.  The outside appearance of this restaurant is very deceiving, because from the outside the place looks a bit ghetto.  But once you get inside everything has been renovated to look very modern and inviting.  

I know people who drive from Brampton and Mississauga just for this place.  If you live anywhere in Oakville, its worth the drive to this place."}
