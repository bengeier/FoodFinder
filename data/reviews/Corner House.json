{"text":"This is a multiplex old house in main street stouffville turned into a restaurant. Upon my arrival, the entire restaurant smelled like french fries and fried food. The food and beverages are very pricy and they try to convince the public they are a 5 star restaurant. far from it. for example a bottle of domestic beer is $6.75 and an 8 OZ steak is 36 dollars. This is the same price you pay at the KEG bar and grill and your bartender and waitress are hot and sexy!   let me spell it out again: THIS IS NOT A GOURMET RESTAURANT, it JUST HAS GOURMET  P R I C E S !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a Sunday recently. Place looked beautifully kept and was pretty quiet this morning with only one or two other tables. The menu looked to have some really tasty brunch options. We ordered the eggs Benny and the \"double bacon\" hash. The Benny was about a 7/10, pretty average with good peameal served on a scone. The hash however was brutal. Way too many potatoes that were simply not cooked enough. It's like they were boiled but not finished to make them into breakfast potatoes. At least 3/4 of my dish was spuds. Otherwise it was tasty overall but there was barely a hint of the \"double bacon\" other than a couple of pieces of tasty peameal. To top it off my cucumber and tomato salad was swimming in the grease of the rest of my dish. Lots of potential here, just horrible execution."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to have brunch in the burbs and found Corner House.  It's a pretty nice restaurant with friendly service and good food. 
Tables are covered with white linen and for Easter they left chocolate eggs on the table for customers (cute!). 

I both ordered the the Eggs Charlotte ($12) which was basically an eggs benedict on their homemade scones with smoked salmon accompanied by potatoes.  It was really good - the salmon wasn't salty (I've had previously overly salty salmon run-ins before so I've become a bit weary of it).  I also ordered fresh berries ($8) which come in a bowl topped with whipped cream.  It was nice to counter the heaviness of the eggs & potatoes with the berries.  It made me feel better about myself (something healthy...sweeping aside the whipped cream). 

I noticed that on one of their blackboards they were advertising their 52 weeks around the world so every week their menu would feature food from different countries - pretty neat!"}
{"text":"had a three course dinner with a few drinks. the lighting was perfect to create an evening of romance, it wasn't too dark nor too bright. candles on tables. you could just hear the kitchen in the background- a pleasant but not dominating noise. professional servers. a full house. i had lobster, it was perfect, wasn't overdone. you could see the other customers enjoying their meals as well. the plates were well presented but NOT overdone with artistic \"flare\" good portions as well.  a favourite in stouffville"}
{"text":"The corner house is a very quaint place and looks great. It is also one of few French restaurants I've been to, so I was excited to try it.
When we arrived, there was literally nobody there to greet us. We saw someone in the back and asked if they were open yet and he said yeah someone should come downstairs soon. About 5 min later we were going to leave when a man came to seat us.
We started with the calamari that was very well done. Not at all chewy and nicely grilled. 
I went for the seafood pasta which I thought would shine at a nice restaurant and it was totally tasteless. I expect a nice buttery white wine kind of sauce but it was just totally bland and fishy. 
The husband got cheese ravioli with tomato sauce which was good, but very basic. 
For the price, I wouldn't return. Such a shame since we wanted to book our rehearsal dinner here - the food just wasn't up to par for the price."}
{"text":"Great intentions, poor execution.

I went there for Sunday brunch with my wife. We were quickly seated in nice comfy chairs by the window.  The decor was nice and just the sort of \"country cafe\" we were looking for.  I thought the menu was well put together and had a few standout items (like duck bacon anyone?) We were left with our menus for quite a long time and another couple who came in after us were already being taken care of.  Eventually orders were in--Charlotte (eggs benedict w/ smoked salmon) and a Classic breakfast w/poached eggs.  The waitress came a few minutes later with our drinks and couldn't remember between the two of us who ordered the coffee.  Coffee was mediocre.  From ordering, it took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive and while we waited we were seen to by two different waitresses who kept asking us the same questions.  It doesn't seem like teamwork or communication are high priorities in the hiring process.

The food was well presented and I was looking forward to my eggs.  They served their eggs benedict on a scone, which is a nice variation from the normal English muffin.  The dish would have been better if the scone wasn't served cold.  The eggs were a bit overcooked and the potatoes lacked seasoning.  My wife's eggs were also overcooked.  Her toast was hardly toasted and definitely not buttered.  We eventually had to ask for some butter as no one checked-in until we were nearly done with our meal.

Despite Stouffville's limited selection, I still would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We had the steak salad, grilled calamari, eggplant fries and beef tenderloin. Server was lovely but overstretched. Could work on food presentation. Will definitely go back though because of the quality of the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Corner House is my former go-to lunch break destination when I'm biking through the country-side North of Toronto. Their morning/early afternoon menu is exclusively brunch. It's relatively small at about 5 breakfast and 5 lunch items. It's also pricey; it really makes me feel like I haven't left the City. I usually get the $18 Prime Rib sandwich, we is excellent. It's tender, juicy, and cover in delicious Au Jos but not so much that you can't eat with your hands (and maintain your dignity). The mushrooms and bun are very fresh and really make the sandwich.

The food is excellent, but the main reason I'm only giving The Corner House three stars is the decline in service quality. The first time I went here in April, I pulled up on my bike the owner greeted me, and immediately brought me a giant pitcher of water. The service was prompt; they understood that I wasn't interested in lounging on the patio all afternoon. My list visit there about a week ago was a sharp change. I sat on the patio for several minutes before I gave up and went inside. There was a gentleman with his kids already waiting by the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. He eventually gave up and left. I was a little more persistent and hunted down a waiter. The place wasn't packed; about 12 tables serviced by four people. Once I found the waiter, I took my seat on the patio and order the usual. When he came back to deliver my food, he dumped it on the table, mumbled \"here\" and took off back inside. I never saw him again; no return to check on my meal or refill my water. When I was done, I had hunt down a server inside again to retrieve my check. This was by far the worst service I've received at The Corner House, but the rest of the times it's been nothing special. And at these prices it should be!"}
{"text":"It's a cute restaurant. Staff very friendly. Food was a bit overpriced. I've ordered the spinach and tomatoes eggs benedict, the scone on the bottom was very hard to cut through and to chew as well. There was separation in the hollandaise sauce, it's quite noticeable once the server put my plate down."}
{"text":"I have been twice for brunch at the Corner House for two occasions


I have to say that the food is great

I have had the Jack Daniel's pancakes twice and they were delish

I think though they need a bit more of that syrup on the pancakes

I haven't had the bennies yet but from what I saw both times when my family members ordered them, they looked quite yummy

Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"I think this will always be a special go to place for us. It's such a quaint restaurant away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city. Service is always great and the food is great as well. 

The first time we ate here was 2013. And we've been coming back at least once a year to celebrate something special. Mostly all the food that we've tried have been part of the breakfast or brunch menu. We haven't had any of their dinner plates but we're hoping to come by for dinner some time. 

The last time we went there though I was a bit disappointed. The pancakes were a bit burnt in the bottom and thought they could mask it with more cream and syrup. The scone wasn't great as well. Nonetheless, it's a good thing the service was more than superb."}
{"text":"I came here last night (Saturday) at 9pm hoping to have a late dinner on their cute patio. Was offered a late night menu because the kitchen was closing so I ordered a pizza. Huge disappointment . Unfortunately the pizza was exactly like a frozen pizza (mccain delissio) which is 4.99 at your local grocery store. They charged $20.00 for this which was clearly overpriced . I don't mind paying $20 but not for a frozen pizza. The pizza was definitely not homemade. Very disappointing . The waitress was nice and the patio is cute. I live nearby and will not be back after this incident.  I would have rather the waitress tell me there is no pizza left then give me one that was clearly out of a box.  :("}
{"text":"A restaurant set into the homey atmosphere of a house with great service and a good environment to enjoy your meal. There was a bit of a questionable moment in the beginning, as I walked in and there was no one to great us. I had to stand by the door for a good 5 minutes before anyone saw us. It might be because of the configuration of the house, since it isn't open concept and the server had to move from room to room constantly during the night. 

I had the Salad Bowl, which was a mix of a bunch of greens with nuts and black rice. A good texture combination and one of the lighter options available on the menu. I'm not sure what about this place makes it 'French' though, since most of the menu items can be found in most restaurants. Also, I would have given the place a higher rating if it wasn't for the price. My salad without any protein was $15, while a burger can easily be $20. That is easily more than most restaurants in downtown Toronto. A good place to come if you want to treat someone, but definitely not for the everyday meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for many years. It has changed ownerships once or twice over the years however, has remained to be a Stouffville favourite. The main floor is used for general dining. The second floor is popular for Sunday Brunch. The third floor can be used to host events/parties etc... 

The decor is cozy, hardwood floors/ updated colours.

I had lunch here and ordered Lobster Mac and Cheese. It contained nice sized chunks of lobster, mac and a light flavoured white cheese sauce. As my side I choose Spinach salad. My coworker ordered a large Caesar salad. I must say 5/5 on presentation. He seemed to enjoy the salad as well.

I felt the service was a little slow but then again, this is not the type of restaurant that a person attends while in a rush so maybe it was just me....

Next time I would like to try the Grilled Lobster and Brie sandwich..."}
