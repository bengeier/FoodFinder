{"text":"Horrible food! By far one of the worst Chinese food restaurants I've ever had. Sorry to say it but Arizona just doesn't know how to cook somewhat decent Chinese. Don't bother wasting your time or money."}
{"text":"Orange chicken, it's amazing! Nice atmosphere, great service!
Also,  Chinese beer \" tsing Tao\" don't miss that when you went there!
Recommend!"}
{"text":"I only ordered from here because my regular chinese delivery was closed. My fried rice was burnt and dry and hot and sour soup was cold. Won't order again."}
{"text":"We did the online ordering tonight and it turned out great.
We got the Kung Pao chicken, Egg roll, Fried rice and Chicken Low Mein.  All dishes were very delicious. The food arrived hot which is always awesome.  
We will be giving this place another try soon"}
{"text":"There were 2 dead flies in the fried rice. Eeks! I don't know if the authorities have checked out their kitchen. It's extremely unhygienic. Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"So I have ordered take out from this place... Because it's one that delivers on a day that I did not plan meals in advanced and actually want to eat something \"Chinese\". First off this is so Americanized Chinese menu so nothing ever appeals to me... But I decided to try my hand at some Mushu Chicken... They should change the description of pancakes to flour Mexican Tortilla!  Come on Hong Kong house, you've been using this atrocity for the past 6 months and nobody noticed or complained? There are markets that provide premade chpancakes if your that lazy.  At least you offered a refund, after we demanded it, but Now my husband has to drive over for a refund, we were hoping for a nice quiet Tuesday night in. smh."}
{"text":"This place is clean and delicious! The server was nice as well. I ordered the wonton soup for lunch. It was so yummy! Not too salty, and the vegetables were tender and crisp - not overcooked. It was more than with the price. I would definitely recommend this place! Thanks for lunch! :)"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! It's our favorite for carry out Chinese. Great flavors and happy to accommodate special requests."}
{"text":"I ordered food online (great feature!) last night and picked it up in about 20 minutes. Everything was hot, fresh, and very tasty! I'm new to the area and have nothing to compare it to, but I don't even know if I want to try anything new! It was the best tasting Asian food, I think I've ever had! We had the beef broccoli, chicken with mushrooms, orange chicken, lemon chicken, crispy beef, fried potstickers, eggrolls, and chicken lo mein. It was all excellent! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was craving sesame chicken and found this place nearby. Took a gamble and was impressed not only by the quality and taste of the food but also the lunch price and portion size. It was a great deal and service was awesome. Highly recommend if you are looking for a place to try for lunch that offers meals w soup, egg roll, and won ton included at under 8 bucks."}
{"text":"If Yelp would let me give 0 stars, I would give this restaurant ZERO stars. The customer service was downright awful! Without exaggeration, the young man who was our server, said a grand total of 3 phrases to us: \"ready to order?\" \"what kind of rice/soup?\" and \"here's your bill.\" He never said hello, smiled, checked on us, or worse, didn't say ANYTHING when we told him there was a MOSQUITO in my egg drop soup. He just looked at it, took it away, showed the other older woman who works there, and never apologized or offered to make it better in any way. And neither did she when she dropped off our entrees. And as soon as he took my soup away, and the rest of my family's soup back, he brought out more egg drop soup for other diners. I would bet a lot of money that they served those customers from the same bug-infested soup pot. When he finally delivered our check, I asked if he was going to say anything or do anything about the bug in my soup. He just looked at me, still not saying anything, took the check back and comped my meal. After 10 minutes of him blatantly walking past our table a dozen times to help other diners, we had to walk up and insist he finalize our bill, STILL NOT SAYING ONE SINGLE WORD to us. Between the questionable food preparation practices and the absolute lack of customer service, I cannot believe this place is still open. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"First Asian Restaurant that I found that makes a egg foo young that they can be proud of. A very nice surprise, I wish I lived close enough for delivery."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this new place since it's walking distance from home and there isn't a whole lot to choose from in the Tramonto community! I was sooo disappointed especially for the prices! My rice was chewy on the outside and crunchy in the middle. When I called and complained they didn't offer to refund my meal or even give me some sort of freebie or discount! For a new business I found this strange.They seem like the type of place that will close within the 1st year and re-open with a new name."}
{"text":"Sweet and Sour Pork was dry and the sauce was watered down to the consistency and taste of fruit juice.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Sad that we don't have many choices in desert hills. Thought I would give Hong Kong Asian one more chance (I came 2 years ago and it wasn't good)
Nothing has changed. Rude lady took my order, seriously sounded like the \"....and then ....person\" and  she wanted .75 cents to upgrade to brown/fried rice on the kids meal.  No biggie, no problem. However the guy behind me orders white rice and he gets told they have no more white rice but they will give him fried... ok whatever.  She never left the register and we were standing next to each other. Did she telepathically know the rice was gone? Weird.
I get my food and the Mongolian beef was all onions, maybe 5 small pieces of meat.
The orange chicken was sweet and sour at best and the hot and sour soup was some lukewarm broth with some vegetables... ew!  Sorry but I can't come back.   Just upsetting to spend 47 dollars and not eat."}
{"text":"Food is good, but, water in the glass tastes funky. This was true on multiple occasions. Also, went in one night to an empty restaurant, my husband and I were offered a small table. We asked for a booth instead and were told no! We left and never went back."}
{"text":"Me and some friends walk in. The lady at the front desk started yelling saying here or to go I couldn't quite understand what she was saying I told her I'm sorry she said are you going to eat here or you going to go. loudly everybody at the restaurant look at us it was embarrassing I told her you know what we are going to go and walk out I agree with customers nawar no respect whatsoever. I think she have marriage issue.."}
{"text":"Went for take out and was very disappointed.  Every dish tasted as though a salt shaker fell into the wok.  Extremely greasy too.  First time I ever threw Chinese food away after only a few bites.  Oh, nearly forgot...the fried rice was crunchy old.  Someday we will get good Chinese food in the far north valley."}
{"text":"Take out service was very fast. Jumbo (not really!) shrimp with mixed vegetables, spicy, was simply fantastic. The transformation of this establishment from donut shop to coffee shop to a sit down restaurant is incredible. The atmosphere is pleasant and looks to be very comfortable. I can't wait to bring the family back for a meal."}
{"text":"One of the best in AZ!!
don't know what some of the reviews here are talking about?!
I left a tip also but here it is again!!
One of the best Scottsdale has to offer!!!
 if not in the top 3 in all of AZ!
One of the best orange chicken!
One of the best lo mein noodles!!
One of the best chicken curry!!
Teriyaki chicken!! So flavorful!!
Right amount of spices and flavor!!
Don't miss out!! Treat yourself to this Asian spot.
It's a nice, clean and friendly staff authentic
Hong Kong food and chef and 
Lunch specials!! The prices and portions are really good for buck$$$
There's plenty of reasons to stop in here for lunch or dinner!!
One of my favorite spots in AZ!"}
{"text":"When I went here I believe the actual owners (husband and wife) were working as the waiting staff. The wife should not have been waiting tables and was constantly passing back and forth from the table. If I scrunched up the straw paper and put it on the table she was there in seconds to grab it. The experience felt very intrusive. That being said I know she meant well and did not mean to be rude, especially taking into account there is an obviously large language barrier and cultural difference present.  
The food was very delicious, very fresh and not at all over blown with sugar and salt like most Chinese food restaurants do to appease the American consumers. I shall return and forfeit my dollars."}
{"text":"Not enough meat!
Ordered Mongolian Beef & Kung Pao Beef. Both had a ton of veggies but only a few pieces of meat. Pretty disappointing. The flavor of the meals was alright though. 
The fried rice is not real fried rice. It's like an artificially flavored fried rice with pieces of corn & carrot in it. 
The hot & sour soup was a big disappointment too. Very bland. 
Overall, will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Opened where the Krispy Kreme donut shop used to be, it's a little disappointing for a Chinese restaurant. Most of the food seemed disgusting, with a waiter basically bringing out a noodle soup that consisted of a bowl of warm water, and a block of dry, packaged noodles. The waiter then just placed the block of dry noodles in, and left, without stirring or anything. The chicken was decent though, and I think it was the Kung-Pao chicken that was the best.

The service was adequate, but truthfully, hard to judge, since they did what was necessary to get out food, pay the bills, etc. but never had a conversation with us. I wouldn't say they were rude, or distant, but they weren't that friendly with the customers.

Overall, this place was disappointing in it's ability to deliver good food, and the service wasn't too friendly as well."}
{"text":"I thought the food was OK at best. Nothing special about it. It did not seem that fresh and I the fried rice was probably the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the special dinner for two which included soup, appetizers, two entrees and rice.  The egg drop soup was good, the appetizer platter was so much food but by the time we finished it, we were too full to eat our dinners other than just taste them. We got teriyaki chicken and kung pao chicken and both were very good, although we wished the teriyaki glaze would have been thicker. The ingredients in the entrees were very fresh and nice. Service was courteous and prompt, as was the food. We got to go boxes and have enough food left over for lunch tomorrow. We will definitely go back there again the next time we are in the mood for Asian food."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Chinese take out and they deliver! Their fried rice is excellent and anything we order the food portions ample. General tsao chix is really good. 

My only wish is that they would include the crunchy noodles with orange sauce. Otherwise its great 

Delivery! In this area! So rare :)"}
{"text":"Good food.  In fact, the only place in the Desert Hills area with decent Chinese food.   I often get take out and there service is very fast.  My only complaint would be if you order close to closing time your meal will likely taste as if it was made earlier in the day.  Overall a good place."}
{"text":"Friendly hostess.

The price doesn't constitute the quality.  Drop the price 20% and this place will rock.  Price point can increase return customer base and loyalty.  If I don't say Wow after paying my bill (to go) and then say Wow after eating, then I'll just be the once or twice a year customer.

I agree with the other review that the containers leak.  Easy on the sauce please.

I will try again and see if I have a better experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch special shrimp with lo mein. Lunch special came with soup egg roll cream cheese puff and fried rice. Food came out fast and was absolutely delicious all for a little over 7$. Amazing value and great food. Will be eating here again for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite. Every time my parents are in town we order from here. The soft noodles are the best I've ever had. Any entree we have ever order is great. The dine in experience is not my favorite but great place for take-out."}
{"text":"The General Tso's chicken was very bland. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because the steamed dumplings were decent. We ordered delivery and it came pretty quickly. I just wish the food had more flavor."}
{"text":"We were regulars for lunch, but after a baby roach in the pork fried rice, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim with my family and first of all I'm a vegan and usually it's very easy for me to personalize when eating Asian foods. When I was browsing the menu, there seemed to be a few vegan options. I asked for fried rice with no egg when ordering and the server very rudely said that it was already made. The food tasted very plain to me, but overall it was the customer service that was awful. The server was very rude when asked any questions and taking our order."}
{"text":"Food was excellent everything we had a lot of different stuff was all good well size portions prices slightly higher but you get what you pay for excellent food coming from a New Yorker"}
{"text":"I am totally confused about this place.  The doors facing Northsight are locked but yet have an \"open\" sign.  Saw 4 asian guys playing some sort of game on a table and they saw me but didn't open the door.  I went around to the door  on the other side which was open.  NO ONE was eating there.  The young lady at the cash register seemed to be shocked to see a customer.  The place had the smell of raw sewage so I didn't take a chance to eat there.  Figured that a place that smells so bad might be bad for my health.  Ate there a while back and I thought the food was good.  Something is out of whack here...  Something not good."}
{"text":"I'll have to admit, I did not visit this restaurant when I read some of the initial reviews from the time in which it originally open.That was a mistake! My husband and I have enjoyed multiple delicious meals both in the restaurant and through takeout over the last year. I can highly recommend some of the basic entrées including orange chicken, sweet-and-sour chicken, spring rolls, chicken eggrolls and their boneless spareribs. As many times as we've eaten there in this last year, they never disappoint! Service is prompt and friendly! Food is hot, tasty and the serving size is very good! Give this little gem, tucked in the corner, your business!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but all the reviews above 2 stars must be fake. I hate writing reviews when I say something bad about someone but your better off starving. I just had one of the worst meals of my life. On top of that, Asian food is my favorite type of food, so this is a real low. STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally tried this place out. I was craving Chinese food and I just wasn't in a mindset to drive down to Phoenix for it. 

The Egg Foo Yung had salt pockets, which tells me they didn't mix the batter enough before frying it. They were huge however, and FULL of flavor; crisp on the outside, perfectly moist in the middle. The gravy needed a little work and a little less cornstarch.

The Orange Chicken had a nice spicy-sweet sauce and was great.

The fried rice reminded me of getting House Special fried rice in Chinatown, USA. Perfectly fried up, you could tell they did it the proper way by using cold white rice. On a side note, so many restaurants just use hot rice to make fried rice and it really gets gummy and nasty.

The cashew chicken was delicious. Sweet and salty, the sauce was perfect, the fresh veggies in it were perfect, and the chicken was tender. 

For the four dishes it was 40 bucks. A lot of people are saying this place is too expensive, but I disagree. Ten bucks an entree tends to be the tipping point between bad and good Chinese food. I was impressed with fresh veggies, properly cooked ingredients, and moist chicken.

Service was great for my to go order, however they were packed, and in the 5 minutes I was there saw two tables get up to flag down a waitress. It's my thought that the only Chinese food you go and do sit down at is PF Changs and a hole in the wall in a urban Chinatown like Seattle, DC, or NYC. Everything else has gotta be take out! 

Try it out - you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"Food was blah, service was... weird.

We asked for a plate of broccoli for my 6 year old. Pretty simple request, right? \"We can't do that.\"  I said, \"I assure you, you can. You have steamed broccoli, and you have plates. You just go back in the kitchen and put some steamed broccoli on a plate and bring it out.\" He went to ask in the kitchen, and after a lot of yelling in Chinese, came out and confirmed that they could not do that. Wow. Really?"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place for the first time tonight and was very pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and it arrived in a timely manner. Great to know that next time I'm feeling lazy and hungry I have these guys to bring me yummy Chinese food!"}
{"text":"First time stopping in for take out after driving by hundreds of times.

First I should say that I'm not a fan of Chinese food in general, but I thought this was good. Got the sweet and sour pork combo, which included fried rice, a small egg roll, and a cream cheese rangoon.

The sweet and sour pork was deep fried, but the batter was still very light and crispy. The two sauces included complimented the pork well. The egg roll and rangoon (the combo part) were quite good as well.

The only disappointment was the fried rice. It tasted like it was fried in molasses. It was sweet and heavy, which was not really to my liking. The rice was almost all rice, with very little egg or vegetables.

Side note: They give you a TON of food with each meal. Seriously, they didn't skimp so don't go overboard on the sides.

I would definitely come back here if I was looking for Chinese, but I would skip the fried rice.

By the way, they did a very nice job decorating the restaurant. Much different than a Krispy Kreme!"}
{"text":"I would really give this a no star. The customer service was horrible. After spending $41 on three entrees and crab puffs, I noticed I had only received one sweet-and-sour sauce with the order. I left my purse in the car and went back in to ask for a couple of sweet-and-sour and one hot mustard sauce. I was given one sweet-and-sour and one hot mustard and when I asked for an additional, the lady screamed \"that will be one dollar!\" I had left my purse in the car and went to leave when she shoved it toward me on the counter.  I was really surprised and embarrassed and went to the car. I called from my car and asked what their policies were so that I would know for the future and the lady screamed \"I am too busy to talk now\" and hung up the phone on me! Now I know for a fact they were not very busy but I was appalled at the overall customer service. I will not be returning. The food was good but the horrible customer service was not worth it!"}
{"text":"Pros:

* Food was brought very quickly
* Food was wet but the backstroke was unnecessary
* Clean
* Smells good
* No television!

Cons:

Buddha's delight was the exact same, uninspired mixture of vegetables as our Cashew Chicken and Pepper Beef.  Tons of giant pieces of green pepper and tons of giant pieces of onion.  And tiny pieces of celery.  And no mushrooms!  What duh?  Whatever happened to Chinese vegetables, like snow peas, bamboo shoots, or bok choy?  Granted, the Cashew Chicken did indeed include water chestnuts but, as another reviewer mentioned, the chicken is PROCESSED.  Gross.  The pepper beef was in a typically banal, salty, dark brown sauce.  

I used to seek out Chinese restaurants because they were the go-to place for \"clean\" food.  But the menu here exemplifies how far such places have degraded.  Of all the dozen or so chicken options, only one was not deep fried or breaded but actually stir fried.  Same goes with the Beef section, just one such option. 

Unimpressed.  Now that they are past their bumpy start, I will take my business back across Carefree Highway to Tao Kitchen #2 or Shanghai in Anthem.  Both are better quality.  (By the way, Sesame Inn is the best Chinese in the Desert Foothills.)

Footnote:  Just like plastic bags in grocery stores, I know it has now become commonplace for take-out to be handed over in styrofoam, clam shell boxes.  Hong Kong Asian Cuisine is no exception.  I spurn such boxes for many reasons:

1) The absence of traditional Chinese takeout boxes degrades the specialness of the Chinese experience.
2) Clamshells leak, a lot.
3) If you don't want leakage in your vehicle you must ask for a crinkly plastic bag. So then you have leakage in the bag and therefore on the back of your hands upon removal.
4) Styrofoam is not recyclable.
5) Despite my best efforts, sliding food out of the container onto a plate is always, always a messy experience.
6) The inside top of the box accumulates condensation which, inevitably, runs over my hands.
7) They communicate to me that the owners are concerned with cutting corners."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area so we decided to give this little restaurant a shot. Came in for an early dinner and it wasn't too busy- 1 couple dining in and the had a few take outs. We ordered the house fried rice and it was okay, nothing fancy. The customer service was good- the server was an older woman and she was super sweet and checked up on us frequently. The overall vibe of the restaurant wasn't all that great though. Very quiet- don't remember if there was even music playing. May or may not come back."}
{"text":"I am just excited to have something quick by the house.  The sizes of the dishes are pretty large and my husband and I can get one entree and then I make steamed dumplings or egg rolls at home.

I have tried a few of the chicken dishes (all requested to be made spicy) and I thought they were all good.  The one drawback is most all the chicken entrees are fried.

I did try the mongolian beef and that was not good - I usually do not order beef but wanted to try.  I would not recommend.

Yes, I agree with the other reviews that Hong Kong Asian is overpriced for what it is, but I am not bringing by 2.5 yr old and newborn to PF Changs so it is what it is the next few months!  They need to work with Groupon, DealChicken or Living Social!"}
{"text":"Bought 2 soups and 2 mains here last week. Our mains didn't have enough sauce on them and our sizzling rice soup was missing the sizzling rice (seriously, how the eff do you forget the sizzling rice for sizzling rice soup??). I called the restaurant and they said they would make a new soup for me next time I came. 

Fast fwd to a couple days later, I grabbed a chow fun main and ordered my replacement soup. They did remember the sizzling rice this time-2 small post-it sized squares of it....it was like they gave the least amount possible just to claim they did give rice. The soups both times had a heavy amount of soy sauce and again, the mains didn't have enough sauce. (are you guys rationing the amount of sauce used or what??)

I think we're better off throwing a rock and going to whatever Chinese place it hits."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to this place!  Used to have \"decent\" food, certainly not the best, but edible.  We used to order 2 or 3 times a month, however the last several times we've ordered it has just been a HUGE disappointment.  The egg rolls are a grease slick, the \"fried\" rice is tasteless and my Kung Pao Chicken almost inedible due to the overwhelming amount of black pepper used.  Black pepper in Kung Pao Chicken - really???  My husband and I always order extra, extra spicy and that had helped a lot.  The last several times extra, extra spicy has meant an exaggerated and  overwhelming amount of black pepper!, not the normal Chinese red chilies.  For some reason the cook thinks they are very expensive and is very miserly in their use.  If we are lucky, we might find 2 chilies in our order.  For the time being, Hong Kong has lost 2 regular customers.  We might try them again in about  6 months and see if they're back.  Of course, if we find a new fav Chinese restaurant, we won't be back and that is doubtful, even now."}
{"text":"Dropped in after a weekend in the high country. We ordered your basic Asian Cuisine.  My chicken was rubbery and undercooked.  Flavors were lackadaisical. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is horrriiibbbblllleee. The egg drop soup seems to be poisoned by this yellow acid that kills the flavor of the egg drop soup. My mom ordered lo mein (vegetarian) and it was so salty. It was as if they poured Salt into the food. My dad ordered kung pao shrimp and just terrible.  I cannot believe this restaurant exists and the service is not even great."}
{"text":"Okay, the food is pretty good although it's a little over priced. The little old lady that works the register makes me want to run to the hills every time I step foot in this place. She doesn't greet you and is quick to get you out of there by ignoring you, being pretty rude and acting like you're a nuisance. That's why I get take out when I do want it lol run in and get the F out."}
{"text":"I recently just moved here to Scottsdale and I kept telling my husband that I wanted some yummy asian-chinese food but didn't know where to go or buy from. So one day, he brought home a brochure from this place and told me that he actually had it for lunch on his break and he recommended it to me if I ever get hungry or crave for some orange chicken. So finally today I ordered some because it was one of those lazy days where you don't want to go out or cook and this place DELIVERS! I am in love with that already. As for I have little ones, its always a hassle to get them in the car, seat them down and having to quiet them down before disturbing others from their meals. Everything on the menu sounds delicious and it took me quite some time to decide which dishes I wanted and pretty much, I got eye hungry from just reading all of it. I ordered: 

1 Chicken Lo Mein 
1 Pan Fried Noodles
1 Orange Chicken Lunch Special with Steamed Rice
1Beef with Broccoli Lunch Special with Fried Rice

and they had a deal *Free order of eight cream cheese wontons with any purchase of $30 or more.*

There was sooooooo much food for my two daughters and myself! We hardly dented our food. They are not cheap with their plates of food. Filled with lots of meat and veggies. Everything was yummy. I would definitely order from them again because overall, i had a great experience! 

Also, I ordered from Grubhub and delivery service was awesome. Came in 30 minutes when the estimated time was an hr at least."}
{"text":"I like the place! Not absolutely the best food ever, but very good and at a fair price. The staff are all friendly and it's usually quiet."}
{"text":"Ordered through grub hub app. Got my food fast. That was probably the only good thing about it. Ordered orange chicken, it was just ok. A little bland. Had the cream cheese won tons, tasted stale and expired and they were burnt. Called to just let them be aware of the situtation, got bad attitude from lady on the phone. Gave me absolutely no solution or even an apology. Called grub hub, they gave me a $5 off coupon that expires next month....


My status currently: sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"I love Asian food, just not this one. Food is flavorless, I ordered the spicy generals Tso's Chicken. Even the veggies that come with the chicken were hard as if they didn't steam or cook them. I even upgraded on the rice and got fry rice. This rice had the texture of plastic not to mention had no flavor. Sad to say I did not eat my meal. Consider this your warning."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend eat here all the time the prices are great and you get huge portions. Staff is friendly :)"}
{"text":"Stopped for takeout today... service was fine, food was just OK, had teriyaki chicken that came with tons of veggies (not expected) and small portion of chix, watery non sweet sauce.  Lunch came with egg roll and wonton, both not so great, no mustard or sweet and sour came in the bag, asked for chili oil and got a large side of bland red colored oil and chili.  AS we were waiting asked for a cup of egg drop soup...she rang up $4.20, I nicely declined with holy cow.  She did apologize, I guess the solo egg drop is for two but she should have accomodated and sold me a single half price???  So, small portion lunch, barely ok flavor...its hard to mess up teriyaki chix, lunch takeout and large drink, 10 bucks.  Way too much cash for what I got...I am going back to Tao a mile north."}
{"text":"Awful service. We came in at exactly 11am and were the only customers in the restaurant. We got our menus and drinks quickly (within a minute) but the waiter didn't come back until 11:15 to get our order, again we were the only people there! But there were 3 employees up at the counter. Food is average. We will probably not be coming back due to the awful service."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered from this restaurant.  One of the worst Chinese restaurants I've had.  Tough beef and saugy sweet and sour pork.  More breading than pork.  Don't waste your time on this restaurant."}
{"text":"Their Mongolian beef is fire. This is the best Asian delivery I have had since moving to Arizona. You can't beat the price either"}
{"text":"So, DH and I were heading home from auto-hiking on Castle Hot Springs Road and we were wanting some Chinese.  Except, there's none in Cave Creek/Carefree worth eating.  But we had stopped at Home Depot in Anthem and we see the sign for Hong Kong Asian and thought---hey!

I don't know why people are complaining about the pricing.  It was right on par with the Chinese restaurants in our old hometown.  I ordered the Pan Fried Noodles and DH went for the Kung Pao Chicken.  I also added the egg roll and cream cheese wonton to my meal and we ordered a hot and sour soup to share.

Okay, the soup was maybe a dollar more for the same quantity.  And at our old place, for 3.95 you could combo up to an eggroll AND soup.  But I have noticed that AZ restaurants are really stingy on their \"add-ons\".

You know, it wasn't bad.  Not fabulous, but it was the first *real* Chinese we have had in a year.  There was plenty of beef, pork, chicken and shrimp in my nicely sauced noodles---they don't skimp on the proteins----and lots of tender/crisp veggies.  Same for DH's Kung Pao.  The egg roll had a crisp exterior, but the inside was bland and mushy.  The cream cheese wonton was tasty---I could have munched many of those.  The hot and sour soup lacked a depth of flavor that I was accustomed to at our old fave.

I have to agree, though, it was salty.  Not so much that it was inedible, but after the first bite, I removed my rings because I knew there was some finger-swelling in my future.  But frankly, we overlooked that in our pleasure of *real* Chinese for the first time in a long time!  I wonder if you can ask them to pull back on the salt?  Or if they even read these comments and can tweak the kitchen on their own?

We took our meals home, but the restaurant looked quite clean, though the decor was nothing to get excited about.  About half the tables were full and there was a steady stream of folks picking up their carry-out.  The guy at the counter was polite, if not warm and fuzzy.

Oh---and quantity---we each got two meals out of our containers.  I think that's reasonable.

Because of the salt, I probably would have gone with a 2.5 star rating, but you know how Yelp is.  Whole numbers only.

We'll be back.  It's 14 miles from our Cave Creek home to Hong Kong Asian, but our previous home was eleven miles from town and Chinese, so....  The joys of country living.  :)"}
{"text":"Greasy food. Bad fried rice. Fast, friendly service. Annoying TV playing court reality TV. Affordable. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This place was awful. The only time I got a to go order they messed it up not once but 3 times. Simple order and I spent 30 minutes waiting for them to figure out Mongolian beef sweet and sour chicken and an appetizer. Then I got home to find no sweet and sour sauce. The food was mediocre at best. I decided the experience was bad enough I needed to join yelp and share..."}
{"text":"Got take out Sweet and Sour Chicken and Kung Pao Shrimp.  Asked for side of hot chili sauce, didn't get it. Hubby didn't have nearly enough sweet and sour sauce for chicken and it was very greasy and runny. The chicken is PROCESSED. They charged extra for brown rice. I ordered the Shrimp Kung Pao for 11.99 and asked to add chicken (I could have just gotten another dish that had all the same ingredients for 11.99 but she still charged my 2.00 extra for that). For two meals ended up costing over 40 dollars. Nothing extra. For processed chicken. Shrimp was good. Good vegetables. Probably will not be back, though, even if it is 5 minutes from our house. If they delivered, I might when desperate. (and BTW, doesn't anyone deliver anymore? Not in North Phoenix, I guess?)"}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Good service and good food. I like the sweet and sour chicken. Isn't like your typical Asian take-out. I'd eat here again"}
{"text":"If you're an east-coast transplant looking for authentic Chinese food like they do back home, this is the only place in Phoenix you should go.  Delicious.  

Not greasy, always hot and fast.  And it's the only place I've ever seen out here that does the boneless BBQ pork ribs like back home.  They are like candy they are so good!  And the pork fried rice is a huge portion, a meal in itself.

This is a weekly stop for us.  (4 stars because the price is a little high)."}
{"text":"First time i could actually see the chicken meat in the eggrolls(very tasty). The entrees are not swimming in sauce just enough sauce to cover the meat and veggies. I have been there a total of 4 times each time i try something different i have not been disappointed yet. If your looking for something different give it a try."}
{"text":"When they are fresh, the cream cheese puffs are awesome.  The kitchen in this restaurant is fast - almost too fast.  From order to carry out n my first trip was less than 10 minutes.  I expect that the rice is sitting around for a while, but prep and cooking seems as though it should be longer.  They are a bit heavy handed with the sauces.  The portion sizes are big enough to share and I think I would prefer slightly cheaper prices and slightly smaller dishes.  Then I'd likely order one more dish to share. But a kids meal, three egg rolls, cream cheese puffs and two dishes was around $40.    I will go there again, but this won't be a weekly stop for me."}
{"text":"Place looks great & clean. Nice interior. Ordered lettuce wraps as an appetizer, orange chicken and house lo mein. The wraps were pretty tasty but the food was very bland in general, portions can be a little larger for asian food. The orange chicken was OK, should've been a little crispier on the batter. The lo mein noodles were good however the beef was chewy and a little bland. Shrimp was tasteless. Staff was nice and friendly 5/5. Restaurant interior 4/5. Food 2/5. We might try it again in a few weeks, just to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from here for the first time for tonight's dinner. 
We ordered: 
-Sesame Chicken (2 orders)
-Egg drop soup
-Soft noodles
-Cream cheese wontons

-Sesame chicken: almost no batter on chicken, which to me was fantastic. All white meat quality chicken. The chicken was very tasty. It does come on a bed of onions, broccoli, zucchini, and other vegetables. I'm a picky eater so that wasn't my cup of tea haha. 
-Egg drop soup: good size portion for a small, but very oily taste to it. Wouldn't order it again :(
-Soft noodles: as I mentioned, I'm a picky eater. I ordered the side of soft noodles with hope for just that, soft noodles only. It was basically vegetable lo mein. However, it was very easy to pick out the vegetables and the noodles were delicious. 
-Cream cheese wontons: nothing that has a stand out taste, but delicious just as expected. They are larger sized wontons which is always a plus. 

Over all, I will be a returning customer. Food was quick and staff were very friendly tonight. I was shocked at the $43 price tag, but we were full and have left overs for tomorrow- so it was $43 well spent."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've ever had. Became extremely ill after eating here. Avoid at all costs. It's the cheapest of cheap Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Just opened, food was fresh, and the employees are new but very helpful and courteous. You get a good amount of food for your money."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment on Saturday for the first time. There was no one in the restaurant but myself. I  ordered off the lunch menu to go. I always check my order before I leave a restaurant. I noticed I only had 1 package of soy sauce and 1 duck sauce. I asked for a few more soy sauce and hot sauce. The lady who took my order appeared to very irritated that I asked for additional sauce. I also asked for a fortune cookie and was given a mean face by the lady who then sat the cookie on the counter instead of handing it to me. The food was ok, however the customer service needs improvement. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure why they have so many bad reviews! We did take out and the orange chicken was great. Pot stickers steamed or fried were great! Everything in the order was correct and packaged well."}
{"text":"Wow really impressed with this place! Really tasty food that doesn't give you that \"I hate myself\" feeling after eating Chinese take out.

Not terribly greasy, fresh veggies and tasty sauces that aren't overly slathered on their meats.  We had an awesome smorgasbord of spring rolls (delish), egg drop soup (one of the best I've had), general tso's- unique but very tasty!, wonderful chicken lo mein, very healthy portion and the Mongolian beef was a bit overly onion-y, but we enjoyed everything and delivery was even early! Check this spot out."}
{"text":"Just finished eating my food from Hong Kong Asian Cuisine...

The good:    Food was tasty enough.    I ordered: 
    21. Sezchuan Chicken - Spicy
    Fried Rice (Large) 
    57. Steamed Mix Green w Kung Pau sauce

I do have a few complaints though:  

1)  the Sezchuan Chicken, which was requested as spicy, was not at all spicy, i could have fed this to an toddler in a cage full of sleeping lions, and had no fear of waking them up from crying.

2) I specifically requested cutlery, because i am in a hotel and i don't have any.   none were brought and so i had to go to the lobby, to get eating utensils, to eat my delivery food.  

3) There are no drinks on the menu on the eat24hours.com site.   you want a water or a soda?   Go screw!   

4) Eat24Hours web site quoted my an estimate of 45-60 minutes.  The food took almost 90 minutes to arrive with no apology, no note of it ...and no fork!
 
So, if you have a stomach for the above, HKAC is the place for you, otherwise, you may wish to move on."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese restaurants I've visited in North Phoenix!

I love getting Chinese takeout and was very surprised by how good this little, independent restaurant is.  

I've only done takeout (never dine in), so cannot speak to their wait staff, etc.

The only reason for 4/5 is the prices are a tad high for local takeout Chinese.  

Otherwise, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered here this eve!!! Food was great! Very large portions! From time order was placed, it was at my door in 20 minutes!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out at this restaurant through OrderUp.com and it was an excellent experience.  The food was fresh, hot and delicious and the OrderUp experience was super easy."}
{"text":"While visiting the area and trying to avoid fast food, we ordered take out. What a disappointment. Absolutely the MOST DISGUSTING \"asian\" food we have ever eaten (kind of). We tried a few bites and threw the food out. My wife ordered vegetable fried rice that was devoid of vegetables- containing only a pale yellow dry and flavorless substance we think was rice (yet tasted more like the container it was served in). I suggest you keep searching, since, although we all can have a bad day, this food was so sub-par, I cannot imagine wanting to eat there again on even a \"good\" day.

I want to add that we are not ones to give bad reviews- usually vote with our feet. However, this experience was so bad, we felt compelled."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying the food was good. My lower rating is for the service we received. 
I got their flyer in my door last week and stared craving Chinese food, so my boyfriend said I could go ahead and order delivery when I wanted for lunch one day. I called, and wanted to place my order, but the woman I talked to mentioned I look up the ad they have to pay $15 and get $30 worth of credit. So I did,  totally enthused and thankful that she wanted to save me money. I called back to place my order once I purchased to coupon. She then tells me it is for dine in only. I asked her since she told me it was available for take out that she honor that, and she got very upity with me and denied ever mentioning it. 
Fast forward three days, I finally had an evening to go in with my boyfriend when he go off of work. We should up at 730PM, and the closed at 900PM. We figured it was not so close to closing time to be an inconvenience, but holy cow, was I wrong. The gentleman who sat us, who also was the delivery driver, was great! He was friendly asked about or day, recommended the orange chicken, and was just all around nice. He seated us in the front area across from the counter. That's where it all went wrong. 

The lady, and I use that term loosely here, hung up the phone when she was done with an order, and immediately raised her voice to the delivery driver. She was angry, I mean really angry that he had not gotten our drinks. Now mind you, we had been seated less than 60 seconds. She stomped over, smiled at us, apologized for her \"dumb\" driver, and took or drink order. After we received our drinks she went back to the counter and continued to berate this poor man about how stupid he was and asking him how hard would it have been to get our drinks etc. He took it like a champ and just seemed to take it in stride. Obviously he has dealt with her before. She told him to not take any more to go orders because they were closing soon. It wasn't even 8PM. 

She came over, took our order for us with a smile that wouldn't melt butter. We ordered the PuPu Platter, Cashew Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Pork LoMein. She seemed angry by the time we were done ordering, and stomped away. When she finished adding our order in, she went up to the driver and said he might as well keep taking orders because obviously they weren't getting done at 9PM. At this point I was getting really annoyed with her attitude. 

Then or food came. The food was great! All of it was well cooked, seasoned and had just the right amount of kick. I have nothing bad to say about the food at all. Except maybe less huge chunks of onion. But that is just personal taste. ;)
When our server dropped off our check, I showed her the coupon and she flat out said no she wouldn't take it. I showed her it would indeed apply and she finally relented by walking away and calling me a bitch under her breath. She apparently must have thought I couldn't hear her when she was only two steps away. 

Her remarks did not end there though. While she was at the register she kept mumbling and talking about us. We were literally less than 10 feet away from her. I could hear her every word. The absolute final straw was her calling me a worthless, fat C*^%. If she'd not had possession of my boyfriend's debit card to pay I would have walked out on the spot. 

My boyfriend was appalled at her behavior as well, but even when we have terrible service we still tip. I mean the food was good, and we had no problems there. if I could have, and if I had cash, I would have; I would have tipped the driver. Our bill was 45 in total, so we paid 15 then to cover the rest, and left her $5. I will be willing to order take out from this place, but never go in again if she is my server. No thank you."}
{"text":"I am not sure what the early reviews were noticing as far as food quality, and while this is not my favorite Chinese food, it is certainly good food and we eat here or take out on a regular basis. The clamshells are gone, replaced with Pei-Wei type packaging which is less likely to leak. Sometimes there is a bit a language barrier, but they are always willing to honor special requests. I think this place is abetter value than the Tao across the street."}
{"text":"I've tried this place repeatedly out of convenience, ordering different types of things through Uber Eats thinking something must be good. It is all tasteless mush. They recently raised their delivery fee by two dollars; it was not worth the money before. The \"lemon chicken\" is just sweet and sour chicken that comes with a different dipping sauce. The fried rice is like, weird. I don't know how to describe it, but it's not right."}
{"text":"I must preface my review with the caveat that I have relunctantly adjusted my standards for Chinese food since moving to the Valley...

Hong Kong Asian Cuisine is definitely better than some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area and we'll probably order from them again, but it didn't live up to my secret hope that we would finally find a great (or even very good) Chinese restaurant nearby when I learned that they had just opened.
We had the hot and sour soup, Szechuan Chicken, and Sesame Tofu.  The hot and sour soup was okay, but a bit bland.  Both the Szechuan Chicken and the Sesame Tofu came with many more vegetables than I expected (broccoli, onions, carrots, zucchini) and they were very fresh.  The Szechuan Chicken was supposed to be spicy and it did have somewhat of a kick.  The Sesame Tofu came too sweet for my taste and definitely called for some heat (fortunately, I always have my sriracha handy).  The portions and prices were average.

So, nothing to write home about, but we'll probably give Hong Kong Asian Cuisine another go."}
{"text":"Open on Christmas, so that was a plus.  Hit or miss on the dishes of the evening.  Beef chow fun was probably the best thing from my dining experience.  Sesame chicken was consistent with the typical Chinese American versions you'll find elsewhere.  There was a dish called Seafood Delight with imitation crab that was terrible (falling apart like mushy paste in my mouth).  I've had similar issues with cooking imitation crab in the past when I've purchased a discount brand.

All said, if you're not looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant, this place beats Panda and some of the other fast food joints."}
{"text":"We think this place is the best local Chinese place.  Way better than flos.

We recommend the Singapore noodles, the pepper steak, and the curry chicken.

And if you like is spicy, you can get it actually spicy - not wimpy like so many Scottsdale places!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt ! 3o minutes before expected, I ordered the bird drop soup and Gen Taos chicken! That was great !
My wife ordered the Orange Chicken, she that it was great also! Recommend this place  to everyone!"}
{"text":"Listen, I dig this place. I like the food, the service, and the prices. I'm not sure what people are expecting but this is a mom and pop Chinese place in Arizona...it certainly satisfies my occasional Chinese food craving. Sit down, order a Tsingtao and some egg drop soup, then enjoy your meal. Get the Kung Pao Delicacies and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Had a lazy day and ordered for the first time. Came in 30 minutes and was hot. Loved the crispy beef the most and that was a new dish for me to try. Definitely plenty of food for leftovers. Will order again the future."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I haven't reviewed Hong Kong but I've been coming here for awhile. We always order off the app Beyond Menu. Super easy. They never mess up and food is sooooo good. I always get the house mein fun and they have big shrimp now lol. Or maybe they always have and just was happy last time. My husband gets the orange chicken and loves it. Thanks super much!"}
{"text":"We are always so happy with our order. The service is fantastic and always so quick to deliver our meal. We often order take out, dinner is hot and the driver is courteous. Now most importantly, the sweet and sour chicken along with the cream cheese rangoon is delish!!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. When I tried to call the restaurant to let them know their driver dropped off the wrong order to me I was deliberately hung up on at least 5 times by a woman working there. I spent 45 minutes just trying to get a hold of someone who could fix this problem. Finally, 2 hours after the \"promised delivery time\" they answered their phone and the delivery came but there was food missing from my order...on top of everything I automatically added a $10 tip when i placed my order, what a waste. I won't be eating here again. Too bad because I was a frequent customer and really enjoyed the food..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times so far and have had the same rude customer service each time. The women that work here have no customer service skills. The food is inconsistent. I ordered the orange chicken and it was stale with way too much sauce. I give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"\"highlights\" from tonight's meal:

Cold and soggy food
Watery and flavorless sauce
Wrong order
Overpriced

Finally to top it off he owners were rude and dismissive!"}
{"text":"Great egg foo young,  still can't find good low main but thats ok.

Egg rolls are small

If any restaurant does one thing you like well, then just go for that one thing."}
{"text":"My food isn't even here yet and they already get 5 stars from me. I just moved to Scottsdale and it can be tough to find Asian restaurants that will accommodate a gluten allergy (I called around 3 tonight).  Not only did they put up with my phone dropping the call three times, they were extremely polite and eager to help.  They were even kind enough to let me talk to someone from the kitchen... Wow! I wish more businesses were still as good at customer service as they are. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Jut OK....  Went for lunch and they had the standard lunch specials, but were a bit pricey for what you get AND were pretty bland. Not sure I would try and go back for dinner."}
{"text":"We have been eating there since it opened and the food is excellent (especially if you go for the lunch specials).   You could find us there at least once a week, we are extremely low maintenance people, and are extremely generous with gratuity.    On our latest visit, the lead waitress was so rude to us that we will never go back.  She came to our table and asked us what we'd like to drink.  When she returned, she slammed our drinks down turned around to walk away and realized she forgot to give us straws and then literally threw them at our table.  We had no idea why she was so pissed.  I looked over at her and she rolled her eyes at me!!  We ended up leaving $10 at the table for our drinks and leaving.  In all the time we have been going there, she has never been friendly to anyone and looks like she hates the world!!!!  We've spent a lot of money there, and now we will never go back :(   The cream cheese wontons were so good :("}
{"text":"I love this place!! My boyfriend and I have ordered from them 3 times, each time getting something different, and we've liked everything we've gotten! The Sesame Chicken is kinda my favorite but I really like the Cashew Chicken too! Their Lo Mein is super yummy. I always get that as a side since the entree already comes with rice. Oh, and the chicken egg rolls are delicious too! Crispy on the outside but never over cooked inside. We get delivery and every time they say 45-60mins but it's always gotten to us within 30mins! It's so fast! I can't speak highly enough of this place. The only thing I'm sad about is the entrees don't come in typical Chinese take out boxes you see in TV shows. The rice does! But the entrees come in more modern plastic snap on lid box things. Oh well haha."}
{"text":"Bland and tepid.  Had the Kung pao chicken w/ fried rice lunch special.  Fried rice was just rice with a little egg. Although the portions were generous it had no taste. Friends had the hot and sour soup that was cold."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp just to write a review for this restaurant. This place is fantastic! The girlfriend and I usually frequent Thai House or Pei Wei for asian but thought we would give this place a try since they just opened. It was dead when we went in but employees were very friendly, restaurant is very clean with big screens around the room. The food is just outstanding, I got the Jalapeno Chicken and it did not let me down. The chicken was all white meat and the jalapeno's were very very fresh def not out of a jar. All the sauces are obviously homemade and extremely delicious. This will be my destination of choice when in the mood for Asian and they also deliver which is also a plus. There is a new Asian place across the street that should not be confused with this one because that one is absolutely awful and should be avoided."}
{"text":"Very good , dining in is ok but I think take out is more popular.  Good food and they also deliver. I definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"First to review!

Well, this is the new business in the old Krispy Kreme spot.  I was excited when I saw something new was opening and couldn't wait to try it out with my 2 daughters who both love Asian food.  We decided to stop by for dinner tonight since it just opened either today or yesterday.

Let's start with the Pros:
1. Friendly staff
2. Delicious food!

My daughters both ordered the children's orange chicken with white rice ($5.99 each)  Their dinner was a perfect portion size for them each with lots of chicken and other vegetables.  The chicken was really good, not the overly deep fried stuff you get from the other Asian place over on 27th Drive near Mountainside.  (That place has more fried coating than it does actual chicken).  They both loved their meals.

I ordered Chicken Lo Mei (soft noodles) for $7.99.  It was delicious as well!  I normally order Kung Pao Chicken with rice, but I'm glad I decided to try something new today.  I would definitely order it again.


And now the cons:
1. I know this is dumb, but I have a huge pet peeve about businesses that have grammatical or spelling mistakes.  It just looks unprofessional.  And hand written signs, too.  They had a sign inside that said, \"Please wait for seatting.\"


2. I think it's a bit overpriced/expensive.
It's tiny inside and I think I was expecting more of a take-out place.  There are only 8 tables inside so I really wouldn't think of this as a sit down restaurant.  But their prices are comparable to PF Changs (from their website)
PF Chang's Lettuce Wraps $7.95
Hong Kong's Lettuce Wraps $7.99

PF Chang's Kids Sweet & Sour Chicken $4.95
Hong Kong's Kids Sweet & Sour Chicken $5.99

Some of their other main dishes are about $2-$3 cheaper than PF Changs.  I would say the majority of Hong Kong's dishes range from $9-$12 each.
There is a huge difference in the decor/ambiance of going to dinner at Changs or coming here.  Don't get me wrong, the food is yummy, I just was a little surprised by their prices.


I would definitely come here again.  However, with the prices as high as they are, I wouldn't come here often."}
{"text":"We were literally the only ones in the restaurant other than staff.  Food was fine, waitress was nice.  We started with cream cheese wontons which were great because of the amazing dipping sauce. Then I had the spicy crispy beef steak and steamed rice which were okay.  My friend had the Mongolian beef which looked yummy.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent for what it is: a neighborhood Chinese restaurant with dine-in capability and serious take-out mojo.

As I said in my other recent review of a Chinese restaurant, how a shop handles shrimp lo mein is a big part of how I view it.  HKAC does a very good SLM.  We also had pork fried rice and cashew chicken.  All were very good.  Excellent, in fact.

Before we settled on HKAC, we considered Flo's and George and Sons, but HKAC was the most reasonably priced.

We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place does a decent job on classic Chinese dishes. One of my favorites is the combination egg foo young. Another is the Mongolian beef. I am pretty sure they have new owners in the last couple months or a new chef because some of the dishes have changed. A decent place in the neighborhood for some quick Chinese food to go."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Great food, clean and very fast service. Plus, the prices are amazing! 
I highly recommend Hong Kong Asian Cuisine!"}
{"text":"It is just ok.  Probably will not return. Just wanted soup and the appetizer platter and it all came out at the same time.  The wonton soup had no flavor.  The appetizer platter was nothing great."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the delivery - but the food is really fresh. I ordered the general's chicken and fried cream cheese wontons. A lot of Chinese restaurant food tastes like they use old grease. Not this place! Very fresh ingredients and the crab Rangoon was so light and yummy!"}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like a fast food Chinese place because of the logo, but don't make that stop you from giving HK Asian Cuisine a try. My first attempt was a friend had ordered take out, Orange chicken and Mongolian beef with fried rice. I loved all of it but the orange chicken really stood out for me. The Orange Chicken was REALLY,  REALLY good. I think their Orange Chicken is better than PF Chang's.. I've ordered take out twice since my friend introduced me and I plan to be a regular. I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"My wife and I love to try different places to eat.  Went to this restaurant, and I have to say our first impression, we sat down and ordered hot tea.  Little did we know that there was many different types of hot teas that they have.  Another non Asian wait staff came over and informed us of this.  She was the best thing at this place.  Very helpful and extremely friendly.  

The food however was so so.  Egg fu yung had hardly any taste at all the sizzling beef was tender but over all the price was very high and not worth that much for the food taste."}
{"text":"We walked in and ordered to-go for a family get together. They were super nice and fairly quick to get a larger order out. The food didn't knock it out of the park, but it was good and we'd go back. 
In the dishes with a meat and veggie mix, there were many more veggies than there was meat.  That's the main reason I give it 3 stars."}
