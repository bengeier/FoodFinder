{"text":"Extremely nice location and very calm yet energetic environment with the right people. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone who enjoys hotpot or shabushabu. The spicy broth is extremely aromatic and flavorful and will having you sweating in minutes. Tons of selection on their menus and authentic and traditional eats; some things you would have never to expect to encounter in Canada. Nonetheless, love the variety and the services they have to offer. 10/10 would go back, but this time with full house so we can order everything on the menu atleast once."}
{"text":"Great hotpot place! I like it's not you can you eat - ingredient much fresher and much cheaper than AYCE."}
{"text":"The spicy soup base is one of the best I ever had. Literally, would come here everyday if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Great variety for their hotpot selection. I recommend the frog legs and beef tongue. Noodles are also very good and it's hard not to fill up on carbs. Meat quality is solid. Spicy soup is super spicy though! It's loaded with Szechuan peppers. Pork bone soup is flavourful and salty. Price for AYCE does not include the soup.   Service on Sunday night is a bit slow. Servers mainly speak mandarin and are hard to catch sometimes. The restaurant is pretty loud due to customers (lots of big groups of young adults) and music."}
{"text":"Late night hot pot in Milliken/Scarborough area. If you're looking for spicy then look no further; their hot peppers are imported all the way from China. Went with a couple of friends: one who loves spicy and the other one who does not. We went with the half medium spicy (made with over 30 different spices) and other side with the non-spicy soup base.   Good quality of meats with nice marbling, fresh shrimp with a natural sweetness to them, and tasty fish cakes. Wouldn't recommend their fish (they only have one kind) nor their ground shrimp. Surprised that their choices of veggies were limited. Tried the soup base before adding all the meats and veggies and also after; none of us enjoyed the taste, better leave it just for cooking. Don't forget to ask for the dipping sauces, there are two.  Arrived there right before closing, no rushing us out. Excellent service by both waitresses and even one of the co-owners; we were the last ones in the restaurant. We were offered to try their plum juice (reminded me of prune juice, not my thing) and even given a complimentary sticky rice dessert. We thoroughly enjoyed our first hot pot experience.  Actually a 3.5 rating but I'm being conservative since this was my first experience with hot pot and I have nothing to compare it with."}
{"text":"I've been in this plaza to eat numerous times, but have never noticed this place because they only have a phonetic chinese name that doesn't tell you what it is. I enjoy hotpot places that aren't AYCE, which means they have quality ingredients. They are known for their spicy soup base but you can get a normal soup as well. They have lots of items to choose from and service is super quick. The only problem was that the servers spoke very little English."}
{"text":"I would definitely go again. Even though it's not AYCE like a lot of other hotpot places, the quality of the meats and vegetables are excellent. It'll end up being cheaper too, since you only order the food you like and will eat. The beef and lamb have a nice marble to them but weren't too fatty. The beef meatballs were juicy in the middle and very yummy.  There are different dipping sauces too, like the sa cha sauce, which I liked the best.   Definitely try their homemade fish paste/balls (they mince it and it's on a plate, but if you scoop a spoonful into the pot, it keeps its shape and cooks nicely).  The soup base also tasted excellent and smelled delicious. We got the half and half (spicy red and mild white), and my favorite way of combining the two was to cook the food in the mild and then put it in the spicy for a few seconds. Remember to drink the soup after cooking your food - the meat flavor with the vegetable base was amazing.  One thing they can improve on - make sure the bowls and utensils are clean! My first bowl still had some rice stuck to it :S"}
{"text":"Chong Qing Legend is nothing above and beyond. In fact; Chong Qing legend is the bare minimal of what hot pot restaurants should be:  Food comes at a slower pace, price tag is a bit high, English falls on deaf ears, tasty soup base, high quality meats, cheap beer.    A great place to eat if you want a slower pace meal for conversation, variety, & a dash of rowdiness.   3/5 would hot pot in the winter time."}
{"text":"I like this place because you can order a la carte, even half orders! The price is very reasonable and the beer is cheap. I come here whenever I'm feeling some hot and spicy food, which is often in the winter.  If you pay cash you get a discount."}
{"text":"Never tried hot pot before and all the places I wanted to try were closed so I opted for this location. As previously mentioned, they are a la carte so the bill was cheaper than I had expected, as opposed to ayce. We got 2 beef platters, mushrooms, noodles and the soup base was mix (spicy & reg) for $40+. We ordered a lot more meat but the lovely lady strongly suggested that two dishes were enough for two people (she was definitely right). We told her it was our first time and she was more than welcome to help us with our orders and what to do. She regularly checked up on us and made sure everything was good. I don't know if they always do this but she was nice enough to give us a plate of some kind of sesame/red bean snack for free! The broth was really good and I loved the homemade noodles. The space is also very clean and they cater to large groups!"}
{"text":"I went on the recommendation of a friend to try the Hot Pot, and I have to say I had a great time.   You get a lot of food for what you pay for.  Make sure you go with a big enough group or a few really big guys so you can order the variety of things on the menu.    The staff speak very little English, and I have a feeling that the English menu isn't as comprehensive as the Chinese menu.  Nonetheless, the service was good, food was great and as always the company was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best hot pot I've had. A group of friends and I decided to check this place out on a whim and we were not disappointed! The spicy hot pot base was actually spicy and the selection of items on the menu was diverse. Price was also very fair for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"3.5 Star for Chong Qing Legend Lunch Menu who is not offered during their dinner hour.  Chong Qing Legend with Chong Qing as one of the major City in Southwest China. One distinct trait of Chong Qing cuisine is that it is spicy and numbing and telling you that they are just that with their food they serves here.  Don Don Noodles ($4.50) is really spicy... the sauce has real Szechuan peppercorn and that brings tears in my eyes. Salty and savoury and HOT! The waitress even comment that she is surprised that I ate that hot...   The freshly made Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($3.50) still have soup fillings inside... served steaming hot and nice.   The lunch menu offers all choices of Northern dim sums, appetizers and noodles. I have yet to try their Chong Qing Hot Pot during dinner, but it is not an AYCE option, as it can get pricey if you have a friend that can eat alot!   Waitress invited me back and bring someone that can really eat spicy so I can try out their authentic Chong Qing hot soup base!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place for hot pot since it's a la carte. The bill came out much cheaper than if we were to go to an all you can eat one. The broth was good, and ingredients were fresh. We told them we were in a rush and they accommodated us very well! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Finally an a la carte hot pot place. $8.99 for a big plate of lamb, $12.99 for soup base and a variety of other meats and veggies. You can eat as much as you want and order in full or 1/2 orders and for some choices in pieces. The place is not very busy on weeknights. The staff here is nice and helpful. If you want hoppy but do not want to pay $30 or more a person. For ayce and do not eat much; this is the place to go. :) For two people, soup base plus 2 plates of meat and some veggie options came to about $47 tax and tip. If you pay cash I think they still will give you a 10% discount (at least that's what happened when I visited). We left full and satisfied with rhwoney we spent and not having stuffed ourselves."}
