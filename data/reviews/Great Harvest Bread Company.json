{"text":"Great red white blueberry bread.  It has cranberry's and blueberry's.  Yummy in my tummy.  Really have enjoyed there bread and sandwich's for years.  Tried the lemon bar today and it was so good.  Just like my receipt but better flake on the crust.  Very good."}
{"text":"The bread here is absolutely outstanding! The pumpkin spice is one of my all time favorites and I have never had a better cinnamon roll!! However, I have gone the past 2 Saturday's around 8am (bare in mind they open at 6) only to be told they have no fresh bread (or any bread really for that matter) and wouldn't get a shipment in until 10 or 11!!! Such terrible business structure to have the bakery open but nothing to serve!! Was so broken hearted to walk away empty handed two weeks in a row!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best little local bakery.  The owners are this cool young couple who really dig what they do.  Everyone who works there seems to really like working there.  BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN VEGAS!  They only use honey & molasses for their breads and that is huge to me...NO HFCS!  Try their Honey Whole Wheat is the best...or maybe the Tuscan Chicken Panini...YUM!"}
{"text":"My wife got the Irish Soda Bread as this is her favorite.  We have not been back since."}
{"text":"Really disappointing, because we wanted to try something different from the major chain sub shops.   However, I couldn't even eat my roast beef sandwich. Bread was dry and broke apart,  so I was left with a gross, fatty pile of meat and no bread.  

My whole family of 4 was so disappointed that we sarcastically joke about eating here every time we are in Las Vegas. Sorry to say but won't be back."}
{"text":"Incredible Pumpkin and Chocolate Chip Bread. Love that you get a free sample of something every time you stop by. Friendly team too!!!"}
{"text":"You know when you really want a sandwich and you have that perfect image in your mind of this stacked up beauty of a creation?  It has that toasted bread, fresh colorful veggies and those perfect slices of cold cuts all stacked perfectly as if it's a tribute to the sammich gods?  That's exactly what they make here, it's the sandwich of my dreams a SILF if you will.  The consistency of quality here is amazing and I've never been disappointed by them at all.

The staff always makes you feel welcome and greets you as soon as the door is opened, almost too early... I mean they're not quite waving at you as you park but they notice you right away.  They always offer a slice of their fresh baked breads and ask if you want a little butter on it.   The breads are perfect and there is really not trick to them at all, their secret is they just made the bread the way people used to.  No additives, no flavor enhancers, nothing besides quality ingredients and a staff that knows what they are doing.  As the girls behind the counter have been there as long as I have been coming I think they have it down by now.

There is also an assortment of gift baskets, cookies, spreads and other nice touches that would be great for a gift or an office party."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. Sandwiches were ok. Sourdough bread is fantastic! The young man at the counter spoke in monotone and was kind of rude. Didnt smile and seemed annoyed. This was my first time there. I'm not sure what he said when I walked up to the counter he was mumbling. I said oh, sorry what was that? And he didn't respond. I think he was offering a sample? I'm not sure, but I would of loved one being it was my first time. I placed my order and waited for it, while I saw other people come in and got offered samples. It felt like my business was not wanted there. I won't be returning to this location. Thanks for the bad experience young man at the register today."}
{"text":"Best baked breads I have ever had. Great customer service. Chocolate chip scones are yummy."}
{"text":"Nothing beats grandma's homemade bread...except the breads at Great Harvest. They know their stuff. Staff is so friendly. Met the owner today. Her joy and enthusiasm is infectious. You can tell she loves what she does and, boy, it sure translates. 

Don't forget to grab a free slice of bread."}
{"text":"Picked out some items for a gift basket, they put it together for me and wrapped it beautifully; it was a gift I was proud to present."}
{"text":"Mmm Great Harvest!!  Fresh, yummy bread and free samples.  Does it get any better?  

Pumpkin bread, sour dough bread, cinnamon raisin bread... it's all good.  But really, my favorite is just their standard light wheat bread.  So soft and delicious and I don't feel quite so guilty eating all those carbs when I know it's made from super fresh ingredients and no preservatives.

The only thing that keeps me from giving Great Harvest 5 stars is their sandwich prices.  Don't get me wrong... their sandwiches are really fresh and delicious, but they're smallish and are pretty much just like something you'd easily throw together at home.  For $6-$7?  That's pretty steep!  Even with fresh-made bread holding it together!"}
{"text":"Offered me blueberry bread with white chocolate .. Tried it ... Buyed it"}
{"text":"Ok. After reading all of the reviews for this store I am even more disappointed with how I was treated this morning.  I entered the store because I forgot to grab breakfast before my hair appointment. I stood in line behind a young lady and there were two other women being helped. There was hardly anything in the counter but I saw them working in the back so I wasn't worried. A young man came out and assisted the young lady in front of me. He was very nice to her and offered her a sample.  The other women received samples as well. So I was excited to taste the pumpkin bread. 

Well....after the young lady in front of me got her order and checked out I stepped up for my turn only to be rudely interrupted by one of the rudest women EVER! This lady was waiting for her order and had already received her sample but was rudely begging for another one (slob). Instead of the young man asking her to wait so he could help me he indulged her rudeness and completely ignored me.  I WAS NEVER OFFERED A SAMPLE AND WAS MADE TO FEEL LIKE I WAS NOT WELCOMED IN THAT STORE.  I had to interrupt her in order to get my order in and I purchased a scone (wasn't that great anyway and it was dry) and I wasn't even thanked.  Last time I checked my money is just as green as hers!  I will NEVER return to this business!!!"}
{"text":"Omg, I don't know where to start. If you love bread and you want it fresh over the grocery store stuff, this is the place. I was in there last week and bought pumpkin bread along with apple cinnamon swirl. Omg!!! You can even try samples. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Not only is the bread, pasteries, sandwiches, salads and staff AMAZING!!!!! This company constantly gives back to the community and churches. They donate all their unsold bread EVERY day to the homeless shelters. We've seen first-hand how much joy and appreciation those folks have for thier free loaves of bread that they get to take with them. Thank you God for companies like the Great Harvest Bread Co. May God grace everyone at the company."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly and clean.  Sorry, Grill not working so no grilled sandwiches.  Sorry, no spinach.  Very limited selection of what they do have.  Small place.  Seating outside is nice.  Sandwiches we had were really good.  Management could maybe use some improvement."}
{"text":"So good!  I love the generous samples; I've ended up getting things I wouldn't have normally chosen like the cherry white chocolate bread.  I Love the Dakota round loaf-dense & soft with little seeds...yum....love the spinach feta (try it!) It didn't sound good to me but I tried a sample and it is good!  The staff has always been nice too.  The only thing I think is kinda weird...they are a bakery that's closed on Sunday's!   They run out of stuff too...once it's gone...it's gone!"}
{"text":"We weren't sure what to expect, but we left happy! They have an assortment of breads, sweet baked goods (cinnamon rolls/cookies/etc), and create-your-own sandwiches.

We both got sandwiches and were happy (~$6 per sandwich). He had a grilled sandwich on white bread; I had a cold light wheat sandwich. Mmm, I love wheat  bread!"}
{"text":"Savannah bars for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert!  Oh, and the cinnamon chip bread with some cream cheese too!!  Love this place!  Where else can you find amazing, fresh baked breads from SCRATCH?!  I can honestly say, I have never tried a sandwich here, but after reading the reviews it sounds like I really should!  I promise, you won't be mad at the selection here, just great fresh bread at great prices."}
{"text":"I love great harvest.  The White Chocolate Blueberry Bread is one of my favorites and of course cinnamon chip.  Not to mention the staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Great Harvest in Las Vegas.  It's on the edge of civilization, it's always nearly empty, and the teenage employees are always super sweet and helpful.  What's not to love?

Regarding the bread, try some Blueberry-White Chocolate bread.  It sounds awful in theory, but it is SO crazy delicious.  For savory lovers, try the Cheddar Garlic, which has pockets of cheddar goodness embedded in the loaf.  

They also have sandwiches, breakfast and lunch, which I've never tried.  

My biggest beef with this place is the hours.  It closes at around 5:00 p.m., which is only convenient for housewives.  Why the hate for the working man?

P.S. - As of this date, they have a check-in offer for a free cookie."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious baked breads. I particularly love the white chocolate blueberry loaf, it's like dessert for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this place, amazing bread, sandwiches are fabulous, service is always great! 

However, to the guy in yellow shirt at noon on 1/18/2016, sitting at the table by the chips, talking ridiculously loud on the phone and watching videos even more loudly..... Buy some headphones, you are rude!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast and DELICIOUS!! This is a place to go when your looking for a quick good sandwich. I love how you can customize your own sandwich or if your indecisive they have a list of sandwiches you can choose from!"}
{"text":"I have been to other Great Harvest Bread franchises they have all been good. This place was no exception. The employees were friendly and fast. I ordered a Vegas Veggie sandwich and two loafs of bread. All is very tasty, and the bread is so soft!"}
{"text":"Very good bread!  It was a nice pleasant environment and we went here to bring some cheddar bread back home.  However we didn't realize that they only bake it on Saturdays and likewise for most of their other types of bread.  So if you're really into a particular flavor you'll have to call ahead and find out their schedule. Because we were leaving before Saturday we implored them to help us out and they said they would bake us an order that day if we ordered a bulk of 15 loaves.  We had a couple other friends with us so we split it up amongst ourselves.  Now we're at home and very happy!  In addition to baking breads like cheddar and asiago pesto, they also make sweet breads like blueberry and lemon.

Price: Less than $6 per loaf
Food: Very Good (Cheddar Bread is Very Good, Pesto Asiago is Great, Lemon Bread is Good)
Service: Good
Ambiance: Good
Location: Good"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Great Harvest Bread when I lived in Virginia. It was very popular there, but it's not quite so at the one in Henderson. I was hoping to find the same bread that I got in Virginia--one that had all seeds, but they told me they all do their own thing. That bread was the best bread I ever had. I still get their white bread and honey bread. The bread is pricey, but I do love them. I love how they give free, huge slices of bread with butter on them to try. I've taken advantage of this to try some of their desserts. Sometimes I'll like them enough to buy them. Although I love their bread, this store only deserves three stars (possibly less) because they are seriously lacking in customer service. The cashier seemed plain miserable and needs to take some happy pills or find another job where she doesn't have to help people!"}
{"text":"Heaven on earth and free slice of bread when you walk in! Yum!  Best kept secret in las Vegas! Heaven on earth if your a bread lover!!"}
{"text":"No excuse for lackluster treatment of customers! Being under new management, late night out partying??? What ever the reason customers should always be offered a slice of bread the way I understand it.  Yes there is a tacky reminder at the door re: did you use your punch card."}
{"text":"I loved this great harvest! I have been to a couple and this one felt so home-like and it was cute inside! They had the cutest stuff to buy like aprons. The food was so good I had a turkey pesto sandwich and I recommend it grilled and it was so good. The bread is all so fresh and they make everything there! I love it!!!"}
{"text":"I go to Great Harvest at least twice.a week for a.Take- Out Sandwich and to buy a loaf of bread that's so good that I'm sure it's not good for you.....:):) Try it! It's quick and easy!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times. This is great little Bakery which moved into its current location from next door about a year ago. We stopped in there every time we grab a coffee at the Starbucks next to it. They also make gluten-free bread which is available fresh one day a week."}
{"text":"Use to come here during my lunch hour when I worked in Anthem/ Henderson area. Pretty good actually. Kind of over priced for a regular sized sandwich if you ask me. I would honestly rather spend my $5 at subway for a footlong. 

Anyways, I dont think they are bad at all. I think they are rather good. Their customer service is good. Cleanliness is good too. It just was not anything that REALLY stuck out for me."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you're offered a free sample, I went for the Blueberry Scone but it they also had Pumpkin & Cranberry Breads and even a Sugar Cookie! I loved it but didn't feel the need to order more this time. Maybe next time I'm in I'll add it to my meal. 

The menu is open to vegans, vegetarians and meat lovers. The sandwiches are made fresh and you can watch them make it. They stuff them fat! So you do get every penny's worth. There is also a cooler full of drinks such as water, sparkling water and juice. 

The only thing I dislike and reason they don't deserve 5 stars is THEY DO NOT LIST THE PRICE of each item! So you really have no idea how much you're spending until you're done ordering. I went for the \"combo\" he offered and for a bottle of water, sandwich and cookie (I didn't see any chips that caught my eye) I paid $11.30. Considering this is Fresh unlike Subway, that's reasonable but it would be nice to know that I ordered a $7 sandwich BEFORE I order it. They really should add a price system to their menu and update it if needed because everyone with common sense knows it's subject to change at anytime. 

Overall this is definitely one of my favourite sandwich shops in town. Happy Sandwich Day!!"}
{"text":"This was such a cute bakery! The staff were very friendly and answered all my questions as kindly as they could. (I asked a lot!) They were even so kind to offer to slice my bread for me without me asking. My favorite was the honey wheat and jalapeno cheddar bread! So moist and it really taste homemade!! Definitaly going back. Worth the 45 minute drive from LA."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Great Harvest for many years. The service and food is always good. Although they make breads and sandwiches the serving size for the price is great.  They always offer your a free slice of bread upon entering.  Great Harvest also has a rewards program for every time you eat so you can get. Free loaf of bread or sandwich."}
{"text":"I have often been delighted with the amazing bread and sandwiches i have received at great harvest on Bonanza, so I was thrilled to find that there was a great harvest near my job in Summerlin.  Although it is a bit out of my way, i decided to make the 15 minute drive to this location enthusiastic for a delicious home baked lunch.  

I was however, less than pleased with the service i received. not only were the prices higher at this location, odd, but the sandwich took much longer to make ( and was made incorrectly, despite the fact that great harvest has you write down your specifications).   the bread on my sandwich was falling apart and i had to basically each my food with my hands, it was disgusting.

i was also not offered to sample the bread of the day which i had in mind to purchase. I did notice other clients come in and be immediately attended and offered to sample multiple slices of bread and engage in conversation before walking out and leaving without ordering anything. 

Sadly i left without buying the bread of the day and will probably never return to this branch. Please learn to treat all of your guests with the same amount of courtesy, especially these who actually make purchase and come in with faithful client cards half full of stamps."}
{"text":"The staff is always so friendly and they give massive samples. The baked goods are delicious and come at a very reasonable price. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Customer service is the best and I will be returning for gift baskets each time I have a need. I was surprised that they give you such large samples of their bread. And it was delicious. The baskets hey custom made for us were affordable and very professional. Good job guys."}
{"text":"I've had the fantastic scones in Ireland so now I'm on a hunt for great scones in LV. This places scones are like big cake(ie) cookies. Not very good. I do like coming here for a sandwich at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Every time I come over on this side of town I must stop and I must get something I don't care beds down to a little tube of honey we're a big loaf or bread this place is absolutely outstanding I love it love it love it love it"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sandwich shop/lunch spot. 

I'd highly recommend the spicy turkey pepper jack on sour dough, or the caprese sandwich. 

Their loaves and baked goods are also amazing and they always give samples."}
{"text":"This place is amazing... I mean, they have a free sample bread table! They change their bread specials daily, so make sure you either call or check online! The sandwiches, oh so good! It does tend to take a little while for your food, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Epic sandwich selection and the desserts are so bomb! The staff is friendly and full of suggestions on items. Don't be shy to drop in and sample something!"}
{"text":"Great Challah bread. Friendly service. Give you great samples. Price is reasonable considering the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Harvest Peach Honey is the best!!!! But they were out of it!!! The staff is nice and helpful.. Its always clean.. You get a free slice of bread with butter and a punch card and the 10th loaf of bread is free!!"}
{"text":"I just had THE BEST Italian sandwich EVER, with just the right amount of sauces and ingredients... it was made perfectly ...by a gal...I think her name was Kenalee.  Soft delicious bread baked to perfection.  DELICIOUS Italian sauces. BEST sandwich I have had anywhere in a long time!!! Mmm!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here over 20 years--since it was by the smiths on sunset.   Great bread and great service.  What has happened?  Are there new owners?  The employees aren't nearly as friendly and what is up with the shrinking pumpkin bread?  It's become sooo tiny and my grandkids won't even eat it anymore because there are always big chunks of what I believe is unmixed flour and they think it looks gross.  I'm really sad about the decline in quality"}
{"text":"Great service, Great smell of bread, Free samples, cant go wrong here.

The one thing that made it one star less than a perfect five was the breads they had on sale made specific to each day. 

i was craving the walnut coconut bread (as I saw on the menu). Come to find out that it was only made on tuesdays and sundays. :(

I got another bread to sub for the bread I wanted. Its not the same. Also, I find it weird that they closed the store when they sold out of bread. I thought whoever owned the business should know what their sales are per diem and make enough product for that day. I guess they dont teach franchisee's cost management  info."}
{"text":"Instead of wearing pink, on Wednesdays Great Harvest  turns gluten free! I stopped by at the end if the day and they still had lots of good options. We got a loaf of Dakota bread, which was awesome and nutty; red, white, and blue desert bread, which had berries in it and was delicious and we ate it for breakfast; and a brownie which tasted like a proper brownie, none of the tell-tale gluten free texture or flavor. They had several other gluten-free breads available, of which I only remember cinnamon raisen and white sandwich style. They also make sandwichesto order, so keep Great Harvest in mind at lunchtime if you're nearby. I whole-heartedly recommend you stop by too!"}
{"text":"First timer here, my co-worker who's been here was raving about how good it was. I got the chipotle chicken club and it's amazing...I swear I inhaled the first half! Lol I definitely recommend this place  and it might be my new favorite sandwich spot"}
{"text":"I am soooo glad I found this bakery. They have the best spinach and feta bread I've ever had. Also really good customer service."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place a one star is because of Michele, who took the time to talk to me. Apparently the owners dad seems to think he runs the place! He was a total jerk to the employees... there was only two people in line, and one lady didn't have a clue as to what she wanted yet. This jerk decided to show off for his golf buddies and go behind the counter and yell at the staff! Unfortunately, I had already placed and paid for my order or I would've walked out! This guy was a total jackass!"}
{"text":"I stopped In here the other day because I was in Henderson and found myself hungry. I love the breads at Great Harvest Bread Company so I decided to try them for lunch. Big mistake! I was on the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich so that is what I ordered.  That, however, is not what I received. What I received was a cheese sandwich that had been put through an oven on a conveyer, Albeit the cheese was melted the bread was as white and untoasted as when they sliced it off the loaf. I inquired of the young lady at the counter as to why this was the case, (A grilled cheese should come out with a golden brown, crispy, crunchy and delicious exterior crust. Which is created by the application of butter to the exterior of the bread before you GRILL it.)  I was told that they put there garlic butter on the inside of the sandwich so as not to mess up the grill...what grill? there is only the oven with a conveyor belt. This is inadequate, to say the least. That's fine if you want to do it that way but don't call it a grilled cheese sandwich, it is not!!! Perhaps your employer would think about purchasing a Panini grill or something that would produce the desired exterior. 

To the young woman who helped me, don't ask me have a had the sandwich here before because clearly I have not! I have a completely different idea of what a grilled cheese sandwich is, as I'm sure most people would. It was not the warm cheese sandwich that I got.

I have not any other sandwiches here. I'm hopefully they are better. perhaps I will try again...maybe."}
{"text":"Yummy local place, I do believe the staff could be a little more cheerful. Very quiet, lots of tables but there was no one else there. We decided to take the safe rout and order a cinnamon roll. It was very delicious. Place looked rather clean and also had kind of a homie feel to it which was nice."}
{"text":"Two words: carb heaven! I love the free samples....full slices of their featured breads. The pepperoni roll is to die for and their scones (my fave the cinnamon chip cream cheese) are the best this side of Scotland!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!  The breakfast sandwich is the best!  Never mind that you are able to have a free sample of the bread that is made fresh daily."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place is nice.  It feels like home.  The service also feels like you're in your best friend's kitchen.  After answering a \"Star Wars Question of the Day\", I was given a free desert!  They also offered me a free buttered slice of bread while I waited for my sandwich.  This is a hidden treasure in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty carbs....not for the gluten-intolerant.  I stopped here for lunch halfway in my bike ride and chose the (huge) \"kid-sized\" ham and cheddar sandwich.  Yummy!  The bread was fresh, the ham was slightly sweet, and the cheddar was savoury enough to balance the ham.  Great Harvest also doles out very generous samples of their baked goods and I got a piece of white chocolate-raspberry bread (more like cake, really) that was as big as my hand.  (It was really delicious too!)  The clerk who took my order was super nice and the place was clean and inviting.  Come visit and take home some bread or baked goodies!  Don't forget your sample.  :)"}
{"text":"I have been to one of the other locations in town. After my solid swim workout was craving a nice hearty sandwich. Since Great Harvest Bread Company was close by thought myself got the perfect spot for the perfect recovery meal. It was my first time at this location but for the most part everything is the same. The menu is a nice long chalkboard style with the different sandwiches grilled, breakfast, vegetarian, kids, signature, and also have salads. They still have the cutting board of assorted freshly bakes bread that can get sample slice of. The cookies and pastries they baked daily looks delicious. If you fancy some Grateful Dead tie dye style shirts they sell those to. Compare to the other location the display for the assorted fresh jams and kitchen equipment decent size (located smack as soon as you walk in).

Talk about love LOVE love the smell from the minute you walk in the store. Nothing better then smell of any kind of bakery shop. All the different fresh bread baked daily or the pastries. Not only do you get hungry but everything looks as good as the smell. 

I ended up going with the grilled spicy turkey pepperjack sandwich. It was tasty and more important hearty sandwich. There really is no skimpy comes to the amount of turkey that was in the sandwich. The bread you can choose just went with the workers recommendation of sourdough. It was loaded with bunch of other stuff. All you need too know is everything had right balance of flavor and texture. Always sandwich is only as good as the bread. The sourdough was awesome. I also got oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. The cookies are huge take up one whole bag or in my pic see the size of dinner plate. It thin cookie but still that whole lot of cookie for one person. It had the perfect balance of both worlds. Nice moist and one of the best oatmeal cookies had in awhile. 

The service was five star. They were all friendly, helpful, and positive vibes. The only thing is not lot of places to eat there. Three tables of two tops and little outdoor patio area. Then again maybe for the most part people may come here for the bread and pastries to go. You would be sad not try some of the sandwiches. I intend on coming back because lots lots of sandwiches that reading the descriptions need to review. LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome! They have great bread, sandwiches and they carry all kinds of other stuff that is great for baking! Beau was the person at the counter who took care of me, he made great suggestions and I was very happy with the customer service. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I first noticed it's more of a bakery and than a sit down cafe. There were only 5 2 top tables inside and outside seating for anyone.  Before u even ordered they offered me a free slice of pumpkin chocolate chip bread. It was yummy. I then ordered a Spicy Turkey Pepperjack sandwich,  I couldn't really taste the spicy in it but everything tasted fresh and you know the bread is fresh, just watch them make it. It just enough to fill you up without overdoing it. Sandwich and lg. Lemonade for under $11"}
{"text":"Great little place for some fresh bread and baked goods. They always have a good selection of fresh items to provide samples when you walk in. 

I like to stop by here for lunch. Their menu is quite good and you have so many choices for bread. It's also in the same center as Handel's! Big plus."}
{"text":"Picked up a loaf of coconut walnut bread today.Delicious as usual.Service is lacking.Need to get people behind the counter that are more customer service oriented and treat it like a business and not a joke or, like they are inconvenienced by customers."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great customer service and great food and desserts. They offer a variety of bread samples everyday of the week. My favorite is the coconut bread...SO yummy! All their sandwiches are delicious. Can't go wrong with this place. I will keep returning."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. Unique and new flavor each day of the week. I live going there. Generous sample size and I always end up buying something I like. I tried pastrami sandwich one time and I liked it."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!

I found out about this place when I first moved here but never got around to trying it until finally last week! I'm always the last to try things! 

We came in the late afternoon and the store was empty just the way I like! I don't like anyone hovering over me especially when I'm in a new place and want to explore it! My eyes went straight to their loaves of bread! OMG! I've never seen such beautiful looking bread in my life! It is so puffy and soft! It feels like pillows of heaven! 

Also, they have baked goods which can get you in trouble too! My mom was so blown away by the free slice of bread you get! She was only expecting a tiny sliver of bread but got a whole slice of bread AND butter!! My mom said the coconut bread was too die for! I also took home a loaf of Light Wheat bread to give to my sister when we went to California and she absolutely loved it! 

They also have sandwiches and I can only imagine how crack they are! I picked up a menu for the month and OMG,every kind of option you can think of! I can't wait to come back and try other stuff! I'm a fan! ^___^"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE sandwich shop ever. Quality, quality, quality all around, especially the breads. The Hot sandwhiches are the absolute best. Want a good lunch??? Go here!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a loaf of Soda bread. It's only around once a year you know.
I snuck some in the way home and wow it was great.
Looking forward to having some for breakfast fur a few days."}
{"text":"Ok Folks! Let's talk about the Great Harvest Bread company. This was one of my luxury places I went to for breads, loafs, cookies and an occasional sandwich. I normally visit the one on Marks St. In Henderson, NV. Today I stopped in at the location on Tropicanna and Fort Apache, Summerlin area. The place is clean and the staff are friendly so those are pluses. Let's get to the food. I ordered the Vegas Veggie sandwich, turkey farmhouse with the cranberry and the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf. The Vegas Veggie was just ok. They didn't have hummus and the sandwich ended up rather dry. My wifey had the turkey sandwich and took 1 bite and put it away in her mini fridge and even forgot about it and as we were leaving remembered it and decided to not retrieve it and maybe have it the next day. Then our go to pumpkin bread that is usually so addictive and moist. Took 1 slice put it in the fridge and left it behind too. It was a bit dry. Maybe it was a bad day or just a bad location. I will go back to my location some other time and see. Maybe I'm being harsh because I expect a certain level from them. But I'm just disappointed and spent 25$ for food that we forgot and didn't care about.....ugh what's going ON!!!! #frustrated....good luck Great Harvest Bread Company!!! Bring back the good good PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok folks let's talk about the Henderson Marks St. Site.........lets just say.......DA FREAKING BOMB SANDWICH AND BREAD! It's weird that the same company can be different from site to site. I am so sorry I cheated on you with a summerlin great harvest. I will never do that again. Everything is better at this store. Bread, sandwiches and service!! All was top of the line. GOOD FREAKING JOB!!! WOOOOOOOHOOOOOO!!! Had the chicken salad sandwich and sampled the cinnamon bread. OMG GOOD! I'm craving it again. It's like crack!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich and some bread.  I got a turkey sandwich on sourdough, and a ham on white for my husband.  He devoured his before I could ask him if it was good!  I also bought a loaf of white bread, a cinnamon chip loaf and a garlic cheddar (my favorite).  Everyone there is so friendly.  Great place to grab a sandwich!"}
{"text":"First, I'm greeted with a bread sample as soon as I walk in from the friendly guy at the counter. Not to mention, this raspberry white chocolate bread was gooey and amazing!!

I wasn't that hungry and planned on only eating half of my spicy turkey Pepperjack sandwich. It was soooo good I ate the whole thing!

I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Went in the day before Thanksgiving and was very disappointed.  Was going to get sandwiches for the next days travels and when we went in was told they were not making sandwiches that day.  What is that about.  I couldn't go  back another day we were traveling and I have purchased coupons and had to use them.  Had called for hours and was never told about limited services when inquiring about hours."}
{"text":"I'm a regular, eating here at least once a week. I work in the same area. Not one of them recognize me yet (no worries).  Just tired of the \"robotic\" greeting. 

Today, I got my regular pastrami sandwich. Wow. Soooo disappointed. Came in the normal basket.  Here's the deal. Look at the photo. The shredded lettuce covered the basket and sandwich. I didn't order a lettuce sandwich with pastrami. After swiping most of lettuce off to find sandwich, the lettuce filled HALF the basket. 

It seems to be getting worse and worse. 
So sad."}
{"text":"It smells amazing in here.

Great Harvest Bread Company has a cool semi-old school bakery vibe that sets it apart from other bread and sandwich shops. Being able to see the flower on the table as the bread makers behind the counter do their magic is a fun touch. It gives this establishment an authenticity, especially to their baked goods.

The bacon avocado turkey club I had for lunch was tasty. I ordered it on one of the whole grains, and it was delicious as advertised. I enjoyed the bacon especially, nice thick slices with plenty of flavor.

I'll be sure to pick up a loaf or two one of these days."}
{"text":"I live about 2 minutes away from this place and I am so happy (and mad) that I found this place! Happy because they have so much tasty treats and mad because I literally want to come here everyday and eat all the yummy treats and spend all my money! Seriously though...the struggle.

I absolutely love the yard bird salad! I have found this place place less than a week ago and already at the salad 3 Times. First two times were fresh and delicious! Third time it was not fresh at all and leaves were wilted and soggy (which is why I took one star off). I was pretty unhappy about that since I was so excited to eat it before studying only to find it it wasn't fresh!

I also ordered the turkey pesto sandwich which was just okay. First of all, the sandwich and salad took I while to make (which I'm ok with since it's fresh). The sandwich contained a lot of turkey but not enough pesto! 

The salted caramel cookies are to die for. I literally cannot but then because I can eat those huge cookies by myself :( also, they let you taste bread as soon as you walk in and it is amazing! I tried the pumpkin bread with whipped butter and it was delicious. They sell the whipped butter there which is one amazing thing in its self. 

They have delicious looking cinnamon rolls which I haven't tried yet (watching my waistline), delicious loaves and cookie!

Just know that when you walk in there, you will probably spend more money then you intended. Also, if I were to give a suggestion, it would probably to be to have more caffeine options!"}
{"text":"You guys deserve 4 stars for lunch for sure. Just came in here today for breakfast to get an egg sandwich and pretty disappointed. First of all I don't get how your breakfast sandwich can be the same price as lunch, over $8 is expensive for a Togo bacon and egg sandwich. Secondly I asked for ketchup with my egg sandwich and you guys don't have any, how do you serve breakfast and egg sandwiches with no ketchup, please fix that.

I decided to be nice and not take off a start for he bad breakfast experience because of your free samples:)"}
{"text":"Always great service and GREAT BREAD!!!! Staff is always friendly and offers generous sized samples. Monkey bread is amazing, and my new favorite is their white chocolate blueberry french bread! This place is my new weekly stop! Highly recommend stopping by and picking up a sample!"}
{"text":"They have soda bread for St. Patrick's Day (order early). Really great fresh bread and cute little store."}
{"text":"This is a cute place for sandwiches, breads and treats. The customer service is helpful and they give you a taste of one of the breads upon coming into the shop. 
They answer questions and are knowledgeable.
They have a point system for a free loaf of bread that they enter in the computer so be sure to give them your information. We got monkey bread and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. They unfortunately didn't have any snickerdoodle ready, and the oatmeal wasn't a hit. The monkey bread however is great with lots gooey cinnamon and easy to pull apart. We got a taste of pumpkin chocolate chip which was good if you like pumpkin and they give a full slice of bread. 
Not sure if different locations have different breads but they serve different breads different days of the week and the blueberry streusel we had at another location isn't available here."}
{"text":"Owned and operated by young people, this bakery of various breads, cookies, loaf cakes as well as offering gourmet sandwiches is a real find.  And at the holidays they offer wonderful custom gift baskets of their goodies.  Come by for their free samples and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I'm having a tough time justifying going here anymore.  I like their product and the idea of getting fresh bread without a bunch of junk in it.  But every time I go to get a loaf it's either sold out or not ready or too hot to slice or something else. If I can't get the product, there's a problem. If you wanna check it out, they make decent sandwiches, and the bread is pretty good, IF you can get it.  The hours aren't real great either."}
{"text":"Apparently they don't serve sandwiches at this location during the summer time because business is too slow and they're trying to cut back on expenses. So, I only tried the triple chocolate scone and a lemon bar. The scone was decent, but nothing special. The lemon bar was the better of the two, but the lemon flavor was too subtle. I'll probably be back in the fall to try a sandwich and i still have to try their coconut bread, which I've heard good things about. They do serve some bread by the slice, but the coconut loaf isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Our first visit...and I was starving. My wife suggested it, and I was totally in to trying something new! I ordered a sandwich only to find out that they were out of the chimichuri sauce. My wife made fun of me because this always happens to my order. I changed my order and was then told that they were again out of something! Needless to say, we left and went to Panera"}
{"text":"Best Great Harvest Bread in Las Vegas.  Employees were real cool and the bread well it is out of this world and its whole grain no bleached or enriched flour.  I like to take some home and make french toast or bread pudding.  You can even freeze it for later.  Just buy a bunch of loaves and freeze and use for parties, picnics or camping trips. We bring a loaf on our drive to California and its great with a cup of coffee on the road ."}
{"text":"Keep me away from those Savanah Bars because those things are addicting!!! 

What a great place! I walk in and first thing I hear is, \"Hello, would you like to try a free sample?\" And I'm like, \"Yes, yes oh yes!\", even though a minute ago I told myself that I would be strong. But how can I refuse when the bread is fresh baked and oh so good? 

I love their High Five Fiber loaves. It's pretty much the only bread I eat nowadays. If I'm going to a special gathering and need something different, I'll pick up a loaf of their Berry White Chocolate and toast it a little more in my oven. My husband loves the Coconut Walnut bread. Oh geez, and their Whole Wheat Pancake mix is wonderful. Hey, did I mention the Savannah Bars? 

The only thing I didn't like was the chocolate chip cookie mix. Tried it once, not a fan. The chips were tiny and it cookies definitely tasted like they were from a mix.  I'm still giving 'em five stars 'cause maybe it's just me because I normally make my cookies from scratch."}
{"text":"I love that upon walking in they ask you if you want a sample of bread!  Sometimes I feel bad because I ask for a couple of samples then I get FULL and I forget what I went there for to buy. I recently had a new sandwich there ... Avocado Turkey Club... they make their sandwiches fresh and the meats they use are real not that processed junk. They also use fresh bread that they baked that day. Their cookies are pretty good too... my fav is the chocolate chip oatmeal, I always come back for that and they are HUGE.  They also serve breakfast sandwiches for those earlier risers, I'll be sure to try one of those.  If you're in the area check it out... you might like it!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was actually a chain restaurant, you can't really tell since the store is really inviting and homey, and the employees are super friendly and approachable. My favorite so far is the cold Turkey Pesto on the grainiest bread I could order (forget what the bread was called). The balsamic vinegar dressing was just enough to not make the sandwich soggy. It wasn't too heavy for lunch and I saved the other half of my sandwich for a later afternoon snack. They do have a loyalty program, but no physical card. Just give your name to the cashier and they can look you up. My husband thought the cinnamon twist was a bit too sweet, so I'd opt for the Monkey Bread (which they use to make the cinnamon twist). I didn't care too much for the scone, but the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The free samples are dangerous...the pumpkin nut thing was AMAZING. So I had to leave with a loaf. The kids behind the counter are super warm & friendly. Great bread, great service."}
{"text":"I came in an hour before close and wanted to order a sandwich. They were pretty much sold out of all flavors of bread except for some different wheats. But the girls were all very helpful and kind while I chose my sandwich and ask about soups. The sandwich was made fresh and delivered to me within two minutes of ordering. 

I got light wheat, mayo, turkey, provolone, cheddar and lettuce. The give a generous helping of the meat! A nice meal for a reasonable price. You MUST try their oatmeal chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"I love this company, but this location is awful. The lady at the counter was rude. I came to this store a couple weeks ago and brushed the bad service off. I thought she must be having a bad day. But I came in again with my family and she acted as if we were disturbing her. I went to the location on horizon and it was a huge difference. I will be giving that one 5 stars. They also didn't have any bread ready. I'm not sure if she's a manager but I won't be going into this location again specifically because of the service we received from her. The other girl with her was very pleasant and I feel bad that she has to work with such a miserable person."}
{"text":"GH used to be one of my favorites. The Bonanza location was seriously the best and is sorely missed. I went to the Marks store today for lunch...where do I begin? I was greeted by a less than friendly cashier who not once offered me a slice of bread. No biggie since I would have declined anyway but not to be offered...strange. I got a very simple turkey sandwich and other than the bread (which was, as usual, fantastic!) it was really lackluster. The turkey was somewhat dry and the edges of the cheese were hard. I got it with basil mayo but it was so scarce I couldn't taste it-not one bit. 
Maybe the most disappointing part of my visit was the sugar cookies. What in the crap has happened to the formerly soft, buttery, fresh cookies with the perfect amount of delicious frosting? Let me tell you...they're not to be found at this store! The cookies were hard! Not inedibly hard but just not the soft sugar cookies that, in my book, made GH my most favorite cookie stop. Boo! 
To add insult to injury, I get all the back to work and realize that I never got my drink! Ugh! I love your bread, GH, but I will not be back for sandwiches or cookies!"}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place. Not only are the breads amazing, but they have everything you need to make a great bread plate, including jams and whipped honey.  Don't let price chase you away -- it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I'll say it again, as I've said before...I love the items this company offers.  This is probably my second favorite location to the North Las Vegas location.  You get a free slice of bread when you walk into the store and they seem to favor the Beatles and Star Wars in their decorating scheme.

I suggest lunchtime in order to get one of their specialty sandwiches prepared.  My favorite is the Pesto Turkey...so good!  

My only complaint is that they have a Star Wars trivia question to answer in order to get a free cookie (my favorite thing they sell).  Being a Star Wars fan, I answer every single time I go in, but they always seem annoyed that I do.  Suggestion?  Don't offer that as a promotion."}
{"text":"Imagine going to McDonalds for a Big Mac and finding out they've decided to only serve that particular sandwich (their most popular) once or twice a week.  That's what purchasing bread at Great Harvest Bread Company is like.  Well, no...that's what Great Harvest would be like if the girl behind the counter was flipping you off with a smile on her face at the same time.

In my opinion, their best item (besides their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies) is their loaf of Cheddar Garlic bread.  It's quite possibly the only reason why I still stop by this place anytime I'm in the area.  However, it's been a few years and I figured they may have replaced that item in that time.  So, I called one of their locations and was told that they still serve that particular bread on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

This past Saturday, my father was looking for breadbowls for a soup his wife had prepared and I suggested Great Harvest.  We walked in and each got our complimentary piece of bread by the rudest girl that I have ever been helped by.  I looked at their racks and noticed a lack of Cheddar Garlic bread.  At this point, my sister asked the same girl if they had any in the store to purchase.  She responded with a scoff...\"I only make that bread on Thursdays.\"  Trust me when I say that you informing me that this item is unavailable will hardly lead to a meltdown on my part.  What I can't handle, however, is your show of annoyance at my inquiries and complete lack of customer service.  I not only won't be back, but I'll make sure to provide any friends, business contacts or general aquaintances with an alternative business that is only too happy to treat their customers as if they're actually wanted."}
{"text":"It was my first time here & I was very happy with the customer service rendered to me by Korya. She was very polite, knowledgeable of the products that they are selling & offered me sample of the bread that I can't refuse. It was delicious! Thank you Korya! I will be back again soon. I bought the Harvest White, Sourdough & their vanilla honey butter. That butter was yummy!"}
{"text":"i come here often for the fresh bread. i love crazy things like sunflower seeds and flax all with wheat. i don't mind paying up to 6 dollars for a loaf of bread if i love it and that i do with this little bundle of carbs. (good carbs though! promise!) as soon as you walk in they offer you a slice (more like a chunk, but I'm not complaining!) of one of their breads offered that day.
my three favorites of the healthy loaves being flax oatbran, dakota, and the high 5 fiber. the cinnamon swirl always makes me want to buy a huge loaf of it and warm it up topped with some vanilla ice cream. i'm sure it would be good right now with the holidays! i would go and try a chunk of it if i were you. they have sweet and savory breads, so whatever your little tastebuds desire that day you can get your fix!
i have never had any of their sandwiches made in shop, but i can only imagine the love i would have for them. also make a note that they are closed on sundays.
happy loafing! be sure to get a punch card because i am sure you'll be back."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed.
I ordered the Chipotle Cheddar Pecan sandwich.
It's description reads:
Cheddar, sweet and spicy pecans, chipotle mayo, onions, cucumbers, roasted red peppers, banana peppers, jalapeños and lettuce.

Sounded great, I order the mayo on the side. 

Upon opening the wrapper I was surprised to see how small the sandwich seemed. Lifeless in comparison to my fiancé's spicy turkey. Probably because it didn't have meat... so I take a big bite expecting and sweet & spicy burst of flavor.

What a let down. It had basically no flavor. Surely the chipotle mayo couldn't be the sole flavor provider. So I open it up to find there were no cucumbers, few roasted red peppers, no banana peppers and NO JALAPEÑOS! 
After double checking the ingredient list I also realize that tomatoes are NOT listed. But here they are, on my sandwich list.

How hard is it to make a sandwich correctly?! What a waste of money. 

I also ordered two Swiss turkey sandwiches for the kids with the herbed Italian mayo. Not impressed. 

You get two stars because the spicy turkey saved the day. But it's pretty easy to shine next to what I had."}
{"text":"This was a little gem I found right by my house. They make all of their breads fresh daily and you get a free slice every time you go in, so you can try every bread you want! My mom and I ordered sandwiches and they were amazing! A bit pricey but I would rather get a sandwhich there then go to say Panera. Definitley try the white chocolate cherry bread and next time I go in I have my eye on the pumpkin choc chip bread! MMMMM!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  We went for the first time to grab a little snack. We were surprised that they offer a free slice of bread.  We bought a berry bar and chocolate chip scone...yummy.  For our free slices we tried the pumpkin spice and the cinnamon swirl bread.  These were heavenly.
 The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was clean and enjoyable.  We can not wait to go back and try other goodies."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place about a year ago after looking for new lunchtime spots near my office. It is now one of the regular lunch choices. First, you are greeted with a nice slice of bread upon entry and usual have a few choices for the sample. The sandwiches are very high quality, made fresh, and always leave you satisfied. I have also tried almost all of their salads and they too are good sized portions with fresh, tasty ingredients. The other draw for me is their loaves of fresh baked specialty bread - whether its the asiago/pesto loaf for sandwiches or white chocolate raspberry for French toast I love picking up something delicious and unique from time to time. Service is always fast and professional and the 60's/sci fi décor is charming."}
{"text":"This place is so solid. Location is kinda weird, they used to be in a really easy to find location...somewhere closer to 615 but now they are tucked into a shopping plaza where the old Staples used to be. 

I'm guessing rent was cheaper. :D

Anyway, they make awesome bread, sandwiches, muffins, brownies - you name it. 

It's a family ran spot with I think a brother and sister combo running the joint. Not sure but that was the vibe I got. Either way, worth a visit. 

They also offer Dog bones for your pup and they're BOMB. Our dog mows these things with vigor and he's picky about snacks. 

Out.

{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly staff offering bread samples. Ham and swiss on sourdough was fresh and delicious. I love ham and their ham is delicious. Swiss cheese was excellent too. You pick from their signature sandwiches or build your own. They offer a daily soup as well as breads and cookies. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Used to be a customer when I lived in Connecticut. So happy to have found them again out here in Vegas! Fantastic baked goods...free samples...and oh man, the aroma of baked bread when you walk in the door!"}
{"text":"I had this chain in Corvallis, OR and really enjoy the cinnamon rolls. Last time I was in I tasted the sourdough, strangely too sour for me but the fact that they bake fresh bread will keep me coming back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this company. Bread is baked fresh daily. They sell there day old bread for 50% off. They have great lunch specials with sandwiches. I would recommend white chocolate cherry swirl or pumpkin spice for bread. But if u cant decide they will give u a free taste."}
{"text":"Best chocolate chip scone I've EVER had. The bread is really yummy too. I would give this place 5 stars, but the service I received was pretty lacking. It obviously wasn't the owner; it was some blond high-school aged girl who was completely unenthusiastic, monotone, didn't smile at all, and spoke to me as if I was an idiot when I asked her questions.

Other than the service, this place get s a thumbs up in my book."}
{"text":"Good quality bread. Free samples and plenty of breads to choose from. They also sell spreads and jams. Cookies and other baked goods sold here as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The baked goods are fresh. The samples are amazing. And the atmosphere is nice. Love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I have been coming to this location and the one on Marks for years. Love the choice of music (Beatles, Smiths).

The only criticism I have for this location is in regards to the seating. Tables are small and too close together to seat two or more people comfortably. The fake flower pots on the tables simply reduce the use of space rather than add to the ambience."}
{"text":"There isn't much to say....great food and great service.  What more can you ask for?  I like the High 5 Fiber bread, Garlic Cheese loaf, and the Savannah Bars. Yum Yum Yummy!"}
{"text":"Cute sandwich shop. They have so many varieties of bread and sweets and prices are reasonable. I got the farmhouse sandwich and it was good. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"One stop shop for the best variety breads, cookies, sandwiches, jams, etc. This Great Harvest has reinvented the way you buy sandwiches by providing an upbeat classical and hipster vibe from the music to the ti-dye shirts on their backs. Your experience here will be second to none, once inside I guarantee you won't want to leave once you've embraced the rich delicious smells of fresh baked breads and treats or maybe enjoying a fresh baked mouth watering blueberry scone outside in the beautiful open courtyard is more your style. Regardless your style or taste buds, the owners Dane and Kimmi will have you leaving with a smile on your face. If your tired of the sloppy sandwich chains (subway, port of subs, etc.) this location is the place to go."}
{"text":"I greatly enjoy coming Great Harvest Bread Company.  I used to eat at a location in upstate New York,  and was pleasantly suprised when I found one near. Very friendly staff that greats you with a smile and 'hello' for all that enter, engaging,  respectful, kindly offering bread to all when you're deciding on options (so many choices). Staff engage customers in conversation and are really pleasant, the tv plays great shows. I come on my own, with my husband,  with colleagues,  and of course grab bread for family and office events.  The sandwiches as well as breads and treats I've purchased have always been tasty.    I grew to appreciate it even more when I recently visited the Henderson Location on Marks street where the service is not as friendly (see that review seperately).  Thank you staff, as well as owners for creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"In general,  I enjoy Great Harvest Bread Company;  I used to eat at locations before I moved here and love the location on Hualapai.  The is was my first venture to this location.  I happened to see it in route to the furniture store and decided to come back for lunch after my purchase. The first thing I noticed,  no welcome when entering..it's a small thing,  but the extra touch that I'm used to at other locations (the store did a a few people, but not by any means crowded).  There was a young lady ringing people and a couple of people in line;  another passed me to take a sandwich to someone, without so much as a peep. I paused the bread slices awaiting my turn, the young lady went back behind the counter, no comment,  no offer of bread. It was my turn so I went to order; no smiles or kindness from the young lady ringing. ..only appeared to be annoyed as I smiled and told her how much I enjoyed the other location and it was my first time there. I asked a question, and with a roll of the eye, was told they didn't have the item I requested. I ordered the sandwich, she rang order & pushed the receipt to me across the counter (not for signature,  but my copy. .is it too much to ask to hand a customer a receipt ). She did ask me if I would like bread/butter, and when giving it to me did the same,  sat it on the counter near the register and slid it across. All the while with a scowl.  The young lady who brought my sandwich, no smile,  appeared irritated as well. The sandwich was ok; great pesto, but the ends of the bread were harder than I'm used to for some reason and the shredded iceberg lettuce was wilted. Perhaps an off day, perhaps selective with niceties, I don't know,  but the staff did not make a good impression to me at this location. With a range of options for good food, I tend to choose places with good customer service. Perhaps management can work on this with staff and perhaps things may improve...I guess time will tell."}
{"text":"I'll get straight to the point. I walked in and was greeted by a super nice girl who immediately asked me if I wanted to sample any of their six or seven breads they had ready. I had a hard time choosing but eventually settled on the White Chocolate Cherry Swirl. She cut me a good one inch piece off and put a dab of butter and evened it all out for me. I realize this place has a religious affiliation but man oh man is their bread HEAVENLY. Soft and fluffy with bites of cherry to give it some crunch with the white chocolate so amazingly creamy. I was blown away. I had been wanting some ice cream or yogurt all day but after having some of this I was more than satisfied. At eight dollars for this particular loaf I can't say I will make this a weekly stop but every couple of weeks they can bet on seeing me in there. 

Great bread, Great service. Little bit on the pricey side but I think it's worth it. Especially when you get an entire loaf which will probably last you at least a couple of days unless you are like me and use it as a meal replacement."}
{"text":"I wasn't very thrilled about my order. I ordered my food through post mates and I was really looking forward to a yummy sandwich. I ordered a Turkey and Avocado Club sandwich, which was not enjoyable at all. My sandwich was so soggy on wheat bread and it immediately fell apart on the first bite from all the sogginess. I also ordered a cinnamon roll. The taste was great, but the glaze was unpleasant. Definitely wasn't expecting to bite into undissolved sugar. All I really enjoyed was my lemonade and chips."}
{"text":"15 minutes for a cold sandwich when no one is in front of you is too long! My sandwich was made and set aside then other orders after me where started. The lettuce was old.

12/4 thank you Kim for making thing right!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.  When you walk in, the person in the counter offers you a piece of bread of your choice (out of a selection of flavors they chose).  

I've tried their Spicy Turkey sandwich, which is really good for those like a bit of a spice.  Their pumpkin cheesecake bread and white chocolate blueberry bread is also very delicious.  

Parking is plentiful as it's in a Smith's shopping center."}
{"text":"Is there anything better than the smell of freshly baked bread? Awesome place, super friendly people - eat in and take some home, plus they give free samples."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Great Harvest was just because I drove by and saw it. When I walked in a friendly employee greeted me and offered me a huge sample of a cookie. I bought a salted caramel cookie (amazing!) and a loaf of sourdough bread. I'm in love with the bread now. Their sandwiches are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Next best thing to a neighborhood bakery.  The specialty breads are good. The simple sandwiches are elevated because of the fresh bread. Customer service is great...can't go wrong with young, nice, pretty girls."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Costco. Noticed the bakery and went in. Ordered a breakfast sandwich that was great. Their products looked amazing and the smells were intoxicating. I bought a cinnamon roll for the road, and when asked, they willingly scraped off most of the icing. It was really good. This is now the best reason to visit Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast or lunch! If they offer you a slice of white chocolate blueberry bread, get it every time! They have ahhhhh-mazing sandwiches, of course, it's the bread. My favorite sandwich is the Spicy Turkey. And I can't leave without a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie."}
{"text":"Continuously great customer service. They are always patient and helpful. 
NEVER a bad experience and ALWAYS love the food.

Must try the new bread pudding bars. They are heaven. They aren't too heavy for what they are and the sweetness level is perfect. Very soft and always fresh. 
Lemon bars are good. The citrus taste is the main focus as a bite is 75/25 tart/sweet. It tastes fresh and bright. Love the tartness!"}
{"text":"I went in yesterday (Hualapai and Tropicana location) to check it out while I was driving around as I heard from my girl that this place makes great sandwiches and I was not let down. 

To start I was offered a free slice of bread with butter when I went in. I had the jalapeno cheese bread with a nice amount of butter and I was wowed. Not just by it being free or how thick the slice was, but by the amazing freshness and flavor.

I ended up ordering a chicken cranberry pecan sandwich on the honey wheat bread, and I have to say this is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. This sandwich easily fits in my top 10. It was so fresh, juicy, sweet, and creamy and really hit the spot. I think the super fresh bread had a lot to do with it.

Added a Coke and a large oatmeal raisin cookie (also fresh) and I was a happy camper.

If you have not tried them out I would say go for it. I will definitely be revisiting them.

Btw Loved all the star wars nerdy stuff they have at this place lol."}
{"text":"Just an update to my older review.  Great Harvest recently moved from the small pad next to Starbucks to a space twice the size on the corner of the same building.  It feels much more open and there is quite a bit more seating.  They also now have a Coke Freestyle machine.  Same great food, better location."}
{"text":"I stopped in today to get a scone after reading the reviews on Yelp.  They only had the chocolate chip scones left, but it was worth the stop.  Priced at $2.25, they are not over-priced for the size.  It was quite tasty.

I'll be stopping in from time to time to see what else they had.  The woman who waited on me was just delightful!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly great ! The food is amazing pastries always fresh and the service is super friendly! If you haven't you must try ."}
{"text":"I had the pumpkin chocolate chip bread and it was delicious! However, the customer service was awful. I ordered a cold turkey sandwich and received a hot grilled one that wasn't good because the turkey over powered the bread and it had way too much of the sauce they used. As a person that worked in customer service for 15 years, I was very disappointed at the girl's attitude at the cash register and the way she handled the situation. I wouldn't go back to this place."}
{"text":"Very over priced and crappy customer service not even a smile when I walked in I had never been there before and they acted like I put them out by asking questions. This place gives small business a bad name only reason for the 1 star is Starbucks is next door. And the day old bread racks were empty"}
{"text":"I absolutely love these sandwiches and crave them all the time! I opt for either the Classic Turkey ($7.25), Avocado Turkey Club ($7.50), or Hummus Harvest ($6.95) depending on my mood; though the Classic Turkey is my go-to. The sandwiches are stacked high and are delicious. For around $7, it's a great deal for lunch! And they have something for everyone; vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free choices are available. They offer gluten free bread in slices for your sandwich or in loaves to take home. I can vouch that it's seriously yummy! Call ahead of time if you're ordering a GF sandwich because they have to defrost it :) 

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because although their GF bread is made without wheat, no precaution is taken to make sure it does not become contaminated (but they do give you fair warning about cross-contamination). I cannot with confidence recommend this spot to fellow gluten-intolerants or Celiac's. It's a hit or miss for me, and sometimes I do get sick. I noticed that maybe the staff could be trained on how to prepare a GF sandwich. I've had to explain to please not use the toaster on my bread because I could have an allergic reaction if it picks up crumbs from regular bread. Some simple changes could make a huge difference and make it possible for those with less severe allergies to enjoy the food here! Because what's the point of carrying a GF product if those who need it can't eat it?!

Other than the gluten thing, I think this place is the best. I always recommend it to my friends looking for a good sandwich or an affordable lunch. Keep up the great work Great Harvest Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place Rocks.  Tina is AMAZING!  I hadn't been there for months and I'm sure there had been hundreds of patrons since I was last there and when I walked in, Tina, the owner, remembered my NAME!!!!   Very entrepreneurial.  They don't remember my name at that \"other\" bakery around the corner on Ft Apache.  

They have a customer appreciation French Toast breakfast made with their Challa Bread every quarter.  I mean, eggs, bacon/sausage, fruit, coffee, juice, etc...It's a grub session for sure.  

When you go there to buy their baked goods, they have something for everybody.  I am partial to their Dakota Bread, but they have plenty of bread samples just in case you can't make up your mind.  They also have killah brownies, OH SNAP...almost forgot!!!  When in season their Black Berry Scones will change your life.  Amazing!  

They make a variety of cookies too.  Nom Nom Nom...

If you're an athlete of just a care about your health, this is a good place to find whole grain foods to provide you with proper nutrition for optimal health.

Chow!"}
{"text":"Simple... and fabulous. Fresh bread, fast and friendly service and reasonable prices are what makes me go back to Great Harvest whenever I am hungry and in the area. 

When you enter Great Harvest, one of the friendly staffers will most likely offer you a free slice of bread. Can't beat free! 

The only food served here are sandwiches, although they do have some shelves with different spreads for their breads and yummy looking breakfast cereals. Sandwiches are ordered piece by piece... Meaning you pick your bread type, your cheese, your meat, and your toppings individually. 

They also have the best chocolate chip cookie I have had in a long, long time."}
{"text":"Is it weird that what sold me on my new house was that it was close to D.W. Bistro AND Great Harvest Bread?  Maybe.  But I had not had GHB since college in Kentucky and have now made several trips to this location since moving in to my new digs.  

I have had the jalapeno jack breakfast sandwich (very spicy and tasty) and taken breakfast pastries to my office for my coworkers.  The Savannah bars and scones are my favorites, but anything you order will be good.  I did purchase a loaf of bread a couple of weeks ago, but generally I skip it because it is just too hard to wolf it down before it goes all old and stale.  Beware of the free samples if your plan is to make all your coworkers fat and not yourself!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches on artisan bread, yummy sweet treats, Kitschy shabby sheik decor with classic tunes to get away from the Vegas heat, served by friendly faces."}
{"text":"The first thing I saw when I came in is the woman on the front asking me if I want to try their fresh bread, after trying the bread which I like very much I told her that I will come back to try sandwich later on and that's what I did. 
I tried the sandwich tuna which was really good and I highly recommend it. 
The place looks very clean and appealing and above all the service is really good. 
I recommend this place to whoever love different type of bread and homemade style!"}
{"text":"Strictly service. Walked in and was not greeted. Placed my order and waited.... and waited.... and waited......... I checked the time and noticed my sandwich was at the 25 minute mark. A younger lady came in and I over heard her paying for a catering order which I assume is the reason why my sandwich was taking an eternity. When I finally got my sandwich it was wrong. I asked for no banana peppers on it but I guess that made the order far too complicated to execute. I understand places get set behind with large orders but my suggestion is to make the customer orders while working on the larger orders to prevent people from waiting an absurd amount of time for a cold sandwich."}
{"text":"great little place. very friendly and helpful staff. I'm not really a bread person, but came here based on yelp reviews. soon as you walk in they give you a sample. I ordered the spicy turkey sandwich and it was good. they have all different sorts of bread and I'm really glad this place is open. it's a great place to go to pick up something as a gift or something. I'll be coming back here for sure and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great! Amazing food, everything is fresh and tastes great. The staff is always very nice, and they offer free samples of bread and other baked goods when you come in. I recommend the turkey bacon ranch grilled sandwich and the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie! 
One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best bread in town! We love having them so close!! The pumpkin chocolate chip and cinnamon burst are some of our favorites. Always great service, friendly employees and love that you can try a slice on your visit."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! It doesn't get any better than walking in and getting handed some pumpkin spice bread with butter on it. YUM. 

We got two sandwiches, and I honestly forgot what they were. They were really good though, and they reminded me of if you wanted to make yourself a really good sandwich at home, and you happened to have all the fresh ingredients to make it lying around. And you have the motivation to go through building a badass sandwich. That's what it was like.

They also had DELICIOUS bread to buy, and we go the white chocolate raspberry bread based on Yelp reviews. It did not disappoint! We ate it for breakfast for the next 4-5 days, and it was heavenly. 

My only issue is that they are not open late AT ALL. I mean 4 o'clock? come on. I have to leave work on break to get stuff here during the week, which just won't ever happen. This leaves weekends only."}
{"text":"Wonderful, quaint little store with great options and high quality. My wife and I are gluten free so it's hard to find quality bread and they do a very good job here."}
{"text":"Amazing! I've always loved their fresh and unique selection, especially the cinnamon swirl loaf and pepperoni rolls. Today I experienced the most curious customer service I have ever received! The employee was so kind and willing to go above and beyond to take care of my needs. 

Definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Costco to fill up our gas tank before heading back to California and found this place. They have a amazing selection of freshly baked bread. From sourdough to pumpkin chocolate chip. We will definitely be coming back each time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not a fan of low-carb, no-carb, smart-carb, whatever-carb? Me either!

My favorites are the honey wheat, blueberry lemon coffee cake, and pumpkin spice with or without chocolate chips... 1 loaf is ~$7. Seems like a lot for 1 loaf, but it is so good!!! The supermarket variety does not cut it!!! 

The sandwiches are good too ($6.55). You build your own sandwich by using a checklist thing. It probably won't seem too spectacular at first, but trust... it aint Subway!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised how much I liked their bread.  We tried the Dakota and it was a yummy multi grain."}
{"text":"This place bakes the best bread have ever had!  My friend was talking about their amazing pumpkin bread, so I had to try some for myself.  Let me tell you it was way better then I had anticipated! We also shared a tuna sandwich which was also delicious & while it was being made we were offered to try the coconut bread & red & blue bread (white bread with dried blueberries & cranberries).  Both were soo good!  All the employees were also very sweet.  It makes me very sad there aren't any stores in New York!"}
{"text":"I love going here. The bread is the best and I love their sandwiches. The owner Dane is so friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place! You can tell fresh ingredients are used. Wish there was a location close to where I live. 

Love the spicy turkey pepperjack"}
{"text":"A little disappointed when I purchased the white chocolate cherry bread yesterday, it only had a few white chocolate chips and not a lot of cherries either. Please make it the way you used to."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm from Los Angeles and always stop here on my way back to L.A. I get a sandwich and 3-4 loafs of pumpkin chocolate chip to take back home."}
{"text":"This is seriously THE most amazing bread shop and sandwich shop in town!!! I love it! Always such friendly staff and immaculately clean!"}
{"text":"We love this place. The bread is awesome and has no preservatives or weird ingredients. The baked goods are generous sizes and delicious as well. So glad to have one of these places close by!"}
{"text":"Love love love Great Grains. Always so fresh & tasty. (My personal fave is the veggie on wheat with sundried hummus) Restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and clean, staff is very friendly,  samples of daily bread are ridiculously terrific. I only have one request: PLEASE CONSIDER ADDING A LOCATION CLOSER TO LAKE LAS VEGAS! There are NO good sandwhich restaurants over here. Subway is the only game in town as I am certainly not a fan of Capriotti's...(hint: The new Cadence shopping center going in where flagship Smith's is being built would be ideal!!)."}
{"text":"Heavenly bread. When you walk in, you're immediately greeted and offered to sample each of their fresh baked bread / cookies of the day.  

The sandwiches are large, healthy, and hearty.  Highly recommend for adults and kids."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I grew up on great harvest bread and was happy to find one here in Las Vegas after moving here. Each time I have gone they have had a new bread to try. I really enjoy their white chocolate raspberry/blueberry breads. They remind me of butterbraids, sweet and delicious! They also have a variety of other sweets such as cookies and bars. They are s great place to get bread for yourself or to put together a gift. Nothing is better then freshly made bread!"}
{"text":"I love love love their Dakota Bread! We make a special trip here every time we are in Vegas for a loaf of this bread and one of their wonderful sandwiches. We tried their delicious cookies. One was so big we split it so we had the other one the next day. The peanut butter was my favorite. Well worth the special trip there."}
{"text":"Awesome cheap bread with very nice people! I've always had great experiences in any Great Harvest Bread Company joint I've gone to!"}
{"text":"I should have ran, (not walked), in the other direction when I saw the word \"Bread\". Chocolate chip cookies are a weakness of mine, and, oh - what's this? Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread? With butter? That is a recipe for self-destruction! Everything in moderation, right? Nope. It seems like the logic part of my brain shuts down whenever there are cookies around me. My only purpose at that point in time would be to consume every cookie in site! (My motto in life should be, \"No cookie left behind\".) The Monster Cookie, (with the M&M's), does it to me all the time. The sandwiches are excellent - especially the Spicy Turkey Pepperjack on five-grain bread, and the B-L-T-riffic. 2 more favorites - the Savannah Bar and the White Chocolate Blueberry Bread - soooo good! On the days that I want to over-indulge, Great Harvest Bread Company is my first and only stop!"}
{"text":"We were immediately greeted and offered a free sample of the their bread. Bread was delicous, we immediately bought 2 loafs. Bread is made fresh at the store. Very friendly service. They also sell sandwiches, will update when I try their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Super attentive guest service.  Reps properly trained. 

Food quality - five swirly large lollipops. . 

Great spot for a healthy lunch.  It just takes a tad longer for good handmade food."}
{"text":"First let me say I will never come back to this place and they jacked my Coach sunglasses!! I was impressed upon initially walking in b/c it smelled great. They offer you a free taste of bread as you walk in. My bf went w/ red, white and blue. It was good but not spectacular. I went w/ Coconut Walnut. OMG really good. but the service RUINED it for me. 

We came in for a brkfst sandwich of which they only have 2 options eggs and ham or eggs and bacon - seems simple enough right? you also (acc'd to the paper you write your order down on yourself ) to add tomato or green pepper. Odd combo but ok. mybf ordered 
1) ham, egg, cheese, tomato and green peppers
me i ordered:
2) bacon, egg, cheese and green peppers

well first she came back .. do you want cheese? 
yes.. i circled cheddar.. ok
then she came back.... we are out of wheat bread do you want another?
well.. yeah (i dont want to eat a bread free sandwich)... what do youhave?
her: we have xyz and soudough
me: ok Ill have soudough (my bf ordered white)

we finally get our order - both were on sourdough I might add.. 
Neither had tomato or green peppers... 
my bf took his bk and asked about it and she just looked @ him and said well.. what do you want me to do?
the BF: he said well can you fix it? 
she started  um... well.. um.. and um... er... 
finally my bf just said well can you give it to me on the side? 
HER: yeah that's a good idea. you can see the photo on the side.


I walked out and realized I had left my Coach glasses on the table. I went bk in and they were already gone. This was not a place I'd ever go back. After this neither of the girls would look us in the eye. it seemed like 2 girls that had no idea what they were doing.. One of them commented to my bf that they had been there since 5 am to bake bread.. um.. so that means its ok to mess up our order b/c you start your workday early? 
The fact this place was empty should've tipped us off. As we left there was an elderly couple walking in, I said whatever y ou do just stick to the bread - the sandwiches are TOO COMPLICATED for them to make and they've been working since 5 (she said it, me.. so this was not an insult, just a disclaimer I was passing along)"}
{"text":"If I could make bread like this I would open my own bakery and be awesome!  This bread is so delicious and their sandwiches are pretty great!  The price is right and they give you free samples of their amazing bread while you wait.  Big samples.  Like whole slices of bread, not mini little bites.  I don't eat a lot of bread so when I do, I want it to be worth it!  My wife also told me this place originated in Montana.  Anything from Montana is good in my book.  This place, Moose Drool, my Wife.  All top notch, and from Montana."}
{"text":"I've recently turn diabetic and have had to modify my diet considerably. I was under the wrong impression that rice cakes were a good snack item as they are very low in calories ..about 50 to 90 depending on the flavor. But all other things considered my blood sugar value has been a very mild roller coaster. Well time to hit Google and study up on these round tasty treats. Much to my surprise
I discovered that they are nothing more then pure puffed rice. Well we all know that rice is on top of the forbidden list of carbs. Right ? Fellow campers. Of course bread is as well. But reading through all the research and 350 responses one truth stood out like a cheap Saturday night $10.00 chrome pistol in a Mississippi juke joint. 
Pumpernickel bread. 
Instead of the rice cake substitute half a slice of pumpernickel bread. The same 50 calories and no artificial ingredients.
So off to Yelp in my quest to find the best in Vegas- Henderson area. It didn't take long to determine that this bakery would be the answer to my dreams.
I called about 3.30 pm to make sure it was still in stock and their hours of operation. The kind person who answered informed me that they had 3 left and was kind enough to place 1 aside with my name and phone info. Sure glad that I did because by the time I arrived...about an hour later it was the sole survivor. The bakery  has a very large seating area ...a good sign of a heavy loyal customer base. On the left side of the counter is a sampling area...just point and ask and you will receive mamma from heaven. I succumbed to the banana bread....a very wish choice indeed. 
I departed with my pumpernickel loaf tucked under my arm as if I were a star quarter back running for the goal post and the other side determined to place my face in the grass. Of course I made it home without as much as a single red light. Oh how I wish you could savoir the flavor of that first bite...and the second one. What a delight. On a score of 1 to 10 this is with out a doubt an 11. As Clint Eastwood would say...I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love the pumpkin bread !! Sooo good!!
Chocolate cookies to die for ! 
Thank for making fresh bread daily"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Sandwiches on point and their breads and pastries are excellent. Today I got the white chocolate raspberry, still warm! :)"}
{"text":"I woke up this morning with a serious craving for fresh, soft sweet bread. After yelping for about an hour I came across this place and I'm so glad I did! Walked in and it was a little busy but I was immediately greeted by a chipper young lady and asked if I'd like a sample. Well don't mind if I do :) I was a handed a huge slice of my choice- I chose the cinnamon ? something... It was so delicious and the portion was big enough that it satisfied my sweet tooth. I was still hungry so I ordered a sandwich-the turkey club. So yummy, my little baby in utero was doing flips. I was very satisfied during my first visit that I'm sure I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way from Glendale, AZ to Salt Lake City, UT.  Grabbed gas and found this place open and ready for customers.

The woman inside answered my silly questions and gave us samples of a few items.  
Everything was great!

I had a small piece of blueberry cake and should have bought the whole cake.
My breadwise companion had a slice of bread with butter.  What kind, I do not know exactly, but it was tasty and we should have purchased more.

I heartily a-proof of this place.

Proof, yeah I said it.  You'll either get the joke or not.  
Rise up to the challenge, knead it over in your breadbox a while."}
{"text":"This is a great bakery and they never disappoint. I've tried several of their breads and they are all really good. The cinnamon swirl bread is amazing if you want a dessert bread. We recently found out my daughter is gluten free and they have a great selection for breads for her. The granola bars are amazing, as well as their soup mixes. Hands down, it is a great stop and worth a trip."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and it was definitely worth it. They were supposedly closed at 6 and we walked in at 605pm i felt like an A*hole but they insisted that they take care of us. We tried the turkey bacon ranch and BLT-riffic and grabbed a loaf of pumpkin spice bread to take home. Im so glad we ate here because it was one of the best put together sandwiches ive had. they craft them really well and its not sloppy. I really dont appreciate a sloppy sandwich and the pumpkin spice bread was amazing. i will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I had placed this review originally as a 2 star. However. There is something to be said for integrity. I appreciate Ms Kim for her prompt response and help in the situation. You do not find many owners going above and beyond or leaving it to the minions to handle. I love their bread and sandwiches - sugar cookies are scrumptious. My new found favorite bread is the Cheddar Garlic. They only make it on Fridays but it is so yummy and makes me think it will go awesome with some really nice soup. I am single and cannot always finish a loaf - just do not eat enough bread in a week and to me - never freezes well. But the rolls freeze great. Going to try the rolls on Friday - now have to plan what soup to have with them. In addition, I like the accessories they have in store and I have been thinking if making up some Christmas packages that may do well.  Thanks again for your help and continued service in our valley - bread rules!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this Summerlin gem while looking for a good sandwich and a lunch break during a long moving day. These guys were about to close up shop, but we had just enough time to sample delicious breads (generously cut and slathered in butter upon request) and order up giant salads. 

I love their popeye bread (cheese, peppers, vegetables, spices, oh my!), the blueberry cream cheese bread (and scones!) the monkey bread, and 

The Greek salad has enough hummus and substance to feed a small Trojan army, and the regular salad sports what is probably close to an entire chicken breast atop fresh greens. 

There's an outdoor patio, fairly quiet and enjoyable for a strip mall area, and the restaurant inside is themed in The Beatles and Star Wars - a quaintly nerdy combination that is comfortable and endearing. The staff is helpful, friendly, and makes bomb sandwiches, smoothies, milkshakes, cookies, scones, BREAD, coffee, and salads. What else can you ask for?

Well, since we're on the topic, I would like to ask for soup. Adding a few hot cup options to the blackboard just makes sense, and would complement those breads and sandwiches perfectly. 

Do note that you have to like their Summerlin Facebook page in order to access the monthly menus for this location."}
{"text":"I had the turkey pesto sandwich with provolone cheese. A great blend of flavours. The service is great. You fill out an order card and pay. Sit down and relax then they bring you your sandwich. A great place to chill and have a bite to eat with friends. It's bit small so fills up pretty quickly but it doesn't seem overcrowded because the tables are spaced nicely."}
{"text":"Bread, that irresistible food item some simply snub and call: carbs. 
Whatever, listen up it's bread and the variety here is fresh and satisfies those taste buds:)
The issue I have here are those samples. Yes, free sample slices and after I taste a few, I'm full! Ha ha ha;)
Therefore, I leave with at least two loaves of the assortments they sell and they also can slice the loaves for you. Indeed- loaves plural. That's it, well they also have sandwiches breakfast ones and lunch ones.  So, stuff yourself, but go here hungry.  
When you entered the aroma draws you in, quickly since they have slices waiting for you to try.  Nope, you won't be able to resist the aroma wafting through this establishment.  Don't plan on counting calories here, this wonderful place is not for those people;). 
The baking is done on premises, hence the aroma wafting through Great Harvest:)"}
{"text":"Awesome and home made fresh breads .... congrats move to corner store and look great and more room for customer"}
{"text":"First things first, try their pumpkin bread.  Moist and spicy and full of pumpkin flavor.  Yum!   

Now on to the sandwiches. Their made on their homemade bread and the meats and veggies are always fresh.  I've tried a few sandwiches there and I love the beef with pesto.  As well as the turkey with cranberry.  

Service is friendly and they have preserves and spreads on sale.  As well as sauces etc.  

Love this place"}
{"text":"My most recent experience at this location was awful. The service was lousy and unfriendly. My friend and I ordered the same exact thing minute apart. We were told they had no sourdough bread, so we both subbed for honey wheat. My sandwich came quickly, and was delicious, but SMALL. After 10 minutes, we still didn't have my friend's sandwich (same exact one). Another 10 minutes passed and no one really looked like they were doing anything. When we finally get their attention, what do you know? They lost the \"ticket\" so they forgot about making the sandwich. Only a few minutes after that the sandwich came out (with sourdough bread), with no reference to the fact that it took almost 25  minutes longer to make that one. We noticed a young girl behind the counter handling the bread without gloves. It was the same girl who works the register, so I can't imagine it's hygienic to handle money and then handle ANYTHING without gloves. When I went up to ask for the manager the girl simply asked, \"do you want a cookie or something, or do you want me to comp your meal?\" But still no apology, and didn't even ask for feedback. They wound up refunding both of our meals, but the young employees should probably receive training on how to be more attentive and customer service oriented."}
{"text":"Oh My --- sandwiches are awesome --- Bread is amazingly good.   Not sure how often (a day) they make bread, but it tasted like it just came out of the oven.

And the smells are delightful.

Will be back for breakfast stuff."}
{"text":"My three favorite things about entering a Great Harvest are: the warm greeting on initial entrance, the delicious smell lofting in the air, and the thick slice of fresh bread offered at the counter. 

The way Great Harvest prepares their breads is one of the reasons why it is worth every penny. When you break into any of their loaves, the bounty of ingredients is clearly visible. For sandwiches, I love to get their cheddar garlic and have them slice it up. With bread like this, it is unnecessary to add any cheese to the sandwich or anything besides protein and veggies. I could make a meal out of it on it's own. Then follow it with some of their Sin Amen Swirl."}
{"text":"Totally dissapointed. The companies web site has Loaves of Bread not available in this store.  They slice all their bread and bag it with the exception of the asiago. I find it drys the bread out when sliced. I was told i could request a unsliced loaf and return tomorrow. Yeh. 20 minute drive to get a $9.00 loaf of Bread.  The windows are filthy and overall the place looked dirty. Don't think ill be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for GHBC but they fell short. I ordered 2 sandwiches for me and the wifey, asked for both to be toasted and to throw jalapenos on mine.

When I arrived home neither had been toasted and no jalapenos... The sandwiches tasted good but they weren't prepared the way we asked and for $15 I expect to have things done properly."}
{"text":"Very overpriced.. They make mistakes on your credit card. Only a few breads worth $8.00, the average price of a loaf of bread. I recommend that you save your time and money."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good they were out of the pumpernickel for the Rubin sandwich so I got it on sourdough it had great flavor and I am sure it would of been even better on the right bread  the salted caramel cookies are awesome so give this place a try and it also sells while loafs of bread"}
{"text":"Great Harvest was one of my regular places I went in the Seattle/Tacoma area to get my husband his sandwich bread.  They were also a permanent staple at the Federal Way farmers market, where we used to frequent.

We decided to come here on the way to Costco, to see if they had any of the same cheddar garlic bread that they used to sell in Federal Way.  I was very sad that this was not one of the breads at this location, and the only reason I marked this business down a star.  However, they had some really lovely alternatives for my husband, and some decent multi grain, seeded bread for me.  I have not tried any of the sandwiches here, so I cannot comment on them, but I imagine they are good on such fresh bread.  

Nowadays I have been visiting the Molto Mario farmers market for the wonderful sour bread and rye bread they have, but if I find another location closer to the SW area, I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, and I have tried different things. My all time fail-safe item to order is the turkey pesto grilled sandwich. The combination of flavors is quite difficult to not love. I've tried their pastrami sandwich and I've also ordered the plain grilled cheese which truth be told was disappointing. I love their pumpkin loaf!! I don't buy it because the time I did I ate the entire thing in one day :( it's that good. Their bread is all flavorful. I haven't had any that I didn't like. The baked bread changes on a daily basis but you know what to expect and when since they do have a sign as to what they bake on a weekly basis separated into everyday of the week. The decor is simply cute. Reminds me of an older generation house hold. The store front and restrooms are clean always. The only thing keeping me from rating the five stars are the girls working there. Not to say they don't do their job, they just don't seem to ever want to be there and are plain flat when talking to them. Again, the items are all amazing. I just wish the people employed there were more interactive."}
{"text":"Want warm and fuzzy....how about the fresh smell of baked bread!
Walking into Great Harvest Bread is like walking into your grandma's kitchen on \"bread\" day. 

The store is very warm and inviting with all kinds of breads displayed that have been freshly baked that day. Overwhelmed at what to buy...don't be. They  give FREE samples every time you come in.

I have only tried two breads from here so far and am addicted

1) Pumpkin chocolate chip bread - it will change your life! It is so good that I will probably give everyone I love it over the holidays. YUMMY! ($7.00)

2) Cinnamon Sugar Spice loaf ( I got a free sample of this one) It is so tasty, sweet and buttery. Delicious.

GHB sells made to order sandwiches as well that I am yet to try but will in the future.

All I know is that these breads really RISE to the occasion! :)"}
{"text":"The Marks St store has moved next door to a larger space, and it makes a difference. There's more merchandise on display, more accessible and attractive than before. It seems like employees are more attentive to customers too. 

This time I got the flax oat bran bread ($6.95/loaf), which was very good. There's still too much sodium and prices are still too high, but overall, an improvement at this branch, so I'm upping my rating to four stars."}
{"text":"This review is for Hannah who helped me out at the Bakery as I was passing thorough town! 

Greeted me. Kindly explained to me about their ways of getting things done from scratch and how variety is added every day. Super sweet. Gave me a delicious sample too!! 

The bakery is CLEAN, and inviting. The music was nice too. 
And their retail is so tempting!!! Too bad I had no more room in my car!"}
{"text":"Every Christmas marks the time that I venture over to Great Harvest for gifts of baked goods.  I usually go to the location on Marks in Henderson because it's near my job, but this store is actually closer to where I live.  The best thing about Great Harvest?  The free slice of bread you can get when you step inside a store, with butter if you want it; of course I want the butter!  I love bread, but I can't come here as much as I'd like or I wouldn't fit through their door before too long.  I like their products as gifts because everyone I've ever gifted their goods to has loved them, as well.  The cinnamon crunch bread is one of my favorites, but I also love the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf.  The cookies that they sell are a nice, big size with the snickerdoodle ones a fave, too.  If you ever need a carb fix, stop here and get yours."}
{"text":"I love Great Harvest for many reasons.  Reason #1 is that you can go in and get a free slice of fresh bread with butter--two of my favorite things.  I CAN live on bread alone, unfortunately.  Reason #2 is the pumpkin chocolate chip bread that they sell and this is the best time of year for that.  Reason #3 are the gift bags that you can get and give, especially during the holidays--I've gotten one at Christmas time for the past 4 years from my boss and I always look forward to the loaf of fresh wheat bread and 2 giant cookies nicely wrapped up for my enjoyment.  People love receiving delicious edibles and Great Harvest offers a selection that should satisfy anyone on your gift list."}
{"text":"I love freshly baked bread. This place is tucked away, so most of the time it is not busy. The honey whole wheat and the walnut coconut bread (only offered on Saturdays) are my favorites. They also offer a selection of honey, including cinnamon honey, and vanilla honey, which are pretty good although a little pricey.

The staff are pleasant and helpful, just remember to look at what bread is offered each day, as not all breads are offered each day throughout the week. I made the mistake of coming in for walnut coconut bread on a Tuesday, and was promptly rejected as it is only offered on Saturday. Also, closed on Sunday, kids."}
{"text":"ITS LIT. The samples they offer when you walk in is reason enough to come here. The sandwiches are FILLED with a lot of meat and cheese. Their service is always great. Try the white chocolate raspberry bread thing!! Straight fireeeeee"}
{"text":"Long line, customer service was not happy and they seemed unorganized and short handed.  Sandwiches were ok.  They hardly had any bread to choose from."}
{"text":"I was a fan in Denver and I'm a fan in Vegas. This place offers the best tasting and healthiest selection of bread. I've never had wheat bread that was almost doughy like white bread (great for making grilled cheese!) or yummy seeded bread that was the perfect compliment to a turkey sandwich. 

Their Vegas rolls here are white dinner rolls and are perfect for mini sandwiches, an addition to dinner or just to munch on. Again, they're super moist and delicious!

Bonus: getting a warm slice of bread with butter and honey while you're picking out your goodies. It just doesn't get better than this-- and if you're going to be a carbaholic like me, might as well get the best bread you can get!"}
{"text":"Great friendly customer service bread and cookies and other treats made fresh it smells so good in here.  Lots of vegetarian options available as well for sandwiches.  I normally just get sandwiches and coffee here for breakfast or lunch and they offer delicious samples from their cutting boards while you order.  They also have Coke fountain drinks with the fresh brewed coffee that they make one at a time for you."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the place smelled amazing! We ordered two scones, a cinnamon roll with icing and the original sandwich with ham. We received a free taste of coconut walnut bread. It was to die for!  The free sample was very very generous. The bread was the perfect balance of toasted coconut and with a little butter it was perfect. The chocolate scone was sweet but was balanced by the not too sweet cream cheese throughout the scone. This scone was definitely more of a dessert. The blueberry scone was more reminiscent of breakfast for me. Delicious in every way. My husband loved the original sandwich. It was huge! Definitely a good item to share. As far as the cinnamon roll is concerned, it was the least impressive item that we ordered. I wish it was warmed. The only thing missing was an espresso bar, but I get it - the business is bread not coffee. This place is much smaller than the one in Henderson. But the quality is the same! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Oh how my eyes lit up when I saw a Great Harvest in my neighborhood when I first moved here. There was one back in my hometown and that place was always loaded! Most days you couldn't even get into the bakery. It was that good. 

Even though this place is a franchise(I have some mixed contempt for any business that has more than three locations, local or national), I expected to still have access to all my favorite glorious calorie burdened breads. But I found not all choices are available by location. Darn. Alright, I can live with that. What was available on the menu didn't always translate to the shelves however... No matter the hour. Practically every time I went in, whatever the day or time, what was available on their calendar that I particularly wanted they either had not made yet, had sold out or not going to make anymore batches. Way to pop my balloon. I feel like that little kid on Despicable Me with the ice cream each time I go in. My mood especially regresses with the service. It's usually young employees, but I would think young employees would be just a teeeeny bit more chipper. As if I wasn't disappointed enough to walk out with an alternative choice, the feeling of being helped by unenthusiastic workers just don't make me excited to come back. But I still will. There's no bakery closer to home for me and despite the disappointments and service, what baked goods I do get will still be reason enough to come."}
