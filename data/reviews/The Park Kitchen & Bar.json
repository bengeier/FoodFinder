{"text":"Brought my Best Half here for lunch on Saturday. Having said this, a little back story is necessary: we did a proverbial \"coin flip\" between Park and OJs which share the same parking lot. OJs actually was the choice for no other reason than the \"flip.\" We entered OJs, were greeted and invited to sit anywhere. We chose a table along the windows in clear view of the bar and waited....................(20 min). The kicker was a couple that came in well after us was served. Left, still unacknowledged. I mean I am not \"pretty,\" but I am a decent human being. Anway, we walked over to Park. Entered Park, where we were greeted and invited to sit anywhere. The hostess followed us with menus and then our server took our drink order and was back before we even opened the menus. To be fair, there was very few customers but it was also1:30 pm.

I ordered the Sumo Burger with fries and Best Half ordered Butter Chicken. Took a bit for the food to arrive, which gave us time for conversation without mouths full. When the food did arrive it was fresh and hot. The Sumo was tasty, but the patty seemed a little dried out. The Butter Chicken was very nice (tasted good too)! Nothing worse than cheeky Butter Chicken!

I would come back. It is a nice spot for conversation and a meal! I think this establishment is possibly quiet on weekends as it is in the heart of Quarry Park which houses all kinds of large office business, so weekdays are busy. 

Sidenote: I also noticed a sign advertising decent happy hour deals on pints."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, although a few more veggie options would be perfect. The ambiance is awesome and I love the overall feel of the restaurant. The service is the part of this equation that is lacking; and the reason for the three stars instead of four or even five. On both of my visits, the staff have not been prompt, even with something as minor as refilling a beverage or bringing a to-go container."}
{"text":"Mixed emotions...enjoyed the burgers especially surf and turf; loved beet salad but a bite size salmon added to salad was not worth the added 6$;  the margarita pizza was less than acceptable...crust and pasty sauce was similar to a cheap frozen pizza."}
{"text":"I met friends at The Park on a Friday night. It's spacious and I liked the decor. Good service and good food.  Decent drink selection.  Prices are reasonable and fun music mix. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We love slushy drinks on the patio. There is cute decor in and out and their tacos are great! Dress up a bit for this place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, lots of tables. great service!!!! great local beers, Village Blacksmith, best dark ale.  Great food. We had the fish & chips, large portions. Also we had the chicken pineapple burger with a great citrus balsamic dressing on the salad was Great! Rum raisin bread pudding was good just needed more caramel sauce lol. Waitress made sure we took advantage of happy hour. Thanks Lorraine! We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Perfect establishment. 
Food was great, service was amazing, will def come back here again."}
{"text":"While we had a great experience here, I would classify this place as an upscale Apple Bees. We had the Chilled Shrimp Bruschetta to start. It was tasty but it was lacking a little zest - like balsamic vinegar. Also, we thought that the shrimp should have been warm. Following the appetizer, I had the famous Surf and Turf burger and my boyfriend had the Tenderloin. For the price, the tenderloin shouldn't have been as tough. It was great seasoning, however it wasn't integrated with the meat well and lacked in the end. The burger with the sweet potato fries was very good, although I had a hard time picking out the lobster. The hamburger meat was amazing and I felt that it over powered the lobster. For dessert, we had the ganache - amazing! Best dessert we've had in a while. 

Overall, the experience was good. The service was prompt, although at times it didn't feel sincere. The hostess had a great personality and treated us great, but our server wasn't 'in-it-to-win-it'."}
{"text":"Looks like a dinner inside.  Too bad such a cool name I thought.  Good beer happy hour.  $4 for a tiny glass of beer(sorry sleeve).  Good service and the food was surprisingly good, although overpriced."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened in place of another restaurant that recently closed.  I have to wonder if it is the same restaurant under a different name.  The decor didn't change much and the service and food sure as heck didn't improve.

The first thing you notice is the incredibly long wait for anything.  We sat down at noon and we didn't receive our food until about 1pm.  We were here on our lunch break. Since Quarry Park, is basically nothing but office buildings, you would think that they would know their clientele and be able to work with that.  Nope.  I saw a number of other tables wait a long time for everything.

Second, their food is terrible and cheap tasting.  I had the chicken pasta.  It tasted like they got the cheapest bargain brand canned sauces and pasta they could find.

I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"If you're coming here for a lunch during the week, make a reservation! Rookie move on my part.

The actual space is huge when you look at both the bar and restaurant side. Tons of room, but also tons of local businesses in the area that pick this as their lunch spot. So resos = good idea.

We needed a table for four, and were sat at the bar while we had our 20 min wait. Great beer and wine selection, and I was pretty pleased that they had guinness and strongbow on tap. Crown floats all day! 

When we finally got sat we were given one menu for the four of us. We asked for three more, and the server forgot about both our drinks and the menus for about 15 minutes.  She came back with the drinks after literally saying, \"Oh, Shit.\" as she walked by haha, and when she returned we again asked for menus. She forgot again and 10 minutes later asked if we were ready to order. Nope. Still don't have menus, miss...

We asked for food recommendations and her response was \"I don't really know..I've only worked here for 2 months, so I'm not sure what's good.\" Umm..2 months? Okay..

We ended up ordering the baked brie and the spring rolls for our appetizer.  The spring rolls were RIDICULOUS. I could eat those every day. The brie was super small and underwhelming.

My sister in law and I had the quesadillas, which were honestly just weird...They had tortilla chips baked into the quesadillas, so had this weird soggy corn flavour, and were served with a sweet bbq sauce rather than salsa and sour cream.  My brother had ordered the mushroom pizza which was also underwhelming. Super doughy, not very crispy.  And mom had the fish and chips were actually really good.

Atmosphere wise? London pub meets flowery garden print booths...It was a bit bizarre, but it works for them I guess. 

Anyway, not the best food, not the best service, but good for a drink or two!"}
{"text":"Went there with collegues for a business lunch and it was a great choice. While the hostess was attentive she also knew when to leave us along to carry on with ourr discussions. The food was good with a nice variety of options and everyone enjoyed their meal. I would definitely return. Great variety for their side items too.

Loved how large and opent he restaurant is and it would be great with a bigger group of people.

Only complaint was that 2 of us ordered the panini special and we were not told that it was out but were just brought the panini that was on the menu - still good but woul dhvae like to be told."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Ahi tuna tacos were good but too much green not enough fish ratio. Couldn't taste the lobster in the burger. Service was good. Restaurant is quite nice."}
{"text":"We tried one more time, hoping that the quality of the food would improve... yeah, no."}
{"text":"The prices seem a little high but I've always had good meals there. No complaints about the service. On my most recent visit wine was on special. I asked our waitress for a recommendation on the white and she hit the mark. Fabulous moscato was perfect for a patio lunch. Speaking of which great patio as well. Like that it is slightly covered."}
{"text":"This review is simply for the patio! It is comfortable nicely appointed with a great street view in a modern neighborhood. Enjoy a decent selection of wines or cocktails in the late day west facing sun."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. The food was decent. Another review described the Park as an upscale Applebee's and I think that is spot on. Atmosphere is nice enough, it's pretty open and during the day quite bright. Service was a bit slow today despite the only being maybe 8 tables being served and several servers to go around. It wasn't unreasonable though. Would definitely go again given the chance."}
{"text":"I went there the other night and ordered steak.  It was on the rare side, green beans were hard and potatoes were greesy.  I feel it   Is way over priced for the quality of food.  Service was good, but for the price....should have went to the keg."}
{"text":"I wasn't wowed by these guys to be honest. The staff and atmosphere are great, but they seem like they're still figuring out how to run a restaurant. 

The bar has a few great local beers on tap. The ones I had were very fresh and delicious so nothing negative there. Tried an old fashioned and was quite disappointed. While not as terrible as the keg, they certainly aren't going to be my first choice for a cocktail.

Main meals were interesting. The girlfriend got the pulled pork with mac and cheese. It came out pretty good to be fair. I can't say there is much I would change.

I got the pene and it was terrible. Very soupy and had broken bones in it. They decided to use shredded chicken instead of grilling it, a mistake in my books.

I'd like to note that the person previously that said their dishes are bland want too far off base. It seems as through they're trying to let the ingredients shine through and not quite nailing it.

Ill give them another shot in a few months when they've had a chance to get into the swing of things. Not a place that I would frequent without significant improvement."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my co-workers and it'll probably be the last time unless my meal is paid for. The flavor of the food is just too bland.

I ordered the Free Range Chicken Wrap with excitement when I read 'pulled chicken' on the menu. Unfortunately, the excitement ended when I took my first bite. The chicken didn't seem to have any seasoning, nor was it marinated. I felt that the meat was dry and not tender. Maybe the moisture of the meat made its way to the bottom of the wrap because it was soaked by the time I finished the first half of the wrap. Either that or the vegetables were too wet when the wrap was assembled. Fries were pretty generic.

I would've given 2 stars but for $14, I was expecting a lot more. Looking at the menu and with lots of items above $15, it's definitely not a place I'd come back to given my first experience. Very nice interior and good service though. Just needs better food."}
{"text":"If you like to chew on styrofoam shipping peanuts, then order the lobster.
The burger and soup were passable.  The server was great, though."}
{"text":"Service was really good. They serve my favorite beer Wild Rose velvet fog. Food was ok - we had a chicken taco and a pulled pork one (the special) as well as the calamari. The chicken was not great - was very stringy and chewy, difficult to eat. Pulled park was good, as was the calamari. 
Nice atmosphere - great Windows all around. However, this is kinda pointless because they want you to close the blinds when the sun is shining. That's what happened to us and, frankly, it was annoying and really affected our enjoyment. That's what drew us to go there - being able to see daylight. Anyway, quite honestly, not sure we'd go back."}
{"text":"Went there for a girls night. We were seated in a semi private room which was amazing.
The service was fantastic and the drinks were amazing. Although the Caesar was a little underdressed in terms of garnishings! 
Food was awful, everyone at our table noted the food was too salty. 
They do cater well for gluten free but need to seriously reduce salt quantities. 
The desserts were pretty good, but they were completely overdone with whipped cream.


I don't understand the comment from Jason at the park. I think you have me confused with another party. My friend - also Sara, did accept the gift certificate and informed me that you called her and thanked her for the comments and apologized for the salty food.

This was meant as constructive criticism for you guys to improve upon with an intention of returning as I enjoyed the experience just not the good. This was not an invitation for a passive aggressive social media feud - even more disappointed in you guys now. 

Hence the demotion to 1 star and most definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"My team came here for Christmas lunch and it was fairly busy on a Thursday. The pricing seemed pretty standard and on par with Milestones or Joey's. Atmosphere was similar as well. 

I ordered the Fresno burger which came with goats cheese, balsamic cream, tzatziki, bruschetta and greens, and I added sauteed mushrooms. The patty was homemade but to be honest, I found it a bit tough. I'm typically one who prefers a higher meat to bread ratio, but this was possibly too much meat for me. Overall the burger was pretty heavy and rich, despite the freshness of the bruschetta. I would suggest a little less goats cheese and a less tough and slightly thinner patty. I loved the brioche bun!

I had this with a French onion soup coz apparently I just can't say no to them! It was a heavier French onion with lots of bread and cheese and less broth, but it was tasty. I do prefer a lighter broth and more of it, personally. As always though, this soup is the bestower of bad breath so beware!

Service was very good. I would give the food a 3.5/5  and service was a 4.5/5"}
{"text":"It was pretty decent and best of all, kids eat free on Tuesdays!! To our biggest surprise, the chicken fingers on the kids menu were really good, especially when they were free (usually you expect to see Dino nuggets). It's nice to find these types of places that have good food and the free kids special, makes going out much easier!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food, never disappointed! Really close to home and convenient to get to. Lots of different food and drinks to choose from for whatever mood I'm in!"}
