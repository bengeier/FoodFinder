{"text":"There are other Colombian places in the Cleveland area, but I feel this one tops them all. We bought a tray of their empanadas, and out of all the from different Latin countries for the party we attended, the empanadas were the best. This place will give you a discount when you are ordering large quantities, where it is a hassle to do so at other Colombian Lakewood places. I've had their Cuban Sandwhich is delicious. The place is really nice inside and the staff is attentive to ones needs."}
{"text":"Really awesome food. We went on a Saturday at dinner time and it was pretty dead.. maybe more of a night spot? Anyway, service was good. Drinks weren't great but not bad. But the food was some of the best I've had in a while. Fresh ingredients, perfect amount of spice, and a lot of it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem! Everything we have tried here is delicious and very reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Food and service was great!  Try the tostada sliders!  Nice location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The authentic Colombian food was amazing! I ordered the grilled Red Snapper was very tasty. It came with coconut rice and a wonderful salad. The food was very tasty, just as I remember it from my time in Colombia."}
{"text":"Moncho's was a pleasant surprise and worthwhile visit. This was the third restaurant visited, in Cuyahoga County, offering Colombian fare. While the menu was not limited to Colombian offerings, it was what I was there for.  The Bandeja Paisa was the item I sought upon arrival. Known as the farmer's meal, it's is a Colombian staple.  I first enjoyed the meal while vacationing in Bogota and Cartagena, Colombia in 2015.  I longed for an experience that brought me back to that fantastic trip. Moncho's version was excellent. It was a huge portion that was well cooked and full of flavor.  I only wished the bar selection included Aguila and micheladas! Aguila was my go to beer in Cartagena. No problem though. I enjoyed the huge margaritas instead. And we started off with a fantastic appetizer. The fireball chorizo was insanely delicious.  Wish I had some now.  The prices were fare and worthy of the portions. I have been to other restaurants where you got nowhere near the quality and portions that Moncho's provided. Service was prompt and our server was friendly. She was attentive and also tended bar. The place was clean and well maintained. Don't let the neighborhood fool or deter you.    The decor was a little strange but not a big deal. Some artwork from Fernando Botero would be a cool addition! I'm not particularly an art expert, anymore than I am with food, but that guy has a crazy, unique style seen all over Colombia.  I definitely will be back and can honestly say Moncho's Bandeja Paisa was every bit as good as the meal I had in Colombia."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! A true hidden gem. The food is authentic Colombian. Everything on the menu is delicious. Had a Mojito and tostada sliders with guacamole mmmmm. On Saturdays they have salsa dancing with a DJ."}
{"text":"Whoa! My new fabulous neighborhood spot! Colombian home made specialities all made from scratch, it's way more than a bar although they have a huge selection of beers from around the world. It's also a classy restaurant with a fireplace owned by a family who turned this former sleazy bar into a trip south of the border. If you ask they will make a special dish just for you. And there's plenty of free parking. Skip the Tremont crowds and overpriced food. Stop by Moncho's instead. You'll be back"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place out, because of all the good reviews, but I just received an email from Groupon (I bought a Groupon for here) that it is now closed."}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich was the best I've had outside of Miami, and the owner/workers we super nice. If the food wasn't enough it's also a great place to watch a Cavs game as there are ample TVs."}
{"text":"Hortencia, manager/owner, is great ! Everything is fresh and authentic.  Portions are large . One of the few places that also offer Colombian options also."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! Have not had one thing I didn't like! Service is always outstanding as are the Margaritas! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Are all these reviews written by Moncho staff?? This place was NOT Columbian food...but that's not even the point. The microwave must have been broken that day or the chef just didn't feel like serving human worthy food. Things came out frozen or tasting like cat food. My cat wouldn't even eat the rat meat served here. We all felt sick after leaving. Granted server was super nice but we went here for food but what we got was garbage. If anyone thinks the food here is good god help you..."}
{"text":"The service was great, the atmosphere was interesting and the some of the food was excellent and other dishes were under par. The restaurant is very nice on the inside especially for the neighborhood it is in.  I came here with a few friends on a Friday night around 8pm and the bar had a lot of people seated at it and only one other table was filled. Our waiter was wonderful and two of my friends speak fluent Spanish so they were able to strike up conversations with our waiter which I think he very much enjoyed. Around 9pm or so they started playing music at a loud enough level that we had to raise our voices to speak to one another. They also had dance party lights which I thought was very strange since they still had tables and it was only 9pm?   The food was hit or miss. I wouldn't necessarily call this place just Colombian- it also has mexican items on the menu. The chips that are served when you are seated were disappointing because they tasted like the oil they were made in. The margarita machine was down when we were there which is always a bummer. The Bandeja paisa was by far the best dish ordered at our table. It was filling and just really good! The mofongo was also on point. I liked the shrimp one the best. I ordered a steak dish and found the steak to be over cooked which made it tough to eat. Overall this place is hit or miss."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Always a pleasure to stop by, watch some great soccer games and eat delicious food.   I love people who work there and the atmosphere there. If you are a soccer fan, definitely go there when Colombia National Team plays. Believe me, you would love it!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and the food was excellent. Generous portions and great quality. I will be back in the area for the next 7 weeks and I will definitely be ordering from these guys again."}
{"text":"My lady friend and I decided late to go out and catch some dinner. After hearing about Monchos on one of my other social media groups, I thought we should give them a try. What a great notion! At 9:00 on a Friday night we were seated right away and the place began to get busier. We ordered the Monchos Platter as an appetizer. I highly recomend sharing this huge delicious treat of beef, pork, chicken, and cheese nachos. After reading reviews, we decided to try the cubano, which was authentic as promised. The toasted bread really helped make the sandwich. I highly recomend this little gem. We plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"I've been in search of really good Columbian food in the Cleveland area, since returning from Florida a few weeks ago.  Moncho's was pretty good!  I ventured here on a Thursday evening, after work.  I entered and was immediately greeted and seated.  I was served warm tortilla chips and salsa.  I ordered a Mojito, chicharrones and grilled Al Pastor taco.   The mojito was just perfect, slightly sweet, fresh mint, just like I like it.  The chicharrones was just ok, served with a side of guacamole.  The portion was small for $6, and I would have preferred if they had been fried just a bit longer.  The guacamole was fresh, but had started to turn brown.  The star of the meal was the taco.  Generous portion of perfectly marinated pork, mixed with pineapple, onions, cilantro and cheese, placed in a flour tortilla and grilled perfectly.  This was a really good meal.  I am anxious to return and try some of the other offerings, such as the empanadas and bandeja paisa meal."}
{"text":"Good home cooked Colombian and other L.A. staples in the middle of Latin-starved Cleveland. Skip the American fare and go straight for the traditional: Arepas, Churrasco, Chorizo, Arroz de coco, maduros. The people are nice and the service excellent. Go here for the flavor and the atmosphere. You won't find any white table cloths or stuffy servers for miles around."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Owner and staff were very friendly. Can't wait to go back for a Colombian soccer game this Wednesday. I heard the atmosphere is electric during the game."}
{"text":"Have they changed management? I've ordered carry out from here twice recently and I've been very disappointed. First time I didn't get the sandwich I ordered and whatever I got was pretty much unedible. This last time I actually got the Cuban but there was the smallest amount of meat on the sandwich and a few scraps of lettuce, the bread was chewy and it was not at all similar to what I used to get. They got rid of the sweet potato fries and yummy cinnamon sauce that my friends and I loved. So disappointing. The old cuban was amazing! Literally would crave it. I'm not sure what is going on but it's not the same and I don't know that I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who is a friend of one of the family members that own this place. Dinner was delicious, I ordered the chicken dinner which was perfectly seasoned and a large enough portion that I had some to put on top of a salad for lunch the next day. Moncho's is a cozy, neighborhood spot with a small, affordable menu of classic Colombian cuisine - check it out if you're in the mood for something like that."}
{"text":"Pulling up, I thought this place was a little sketch. And I was right, it is. But I can't think of any great Mexican food that I've had from a restaurant that wasn't a little suspect.  The bar is kind of a dumpy, no-frills hall. The bartender was super friendly, though, and put us at ease. After a little deliberation and some recommendations, we ordered an app and a couple entrees and I had a nice cold Pacifico - with lime, of course.  The food came out quick - piping hot, very fresh, and incredibly flavorful. I was really blown away by how good the food was. We even took leftovers, which is something we NEVER do while we're traveling.  Excellent food, very reasonably priced, and excellent service."}
{"text":"I was excited to find a well-rated place with a Groupon for my weekend in Cleveland.   Moncho's has a pretty different vibe from most restaurants. It's mostly a bar that has great food. The space is incredibly open (no booths, separation, etc) and at the end of the night on weekends, they clear out the tables to make way for a dance floor. Club Moncho's, yea!  Since we had a Groupon, we decided to go all out and order a sampler appetizer and two entrees.   The bartender was super-friendly. She was quick to offer suggestions on drinks and food and was very efficient in taking care of us and everyone else sitting at the bar.  The appetizer came out quickly and was DELICIOUS. We loved everything on the huge platter. It was immediately apparent we ordered way too much food. But you know, we had to keep eating. For science. Or something.  The entrees were up not too long after. Everything we tried was just excellent. Rich sauces, flavorful meats, savory beans... I'm getting hungry thinking about it.   So, the atmosphere is definitely not what I had in mind when I bought the Groupon, but our food was GREAT and I wouldn't hesitate visiting again and paying full price."}
{"text":"It seemed like a pretty high end place and I think the neighborhood warrants a more casual spot.  I thought it was a little pricey for the portions and quality they served.  I also thought the guacamole was bland.  I had the red snapper and would not order it again. A friend had the cuban sandwich and that was really good.  The owner was outside and very friendly, however, the service inside was slow.  Really wanted to support this local business and I hope they work out any kinks."}
{"text":"OMFDOUBLEFINGOD. This place is fucking fantastic. This is what the dining experience is all about. Mom and pop place where English is the second language, and I would not have in any other way.  Amazing holy fucking guacamole. Simple and perfect, right amount of lime, cilantro, salt. Simple but fantastic  Less is more people.  Chicharrones, the new trend, i have been eating this porky delight since a junior in college,. My first experience with this food group was with the Villamil family in Mexico in my study abroad life altering experience.  These pork skins with a fine layer of meat do not let you down.  Served with a pica de gallo, source cream and a dollop of guacamole. Throw this shit down mis cabrónes.  Ok now to the meat. Get the Columbian meaty meat platter. Chorizo, from the meat gods themselves, more Chicharrones, avocado, beef stew, tostones,cilantro rice, and charro beans. If you do not order this you are muy tonto.   My date had the shrimp Diablo. A shit ton of  shrimp in a smack tu madre charred mexican Hot sauce. Really good as well.  This place rocks out with their clocks out.  Totally Escobar."}
{"text":"There's not a ton of options in Cleveland when it comes to Colombian food. This one is pretty OK in my book. The service is great. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food was also delivered pretty promptly. The decor leaves something to be desired as it is very bar meets bodega.  Now for the food...it was fine. Nothing of note. I ordered a pork chop dish and my friend ordered a salad. We both concluded these were things we could have made at home and questioned what was Colombian about either.  So, if you're looking for good Colombian food, I'd go to Barroco. The service won't be better (bc their service is really not all that great) but their food will be better for sure."}
{"text":"Great authentic Latin cuisine. So far I've had the enchiladas (best I've ever had) and the steak fajitas (with more meat than I could shake a stick at.) Cozy and convenient location with a friendly and dedicated staff. Locally owned and operated too which us always a plus to support local business owners. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. A must try. Ordered Chicken Chipotle the flavor was amazing. Large portions for a great price. You must check it out."}
{"text":"Not the best location, but the food, service & prices....wellll worth it!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"States a delivery fee and a minimum for the delivery but I called, and they don't deliver. The man on the phone was rude and not easy to understand"}
{"text":"Service was great by Mandy, and the food was to die for fresh and authentic. I had the steak taco trio huge plate and outstanding, we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Nice compact menu! Food and drinks delightful! Don't know what to order?!?! Ask! Recommendations suited to your taste! You gotta try it but come from 176 Denison is currently closed going east."}
{"text":"Ok, let's just state right off the bat that I AM COMING BACK HERE!! Delicious. Loved it.   Ordered paella and carne asada arepita. Neither were what I expected, but both were fabulous. The paella was salty but combined with the rice it was great. The arepa was thin, I expected something thicker. Both were finished regardless!!  The food was really five stars, but I only gave four because of the service and opening hours confusion. Service is nonexistent, had to ask for everything and it was hard to flag them down because they would never look at you. Their opening hours are very confusing, the week prior we went at opening time and they were not open. No sign saying why, just opening hours saying they SHOULD be open. Ok... week later we called to make sure they were open before coming in. What's happening, when exactly are you open Moncho?!"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty but small portions for the price in my opinion. The drinks were expensive, if they had a happy hour no one told us or applied it to our bill. BUT all of that wouldn't get a 1 star rating from me, what makes this a 1 star is my discovery that someone added a tip to my bill (i had tipped in cash but paid the bill with my card and drew a line through the tip portion). I contacted the manager and he refunded me the tip but that only corrected the wrong it didn't make it right. We will never return and I caution everyone who does go here."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp and was excited about It. So I shared it with my sister who decided we'll go. We get dressed yesterday and decide to take the drive across town in the blizzard. Just to get there and their closed. Not closed because of the weather closed. But phone disconnected out of business closed. Imagine our disappointment to see this. Hopefully these closed businesses will start deleting their profiles on yelp!"}
{"text":"If you want genuine Colombian food you will absolutely love it. The food is always great and everyone is very nice! The Sunday specials are great with amazing flavor!   Make sure you always ask them \"what's the special of the day\" you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had great food (tacos with al pastor, shrimp in plantain \"cups,\" and grilled tilapia.   The service was warm.  The star of the show was the charro beans, probably the best in the world. Loved their salsa.  I believe it IS new owners, though they've kept some of the former Columbian recipes. We were so glad we came and will be back."}
{"text":"We were at Steelyard Commons and were looking for a non-fast food place to eat. Moncho's popped up on Yelp & I'm glad it did.   The restaurant is super cute inside and out, don't let the location turn you off! (They're also opening a location in Lakewood). 4 stars because the prices were a little bit more than I was expecting but I suppose other factors (quality of food and ambiance) warrant it.   Ordered: guava smoothie, guacamole w/ tostones, churrasco con pollo, and bandeja paisa.   EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. I normally don't care for chicken breast but the churrasco pollo was perfect grilled and the chimichurri on it was fresh and tasty. Also the guac was the best I've ever had anywhere. Plantains came with both entrees and they were delicious. Rice & beans delicious came with the bandeja paisa and the beans were super flavorful. Guava smoothie was perfect. Wanted to get flan but they were out.   SERVICE WAS SUPER FRIENDLY :)   Will definitely go back to try the cocktails and more food and flan!"}
{"text":"I had never tried Colombian food before, so I wasn't sure what to order.  (My palate is as American as it gets.)  The staff was very helpful, and I decided on the Churrasco de Pollo.  It was savory and delicious, the side of plantains added a mildly sweet twist, as well.  I will certainly eat there again.  The food is prepared while you wait, so it's best to call in your order."}
{"text":"The food was so absolutely delicious. I got the paella and It was so perfectly made. I also snacked on my sisters entrée which was very yummy as well. I really like the family feel and the service was very good. It seems as though this location closed? If it is reopening I would like to know because I wanted to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Happened upon this place in the search to try something different.  What a pleasure!  Authentic Hispanic atmosphere.  Very welcoming and very friendly.  We sat at the bar.  The owner greeted and chatted with us for while, made some suggestions of what we should try, taught us some Spanish phrases.  Fellow guests were equally as friendly.  The food was wonderful.  Very fresh, great flavors.  We've been back a few times and everything we've tried has been great.  Will definitely go back."}
