{"text":"We took the family here for my father-in-law's birthday.  It was a good thing we made reservations as there were many people waiting outside when we arrived.  We waited about 10 minutes to get seated.   The manager apologized and said the earlier tables were taking a bit longer than expected.  The waitress came quickly, took our drink orders and brought them quickly.  She was personable, suggested the clam chowder and halibut when asked for suggestions.  The clam chowder was excellent.  Dinners came quickly.  The food was hot, fish fresh, and vegetables cooked just right.  We were all very pleased with the evening     And are looking forward to our next trip back.  The only negative thing I have to say is that it was a little loud and sometimes hard to hear.  But all in all it was a very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a review but I just thought I'd warn everyone about this place. We made a reservation at 5 because we had to be somewhere at 7. We ordered our food and it took an hour to get it. It was on a Sunday and wasn't very busy at all. Out of all 4 of us only one person said their food was ok. I got the shrimp and scallop scampi and it had no flavor. I was very disappointed. The grossest part of all was when my husband bit into a piece of his fried fish, there was a big piece of something black and foul smelling in it. So disgusting!! No body could figure out what it was. It stunk up the whole booth. It made me sick to my stomach that I couldn't finish my bland, tasteless entr√©e. We brought it to the servers attention and he did absolutely nothing about it. He just took the plate away and later when we asked if they were able to figure out what it was he just said, \"No\". Bad food and bad customer service. I will never go again."}
{"text":"Nothing special for the prices. It's ok but for 33$ I would except a good steak.... Um nope. My 8 yr old cooks a better steak. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"WE went in to try it again.  We had been there previously about a year ago and the fish was tough!  So we thought we'd try again.  This time we stood at teh hostess stand for 10 minutes with wait staff walking by with NO eye contact.  We left after 10 minutes.  No one ever made eye contact or spoke to us.  Horrible experience and I wonder how the heck they stay in business.  Must be the snowbirds!"}
{"text":"All these bad reviews boggle my mind. All I can say is, haters to the left.  I love this place. I've been with it every time it moved or changed location. My most recent trip, I decided to go for broke and had the salmon meal. DE-LI-CIOUS. It was capital-T tender and the taste was phenomenal. I was in Salmon Heaven! My mother had halibut and my father had fish and chips. Paired with warm bread, the meal was perfect, filling, and not too deep in my wallet. Absolutely perfect. I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Nothing impressive. Just because we came in with a kid, they put us in the back corner. The waiting staff is never around and the entire crowd here is 55+ at 2pm on a Saturday. 2 lobster tails were $46 so I'm not afraid to pay for good seafood.... This however was not it. They were rock lobster that was chewy and burnt, portions were small . They are an independent (great to keep money local) and I despise corporate food chains but they need to change their game and ditch the tired setup."}
{"text":"This place was great the last two times I visited. Yesterday... not so great. The waiter was fast, but grumpy (until it was time to present the check).   The chowder entree was bland. It was served in a bowl that had overflowed.  I ordered the halibut fish and chips. The fish was cooked to perfection, but one of the pieces contained a half-inch bone. The handful of chips tossed onto the plate were overcooked and had the appearance of being scooped from the bottom of the fryer. My wife also wasn't thrilled with her chicken parm.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best seafood  that we have tried in the Mesa area.  We have tried almost all of the seafood items on their menu and everything has been top notch.  Fish done just right, lobster succulent and tasty, oysters on half shell really fresh(sometimes larger than other times), seafood salad delightful and the clam chowder is to die for.  Salads are not real exciting but fresh and crisp. We have also purchased items from their fish counter ( a little pricy, perhaps but flown in FRESH) and it has always been very good.  This is the only place I will buy red snapper as it does not age or freeze well. Can not imagine the negative comments I've read."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here to give it a try. I ordered the haddock fish and chips, he ordered battered clams, we both ordered clam chowder. The chowder (at six bucks a bowl) was really good, and a nice portion. The batered clams were ... well, some of them had no clams in them, dry, and not very tasty. The fish and chips? Well the chips were just french frys, and not all that good. The Fish was really good (haddock) however it was two average to small pieces and the cost was 12 dollars. I will go back for the chowder, or if I am really hankering for good battered fish... otherwise no."}
{"text":"Mediocre to the fullest. Wine is overpriced for the small pour given. Bartender had no knowledge of wine list. I had the clams casino which had a great flavor but I've never had them be so small with stuffing. Also presentation was lacking with lil baby clams floating on a big plate with wilted lettuce covering most of the pla. For dinner I had an alfredo seafood dish. Alfredo had a good flavor and seafood was good, but sauce with thin, possibly old. I sat at the bar by myself and even the bartender was never around. Pretty depressing place to have dinner. The bartender was nice enough but literally did nothing but input my order and hand me a bill with an autograt on it... for one person? Insulting. I would have tipped 20% because it's habit but after that I left the autograt of 18% and gave up on this place. Dingy, dirty, not fun, and food is meh. Won't be back. You're not the only seafood in the desert. (Ahem High Tide, Angry Crab, Kona, Blue Wasabi)"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the bad reviews. We had great service and the food was way better than Red Lobster. We will be back."}
{"text":"We moved to AZ a few years ago and don't know many seafood restaurants here yet. We prefer to support local instead of chains when when they are worth it. So we tried SMR.  The guy who waited on us was very nice. He was likely the owner. Seemed to be able to tell us all about the dishes they served and how everything comes in fresh. I could tell he had a direct interest in the restaurant.  The restaurant wasn't high end, but we weren't looking for high end so we didn't mind. It looked a bit dated, but some classic long-established restaurants can get by with that. I had a Scallop & Shrimp scampi dish and my wife had fish, and our son ordered the lobster (first time he's tried lobster).  My shrimp/scallop scampi was pretty good but the serving was pretty small. A small dish with maybe 4 shrimp and a few scallops drown in butter sauce. The shrimp and scallops seemed fresh so that's a plus. Other than that, the potatoes were just basic boiled red potatoes cut in half with no seasoning and a small bit of rice pilaf. Again tasted okay, but not enough to satisfy.  My son didn't care for his lobster all that much. I tried a bite and it seemed a bit rubbery but I only got to sample one of the last bites. My son also ordered the Ceviche and it was pretty good. He liked it. My wife wasn't over impressed with her fish (nor her boiled potatoes). Maybe if we're in the area, we'll try the place again. We didn't hate it, but didn't love it. I was just hoping it would be good enough to make us forget about chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. I went with my mom and Gma and I had to send my dish back because it was coated in flour, which I forgot to tell them I have Celiac Disease. They gladly took it back and brought me a fresh dish. Our server Ben was very courteous. I would definitely suggest this restaurant/market to anyone."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with my colleagues. A LOT of shrimps in the shrimp avocado salad. Totally worth the money. Lunch special is only $7.99!! Staffs are friendly. Food was served fast. Defiantly will go back again!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, put Red Lobster out of your head, and head here!  This place is phenomenal in all their seafood selections.  My husband and I chose to bring his parents here tonight, they are from PA, frequent Rehobeth Beach, DE, and they raved how some of what they ate parelled what they get \"at the shore\"!    For aps, my husband had the clams casino, my father-in-law had the wings, I had the ceviche, all excellent!  For dinner mother-in-law had the fish n' chips, father-in-law and husband had the harvest platter, I had the enchiladas with crab...amazing!  My MIL wanted the fish tacos, but she chose last minute the fish n' chips, and she loved it.  The boys loved the platter, although the crab cakes were less than desireable, and my enchiladas were the best seafood enchiladas I've ever had.  I have compared them to Maria Maria's crab enchilada suizas, these stand out beyond them.    This place is like a sleeping secret, and I wanted to share this place should not be overlooked.  Its in the far southwest corner at Dana Park, is hidden, and is worthy of your seafood cravings!    No more Red Lobster, people, give this place a go, and it is all sorts of family good, big tables, excellent food, good drinks.  Give to the locals, not to the chains.  They also have seafood for purchase, and its fresh as AZ can get it, and the prices are good.  I love the Salt Cellar, but they have since raised their rates through the roof, we looked for less pricey, and they serve up just as amazing food.  Its quaint as well, reminding you that you are in a local seafood joint, and takes you as if you were just off the beach, whether west coast or east coast.  We have the east coasters to prove it!"}
{"text":"I have to say this rating is based on the quality and consistency of the food and service at the Seafood Market and Restaurant. My wife and I have been going to this restaurant for a long time; we followed them to the different locations in Mesa. We have never been disappointed with the food or the service. A few months ago, my wife had oral surgery and we ordered one of their salads to go, the owner, personally prepared a fine chopped salad for my wife. Their chowder is really good, if I have a big bowl, it is almost a full delicious meal. Their Southwest Salmon is my favorite. Their prices are reasonable and once more they really know how to prepare fish.  Julio G."}
{"text":"Can you review THE WORST?! Unbelievable! There were about 15 of us chicks in for a little happy hour fun and we were treated horribly from the get-go. From the rude attitude of requesting additional seating to accommodate our group,  from 2 not 1 server, to physically moving our own tableware & waters to the eventual tables, it was a debacle! Way too many options to ever be treated in this manner again! Honestly?! Then.... Our individual checks arrive with a 30% gratuity added?! PUHLEESE! While the food was mediocre to good the entire \"happy\" hour experience was almost anything but....except we are a class act group who managed to enjoy one another in spite of this abominable treatment! What a shame when several of our group are regular customers and appreciate having seafood in the desert."}
{"text":"3 stars only because the price was right for what we got. Unfortunately, what we got was mediocre. The tartar sauce was more like mayonnaise. My crab cakes were limp and unexciting. The steamed vegetables were flavorless and soaking wet. The clam strips were alright, fried right and not greasy. The pasta salad was too heavy on the mayo. As another reviewer put it, cafeteria quality. I have actually eaten better seafood at Red Lobster (I only go to RL because the mom-in-law likes it!). Would not return, ever. I'd rather pay an extra $5 a plate and get something memorable and good."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and tried to give it a chance one last time. The clam chowder should have been called potato soup. There were clams in the soup, but there wasn't any clam flavor. The bread, in my opinion, was a sliced sub roll toasted. My seafood plate, the orange roughy, was tasty. He had the halibut and it was just broiled and uninteresting.  Even the cheesecake was tasteless. This will be the last time we give this restaurant a chance. We had very slow service initially, but then it got better and the server was courteous."}
{"text":"Eat here twice. Ordered the pollock fish fry and the other time the walleye.  Fish was excellent. Service is very good.  Best fish I have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are awesome! Lots of food for the price. Had fish and scallops plate and it was delicious. Clam chowder is fantastic! Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"Website says they close at 10:00 pm. Called at 9:30 and asked if I could place a to go order. Guy who answered was so freaking RUDE. \"Kitchen is CLOSED!\" I said it's 9:30. Your website says you close at 10:00. Hangs up on me. Regardless if the kitchen is closed he didn't need to be rude. Highly doubt kitchen was closed 3 minutes prior to the place closing. Need to learn so customer service skills. Jerk. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for our anniversary, hoping for a great seafood dinner. We left incredibly disappointed overall. We were seated right away but it took nearly 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink order, two iced teas. It then took about 10 minutes just to bring us our drinks, despite it not being terribly busy. Our server then left and took 10 more minutes before coming back to take our order and was not very friendly, looking like this was the last place she wanted to be.   We ordered stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer, and placed our entree orders, in fear we would have to wait forever. I ordered the halibut and my wife ordered a shrimp and scallop scampi. Our appetizer was decent, not great. We opted for soup, clam chowder, for our entree side which was actually pretty good.   Our dinners then came and things went downhill quickly. My plate included halibut, seafood pasta, and vegetables. The vegetables were clearly frozen and out of a bag. Very disappointing already. The seafood pasta was crab (possibly krab) mixed with rotini noodles. It was OK at best. The halibut was a nice sized portion but did not taste good at all. It tasted old if that even makes sense. My wife's dish was better than mine, but very salty. The scallops were rubbery and not cooked well.  All of this cost us $60 without tip or any drinks from the bar. If the food were delicious I'd be fine with this, but sadly you can get a better meal at red lobster *cringes* or if you were to cook at home. The service was poor which did not help any. For comparison, I went to Four Peaks Brewing today, ordered a stuffed rainbow trout entree for $16 (half what I paid at Seafood Market) and it was leaps and bounds better...from a brew pub! That should be embarrassing to Seafood Market. I definitely would not return here."}
{"text":"Took family there for a late Mothers Day Dinner for mom and Aunt as well as a Birthday the Uncle... Everyone loved their meals, the place was not busy at all for a Friday night but we did not get there until 8PM so the service was really amazing.  The lobster was very tender and tasty which is what mom and I had.  As other reviewers mentioned, the veggies were a little watery, but not overcooked and certainly still enjoyable.  A better veggie choice or just crisper freshly made veggies and I would have given it 5 stars for a Seafood restaurant in the desert.  I also hate chains so this was a good find for us."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on my birthday.    We ordered calamari, oysters rockafeller, mussels and clams casino for appetizers.   Superb! Loved that the calamari was lightly breaded.  The clams casino were a different take on clams.  I ordered Clam Chowder with my meal, which was ample with clams and potatoes.  It was almost as good as the chowder as I had in Plymouth, MA just a month earlier. I've read some of the reviews below about the chowder, and there may be inconsistencies.  But I'm glad I got a good batch.  For dinner, I ordered the Pasta Primavera, which had a lot of clams, mussels, shrimp and fish, but also was overwhelming with vegetables that were undercooked.  But it was a big plate of food.  Others at the table ordered the Harvest Platter (which was eaten in full) and 2 orderrs of the Linguini with Baby Clams.    Nobody sent back their food, and our server was very attentive and fulfilled all of our needs.  He frequently stopped by the table to ask if we needed anything.   Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. I ate there tonight and was not impressed. Mostly locals with their hoochie mammas getting ready to go out on a Friday night. Not sure if it is even worth a second try..."}
{"text":"What to say about this place one positive thing is they have a seafood counter which I guess you can buy fresh fish to take home which is kind of cool the silver we had she was fast helpful on top of things and pretty good of suggestion things on the menu and that's an offer questions since it was the first time there I started off with the side salad which is clearly out of the bag Little Brown which is not good order the halibut very very dry way overcooked the steam vegetables for probably Frozen have a bag to overall the seafood wasn't very good was on the cheap side though for seafood I would find a better place around Mesa on this Valley but if you want Seafood on a budget I would suggest going here it could have just been off night since it was our first time there"}
{"text":"Food, service and lighting are reminiscent of Denny's on a bad night. The wine glass was so small it was distracting. Too bad, so little competition in the area."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Everything was dry and processed and tasted frozen at best. Even the fish and chips was gross! Fish stick quality filets...yuck! This place made red lobster seem five star!"}
{"text":"So far this place looks and feels depressing! It's a place you'd go if you just finalized your divorce and just signed your kids away to your bitch of a wife. . . On a plus side, the food is decent. Enjoy the salmon as you forgot about your problems for a while. . . The clam chowder is wonderful. Reminds me of that time in New England when my ex and I first met. . . Still tho...the ambience on a Thursday night is super depressing AF. . . Also this is white people seafood. No fish heads here nor deep fried whole fish."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a whim.  Hungry after a long day and seafood sounded good.  Parking lot was full so thought it must be a good place. Restaurant was very busy but we were seated immediately.  My husband ordered the scallops and I ordered the scallop and shrimp scampi.  I grew up in Massachusetts and know good seafood so I thought it was a bit strange when the waitress asked me if I wanted my scampi over pasta.  Huh??  No thanks.  That should have been a red flag because when my scampi arrived it was in a bowl full of liquid and looked like soup.  Didnt have much butter or wine flavor as described but what was most dissapointing was that for $17 bucks it contained ONE large sea scallop sliced horizontally into 3 pieces and 2 good sized shrimp.  For $17 bucks!!  My husbands scallop dish, for about the same price had a total of 4 large scallops horizontally sliced into 12 pieces which seemed like a good value compared to the scampi.  The side dishes at this place are a total throw-away...it just seems like they are there to fill the plate so you dont realize how little seafood you are actually getting.  Bland, seasonless veggies...baked potatoes that were obviously cooked ahead of time and reheated...tasteless pilaf...and none of the other sides on other diners plates looked appealing either.  The clam chowder was decent...not really that good, but decent...I would say it is the best tasting thing we ate that nite.  Food presentation and ambiance could really use a boost in this place too.  I really wanted to like this place because good seafood is pretty hard to find in the desert but I guess we will just have to keep looking.  Definetly was NOT worth the almost $50 tab for two people. Oh, and on a final note, one should not have to ask for lemon wedges in a seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"This was an okay restaurant , didn't seem too bad until the waiter came by very fast pace and didn't stay very long ."}
{"text":"Waitress was very knowledgeable about flavors of fish which is great for fish newbies like me."}
{"text":"This place was good! Enjoyed our food to the fullest. We had crab cakes & the Tacos de Camarone delicious"}
{"text":"Arrived at 8:10pm when they close at 9, we stood and waited for someone to seat us in the near empty restaurant.  The same experience waiting to order ensued.  Ordered the salmon and the roughy...both were good.  Still, our feeling was this was fairly commercial seafood fare...nothing outstanding, but good.  I mentioned the Time Mag cover story about wild vs. farmed.  The waitress knew nothing, and asked the boss what was wild and what was farmed.  Shouldn't someone in that position know?  The boss rattled off 3 or 4 farmed fish, adding that the rest were all wild.  He couldn't have cared less to have a conversation about it.    http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html"}
{"text":"Called in to ask if they have \"sashimi-grade salmon\" and was informed it was $16/lb.  Upon walking in, told the guy I called in asking for salmon sashimi and was informed that he \"[doesn't] know what that is\" and that he has \"whatever's in the case - it's all fresh.\"  Waste of my time and money to visit a restaurant with a \"market\" the size of my dishwasher. If you're going to call yourself a market, get enough space for an actual stock of fresh seafood with variety and know your product. There is a MASSIVE difference between salmon filets and salmon sashimi. Had I trusted you, I could very easily be dead or in the hospital right now."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go for seafood and the clam chowder is the best around. We also love the intimate feeling about this place, very relaxing after a stressful day of work."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the bad reviews are coming from. It's a laid back kind of Seafood place. I'm from the NW and I've had some damn good seafood in my life. This is not the best but it's the best I've had in this land locked state. Were not on Pier 8 overlooking the ocean or Puget Sound. This is Phoenix. Phoenix may have a TON of sushi restaurants but not so much in the classic fresh fish department.   Chowder is good. I've read some reviews comparing it to Canned soup. It's good. The pasta primavea is excellent, stuffed with mussels, clams, fish and shrimp. Fish and Chips are awesome. Name another place you can get good fish and chips in Gilbert. Can you? I can't. Please let me know if you do.    Dinner for two with drinks, appetizer, chowder, salad and main course. $55. Not bad."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant a better review, however the service is AWFUL.  The first time we ate there we had a very rude waiter.  Too bad I can't remember his name. We decided to give the place another shot as a to go order. I am 9 months pregnant and can't eat certain foods. I spoke with Steven and when I asked if I could substitute a different side with my fish and chips, he was so rude! I ended up speaking to the manager who gave a half hearted apology and we decided to go elsewhere. We will never go back and will warn our friends as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I were taking our newborn to a Dr appointment in Mesa when we realized it was our 18th anniversary.  I had been wanting to take her here, so we stopped in on the way home.  The place is not fancy but it is comfortable and clean.  The waitress made some suggestions (salmon, swordfish or halibut).  My wife had the pollock fish and chips, I had the swordfish and my son had the chicken nuggets.  My wife and I had the chowder also.  The clam chowder was my alltime favorite ( I would come here again just for a bowl) and ranked high for my wife.  The chowder had a broth that tasted of veggies and clam and was very well seasoned.  The bread they served was nice and soft.  My beer(SN Torpedo) and my wife's iced tea were good.  The swordfish came \"lightly seasoned\", perfectly cooked, and very fresh. I had to add more salt and pepper.  My wife enjoyed her panko Pollock.  The fries were decent but seriously under-seasoned as were the chicken tenders.  Most of the food could have used a good dash of larger flake salt and maybe some freshly ground pepper (and I don't like a lot of salt.  My baked potato was fine but could have used some chives and some seasoning, it is served whole and you split it yourself.  Sour cream and butter are provided.  The veggie side was BLAND BLAND BLAND.  Perfectly steamed zucchini and carrots with no seasoning,no herbs, no oil, no butter.   The veg was the biggest let down of the mean some seasoned olive oil or butter would have gone a long way.  I am a veggie fan and appreciate the good sized serving.    With a little more attention to seasoning this place could easily be a 4 star place."}
{"text":"I don't usually get excited about a side of rice, but frankly, I would have been delighted with just a dish of the Rice Pilaf from Seafood Market & Restaurant.  The rice was perfect and so delicious.  It tasted simply nutty, salty and yet layered with a richness that made me think it must have been cooked with fish stock.  And that wasn't even the best part of the meal.    We arrived at 5:30 p.m. on a Friday night.  Yes, we had to wait for a table, but it was not uncomfortable.  The wait time flew by as we perused the big chalkboard menu on the wall hanging over the case of fresh fish on display.    We were soon enough seated in a comfy booth and my companion settled on the Tuscani Bread Bowl of Clam Chowder, while I ordered the special: Chilean Sea Bass with rice and vegetables.    You already know what I thought about the rice.  The vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots) were tasty but the broccoli was tough and rather hard to cut with a butter knife.  Most people like their vegetables al dente.  I'm not one of them, unless I'm eating them raw on purpose.   The bass however was delightful.  It's both a light and flaky yet a fatty type of fish that holds up its texture very well.  My serving was pan seared and kissed with butter.   I enjoyed every bite.    I accompanied the meal with a glass of Weber Zeller Katz which is a round full-bodied German riesling and an excellent choice to go with the bass.  Not too buttery, not too fruity.  My companion's soup was served in a bread bowl which she devoured with exclamations that it was delicious and yummy.  It is not often that my companion ever leaves a restaurant without a doggy bag, however at this meal, she ate everything and it was not a skimpy serving.  I tasted the soup with the bread and it was so good that I think I might order that for myself next time!  Looking at service, taste, ambiance, location and price, there is nothing I experienced that was negative (except maybe the broccoli and that's my own preference).  Which means, that we will be definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Lunch here for the first time today. I am giving them four stars because their oysters were very good (sweet tasting), service and bread were good. I have had better ceviche and my seafood/rice thingy was a little too spicy (taste of Tabasco). My wife said she enjoyed her chowder so there is another positive. We will return for the oysters. I don't know where these came from but they were the best since visiting the oyster bar in Grand Central Station."}
{"text":"I have never walked out on a meal before tonight. We eat out almost every night, and usually have an amazing experience. Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a truly terrible experience to encourage a review.  I'll give the highlights: The restaurant was nearly empty at 6:15 p.m., and still it took about an hour to get our food. The lettuce on our salads was wilted brown, to the point I couldn't believe they actually served it. The steamed vegetables were refrigerator cold, and my daughter's clam chowder had a long hair in it. The topper was when my father cut open his potato to find it was rotten inside.   At this point we brought our concerns to the waiter, who immediately called over the manager. We would have been entirely satisfied had the manager been apologetic. Instead of offering an apology, the manager was argumentative and said he couldn't control what was inside the potato. He then said, \"What do you want, a new potato?\" We stared back at him speechless, and then he said, \"So, are we done here?\" We agreed that indeed, we were finished with this place.   He cleared our plates right then and there, and brought us a bill for the drinks.   We have never not paid for a meal. But the manager's response was so unsatisfactory and the quality of food was so questionable, we completely lost our appetites.   I have never had a more disappointing restaurant experience as I had tonight at the Fish Market. If the rest of the food is rotten, I sincerely hope their seafood does not make anyone sick."}
{"text":"Good oysters, small mostly crab cakes, mostly cream chowder"}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago, and was so not impressed. The service was ok, wasn't bad, but wasn't stellar. The food was bland. Mostly the ambience is outdated and not very clean. This place needs to be revamped! It needs a total face lift and menu overhaul. I will not be coming back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I just ate there, for the first time, last night. My girlfriend and I had the mexican shrimp cocktail, chowder, halibut, and snow crab. Everything was great. I'm really picky about seafood, and this place met my highest expectations."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time. She had the crab cakes and we both had the breaded cod fish dinner. Everything was fresh and the batter on the fish is thinly coated and not very greasy like a lot of places. The crab cakes are not deep fried so you will taste mostly crab flavor. The atmosphere is nothing great but if you're looking for fresh fish with good service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Well, I haven't sent my entire meal back in years, but I did today. I ordered the clam chowder, which tasted just a step above Campbell's. And I got the fresh Halibut with red potatoes and veggies. Besides the fact that the halibut was terribly over cooked, I have actually never in my life tasted more bland, tastless food. Ever. Like zero flavor. I ate a couple bites and told the waiter how terribly bland it all was. I almost laughed out loud when his response was \"well, I can see the seasoning salt all over it.\" Then I left."}
{"text":"Let me just say one thing first. The grub is right. Like reaalllll nice. We didn't know if there would be a wait at like 5:30 PM on a Thursday......there was not. Not only was there no wait, there was also no one there except for 4 waiters and waitresses. I of course order the most barfy sounding grub I could, it was the Pasta Primavera. And it was almost the greatest thing I have ever tasted. For realsies. My wife got some weak looking fish but she said it was money. We saw this super old couple yell at each other right as we were walking in so that was amazing. The ONLY problem I have is that this place was almost dead silent the entire time. Like super creepy quiet. Turn up the tv or whatever music system you have. Play some Billy Idol for crying out loud. other than that, so good."}
{"text":"Dude. I thought I would have loved this place to pieces, but after our first visit, it all started downhill.   This review is based on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th time here.. I really tried to give this place a chance to improve, but no dice.  This time my husband went to go pick-up the rainbow trout, tuna ahi, clam strips and salads. I went on their website to choose from the menu. Apparantly they have updated it and added a 50% off 1 entree when you buy 1 entree coupon there. So we printed it and off he went to pick up the food.  When he came back, there was nothing but upsetting news. First of all, he felt as though they were rude to him. I asked him to explain what happened. He said that as he went in, nobody helped him. A lady who was already there with some children (whom he guessed was the owner's wife), was sitting there. A man came out (which he guessed was the owner), greeted the woman and started playing with the children.   He didn't even ask if my husband needed any help or was picking up food. Nothing. This whole time my husband can see the food was already packed in boxes behind the counter, just that nobody even bothered to help him. The owner even gave him lip about the 50% coupon... asking, \"Is this from the new website?\" UM, Yeah, it was. Who cares if it was from the old site or new site? It's on your website. How the hell does this guy not even know this?? He reluctantly gave the 50% but had a pretentious attitude the whole time. Plus the coupon doesn't even have an expiration date! What a mistake.  Sadly, the food was good, but I don't think we're coming back. I'm really surprised that almost every time we come here, there are not many employees/waiters and the owner would act like this.  Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"After wondering what the food was like for three years we finally stopped in this weekend 12/3/2011. I have to say I was so surprised how wonderful the food was. We are from the east and I would not expect seafood this good in the valley. We had steamed oysters and they were wonderful and the chowder is amazing! Great dinner!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! Decided to take my wife on a date tonight and thought we would try something different. We found this restaurant in a local magazine and gave it a try. This was absolutely the first time I spit my food out at a restaurant! I ordered the twin tale lobster plate and the first bite was horrible with an ammonia after taste.   The potatoes were clearly burned and the veggies were the lowest quality. My wife had the King Crab legs that had been recooked, the evidence was the soft shell. I then sent my plate back and ordered a steak.  The waitress didn't know what kind of steaks they had on hand and had to ask another waitress!  My medium rare top sirloin steak came out rare and was obviously of low quality!        The glasses of wine were a little more than shots. The only thing I liked was the chowder which came in a large coffee cup bowl. And my wife said she liked the salad.  I should have gone to Kings Fish House, i have never been disappointed there!!! DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!!  PS the Manager didn't even have the balls to come out to apologize!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a good place for lunch. Little pricey but the fish tacos are great."}
{"text":"We've been going here since it was on Alma school! Great seafood restaurant! The Clam Chowder bread bowl is awesome!"}
{"text":"We ate there twice last week and will never eat there again.  We are from Casa Grande and went to a movie nearby and before we left I searched out seafood restaurants nearby.  This one looked good, and it was.  The second time my wife had a doctors appointment nearby, it was in the afternoon, so we decided to eat there again after a positive experience the first time.  Bad Choice.  The lunch menu prices are $1.00 less than the dinner menu.  We wanted the same items as we had on our first visit.  Scallops and oysters.  The lunch menu doesn't include salad or chowder.  Salad and Chowder is $2.50 extra on the lunch menu.  So you end up paying more at lunch for the same meal as on the dinner menu.  when I told the server we were disappointed, she sent the owner over.  What a pompous idiot.  I wont go into what he said. but he certainly did not try to please the customer.  I'd rate this place 4 stars for food and no stars for the the owner's attitude.  The host tried to smooth things over, but they wont see us again.  Our favorite Seafood restaurant is the Bluewater Grill.  Further away and more costly, but management goes out if it's way to make you happy.  At the Seafood Market they insult the customer.  NO THNAKS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh fish! I had Halibut fish and chips. Reasonable price of 12 bucks for the type of meal because it''s fresh. My wife had the Trout blackened and we both loved our lunches. You can certainly eat healthy here but a 12-15 dollar lunch in this economy isn't the best thing, but it seems comparable to other restaurants close by Dana Park mall so I can't say it's over priced in that respect, but there are better \"value\" lunch meals out there. Beer battered was how I had mine finished off but you can get it in a Panco breading coating as well. Cole slaw was flavorful and the fries weren't greasy or fishy."}
{"text":"The shrimp is good and fresh. Please has decent seafood that is well prepared. The kids menu is more of an afterthought, just something they threw on there to shut the kids up that cant eat seafood. This place is good, just don't bring the kids!"}
{"text":"The food and service were cafeteria quality - the prices were high end. The vegetables were soaking wet from the steamer bag in the microwave. The Homemade chowder was clearly ordered from Sysco.  The 11.99 I paid for pasta turned out to be a lil cup of pasta in a wide shallow dish to make it seem like something. The server was ridiculous and ran from me after saying \"you ready?\" This place is a joke. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here twice, and both times the food and service were excellent. I had the fish and chips both times--once the salmon, and once the cod. The fish and fries were cooked to perfection, crisp and light. The bread is outstanding. My mom, with whom I've eaten here both times, says that she and my dad used to come here just for the bread, it's so good. I can see why!  Both times I've gone, it's been a very light crowd, but my mom was stunned that we were able to get a table. She says that during snowbird season it's usually a mob scene and impossible to get a table. I guess it's a little early in the season yet for that to happen. ;-)"}
{"text":"Great place for seafood! We love to come here as a family or for special celebrations! The stuffed mushrooms are wonderful as well as the calamari!  As for the main dishes you can't go wrong! I typically ask the waiter what their favorite is and that's what I order.I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Best Clam Chowder in the valley. Made like back home in Boston which is a great price. Son said the Haddock dish was excellent. Highly recommend this hidden gem I found back in 1993.  They also have a fish counter to buy fish or the clam chowder to take home I just love this place."}
{"text":"A hidden delight.  Not well known but the portions and quality of their seafood is great. I had the shrimp scampi and it was well prepared with mushrooms and came with veggies and a baked potato. The clam chowder was excellent. The warm bread served before the meal was a nice touch. Premises are meh and could be better. The interior is dark and depressing. Parking is easy as it shares an huge lot with a ton of other and better known restaurants. I will be back on this one. Our waitperson was Tricia and she was delightful and efficient. Service was not fast food type but made the dinner deliberate and leisurely, a nice evening."}
{"text":"We dined here today and both got the fish and shrimp lunch. The food was okay, certainly wasn't as good as Red Lobster. The prices are good. We would go back. Our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant in Mesa. Hands down... Chef/owner Pablo Reynoso has been serving the best seafood in Mesa since I can remember."}
{"text":"My husband was in the mood for seafood Monday night so I decided to look for a restaurant in Mesa on Yelp and found Seafood Market and Restaurant.   I called ahead to confirm the time the kitchen closed since we were arriving at around 8 and they closed at 9. They said, about 15-20 min prior to closing.  When we arrived, there were about 4 or 5 occupied tables. The restaurant does look a little dark at night with pretty basic decor. When you walk in, you can see the \"market\" area where the fish is on display in a refrigerator. They also have a bar area which was empty. We were seated immediately and the waitress introduced herself a few moments later.   The menu had plenty of options to choose from. My husband and I chose the crab stuffed mushroom for an appetizer (based on the waitress's recommendation). We also ordered the King salmon which is served with two sides; my husband picked the clam chowder and the seafood pasta, that was his dish. I selected the Shrimp Po boy sandwich which is served with fries and sauce on the side.   Our waitress put in our order for the appetizer ahead of the main dishes because it takes time. By the time we ordered our mains and waited for a few minutes, the appetizer was out. It was probably baked in the oven hence the warning that the dish was \"super hot\". The appetizer was delicious!! We both enjoyed every bit of it. As soon as it was served, we also got some toasted bread and butter which went very well with it.   About 10 minutes later, the clam chowder soup was served. It's served in a cup since it's a side. The waitress was very thoughtful; she included an extra spoon in case I was interested in tasting it too and I did and it was also delicious.   The mains came out a few minutes later. The food looked pretty good. My husband asked me to try his dish and the salmon tasted ok but it was slightly overcooked so it was on the dry side. The seafood pasta was delicious although my expectation of a seafood pasta was completely different. It was a cold seafood pasta salad. My thought was that my husband was gonna get like a hot spaghetti or linguini with some seafood. Nevertheless, it tasted great.   My Po Boy dish looked pretty good however, it did not hit the mark with me. The bread was soggy on the bottom, it felt as though there was water on the plate before the sandwich was put on. The veggies were on the side with a pickle, a lemon wedge and sauce. I've only had a Po boy sandwich once before which was a long time ago. I remember it had a nice Cajun flavor. The shrimp was breaded but had no flavor. It was pretty bland, it almost tasted like it didn't even have salt. I ate a few bites and left the rest. I still took it home though so my husband can try it and tell me his opinion. He thought it was pretty bland too.   Overall, a pretty good experience if we ignore the Po boy. Service was excellent. We were in and out in about 45 minutes. Prices are reasonable for a seafood restaurant. We will go back and I will try another main dish on the menu. Hopefully it will taste as good as the appetizer!"}
{"text":"A little slow on the night we went but other than that the food was amazing and our waiter was great! Very attentive to what we needed. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place just rocked my socks off. Every server should be like Ben, he's the tall handsome man with great hair.  All the seafood is delicious, fresh, and I've never had better zucchini sticks than these ones. And I've had them all. Even Zinburger. And their ranch is homemade and the best ever!!"}
{"text":"Always very good.  Not extremely upscale.  Very good seafood and service for a respectable price.  Always consistent."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. We should have looked at reviews before coming here. Went in a Saturday night and was dead. My fish tacos had a terrible taste and the wife's dish seemed like it was cooked in a microwave. Overall very poor food, I would rather eat a can of tuna. This place needs to revamp completely or go under. Service was good so giving an extra star for that."}
{"text":"I tried the harvest platter and thought that it was adequate though not special.  The oysters were very small, more breading than anything else.  The clam strips were tiny.  The fried shrimp was serviceable.  The cod was the only thing that I would say was actually good.  I know that the Phoenix area is not known for it's seafood, but I have definitely had better in the area.  The service and decor, etc were fine.  Just do not expect too much from the food."}
{"text":"amazing!!  love the owner and staff...seafood the best around for az.  you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I love seafood. I came here expecting to be wowed and I got blah. I ordered one of their specials, the Chilean seabass, and it was completely boring.  Not even salt and pepper for some seasoning. I get the concept of not overbearing food with tons of ingredients, but come on! Use some salt and pepper to enhance the flavor! It came with a side of aioli but I didn't care for the mayonnaisey stuff on my fish. Veggies were also bland, sliced zucchini and  squash in butter. I did enjoy my clam chowder soup, but again nothing special. For a $20 entree I was expecting more."}
{"text":"RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If they had a zero or negative star above I would put a mark on that one.... The waiter (believe its the owners son) was so rude that we almost walked out. The prices are outrageous for a lunch place you can only order off the main menu.  Lunch for my family of 4 was over $50 . The owner dropped off our food and left didn't ask if we needed anything or does everything look ok. My sister ask for certain suace that is normally on a Po Boy sandwich and she was told with a snotty attitude \"well  we gave you tarter sauce and cocktail sauce\". Instead of stating no we don't have that but can I offer you something. I can't imagine treating your people with that must disrespect.  It's been less than an hour and we all have very upset stomachs feels like we are coming down with a case of food poisoning.   Very unhappy customer. Your busniess isn't appreciated at all no thank you when the check was delivered or even while we walked out the door."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Valentine's Day for a nice little seafood dinner and was really happy with the overall experience.  My fiancee and I love seafood and oysters and we always like to try new places.  We thought the daily fish special was delicious, the oysters were great and the service was friendly.  If I had one negative it would be the side dishes weren't that great (rice pilaf and french fries).  The prices were pretty fair, which was nice.  I would go back and would love to try the chowder and other tasty bites!"}
{"text":"We were dragged here with a friend because she was craving seafood.  Unfortunately, the only thing that was better than average was the oyster crackers and the ice water.  The incredibly \"fishy\" smell punches you in the nose when you walk in, and the crowd is almost exclusively retired.  There's nothing wrong with that - other than people tend to lose their taste buds as they age - that's the only reason I can explain how busy they were.  They're \"famous\" for their fish & chips.  The cod was no bueno and the fries were soggy.  I'm sorry, but if that's what you're famous for, you better bring it every time!  The service was less than desirable, and it's safe to say I'll NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Don't have much to say that is positive. My mother, sister, aunt, and myself had lunch here today. An hour after eating we all have terrible stomaches and feel nauseous. I believe the 2 men working were father & son, Pablo & Pablo Jr. The son was the waiter. He had a MAJOR attitude. No smiling and very rude. Definitely did not make us feel appreciated as customers. Daddy needs to shake him or fire him! Daddy Pablo did smile, checked on us once, and thanked us for coming in. The menu is not elaborate and the prices are high for lunch (unless you want fish & chips or a sandwich). Needless to say, we will not be returning. NOTE TO DADDY PABLO: Do not allow JR to work without you being there. He will run off all your customers."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful Crab Louie here. Very good.  Service always pleasant and efficient.  Ambience pleasant.  Outstanding restaurant."}
{"text":"Exterior was recently painted at my go-to place for fresh fish!  Now it's classy to match the wild caught catch of the day. If you have hesitated to eat fish in the dessert try this!"}
{"text":"The salads looked like it was directly out of a bag. The service was lacking in an almost empty restaurant. My girlfriends Shrimp Scampi was good but the Maryland Crab cakes weren't.  You know it's bad when you walk out see Panda Express and know you would have had a better experience there."}
{"text":"Nice cozy seafood spot, I have not been able to locate many since my transition to Chandler from southern California.  So I tried it... Service was great our server was sweet and polite always checked on us and allowed us to make our own sampler plate, the food came quick! We both ordered red snapper plates and it was great came with veggies and 1 additional side to  many to choose from fries, seafood pasta, etc. Overall I will come back.  Only negative was the calamari was a bit under cooked but our server offered another full order cooked more crispy (I really like GREAT SERVICE) but the main course was up and running so we passed on that.  The portions were nice sized.  Try them out I'm sure you'll agree they are worth a trip when you have a need for seafood.    Bon appetite.."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how we came by this place but we've been here a few times now for seafood and I cannot complain on quality at all. It is a restaurant and market. My understanding is that they do supply other restaurants with their seafood and I did hear a rumor that they fly their seafood in daily. I may be entirely incorrect.   The last time we were in we grabbed a few pounds of shrimp since I wanted to make some Mexican shrimp cocktail, we also ordered some cocktail shrimp to tie us over until my masterpiece was prepared. The cocktail shrimp was great! I know, how can one go wrong? It is possible and luckily for us, the cocktail shrimp was beautiful and not all dinky looking like you'd get in a grocery store ring. I was prepared to clean shrimp shoots, knowing that I'd picked up a pound of raw shrimpos. Ha! They had already been cleaned and all that was left was to peel them. Normally, I would expect some minor fishiness only because we live in the desert and I know they didn't come out of the ocean in back. Honestly, not even a hint of ammonia at all.   It's a shame that there aren't more people dining in when we go in because I want to see this place stick around. We'll have to just go in and sit down for a meal at some point and really check it out. As far as the market portion of the place? On point!"}
{"text":"It was good... The portions were reasonable... Calamari was yum! Will go back and try something different next time though"}
{"text":"Trish is the best waitress ever!! I never have to order my food, she has iced tea waiting and orders my regular before I get in the door! Pablo is so personable , great people and service!!!"}
{"text":"The widest selection of fish & seafood dishes that I've found since moving from the California coast 12 years ago. On par with the finest restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf. The fried oysters are to die for! Huge,succulent and hand-breaded. Their Seafood Pasta Salad side dish is also incredibly delicious. And the Crab and Seafood Louie salads are the best ever! Take-out service is highly recommended. They are very courteous and professional when taking a phone order. And the food is usually available for pick up quicker than I can drive there."}
{"text":"I'm not use to the water; so brought in a bottle. Service was great. It is Sunday and we hit the crowd traffic just right at 12:10. Food was great. I had the scallop and shrimp over linguini with mixed veggies.   Bread was a little cold to be toasted."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with my significant other. It was VERY crowded. I didn't really expect that at this joint, but I guess it is very popular with the elders (not trying to be offensive, but I live in AZ and lots of retired elders here). Anyways, service is prompt and friendly. They give you free freshly baked bread (YAY!)  Now on to the food, I came here because I've previously bought some Ahi Tuna at the market area. Let's be honest here though, it's not really a market. It's just a small little fridge with a selection of 5-6 different seafood. But the Ahi Tuna I bought was fresh and delicious. No complaints there at all!. I made Ahi Tuna Poke with the tuna I bought and it got raves from friends.   Ok back on track to their restaurant food, I got the sampler and gf got the fish and chips. On second thought, I think we ordered too much fried food, because I started to feel sick after eating all that. Fish and shrimp were fresh and good, but baked potato was pretty lonely and without its condiments. Maybe i'll try other items on their menu, but the fried fish was just too much for me that day."}
{"text":"The food was reasonably priced. The fish was fresh and delicious, the side items and salad were cheap throw away dinner food. My server was probably one of the least personable people I've ever met but maybe she was just having a tough day. I'll try it again but if it's the same service and undercooked/not very tasty sides I probably will not returning a third time. Again if you go for just the fish/seafood you won't be disappointed with quality."}
{"text":"This is one of the best seafood restaurants in the east valley, top three in the very least.  I have lived here for thirty years and have come to this place for twenty years, back then it was located near Fiesta Mall.  This is your classic east coast styled seafood restaurant that is family owned and operated.  My all-time favorite dish (when it is in season) is the soft-shell crab.  I love them lightly fried and served as a sandwich, which by the way isn't on the menu but they are great at making special requests.  The only \"bad\" experience that my wife and I ever had here was when we decided that we just wanted king crab.  By that I mean we wanted a whole crab and no sides.  The server got the no sides part right, but he served us one portion of crab... four legs, no claws.  Another server noticed that we looked a bit confused about what was delivered and she asked if something wasn't right.  We explained that we were expecting eight legs and two claws.  I suspect that they don't normally serve claws when ordering a la carte, but between her and our server they fixed it up for us... giving us exactly what we wanted.  We just didn't want any of the usual sides because we knew we would be stuffed from the crab alone.  A word of warning though, this place gets PACKED in the winter time.  Folks from the east coast know a good seafood restaurant when they see one and the snowbirds flock to this joint.  My sister and her husband once waited two hours to get a seat on a Friday night in the middle of Lent.  She said it was worth the wait.  As for me I prefer to come here on Saturday afternoons that time of year for faster seating."}
{"text":"Had the clam chowder and it was very tasty. However, I was disappointed in the bread. I was looking forward to a nice crusty piece of either sourdough or artisan bread to complement the chowder. The bread we were served was soft, white and tasteless."}
{"text":"The food was not great the calamari an crab cake an fish an chip how can you mess up a Hamburger with cheese .. I used to eat there last year till now different fish place but today was really bad for me an my Family . I should of went to King Fish in Tempe better serves an food  an Real calamari an crab cakes. I will never come back as a customer go some where else you will be better off.. An one more thing not enough Fries with your food.."}
{"text":"Went Wed. Oct. 10 at around 6:15pm as I was having a massive craving for oysters on the half shell after just watchiong a food channel show about them so we showed up at Seafood Market.  Have been here maybe twice in seven years and neither time was it great but with such few seafood choices in the East Valley I was desperate.  Walked in the door with my daughter and was asked if we wanted a booth or a table by the most \"not wanting to be at work\" host/manager I've ever seen.  We were sat at a booth at I believe was 6:17pm because I just returned a text to my wife.  So we sat,  then we played a game, then we sat and looked at the menu again.  The waiter has been to the booth right beside us twice and made eye contact with me.  We sat some more.  The person sitting alone next to us called over the waiter to say he ordered blackened what ever he was eating and the waiter took it back to the kitchen.  I was now in \"lets just see how long this will take mode\".  The waiter returned the mans plate and then came back several minutes later to make sure it was OK.  Well the time is now 6:44 and I am very thirsty so we left.  I now understand why during the dinner rush your place was so empty."}
{"text":"This place is not good. Went here with my mom for the first time and the first waiter was so rude it was unbelievable. Like we were a nuisance and he hated his job and didn't want to be there. My mom and I kept looking at each other like what the heck is going on and I made eye contact with another waiter across the room and the next thing I know he became our server which happened in time because I was about to tell my mom we're leaving. Then the food came... Not good. Bland, didn't taste fresh, just terrible. He also didn't even ask if we wanted any dessert (not that we did after tasting the food) but he didn't even ask, just brought our check. It wasn't closing time or anything either. Highly suggest you go to High Tide or Kings Fish house for good seafood. I just hope what I ate doesn't make me sick. I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite seafood restaurants in the east valley area.  I love the scallops and crab cakes.  I know of only 1 other seafood restaurant that serves Maryland type crab cakes.  The fish here is excellent. The food has always been good every time I eat here. I wish they had more of a selection of vegetables. This is a minor issue since I come for the fish! As a Realtor I often find myself between closing appointments and like good food."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. I know because I've actually eaten there. They don't serve bees on the menu but they do have a wide variety of fresh fish. The service is always top notch. I feel like the wait staff and I could hang out socially sometime possibly. If they wanted to, no pressure. If you go, order the fish and chips made with halibut instead of cod. Little insider secret. But don't take my word for it. Just ask the bees."}
{"text":"This is a terrific seafood restaurant for the desert. Their fresh catch list is varied, and they will cook it to your specific order. I had the fresh salmon; I ordered it grilled, and when it arrived, the waiter hadn't even delivered it yet when he noticed that there were no grill marks. He whisked it away, and it came back just as I wanted it--with a slightly charred crust on top. Compare that to my dining companion who wanted her salmon slightly underdone. She got hers that way too. This was my first time dining here, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good enough, if you order the right stuff. My recommendation is you stick with the Ahi or the clam chowder. Get too adventurous and it is a miss."}
{"text":"The name \"Seafood Market Restaurant\" conjures in the mind's eye a place that would specialize in just great seafood.  While this place apparently serves  fresh seafood, it does so with such an air of mediocrity that one cannot help but be disappointed--unless of course you don't care about appearance, presentation, atmosphere and taste.    If what you seek is a place that just serves \"fresh\" seafood, then this place will provide your palette with a level of sustentative adequacy.   I think what the \"Seafood Market Restaurant\" lacks is a sense of identity...and, a chef rather than a cook.    I don't want to mislead the readers of this review...the food is not bad; it just did not meet MY expectations (or that of my date).  If a restaurateur is going to serve an expensive product, the presentation needs to match its cost.  The restaurant d√©cor, atmosphere, flatware, dishes, presentation, etc. made me feel like I was in a small town restaurant that did not have to compete with anyone.    I would be fascinated to learn the background of the owner of this place...what motivated them to open, what or who inspired the concept, etc.  The general location is in a pretty nice area, so I wonder who they might be catering too that enjoys the place well enough to afford its existence.   Like so many amazing places in the valley,     this is NOT a place you would go out of your way for,"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed this place each time I've been here. It's a really nice place, someplace to look forward to going. I absolutely love the clam chowder and it's hard to resist getting lobster."}
{"text":"The worst seafood I have had in a long time. I grew up on the coast and worked in some great seafood restaurants while going to college. I know a good fish house when I see one. Took the family there on Saturday.... We were the only ones there.... (Red Flag!) Food was really bad. The fish tasted like it was microwaved. Veggies and rice had no flavor. When the bill came, I could not believe it! I will not go back. Save yourself a letdown and go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious fresh seafood along with other non seafood items. The server was very attentive and sweet. I would definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers."}
{"text":"We are there on Saturday! It was awesome calamari was great, fish and chips were great and the oysters were amazing! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"The staff here is so rude, their service is borderline abusive!   The host scowled at us upon our arrival, and brought us to a booth. Our server took a long time to greet us, and was obviously annoyed that we only asked for water. While waiting to place our dinner order, we overheard the disrespectful host get into a slight altercation with the family next to us. They looked perplexed when he brought the wrong food to their table, and instead of calmly clarifying their meals, he curtly asked, \"What? You don't know what you ordered?\" The host ultimately apologized for his behavior, but it seemed forced and insincere from my earshot.  I ordered the fish and chips, and my husband ordered the dill and lemon crusted tilapia. Both our meals came with clam chowder. Mine had a hair in it! DISGUSTING! My husband pointed it out to the first waitress he saw, and asked for a new bowl. \"Is that a hair?\" he asked. \"I don't think so, but I'll get you another one anyways,\" she said. No, \"Sorry about that,\" or \"I'll get you a new one right away.\" In fact, she took another 10 minutes to replace it, and seemed very put out.  Our server never checked on us, and left the used clam chowder bowls on our table after delivering our food. The bus boy (who was the most polite of the staff) cleared the bowls for us.   It's a shame the service is atrocious, because the food was actually pretty good. We will NEVER go here again."}
{"text":"had shrimp cocktail plate  was plenty of shrimp, short on sauce, fair service,  went for lunch, very few customers, on a Tuesday, Price high for type of food."}
{"text":"where do i begin IT SUCKS! the old man who owned it used to be so good but his kids blow! I don't normaly yelp but as a chef I have to report the worst!   I went in here ordered three apps (super small)  and two drinks and got charged 30.00 bucks which normally wouldnt be a problem but for the owners kid texting out of uniform at the hostess stand (as the boss). The bartender arguing with the servers over my meal about cleanup duties (totally unprofessional) as well as getting a oysters rockefeller with powdered hollandaise protrayed as mornay and boxed frozen spinach totally ruined any food quality as well as ambiance. They also got the order  wrong when we were the only couple in there, where is a manager, oh yeah texting his girlfriend with his sideburns not caring about his customers. they should be out of business for charging the prices they do for the crap they are serving.  In the end if you have no taste in seafood and want to drop a 100.00 bill go there otherwise go to any chain seafood spot you will do better, shame on you seafood market, won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time for my birthday.  Everything was excellent and our waitress Tricia was the best.  She was friendly and so helpful. Happy Birthday to me, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years, all 3 locations. That being said, I am done with them. Last week I took two people with me and got there for Happy Hour. During the noshing on peel and eat shrimp we started talking to the bartender about the food. When I said it was so uneven on quality and preparation during different visits he asked if they were busy during my \"bad\" dining experiences. I said half and half, he told me that when they are busy the experience suffers. I asked him if the price was also reduced due to quality issues. He laughed, I was not joking, so... 85 dollars later, I left Happy Hour vowing never to return...."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! I ordered from here based off of some of the reviews from people from the East Coast. I am an East Coaster and I can tell you this is not good seafood. The food had no real taste to it and the amount of food we were given for 15.00 a platter was an insult. I had a piece of unseasoned fish, two shrimp, two oysters and bunch of small clam strips that were missing the clams! I will pass on eating here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Every meal that my husband and I have ordered here has been excellent! They serve only the freshest seafood you could ask for, cooked to perfection! I recommend the Seafood Market & Restaurant over Red Lobster any day!"}
{"text":"First time. We walked in and I thought this was going to be a nice experience.  We sat ourselves, and the first server brought our menus. Our server came and asked what we wanted to drink. She brought our drinks right away. We started with a mushroom, zucchini appetizer, which we thought wasn't that good. We ordered the fish and shrimp lunch. Our food took awhile to get to us way after we were done with the appetizer. It really wasn't that busy. When our food arrived, we were very displeased. Our french fries were very soggy. The shrimp did not taste the best, And the fish was sub par.  To us, the food at Long John Silver's is better. And you can't compare this food to Red Lobster. Cafeteria food maybe at it's best. We will not be back.."}
{"text":"This place is very classy. I'm not sure if the influx of people has anything to do with the nearby retirement home or the season of snowbirds. But they flock to this place. Having read about it in phoenix magazine I added it to my bookmark and started to explore. The fish is fresh and served a variety of ways. Oyesters in the half shell beats the price anywhere else. I ended up with the harvest which was all deep fried. Not what I wanted really but it was equally delicious. They have a great wine selection and decent beer on tap. I look forward to coming back and trying something not deep fried (although good) on their menu."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow considering they weren't too busy. I'm reviewing this place based on it's half shucked oysters. You're not going to go anywhere and find $14 for a dozen of oysters.. at least I haven't. It's fresh, although the size of the oyster could be better for the price you're paying. I came in for oysters, but their shipment haven't came in yet, but I waited and ordered other foods, and it finally came. Worth it because you know it is fresh!"}
{"text":"I stand by my past review as they continue to be excellent in every way. We eat there at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Liked the decor, and the service was great. Got the fish and chips special. Both my brother and I thought it was very good. Will be back for more"}
{"text":"The place was  pretty busy on a Thursday night so I had some high hopes but in this case Yelps overall rating is about right - to a little generous if you are into food even just a little.   We ordered oysters on the half shell and while they tasted fine enough they served them to us covered with ice... Ah yeah, just a little presentation issue.  I then ordered one of their specials the sea bass with veggies.  About a 3\" x 3\" 1/2\" thick piece...  The fish tasted fine but the veggies were sad steamed limp gross looking things.   Again, the presentation was horrendous.  Just a piece of fish and some nasty veggies I wouldn't serve my dog.  The chowder was the best thing I had here.  I wouldn't waste my time or money here unless you know what you're getting into.  If you're looking for fried food I'm sure this will fit the bill.  Our Server did a good job and treated us well."}
{"text":"Perfection! I finally had the opportunity to dine at the Seafood Market & Restaurant last Friday (February12th). The place was busy and we had a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes) but the food and atmosphere were well worth the slight delay. This is the kind of restaurant I dream about. Subdued overhead lighting with twinkling flames on each table. Comfortable seating. A clientele that seemed in and of itself tasteful and \"above average.\" without pretension or arrogance. Everyone was clearly there to have a good meal and a pleasant evening, It's the sort of place that is special enough to merit \"dressing up\" - guys in sportcoats, etc., but not so stuffy that you would feel uncomfortable in jeans and a t-shirt. The overall atmosphere was relaxed and subdued but children are clearly welcome.  The wait staff was professional and efficient. They kept my water glass filled and cleared empty plates promptly without excessive hovering.   The food was excellent. I was still on my quest to locate decent fish and chips in the Gilbert/Mesa area so I ordered their halibut fish and chips and a beer. One negative comment - no Blue Moon on the menu. The waitress said they get many requests for Blue Moon so I hope they begin making that available to their diners.   My date ordered a seafood platter of some kind - a selection of fried items - clam strips, fish, shrimp, crab cake, with rice and steamed vegetables. He also had a cup of their clam chowder. He enjoyed everything. I had a house salad with the fish and chips. That too was delicious. The french fries were average but the fish was the star anyway and it was very good. The halibut was tender and the beer batter was light and crispy. The coleslaw was nice as well - creamy but not too heavy.  I thought the pricing was appropriate for what you get. Outstanding. I will be eating there again in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been going here forever they have the freshest fish you can get round deez parts, way better than pricey grocery shops near by, I usually just buy fish from here to cook since its amazing, but I have also eaten here many times and everything is fantastic except the veggies so guess what I don't get them! If I want cooked seafood this is my first choice"}
{"text":"My parents and I just ate here for the first and last time. The place looks like a dark Red Lobster, which had a nice nautical theme, but that was all that was nice. Our waiter was especially brisk-- the kind that keeps walking while asking how the meal is. All of the food was overpriced for the quality and extremely bland. I expect a lot more when paying fifteen dollars for a medium sized bowl of Crab Alfredo. My father had the fried perch (which was the special) and said he could find better in a drive through. Official first and last time we will be going here, absolutely not worth it."}
{"text":"Really surprised by all the good reviews. We all know finding good seafood in the valley is tough, and guess it will still be.  2 of us went. I ordered a mixed seafood plate. Shame on me, it came out fried, don't think it said that on the menu but having a baked option would been better.  We ordered Halibut and and got swordfish!!?? Pointed this out and waiter said... uummm, and walked away. Service was really bad. Only about 10 people in the place and waiter only came to the table 2 times.  Really strange as I had heard nice things about the place. But, I had been there about 2 or 3 years ago  (it was really bad food and service then) and was under the impression it was under new management.  I gave 2 stars vs. 1 star, the dinner rolls (that they did not refill were fantastic and the diet coke was perfect (Hey, trying to find something nice to say)  Anyway, with tip (and no drinks) it was about $55 for the two of us. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"We've been patrons for over 20 years, and will be until we die. This place has always been awesome. There is nothing bad on the menu."}
{"text":"I like many others thought this place would be good, but the food was terrible. Bland no seasoning and no seasoning on the vegetables. I give them one star for the balsamic salad dressing it was good. We had the blackened snapper thinking it would be grilled, but came out looking poached and blackening was added after it was poached, no flavor on anything. Bread was store bought and partially burnt. Good food if ur on a bland diet should have read All the reviews before going here."}
{"text":"Their clam chowder is the standout winner here! On its own the chowder gets 5 stars.  The fish and chips were well portioned for the price. The cod was flaky but lacked any real flavor. The bread crust was light but couldn't hold up when given a spritz of vinegar for flavor. The crab cakes were also a generous portion but were only OK. The meals get 4 stars.  I know the place is called \"fish market\" and they have a fish counter, but I don't think the entire place needs to smell of slightly off fish odor. That was off-putting.  Service was just OK. We asked for recommendations but nothing was suggested with any energy. We were looked after but there really wasn't much effort beyond that. Perhaps they were short people. I don't know.  Between the less-than-welcoming-aroma and the just-OK service it nets down to 3 stars for me.  I would definitely come back. And, I do think the place is worth a go. For me, I would get the biggest portion of the chowder and call it quits after that. Served in a bread bowl, it's definitely a big enough serving to call it a lunch."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and had steak and lobster. Both were awesome..sweet lobster and juicy steak. perfect. This is a laid back place, no frills..no snobbery..I like!  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner the other night. I would say this place has the worst service I have seen in a restaurant. The person who greeted us took 10 minutes to greet us then told us to wait at a table so we could be seated at a different table later. When we told him we had ten people coming he quickly changed his mind and had us stay put while they set the big table which took another ten minutes. Then when we sat down we waited five minutes before getting our drinks then after we got our drinks the waiter didn't come back for 20 minutes to order our food. Then they took half an hour at least to serve our food. As the last two people in our party arrived they had to wait 15 minutes to get drinks order then another 20 for food. I get that places get busy but this place wasn't they maybe had 7 tables and 3 waiters. The food was good which is why they get 2 stars. I didn't think the staff was friendly and they were very slow."}
{"text":"14 of us ate here this past Friday night and everyone loved what they ordered.  The crab cakes were good,  the escargot was great. Clam chowder very good, and there were lots if clams in it. I ordered the scallop and shrimp scampi and it was excellent.  Highly recommend this place for your seafood fix. Our waitress was the best.  Serving 14 rowdy guests is not easy but she had such a flair and made it a wonderful experience.  Highly recommend this little jewel"}
{"text":"A nice little seafood restaurant and market located in a popular mini-mall. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our waitress was a few seconds behind us taking our drink order. We had to wait a few minutes for a menu as they were all being used at the moment. Once we got our menus we ordered. I ordered crab cakes with a side of rice pilaf. My wife ordered the broiled jumbo shrimp. Our order was up in a reasonable amount of time. I got 2 large crab cakes. They were good sized for the price. They were a little bland, but the sauce complimented them well. The rice pilaf was perfect. This all came with a side of steamed vegetables. My wife got 6 large shrimps perfectly broiled. We were pleased with the service , food, and price. This is a place worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Good Tacos Del Cabo!!!!  Good Shrimp Tacos!!!  Good Santa Fe Salmon Salad"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to celebrate our anniversary and the worse service and seafood.  They served crab legs ice cold.  My halibut was so-so.  Waiter was handing us bread, etc. over a wall.  Never again."}
{"text":"We had never been here and stopped on whim. I ordered the halibut. Very good. The only down fall is the veggies they add to the plate. They are frozen mixed vegetables.  They could really up this score with a little more thought on the sides and presentation.  Service was very very good! Clean place. But could use a little more ambiance."}
{"text":"First time here I ordered the Clam Chowder bread bowl. I've had better clam chowder out of a can. If you like blah pricey seafood this is your place. Customer service is friendly but not very helpful."}
{"text":"I feel like I walked into a retirement home. Almost all customers are old and we certainly got the stare when we walked in. It was definitely very uncomfortable. Since we were here for food, I just kept my head down and focus on why we were here in the first place.   The clam chowder was delicious and the portion for my Queen Crab legs were generous. If you like crab legs, I highly recommend it. Other than that, everyone else we had was just ok."}
