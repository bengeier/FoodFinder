{"text":"Would've liked to have tried this place but when I showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday it was closed. Very disappointed as the hours posted on the door as well as online said open till 10pm. Not impressed."}
{"text":"When I first moved into the area, I was very disappointed about the long trek to Richmond Hill or Markham to get some decent bubble tea.  When I found this shop, I decided to give it a try and was pleasantly surprised!  The drinks are above average and on par with Chatime.  After trying a handful of drinks, I am confident in giving them two happy thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If you're a bubble tea fan in Newmarket/Aurora you should give this place a try; the selection is on-par with most higher-end shops in Toronto and the quality is higher than any place north of Highway 7.  It takes a while to make the tea depending on your order, more time than you'd expect at a really good place, but my bet is that it's part of the learning curve and that will improve as the shop grows.  Over-all it's bubble tea and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Popped by this place on an evening to check it out after hearing about it. Seems to be a rather new place that is serving Boba tea in a place taken from a Dollar Store. (that has now downsized) First impressions is that looks like a rather nice place with a nice color scheme to it. The place has a very welcoming atmosphere with open space with a welcoming look to the location. Seating seems to be a good amount scattered throughout the floor with the drinks made in the back and then the front being a cash register which accepts contactless.

Overall for the location being in a small town, it is a start. Prices seem to be on par with Chatime and Presto Tea, and the Boba tastes okay.For what it's worth I will give it 3.5 stars of 5 since it doesn't have much to offer other than the location and convenience really."}
{"text":"Cutest little bubble tea shop in town. Ordered a guava yogurt drink and taro slush. The workers were so kind and helpful in recommending a drink and what to put inside. Both tasted amazing :) 10/10 would come again and sit down to have the drinks in the light bulb cups! So cute!!"}
{"text":"We just popped by here by chance and I found out it was only their second day! 

The interior is small but has a very cozy feeling. 

I ordered the Earl Grey Milk Tea and my boyfriend ordered the Green Apple Fruit Tea. They were both very yummy and not too sweet, which was perfect for us. 

The staff is very friendly and always smiling so that's a big plus.

I don't live around here but my boyfriend does so I will definitely stop by here whenever I get the chance! 

Congratz on your grand opening!"}
{"text":"The service is nice, the food and cake here is delicious and for sure they make better bubble tea compared to the one located near the movie theatre (always closed)"}
{"text":"Basic Milk Tea.... made with black tea.... this is what I always get from these type of places. Here it's kinda expensive for something basic but where is makes up for this is in the food, the selection of items available are astonishing, and everything tastes great and it is INexpensive, which kinda adds balance to the price problem I had. Check this spot out."}
{"text":"Authentic Bubble Tea done right!  Let's get this straight--this is truly Oriental tea, not the generic, bland product down on Main Street.  This place saves me from frequent voyages to Chatime in Richmond Hill just to feed my addiction for a solidly good tea.  But first, I needed to vet this place very critically, to see if it would cut it long term.

I can't handle the powdered flavourings for teas.  It just comes across gritty.  Tea Hotea uses liquid flavourings. Also, they offer the choice of black or green tea, and a ton of interesting flavour options.  Big win!  

For toppings, they have a very wide variety including the standard tapioca and jellies, but also the juice filled pearls. And like Chatime, they do varying levels of sugar and ice for a perfectly customized drink.

I tested my usual Mango Green Tea.  The tea was slightly perfumed like Go For Tea but not as overpowering, with a Mango flavour almost as bright as Chatime, but a bit more natural tasting.

But it doesn't stop there:  they offer Taiwanese style snacks, including La Rocca cakes.  Quite simply, I can see myself here nearly every day.  The amount I will save on fuel alone will be the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Such a delightful experience at this bubble tea shop.. Great Taiwanese food and Milk tea, and very nice place to chill.. highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"A cute little bubble tea boutique opening up in new market. There's of course better bubble tea places out there but it's Newmarket.... Finding authentic bubble tea or anything Asian is super hard up north. When giving this place a try I had no expectations. No point of getting your hopes up when it will probably be bad. But surprisingly the bubble tea was a bit above average. The appetizers are cheaper than the Taiwanese restaurants in Markham. I really like their popcorn chicken and Taiwanese sausages! What amazes me about this place is that they also have La Rocca cakes and dream factory cheesecakes for the price of $4.50!!!!! I had the original dream factory cheese cake and it was terrible .... I remember going back the next day to let them know about how bad the cheesecake was, without expecting anything. They came up to me with a brand new cheese cake with my take out order and apologized and they hope that this cheese cake would be a lot better because they're a brand new store and looking to improve. The brand new cheesecake they gave me was literally mouth watering !!! I'm completely satisfied with the food/drinks + the excellent customer service they always offer when I come in! Way to go teahotea! I'm going to be one loyal customer to this place since there's not many Asian places in Newmarket. 
They accept cash and debit only !!"}
{"text":"Finally some decent REAL bubble tea in Newmarket or I should say (north of Richmond Hill). Need some adjustment of atmosphere (music, TV?) if it's there maybe turn it on!!! But overall good quality tea! And good design of place."}
{"text":"Edit: I see the owners notes below my comment and as appreciative of it as I am, once I got into the car the gentleman mopping the floor went to the door to turn off the open sign.  I understand there were no customers and going home early... all they needed to do was come to the door and tell me sorry we closed early and then make up something (i.e. Cold weather, bad drive, long commute whatever the case!!!).  Rather they looked up at me struggling with the door, I even said are you open? And they completely ignored me and pretended I wasn't there.  I'll chalk it up to lack of training.





A little pissed off right now.  I drove in the snow to get a bubble tea and try this place after reading great reviews.  I got here at 8:32, two guys working inside.  I walk up to the door all excited reading the menus from yelp.  I get to the door, pull on the handle and the door is locked.  Open sign still  flashing away.  The two guys stand there and look at me.... then look back down at their mop and the register.  

If you're closed.... fix your hours or at the very least shut off your open sign. If you're closing early come out and tell your customer that you closed early instead of pretending to not acknowledge me.  

To me this shows that they don't care about their customers...good way to start guys.... sorry but I won't come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic cafe!!!!! The service is amazing! The snacks are yummy! And the tea is absolutely delicious!!! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for bubble tea or just a nice place to hang out!"}
{"text":"The vibe is awesome and their taro milk green tea is really good. Workers were really nice. Will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"Was very excited that we finally have a real taiwanese snack/bubble tea place so packed up the kids and drove 20 mins to get there and it's closed at 3:30 pm?? Yelp showed it was supposed to be open. You made a 4 year old very very disappointed and sad."}
