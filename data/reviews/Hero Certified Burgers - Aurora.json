{"text":"Best chain restaurant burgers in town! Friendly people, oriented to please the clients. Owner is realy working hard to keep a good establishment! Renovated recently.Well represents the brand and philosophy of it. Good job and keep it up!"}
{"text":"The fact these guys just do 'hero certified' burgers had my hopes up but it was just average. Kinda boring, chain-like atmosphere and a burger that wasn't memorable. Had a lot better."}
{"text":"HCB is always a good choice for an \"in-between\" burger.  This isn't fast food but it still isn't high end gourmet burger bistro.  Pricing is decent, quality is always great and topping selection is good too."}
{"text":"Teenage boys have a storied reputation for packing it away but there has actually been little objective evidence to confirm that this was the norm until I chanced upon this location of Hero Certified Burgers. What better way to use my talents as an armchair anthropologist.   Yes, burgers in multiples are popular here with local teens and for good reason: tasty certified organic Angus beef.  All burgers are made medium well and prepared and delivered to the table within five minutes. Don't care for beef?  There's salmon, turkey and chicken available.  For our vegan friends a 100% vegetarian soul burger and also gluten free buns, for those who are so inclined.  Fries were perfectly crisp and lightly salted.  I had the four ounce burger and The Big K (the thin man who can eat for four people) the six ounce combo.    We shared a perfect strawberry shake and as I gazed into the Big K's eyes, I knew we were onto a good thing."}
{"text":"Thick juicy burgers!!!  Service at this location is phenomenal and the quality of the burgers are consistent each time.  Would 100% recommend people to this location only."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER PLACE EVER!  The food is fantastic, what, with their classy, gourmet burgers!  My favourite is the Turkey special (I forget what it's called) with turkey, cranberry sauce, fried onions, and sauce all on an egg bun.  MMMMMMMmmmmmmmMMMMMMmmmm!  Their service is PHENOMENAL! I can't say enough about this. The people behind the counter are so friendly and helpful (they remember me when I go back).  I forgot my scarf there and called up once I got back to work: they'd noticed right away and were holding it for me. When I went to pick it up, they knew exactly why I was there and had my scarf ready!  When I go with my friends we place our order and are invited to sit and staff brings the food out to us.  If a table is dirty, staff rush over to clean it so I have my choice of unoccupied tables.  Staff will make suggestions, if I'm undecided.  My favourite, though, is how they handled my inquiry into soy content in the food. I'm intolerant and am trying to be careful.  Staff actually pulled out the packaging for the food so I could see the ingredient list with my own eyes.  Their website is good about listing allergen ingredients, and my email inquiry into allergen content was answered same-day.  The location itself is very clean and feels classy when I go in there. Definitely somewhere I could take business associates or family for a semi-formal fast food dinner!  Everything about this place shines like a star in my eyes.  The service, the food, and the experience.  If you're looking for somewhere to go: GO HERE!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of burger joints around but in my humble opinion Hero stands out for its big, thick, freshly grilled, juicy burger! They also offer you the choice in size of 4, 6 or the huge 8 oz. Maybe not the best fries (McD's still tops) but they give you a lot along with refillable fountain drinks. Tons of toppings too. Forget about a Drive-thru,  worth the wait and rarely big lines."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased to eat at Hero when I need a \"beefy\" tasting burger. The main thing to remember about Hero is their beef burgers are hormone free & use angus beef. Good stuff. Their burgers cost a bit more but nothing to get alarmed about. You can get 4, 6 or 8 oz beef burger patty. I usually get the 6 oz combo; choice of fries or onion rings. I love both. Of course you can add cheese; an assorted variety to choose at a $1.29 each or plain cheddar 99cents. Strip bacon or pea male is available too as a surcharge.  Many free toppings & sauces to choose from as well to put on your burger meat of choice. Which leads into letting you know there's chicken, turkey and salmon burgers too.  The place is a burger joint so expect casual eating experience - wooden chairs & table.  Your food takes about 10 minutes on average to receive. I've been pleased with my food at this location always. My beef burger isn't greasy nor the fries & onion rings.  I've had the lobster topped beef burger and that's yummy. I tried the turkey burger which was good (in a healthy tasting way) but that's not my thing."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. A little pricey but you don't feel like your dying after. Staff is whatever, nothing special but they do bring your food to your table. Absolutely not the place to go for lunch but definitely the place to be after a slammed workout."}
{"text":"Service okay but the food was over priced.  Not a great value and experience overall."}
{"text":"Amazing service.. guy is working the tables, cashier, trash... Best fast food customer service ever."}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent service and great menu. Burgers are delicious as is the onion rings and fries. Soooo good."}
