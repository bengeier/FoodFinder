{"text":"We bought several tens of thousands of dollars worth of Panda windows for a home renovation in NYC.  To make a long story short, Panda windows are low quality, over-priced, badly-designed windows.  While they are spec'd for cold climates, our windows were drafty and would not shut properly.  Customer service was awful, and the company does not stand behind it's work.  They tried to blame us for not using a Panda-certified installer --  Well, after several phone calls to the office, they finally admitted they didn't have a certified installer in the New York area we could have used in the first place and refused to stand behind their product.  We ended up replacing every window.  Do not waste your money.  There are much better windows available for better prices."}
{"text":"I was looknig for windows that had better insulation as we don't have much shade coverage. I went for the thermally broken aluminum windows, which by name doesn't sound good, however they keep the temperature control better than any normal windows and I am able to use my AC and heater less which saves me a ton in the long run. 

I am not scientific but if you check them out you can read all the specs if that is something you can do and understand. I took time to call and get questions answered which helped me make the choice that I did."}
{"text":"Company was an time with the services , very professional and provide excellent customer service, I'm absolutely extatic with the results !!"}
{"text":"I never complain. I'm afraid of Karma.  I'm a restaurant owner, I realize I am an open target if someone is dissatisfied, so it takes a lot for me to complain about someone else. But in this case, they deserve all the bad rap they get.
I bought sliding doors for my restaurant, and I even bought french doors for my home.  I spent well over $20k.  The amount I spent should not have any bearing on anything, but since they have no concern for customer satisfaction, I felt I needed to mention this.

READ ALL THESE REVIEWS!!! The complaints are valid, their ratings are extremely low, their customer service is virtually non existent.  Everything you're reading is accurate.  I even demanded talking to the owner, Avi, after I got ignored for a week straight on emails and texts and left messages to Jennyfer at the Panda company.  Avi is a good talker, but cuts you off in the middle of a sentence and I got absolutely no where with him.  He gave me his cell #.  Within the week I had to call him 3 times.  My last message to him, was \"Why bother giving me your cell # if you never return my calls\"  He's never returned any!  I don't see these guys staying in business too long. and YES, most of the employees I come in contact with share that same common thread... they all are looking for better opportunities. 
AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!!  I signed up on November 14, 2016 for french doors for my home.  Today should be the last call these crooks make to finalize this NIGHTMARE of a project. 

Wish I would have checked the reviews first.  

So for starters:  REALLY??? 5 months for french doors.  Wish I would have gone to Weiland doors instead. I have had to deal with excuses, scheduling and basically I had to call George every Wednesday to see if he was going to come over to complete the job.  George was my main contact (contractor) and communication throughout this whole episode.  He was at the mercy of where Panda was scheduling him and most of the time they just pulled him off my job to send him out of town.  This, in part, was why it took 5 months to install a french door. 
A few months back I could not lock my door.  The alarm was not reinstalled (because the construction was incomplete).  So in order to leave the house I had to rig my door and push a table against the door so my wife and I could go to work.  They sent a repair guy who took apart the entire door, glass, frame.  As a result, the door was now scraping against the threshold and you could see the backside of the raw wood when you looked through the window.  Now the lock was not aligned, so I couldn't put the (outside)  key to the door to unlock it.  They were going to give me a new door handle to resolve the issue, but after 5 WEEKS of calling every Wednesday, I finally lost it when I kept hearing, \"it's not done yet with the powder coating\"
This led to my final straw this past week, with Panda.  For a 4 day period, I could not open up this french door no matter what I did.  Keep in mind that my outside key still didn't work.  Obviously the lack of urgency on replacing the door handle, led to this door falling apart. 
I agressively had to chase Jennyfer Woods, so called VP of sales.  Typical sales person,, once she sells you something, and collects your money, she's not interested in anything else at that point.  Just move on to the next victim. door not open.She said she assumed everything was ok, as of a March email from one of her workers. As I told her, if she would've returned my calls or emails, she could've done better than an assumption off an email from someone else. She seemed receptive and told me her engineer Tad and someone else, would be coming by the next day to check all the issues. The next day quickly changed.  George intercepted the visit from the engineer and he said he would be by in a few days.  To me that was a huge slap in the face.  Its like me, as a restaurant owner, getting a complaint about a server and I resolve the issue with the guest at the table,  but renege on my promise and have the same server go back to the table. Then the server tells them they will take care of their issue, and there was no need to involve anyone else. 
George did finally come through on this.  He took both doors apart, glass, frame, handle.... and fixed all the but a few minor issues.  He's expected back today to complete it all.  YAY!! I've reached my 5 month episode  with Alf and Ralph on Green Acres. (if you're younger than 50, its worth the You Tube search)
Hope no one goes through what I did.  It's not worth it.  This company is horrendous!!!"}
{"text":"Stephen Keller has been a huge help and guide from day one when I reached out to Panda, all the way up until now. We have ordered doors for multiple homes we are building and designing. He has spearheaded any issue that we have had or that has come up and got it handled with ease every time. He has been very informative during the beginning stages and continues to be throughout. We look forward to working with Stephen and Panda moving forward for a long time. Thank you Stephen and Panda!"}
{"text":"Do not order doors from this company under any circumstances. After they received my payment of $13k they stopped returning my calls. The door panels I finally received were not operable and after a year of threatening legal action via voicemail, I finally received only 2 replacement panels that were even worse than the originals. The engineering on their product is second rate and I would avoid them at all costs!"}
{"text":"I am remodeling and expanding my home and decided after shopping around to go with Panda for a large folding door and a large folding window.  I was very concerned after reading some of the reviews but happy to say my experience was absolutely perfect.  My sales rep. Stephen Keller was awesome, responsive via email and phone at all times.  Answered all my questions honestly and quickly.  I emailed him all the time and did question the bad reviews but he was very open about it. I am glad I went with an installer he recommended.  Christian the installer was very quick, experienced and professional. My doors were ready on time and installed when scheduled. I had no issues with shipment the driver helped unload them.  I love both the door and window very much and are exactly what I pictured.  My home is almost finished.  I will share some pictures once completed.  I can't wait to use them.  Thank very much for wonderful experience.  I would very much recommend Panda if your looking for folding doors or windows..."}
{"text":"Great place for all of your residential and commercial needs. Steve and the commercial team are stellar. I use them for all of my high end clients as they have stellar products. I highly recommend these guys."}
{"text":"I live in Northern Florida. Had three sets of custom collapsible patio doors installed about 5 years ago. I  recently developed a problem with one of the lower hinges on the doors. I called Panda and spoke with Katelyn who asked me to send pictures to better understand the problem. I was fully expecting I would need to pay for replacement parts but was informed the new parts would be covered under warranty and they were sent via UPS for free. My contractor was amazed and the new parts worked great. Great communication though out the entire process and Katelyn proactively reached out to me to make sure everything worked out OK. I was very impressed. I think if you choose Panda products you need to make sure you have a contractor that can deal with complex installs. Their products are usually custom fabricated and require precise measurements and an installer who is experienced and will not cut corners. It is easier in South Florida to find certified installers but really if u have a good contractor or someone experienced in door or window installs they call install the product correctly with the provided directions. The factory works with you to draw up design plans, confirm the final dimensions, and then ships the product for install. They were able to color match my existing doors so everything looks seamless. Innovative product that is perfect for customized design and build projects."}
{"text":"The doors are exceptional. The service in ordering was super easy and expedited when we really needed it to be. The follow up for any mechanical issues was always first rate and with follow through. I would definitely recommend Panda again to my clients."}
{"text":"2 Years from previous post still waiting for Panda to make corrections."}
{"text":"We live in Northern California and had Panda windows installed 10 years ago. First, I have to credit our installer for ensuring they followed the company's installation instructions; not taking shortcuts to save time or money. The windows are still in great condition. However, our home has settled over the years and needed maintenance and adjustments. Christian, Panda Technician, is awesome! He is very knowledge and professional. He worked on all eight windows and they perform like the first day we had them installed. I would hire Christian again."}
