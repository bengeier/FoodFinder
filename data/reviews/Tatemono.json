{"text":"Mango crab roll is very sour and there's lots of hard mango fibers in it. Mango salad looks pitiful. Peppered beef is kinda tough to chew. No menu for dessert. Disappointing compared to other AYCE places."}
{"text":"Really good food and really good service. The noodles and fried rice are the best I've ever had - and my boyfriend loves their sushi more than anywhere else.  The waitstaff are always around and the service is really fast every time I've been there. They're very good at accommodating large groups. The iPad system is genius."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and was willing to pay the high prices for the good food, but things change and quite frankly their sushi is no longer worth the ridiculous prices charged. I suggest Oishi Maki or Shogun, both close with extremely tasty food. Sorry for the negative review guys, but you really disappointed me with my last visit."}
{"text":"Great food, servers that are on top of the little things (drink refills, plate clearing, etc), this is one of the best All You Can Eat sushi places.  Check out their White Dragon Roll as well as favourites like the Spider and Rainbow Rolls!"}
{"text":"New place with a cool interior design (check out the wall of chopsticks near the washrooms). Service was pretty decent. Sushi and tempura were very tasty. I tried 5 different types of maki rolls and I liked all except for the Smoked Salmon Philadelphia roll which was a bit too salty for my taste. The shrimp and yam tempura were hot and crispy. Just the way I like em! They have all you can eat, but it's cheaper to order from the regular menu."}
{"text":"I fell in LOVE with this place a few months ago while out with friends. I always get asked to go for sushi and I am not particularly a fan of sushi. What I like about this place is not only that it is auce (all you can eat) but that they offer a variety of other items on their menu. Now I am able to \"go out for sushi\" and still find dishes I like to eat. The food is always hot and fresh. I have only ever been for lunch and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Rude staff!when we requested a adjacent table the staff who  seated  us told us in a rude tone of voice to wait  outside. I didn't complain at the request of my  daughter daughter. sushi was good though.I would never go back to Tatemono restaurant in Whitby. Sacha."}
{"text":"Good food and surprisingly good prices for something in the AMC plaza. The wait staff has been a little too eager every time i've been here--snatching empty plates and refilling water voraciously. If you like that kind of prompt service; then definitely check it out! If you are looking to have a private conversation, you may want to look elsewhere. The interior decor (and washrooms) is gorgeous."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place for sushi!  I have eaten at many sushi restaurants over the years but few are as good as here. The food is always delicious and the service is excellent!  I would definitely come back here again and would not hesitate to recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Love the ordering process and pictures of what you get on an ipad. Great idea! Eat it all."}
{"text":"I never expected to find such a good Jap restaurant in Whitby, but lord behold...  Value:  Outstanding. $14.95 for Mon-Thurs lunch buffet.  And their selection of food on the menu is staggering.  The main focus is on Japanese food, but it extends out to some Chinese and Thai.  Sushi, Noodles, Stir-Fry, Kasu, etc... tea and soft drinks are also included, as are icecream for dessert.  Quality:  Besides a couple of odd fried frozen items (like fried scallops & fried calamari), everything else was made fresh and to order.  Maki rolls were awesome, as were the sushi.  Garlic steak and beef wrapped green onions were outstanding.  Tempuras were pipping hot and crispy.  Service:  Very friendly and attentive.. and pretty quick too.  I can't say anything really bad.. even the location is good (free parking, in a big plaza).. so they get my 5-stars."}
{"text":"GREAT food for all you can eat! Even their dessert selection was amazing. I highly recomment this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very friendly to customers. I went there for an order of takeout. The staff there not only invited me to sit there to check out the menu, but also served me a cup of tea while I was waiting for my order. When I consulted the store manager on the portion size to order, he was very forthcoming and did not try to sell more than I needed. Overall I'm very satisfied with this restaurant and would highly recommend this to business travelers who is looking for a good dinning experience at the town of Whitby."}
{"text":"Not worth the money at all. It cost about $70 total for two people all you can eat for dinner.  The chicken in everything I got was really cool poor quality. The beef was also pretty bad.the sushi rolls they had were decent but not worth how much I had to spend. I had to get up to fill my own water multiple times because the waiters were not very good.  I had heard really good things about the place but was rather disappointed.  It is a nice looking restaraunt with decent food, but it really shouldn't cost so much for just average to below average sushi.  I would just go to a cheaper place and save money. You are basically just paying to be in a fancy looking place and getting average food."}
{"text":"Tatemono is much better than their restaurant in Oshawa (Kakemono). The food was hot and delicious, and service was very good. The only disappointment was that they were a bit slow at times, which was because it was a bit busy and they are newly opened. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This has become my official favourite all-you-can-eat sushi spots. Stunning interior design paired with a streamlined menu of amazing (and fresh) cuisine. The sushi is perfection and passed the flavour test. You can tell the fish hasn't been frozen then thawed. Blech!  A little more expensive than their sister-restaurant, Kakemono, it's well worth the few dollar difference.   Bring your date here if they're sushi lovers. They'll be impressed."}
{"text":"Seriously a disgrace  Price: At $20 for allucaneat lunch (incl. tax + tip) it is roughly $4 more expensive than any other sushi place in Whitby.   Food: Friend had teriyaki chicken which he enjoyed and short ribs (very, very tough) and wings which he didn't. I had golden California rolls (greasy), crab sushi (okay), and a variety of other sushi. Most of it was bearable but  flooded with roe, too much nori and avocado. Also, fish wasn't too fresh, snapper was musty.  Service: Annoying rule of one sheet per table, slow wait staff. (left $2 tip on $50 tab)  Atmosphere: Nice d√©cor, terrible music."}
{"text":"Great sushi but overly expensive. Nice atmosphere and you get a menu on an iPad. They are quiet, slow service and kind of on the fancier side . I'm in love with their cheese wontons so I keep returning but there are cheaper places around."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Called twice for order.The guy put the phone down and left me hanging for 4 minutes! I could hear them laughing but they would not take my order. I will not try again!"}
{"text":"There is not too much to say about the food here as it is a typical AYCE in terms of flavour. The one thing I really like what that they had sashimi during their lunch menu. The sashimi is ok in taste...but the option is nice if you don't want rice.  Huge drawbacks were $1.99/person charge for tea. I find that insanely high since its very close to cafe prices. Lunch is pretty expensive already at $19/person and it wouldn't be too hard to include tea...  The service is very slow. We ended up getting hungry waiting in between orders.  Overall, just an average place."}
{"text":"Not much variety.  Very Slow customer service  Overpriced compared to what you can get from other places."}
{"text":"Updating my review - they have stepped up their service by hiring a lot more servers and their food comes out fresh and fast. It's always busy here now and I'm happy they've improved everything. My favourite sushi restaurant in Durham."}
{"text":"Bad food, taste spoil. The pork is rotted, we ask the server about it but the answer is they force us to finish all the rotted food, because it's all you can eat and we are wasting the food.  And, most of the food are frozen not fresh, you feel it in your mouth. Not recommend and not going back, in any stores in their chain.  Bad experienced."}
{"text":"Go to sushi mountain in Whitby, Quality is so much better but cheaper. Food is okay at this restaurant, you order your dishes using the iPad, drinks are extra cost for all you can eat. I like sushi mountain in Whitby much better than this place tho."}
{"text":"Me and my family didn't even get to eat here! The blonde hostess wasn't even friendly, she came off rude! I'm not sure how she even managed to get that job she didn't even look like she wanted to be there. We ended walking out and finding another place!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. They have a variety of fish and meat to choose from along with sushi. My favourite is the salmon and beef! I much prefer to dine here than other AYCE places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food quality is great. Decor is awesome, very modern with high ceilings. Deserts at the end are a nice touch, a wider desert selection then your average sushi restaurant. Points for that one.   We had the standard all you can eat menu at about 2 in the afternoon on a Friday. Decent customer turnout, all the staff staying very busy.   We'll definitely come back, a nice location to know about that's in a major Whitby venue."}
{"text":"Food lacked flavour and freshness.  The only shining light was Basil Chicken. However it was cold.  Food came fast and furious."}
{"text":"The sushi here was okay, not particularly special or great and it was rather expensive for all you can eat dinner. There wasn't anything special on the menu.   Good place if you are just going to hang out with friends. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Good ambience for families and groups. Good menu and options to find. Fresh sashimi and short list of desserts."}
{"text":"So we happened to be nearby, I looked up what was close and chose this place. It's in a plaza that looks to be pretty much only other restaurants, so I figured it must be good to be able to keep up with the competition. We went in and were surprised by the very elegant and tastefully appointed decor! If you wanted to impress a date (who'd never know it was AYCE), bring her here! The price was right, we were seated at an elegant booth, the server left us with an ipad to order. We chose our food and entered it and waited. And waited....I finally asked what the delay was and unfortunately, we hadn't been told that after we submit our order, we have to summon the server to send it into the kitchen. She quickly did so and our fresh, hot, made-to-order food came quickly. Tastefully displayed, flavourful and excellent service (apart from previously mentioned oversight)! The bathrooms are GORGEOUS! This place is a hidden gem. I wish there was one closer to the city. It's nice to go to an AYCE place and not feel like you're being served in a hectic gymnasium. We had the mushrooms (really good), tempura shrimp (also good), beef skewers (ditto), yam sushi and a few other dishes. This is a good system, food arrives fresh and hot and unlike other AYCE restaurants, you don't end up getting things you didn't order/orders from other tables. I want to go back here soon! Very satisfying experience!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places in N.A. I come here every time I'm in the Whitby area and the fish always tastes fresh and the sushi is well prepared. They have a good selection of apps, entrees, soups, etc. I believe they have 4 restaurants in the Toronto area and they all seem to follow the same concept. The only complain with this place is that the staff can be okay. They're running around trying to deliver the orders to the table and sometimes you don't get much attention, but overall it's fine."}
{"text":"Here's an oriental restaurant that is located outside of any GTAs oriental hot spots but still delivers a pretty solid product.   Located inside a big \"restaurant mall\", this place a lot of competition. They have to perform. And for the most part, they do.  I remember the food to be good (not out-of-this-world fantastic but still good). It felt like it was a bit on the pricey side but not outrageous."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants around.  Definitely has the best decor and ambience of any I have been to.  The food is excellent and I have never had anything from the menu that I didn't like.  The sushi and sashimi are always very fresh tasting.  And just a note about the comment that the reviewer patty k made.  Sushi fish and sashimi is ALWAYS frozen and then thawed.  It is required by law, due to the fact that fish do sometimes contain parasites and the temperature that the fish is frozen at kills any parasites that there may be.  Anyway, the prices are on the higher end for AYCE sushi in Durham Region, $25 for dinner, but is totally worth the price.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tatemono is located in the large AMC Plaza near Thickson Road in Whitby and is the sister to Makimono, which can be found in both Ajax and Pickering.  I came here with my friend for my birthday dinner as I just moved to Whitby and wanted to find a good sushi joint to start going to. As noted above, Tatemono is the sister to Makimono so just about everything on the AYCE menu is on Tatemono's. And then a whole pile more! I was soooo surprised to see that Tatemono's menu has a number of Thai dishes and Chinese dishes to try out. And they're all reasonably sized so you can try a bit of everything.  Some of the new things I tried on this visit (and the following visit two weeks later) were the coconut shrimp, super crispy with a nice sweet coconut sauce, garlic shrimp, almost a stir fry style with lots of veggies and chicken balls, little tiny ones, so cute! Everything was super tasty and all of the sushi was up to par with the normal standards at Makimono.  Now service here has varied the few times I've come - my friend asked for a bottle of Blue and she had noooo idea what he was talking about. And he pointed to the menu item and everything and she still didn't quite get it. We were surprised when she came back with the right beer. We do get some things brought to us that are wrong, whether the waitresses can't read the menus or the kitchen can't read the orders is beyond me but it happens every time we go.  The upsides to this particular resetaurant is definitely the expanded menu and the atmosphere. It's a much nicer feeling place than Makimono, feels a little more upscale and a little more private even if you're not in a booth.  Overall, Tatemono was a great surprise and I'll continue to come back here and enjoy. Beware service at AYCE restaurants is never amazing so don't have high expecations there!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went yesterday and ordered the all you can eat dinner for $30 each.  The service was prompt and friendly but that is where the positive about this place stops. The food ranged from average to gross. The sashimi did not taste fresh at all. I had salmon, mackerel, squid, surf clam and unagi.  The unagi had a fishy taste.  We also had salad, udon, edamame, and dynamite rolls. These were all average. I can't think of a single one of these I wanted to order again except the udon which was average at best. We usually order a la carte from Makimono in Pickering which is ok so I expected this place would be similar in quality. I was pretty surprised how bad it was given the price. I also usually know a sushi place is bad if my stomach gets upset while I am still in the restaurant."}
{"text":"So we came in tonight and we're given the lunch menu even after asking why the options were limited.  They never answered.  So we filled up on the lunch menu (15.99) but have been charged 27.99 each because they can't change the price now!  Vincent the uncaring manager did nothing but call me a liar for the situation.    I eat here 4-5 times a month with work and will be no more.  Absolutely atrocious customer service.    Tatemono should be ashamed."}
{"text":"We opted to not go AYCE which is always a good idea when you have a 2.5 hour movie after.   Here's a tip if you order a dynamite roll for $6.99 just get one order if you are average hungry as the rolls are HUGE!  About twice the size of the AYCE version.  We also had the $12 bento which they forgot to bring the Miso soup and salad and didn't know what type of fish they were serving.  Service today was also pretty slow given that they were not that busy."}
{"text":"First time here. Amazing service. Everyone was all smiles and the food arrived so fast. Presentation was beautiful and huge portions for the prices. Quality of food was perfect. Couldn't have asked for anything better. However, noticed the hygiene in the prep area could have been better. Person making sushi blew his nose in a tissue and proceeded to make sushi without washing his hands. Saw a waitress rinse her mouth and spit in a sink by the front area. Kind of put a damper on the meal we ate. Yuck."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this all you can eat buffet and it is great if you like sushi and salmon. I would go with an empty stomach because it fills you up really fast. The place looks real nice and the food is great tasting."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and we will definitely be coming back the service was great especially for how busy the restaurant was the food came very quickly and was very tasty and flavourful and the price was fair for the amount of food which we ate  I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time to avoid a long wait. We did and I saw many people waiting for a table so I was happy that we booked Ahead of time.   The date of our visit was Saturday, January 21, 2017"}
{"text":"A little above average for an all you can eat in Durham. Nothing too spectacular but the food seems fresh which is always important for raw fish. Seems a little pricy for lunch but I guess that is because you get sashimi in the menu. Selection seems ok but could have more compared to other places in the GTA.   The service is a little on the slow side, had to wait a long time during the lunch hour rush. Our group was there for 1.5hr and it seems like not all the food can arrive in that time. Surprisingly the tempura actually took long.   The staff are actually Chinese so I gues it is a Chinese owned Japanese restaurant (not uncommon)"}
{"text":"There hasn't been any real notable sushi joints in east durham.  Then I found out about Tatemono (thanks Yelp).  You have to drive a bit further down the 401 to reach Tatemono, but for you Oshawa, Whitby, and Pickering folk, no longer will you have to make a long journey to find a quaint restaurant selling some good sushi.  I won't say its the best sushi I've ever had, but I can say its the best I've had in the area.  They have a big menu, but sticking with sushi, they make all the notable signature rolls you often find in other establishments.  The maki tasted fresh and was average sized portions.  The sashimi pieces were enormous though.  Actually, maybe too big?!  I had to half each piece by itself.  Maybe they were feeling generous that day.  The signature rolls were a bit larger than what I've had in most other places;  I had the dragon roll in particular, everything was just delicious, though somehow especially the shrimp.  The pricing is a little bit more expensive, and by a little I mean $1-2 max on some items, by comparison to my regular sushi joints.  Considering the portion sizes that I got, I would say I got tremendous value.  The staff I experienced were patient and friendly.  All in all, I would definitely eat here again the next time I'm in Whitby.  And so should you!"}
{"text":"In the mood for some good Japanese cuisine Tatemono pops into my head and I instantly need to fulfill my craving.  Came in on Saturday night around 6pm and the restaurant is starting to fill up. The hostess asks if we want the AYCE or regular menu. I never order the AYCE here .... maybe I will one day but for now Regular menu it is.  ***So Update - The last time I was here the water tasted like poison HOWEVER I have to say it tasted muchhhh better now and props to Tatemono for adding lemon to the water as well.  I know I want a Bento Box (more bang for your buck) so I instantly flip to that section of the menu. I decide to go with Bento Box D which also comes with miso soup, salad, rice and fruits.  BENTO BOX D $13.49 2 pcs shrimp and 5 pcs vegetable tempura,  1 pcs tuna sashimi, 2 pcs salmon sushi, 3 pcs California roll, 3 pcs gyoza,  Choice of teriyaki salmon, chicken or beef   I love the salad here it's served ice cold and the lettuce is always fresh and crispy and by far the best dressing at any asian resto I've ever tasted!  Next comes out the sushi portion of the bento box which is plated separately. California rolls are prefect, salmon sushi fresh as it comes and the tuna sashimi equally fresh with no fishy taste.  And then my heavenly bento box arrives. I decide to go with the beef teriyaki. I love that they ask you how you would like your beef cooked. Out it comes a heaping pile of beef cooked perfectly medium rare in that delicious teriyaki glaze not too sweet loved every bite.  The tempura this time was soo crispy as were the gyozas perfectly cooked.  We also decided to order an appetizer of Beef Skewers (3pc) - Skewered beef tenderloin glazed w/ teriyaki sauce The beef was really tender and delicious but had I realized we were getting such an ample portion of beef in our bento box I would have skipped this.  Overall a fantastic meal! Service here is really good as all the waiters circle around and are able to assist you at anytime. They are always good at removing plates and keeping your glasses full. Portions here are huge which is why I don't feel the need to order off the AYCE menu. I definitely will be back the next time my Japanese cravings strike!"}
