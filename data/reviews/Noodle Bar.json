{"text":"I was only in town for one day. Stop by the Noodle Bar....the spicy miso was excellent.  Great taste and flavor! !!!!the egg added that extra punch!!!!!  Love it..."}
{"text":"I love spicy miso ramen! I am a very picky eater when it comes to ramen, and I can say hands down every visit to the noodle bar is outstanding. From the noodles, to the broth and lastly the spicy kick in your face. Whenever I'm craving ramen, or friends ask where to go - I always make the trek to downtown."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the management is very nice. We went on a cloudy windy day and the ramen soups were just the thing we needed. We tried a couple appetizers, a couple soups and a couple dry noodle dishes, everything tasted great. There was a mix up due to which our order got delayed by quite a bit but the manager gave us a very generous discount along with a few freebies for the next time without us having to ask for it."}
{"text":"I truly had an awesome birthday dinner here. Jonas was our waiter and he really took care of us. The chef prepared a special dessert for me to celebrate my birthday. I truly felt special. I had the Yaki Soba and it was very tasteful for a vegetarian dish. I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the Spicy Miso, which was off the hook. Large portions with fresh ingredients. I can't wait until the next time I visit this place again. The atmosphere was really cool and so inviting and the staff was very attentive. The manager David Green brought us out several different  appetizers to try and all of them were so tasty. He was very knowledgeable of the menu, which was very helpful, since I had never tried real Ramen before. Our server Lucky was very friendly and was always making sure we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meals. He made sure our drinks were never empty. If you have never tried this spot, I highly recommend that you do. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is great! Noodles, noodles, noodles! They have both Ramen and Italian pasta dishes which is great if you and your date can't decide on what to eat lol. I had Hakata Ramen which was delicious and I look forward to trying all the other ones."}
{"text":"Wish this place was closer to my home.  We have been a few times and LOVE the Hakata Ramen.  There are other items I would love to try, but cannot get past the Ramen.  Guess I need to drive across town more often."}
{"text":"Nice place and nice service. I don't know was it me or the food were really salty. I couldn't even finish my spicy miso ramen bowl. Ate only  of the portion, the appetizer was really salty too. My other 3 friends couldn't finish their bowls of  ramen, neither."}
{"text":"Located near the 111 building Noodle Bar is super convenient for lunch and dinner. There are two sides to the menu: Italian and Japanese inspired. The ramen always hits the spot but the Italian food is lacking in flavor. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is always lively. The place is kept very clean and is never too busy during the day. They offer a small selection of beer and wine to go along with the food. They also do takeout, but it can take sometimes as long as it would to sit and eat so I would recommend ordering ahead of time so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in The Valley. That being said the exhaustion system must be broken, it smells delicious but really strong inside. Left the place reading of stir fry. The place was calm but the server took quite a while to come. The busser took our order. They were both very nice though. I would come back."}
{"text":"Been here for many times now. So good. You can really taste how homemade everything is. Always order their miso noodle soap. My favorite noodle place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was ahhhhhmazing! The food was delicious accompanied with some awesome draft beers but the best part was our server Jonas he had a great personality and made us feel more like we were at a friends house than in public! Overall such a great experience!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I ordered the Abura Soba, which is one of their \"specialty noodles\". I went during my lunch break from work and ordered it to-go because it was a gloomy day and it was beginning to sprinkle outside. I didn't want to get caught in the rain so as soon as I got my food, I headed back to my building. To my surprise, when I opened up the box at my desk, the Abura Soba turned out to be bland noodles with charred, blackened pork. It was so burnt, my co workers could smell it from 15ft away. It looked like leftover meat that had been scraped off the grill and dumped all over noodles, like trash. Never have I been so insulted with my food. How can they serve this poor excuse of a dish to customers? I wouldn't even feed it to my dog! I regret not opening the box while I was still inside the restaurant. I would've demanded a refund. Waste of $10.50."}
{"text":"Their house noodles (not Italian more like Thai) were amazing! You can spice them to your liking with chili oil provided. Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is nestled in between two historic, native-Arizonan cement buildings in the heart of Phoenix. This hidden gem uses minimal signage, so patrons will need to be aware of their surroundings to locate it. (SIDE NOTE: There is no outdoor space at this time, but I was informed that the owners are looking to create an outdoor seating area along with a full bar inside at some point in the future.) Upon walking in, guests are greeted by a sleek, modern hostess stand. The restaurant is divided into three sections: individual bar-like seating, open booth/chair seating in the main dinning area, and a smaller, more secluded dinning room just off the entrance. The colors are unique and inviting--a concoction of red, ivory, and black-- fitting for the Japanese/Italian blend as well as the Copenhagen-style furniture.  Guests are welcome to watch the chefs through the glass partitions that partially surround the dinning areas. Although the ambiance of the restaurant is fabulous, the bathrooms are less impressive. They are dated and appear to be shared with the other restaurants nearby.  This is due to the fact that the building is older and has a unique layout. It is my understanding that the restaurant recently under went renovations, which is apparent by the new furniture and  missing tile in the ceiling above my table (neither of which detracted from the experience). The waitstaff were very pleasant and knowledgeable. My waiter made very good recommendations and knew the menu quite well. The music was a bit off for the vibe of the restaurant, but still enjoyable. The hours of operation seemed to cater to the amount of foot traffic the restaurant might get, so it's a great spot for the weekly blue collars and weekend night owls. Overall, I give the setting 4/5 stars.   As for the food, I purchased the Gyoza (potstickers), Curry Ramen, Green Tea Ice Cream. The Gyoza, albeit delicious, were pretty small. I'm used to larger potstickers. However, the taste and price (especially) were amazing and well worth it. The ramen was recommended by my waiter. It was phenomenal.  It had a fantastic blend of spiciness, sweetness with a pleasant after taste.  The ginger and sesame seeds really played down the kick of the curry. The noodles were a little too al dente for my liking, but were well made and delicious once they soaked in the pork broth for a few extra minutes. The beef was slightly well done, but again, tenderized after sitting in the broth. The food did come out back-to-back, so be sure to ask the waitstaff to wait on submitting your main course. The dessert was less than appetizing. I ordered the ice cream. It was very bitter and lacked any flavor. The waiter was very kind and switched it out for the Pana Cotta. The Pana Cotta was very good. They served it with fresh raspberries and julienned-mint. The portion sizes were just enough for one to enjoy. As for the Italian food, the pasta seemed to only come with tomato-based sauces, which I wasn't a huge fan of. I would like to see the restaurant add some more pesto or cream-based options to appeal to non-tomato eaters. However, I still wanted to try an Italian dish, so I purchased Lemon-Herbed Chicken for a meal tomorrow (again, per the waiter's recommendation).  If it is anything like the ramen, then I am sure it will be wonderful! I would give the food 4/5 stars.  Overall, I had a great experience and would surely go back with friends, family, and visitors. Kudos. Overall experience: 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"Never in 40 years have I walked out of a restaurant. Waited 15 mins after being seated and servers looking at me but no one comes up to say anything. Once I stood up I finally got attention but to late I left been there several times before but only takes once to be treated that poorly to lose my business for good."}
{"text":"This place is the best of both worlds. I got a bowl of spicy miso ramen (hey, it's September and 99 degrees out... #arizonanative) and my husband got a pasta bowl. Both were super delish and pricing wasn't too terrible. Nice little quick date night before a concert or night out. We'll definitely be back next time we're downtown this winter for more bowls of ramen!"}
{"text":"First time here today.  Ordered 3 things: Spicy marriage (cold dish. Sliced beef tendon and beef). Sauces ok. Potion size ok.   Wuhan style noodle (re gan mian. ???). Bad. Doesn't taste like it at all. It is totally Beijing style noodles in bean sauce (???). When inquired, servers said it's their style of re gan mian. Misleading to say the least.   Noodles in lamb soup. Lamb not so tender. Flavour ok."}
{"text":"I found this on Yelp so I thought I'd try it. Wow. I don't have a ramen place like this in my town, but I sure wish I did. It was absolutely delicious and I hated that there was so much food I couldn't finish it all. I had the Brussel sprout appetizer, and it was also good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Looking fo a place for a bit before a shoe. Found this place. Had the hakata ramen. Delicious! Not too spicy. Also had the cucumbers for happy hour which is great. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Try the Japanese sausage & the pickled cucumber salad to start. You can never go wrong with Ramen anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go, I had the spicy pork and noodle miso which was awesome !! I just found a new place to bring my friends !!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place. Servers were incredibly knowledgeable about the dishes and the location is perfect"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. Food is consistent. Customer service is good. I really do enjoy the flavor of the ramens. Clean place."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, the menu sounded delicious. I took my friend there for her birthday lunch and we were so disappointed. We both ordered the Sapporo chicken ramen and it was so tasteless. $20 later for two tasteless meals, if I go back I would try something else. The staff was quick and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice."}
{"text":"The food and service was delicious. The broth for the ramen I got was perfect! Can't wait to come back and try other varieties. My husband got the fettuccine alfredo and loved it too. So much so I didn't even get a taste ;-)"}
{"text":"Zero gluten free meals! They waited 45 minutes to tell me and only told me after they brought everyone's meals at my table. I had to watch everyone eat. Obviously, just really poor service and the server didn't even care I told her I am gluten free. I'm allergic so it's not a choice."}
{"text":"Food really good - unique selection of both Japanese and Italian noodles/pastas. I didn't try anything Italian. Ramen and fried chicken appetizer were both great. Nice wine/beer selection. They made a mistake on my order so I had to wait a very long time and ended up getting my dinner for free!  Otherwise I would have given five stars. In town for a meeting only for a few days otherwise I would definitely go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about noodle bar!Delicious food, great service and they have a killer wine selection!"}
{"text":"I was visiting and Came here because of raving reviews. I was hungry and craving for some good ramen.  Right when my family walked in the door, I met eyes with several employees then they all looked away as if they had other important things to do like wiping the tables and utensils.  Still stuck around, though I shouldn't have, to try out the noodles. I forgot what I ordered but No doubt that it was THE Saltiest ramen or food (for that matter) I have ever had! Being Korean, I am used to eating spicy and salty foods.. my first instinct was not to yell and spit it out. I think I might as well just shove a handful coarse sea salt in my mouth.  I asked my husband if his was good and his answer was \"salty.\" We pretended like we were really thirsty and asked for more water, poured every single drop into our noodles. That still wasn't enough and so I had to pretend like my baby needed some water for his formula. Even then it was still thirsty. I have never lied at a restaurant to not offend anyone til that day.  I really cannot comprehend how this place got really good reviews....? It is mind boggling!!!  Maybe because there aren't that many authentic Asian restaurants in Arizona? Or maybe their taste buds have all melted away from hot weathers?? Or maybe I am just spoiled with good, authentic ramen in California. I really don't know..it will remain as a mystery for me...forever. It's   Kinda sad to see all these people praising this place because that just tells me that they really haven't had good, authentic ramen."}
{"text":"I just finished having an amazing meal with prompt & Polite service. Spicy miso Ramen was outstanding."}
{"text":"While the restaurant is well located and decor is welcoming, the ramen here was sadly bland and not the quality we've come to expect from noodle shops over the past 5 years. I had the Takana ramen and the tonkatsu broth had no depth of flavor. The noodles were watery and a bit mushy. I did enjoy the pickled bamboo and mushroom slices included. The vegan ramen was also ordered and the miso broth was also bland and lacked completeness.  Hopefully it was just an off night, but definitely one of my least favorite ramen dining experiences in the past couple years in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cute place that I really wanted to like but service wasn't impressive! The waitress served us the wrong dish and when we pointed it out, said insisted that is what we ordered and didn't offer to correct it!  There is a pretty big difference in Chicken Jakisoba vs Lemon Herb Fettuccine especially when you don't like Fettuccine. I would suggest trying one of the many other great restaurants DT and bypass this one! Hopefully they will get better service because they do have a  good concept!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour Gyoza and pork fried rice. Yaki Soba noodles were between under done and burnt in some spots but the flavor was good and veggies were very fresh. Shoyu Ramen was good but a little eggy. Love the idea of this place and would return to try other noodle dishes - perhaps Italian next time.  Good music playing."}
{"text":"What a great concept! All the dishes I've tried so far are wonderful. I've lived downtown for 3 1/2 years and this place is a great addition to the downtown restaurant scene. If you live downtown you have to try this food. If you work downtown you have to try this food. If you want good healthy food you have to try this food."}
{"text":"The ramen was super salty and my friend's pasta was super flavorless. Service needs a little improvement too."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and found this place on yelp. Glad i did because it was really delicious. The ramen broth was great and the cucumber salad (i cant remember what its called on the menu) was really refreshing, with a little bit of heat. Service was really good too. Attentive and quick. If Im back in town, I'll definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"These guys have really worked out the kinks since they opened. To be honest, I have never tried the pasta items and only come for the Ramen. I love having a decent Ramen joint walking distance from the apartment and on my last ten visits Noodle bar has been constantly tasty and on point. Would recommend for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I hope this restaurant makes it.  More like it are needed in downtown Phoenix.  But there's a major issue - service.  Been there several times and hostess is at best dismissive and at worst hostile.  Why would you have someone so disinterested in customers be their first contact?  Waiter service is slow and often confused.  They don't know their stations (first no one takes order and then 2 come up minutes apart) and do not have a good grasp of the menu.  In general, I get the feeling I'm inconveniencing everyone by bothering to come in and order their food.  But, the food is good."}
{"text":"This was a last minute stop for dinner. I walked in and was greeted by a single server working all of the tables in the restaurant. He sat me down and promptly took my drink order. As soon as he returned with my drink he was able to take my food order. It was working the whole place like a pro. The food came out, spicy ramen. Talk about amazing. I highly recommend this as a lunch or dinner stop while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"8/25 UPDATE: updated from 2 stars to 4 stars. As mentioned, despite my last bad experience I really wanted to like this place and thought it had potential. So, we went back today. What a difference! We didn't order any appetizers today, so cant compare that experience to last time, but we did order 2 spicy miso ramens, which came in less than 10 minutes, fast! And the ramen was just as delicious as last time, and I appreciate consistency. The server was very attentive, friendly and checked on us as needed. I left with a happy belly and a smile! I'd like to think they read my last review and had a pow wow to fix all the in-house service and kitchen issues, but maybe it was a really bad day? Regardless I am happy that I went back and was able to update this review!    I truly dislike writing neutral/negative reviews, but this time I have to, and I hope management sees it and can work out the kinks for future guests, because this place has all the potential and I really want to like it. Nice greeting at welcome and quickly sat. Server friendly. Clean, nice ambiance. But after our order -- ALL downhill from there. I have only two good things to say about the place. Server was nice, and she recommended the Spicy ramen was really good. Broth, presentation, portion, spice level, chashu, noodles - all good.   My 3 friends got shoyu, hakata, and Sapporo ramen. Sadly all the ramens except for the spicy miso were sub par to not good. We all let each other try each one. Miso was the clear winner and all others, losers. We ordered appetizers -- karaage chicken and gyoza, which took more than 25 minutes to arrive!!! And mind you the place was not busy at all and plenty of wait staff, and hello these are fried foods, quick prep right?. Karaage was yummy, however gyoza was terrible. Small in size and all sides drenched with oil like deep fried versus fried and partially steamed -- usually Gyoza is cooked flat side down with some oil and the rest naturally steams. Their gyoza was like deep fried and gross.   Ramen then took an additional 20 mins AFTER we finished eating our appetizers (not after delivery). Also ordered my spicy ramen with extra bak choi of which was not in the ramen when it arrived and then they said oh we don't serve that anymore. Not the servers fault, spmene should have told her. And then I was also charged for it, and had to ask server to take it off the bill. Honest mistake ano big deal, but after everything during our experience it didn't help the situation.   Also my friend who ordered hakata said noodles over cooked/soggy and then when his bill came he was charged more than what the menu had stated. He politely asked why and they said oh we're going through price change and it's not reflected on the menu. Like really????   I asked everyone their opinions after we left and ALL said they would not come back, but was better than making cup o' noodle at he hotel, which doesn't say much lol. Me personally, I would come back for the spicy miso ramen, errr maybe just phone order and takeout, they stilll have a lot to figure out regarding operations inside the restaurant.   But again my only positive, I think they made the spicy miso ramen really yummy, and it's apparent from the Yelp photos and reviews that it's a favorite. In glad I tried it. However, service, quality of the other ramens, their kitchen working with ANY sense of urgency to deliver food in a timely manner (totally unacceptable) menu price discrepancies, and kitchen/mngmnt communication with staff about what they carry or don't carry in regards to ingredients they offer, PLEASE THIS ALL NEEDS MUCH IMPROVEMENT. I hope they can address these issues. Our airline crews layover here everyday and we are always sharing with each other where to eat (and where not to). I want to recommend this place to them but will have to be honest about our experience. I think the place and staff means well, and these are easy fixes, but def need to be addressed. Again my recommendation to fellow yelpers, just order spicy miso ramen and chicken karaage for takeout."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to go to Noodle Bar based on the good reviews but maybe these people have never been to a good ramen place before.   Their hostess had zero idea what she was doing considering there were three parties, including my fiancé and I, all 4 people or less waiting for a table for over 20 minutes when half of the restaurant was completely open. We ended up being sat in a table that was open before we even got there so it was confusing that we had to wait in the first place and then when she sat us she said \"sorry it's so busy\" which was laughable given only half of the place was full and multiple employees were basically standing around.   We ordered gyoza, curry ramen, and spicy miso ramen. All of which were underwhelming. My curry ramen was not flavorful at all and the piece of beef that was in it was so tough I couldn't eat it off the bone or even get it off with my fork. I ate the veggies out of it, asked to take it to go, and then we gave our leftovers to a homeless man on the walk back to our car. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This is my first time in Phoenix as business trip. I found this spot near the hotel I stayed. Stuffs are very nice , foods are good and cheap. It's like half price compare to NYC. I chilled out here every night by myself. I liked to sit at the bar, enjoy the beer and ramen. Good experience."}
{"text":"The chicken fried rice here is so delicious. I love that its down the street from work so I can stop here to grab a bite to eat for dinner!"}
{"text":"When we entered they gave us a very unweloming and rude look which didn't make us feel welcomed at all. Next they sat us in the middle of 4 families and we were so close to them and knowing the other side of the room was empty The food was okay but overall my experience was awful and the waiters were also doing there job with so much hate. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Excellent tonkatsu ramen. Good location for downtown events also. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The location is very urban and the decor was appealing, but the food was a disappointment. We were immediately sat down at a dirty table when there were plenty of clean open tables around us. The server was prompt to clean up our table upon request. We ordered the pasta bolognese and ramen hakata. The presentation of the food was on point. Food was edible, but did not meet expectations. The ramen broth was more salty and watery than rich and milky. The pasta bolognese was actually better than the ramen, but still mediocre. The bowl of ramen was pretty expensive for the small portion, especially compared to alot of other real authentic ramen restaurants."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but it was downtown so I guess that needs to be taken into consideration. Food portion in the ramen were good but not much variety on the menu. Appetizers were pricey for very little."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Came in at 1:30 on a weekday, there are a few customers there but definitely not busy. Open style kitchen looks clean and barely used.  Has a simple menu mostly covered with handwritten corrections. Majority of the dishes are lamb, which I kind of hesitated as I don't eat lamb.  Ordered Tang's Beef Noodles (small - $8.50)  Was afraid the broth would be lamby but not at all. Not too salty as other reviewers said. The broth is dark colour, a bit greasy at the top but quite light in flavouring. Love the fresh chopped cilantro for burst of flavour. Beef is tender and flavourful but kind of cold when noodles were served. Broth was piping hot which warmed them up. Noodles seemed mass machine made even though the name of the restaurant advertises handmade noodles. Kind of misleading. Noodles were soft and not soggy.  Fried Pork Fillet (3 skewers for $4.99) Not fried but is grilled pork skewers with cumin and chinese seasoning. Hot when served and meat was tender. Not too salty nor greasy.However, wondered how they served it so quickly since ordering - probably precooked then reheated. Otherwise good flavour and portion for price.  Definitely not as bad as I thought after reading the reviews.  Based on the menu they also serve hard chinese liquor (those 50-60% alc by volume ones) but didn't see any in the fridge.   Server seemed confused when I showed the Yelp checkin discount but the owner honoured it after checking with him. Apparently they don't offer the 10% discount anymore but said haven't removed it from Yelp yet"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and decided to try Noodle Bar. We had the fried chicken, gyoza, pork and chicken fried rice bowls and spicy miso ramen. Everything was so fresh and delicious! We've never tried ramen and this was awesome. Full of spice without being too spicy and so many different flavors in one bowl. Everything was so flavorful and we look forward to trying it again on our next Phoenix visit."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal yet! The  is bomb. I'm a fan of the spicy miso. Add an extra 6 min egg for only .50z - service is always really good too!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on here about this place I had to go try it out. Since it is in the neighborhood we jumped in the car and headed out. Only bad part is no free parking. Otherwise, this place is the best! We started off with the Happy Hour $4 plate of Goyoza and $3 draft beers. Then my son and I had the Spicy Miso...oh my, it was so flavorful! Only wish I had a full egg instead of half. Next time I will get extra egg and extra meat. My husband got the Yaki Soba noodles with chicken. That taste good as well, however I liked the Miso better. Can't wait to go back. I would like to try the Italian pastas next time."}
{"text":"Amazing Spicy Miso Ramen! Loved every bit of it, recently opened the vibe is amazing.   My sister had the Yaki soba which was also very delightful. All recommendations of the hostess that sat us.   Very friendly employees.   Food was so good the cook was serenaded by my friend! Lol"}
{"text":"This place used to be soooo good before they changed their menu. My favorite item was the vegetarian curry ramen - it was so delicious, but they got rid of it. Last time I was there (my third visit), I was so disappointed to find out it was no longer on the menu, but I decided to order something else (which wasn't as good as the vegetarian one). A girl and her friend sat down next to me after I ordered, she asked the waitress for the vegetarian ramen, and because they didn't have it, she and her friend left. I was with my dad at the time. He said \"one lost customer is one too many.\" Totally agree. Don't think I'd be back unless they added the vegetarian option back to the menu especially because service is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I ordered the ramen noodles. The dish was fresh and yummy.  The broth was very good. My coworkers ate the spicy dish. Both really enjoyed. We are very happy we stopped by to have lunch."}
{"text":"Really cute date spot! Had live music on Friday night and a little candle on the table. Had the curry ramen broth and food were amazing and totally aesthetic"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy miso soup, and my friend ordered the hakata. My friend really liked the broth of her soup. My spicy miso soup was not disappointing! I really like the broth and it had a right about of spiciness to it. I didn't really like the kimichi as much with the broth, I just felt like it didn't really suit the flavor. Our survivor was very attentive. I would come again!"}
{"text":"Looking for the best Ramen in town ? Look no more. The Noodle Bar has the best , most fresh Ramen in Phoenix. My husband and I enjoyed the Sapporo and the Spicy Ramen bowls. The seasoning was perfect. We stumbled upon the Noodle Bar and was pleasantly surprised. The Asst manager Jonas waited on us .  He was very friendly and just over all nice guy. He explained how the Noodle Bar was created and how the food is prepared daily. We will definitely become regulars not only because the Ramen was delicious but because of the excellent service we received from Jonas.   Thank you Jonas it was wonderful. See you soon !"}
{"text":"Amazing!! All I have to say is amazing!! Everything was incredible..from the service and atmosphere to the food everything was perfect. I had the spicy roman which is to die for. Perfect flavor and spice. Super chill atmosphere that can be a perfect afternoon lunch spot or a fancy date night. This place Comes highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had. You can tell everything is made fresh and in house. It's all quality and soooo good. I wasn't sure what to expect because I've had a lot of ramen and it's a hit or miss... but the different is real! I got the spicy miso and my boyfriend got something that started with a T! His was definitely my kind of dish. The flavors are awesome!! I will be going again."}
{"text":"This place is great, nice ambience, quick service, and the food is great. Not to mention they have super cheap beer during happy hour and normally cheap beer regularly."}
{"text":"Their Spicy Miso is on point! I love how they have a Italian and Japanese kitchen, their menu prices are perfect for the amount of food you get, and it is just like a traditional ramen bar.  Will highly recommend to anyone and will most definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Yay.  Im a fan.  Decent noodle place in Downtown phoenix in the awesome Orpheum Lofts building.  I can only speak for the ramen - definitely an interesting combo to combine italian and ramen - seems to me they should focus on one but whatever.     I like this Ramen, its good and I've been here 5 or 6 times.  Being this is in Phoenix, I am not expecting LA/SF/Tokyo level ramen, but one issue is they are pretty stingy on the meat.  I order extra meat and still its not enough."}
{"text":"I seen all the good reviews so I wanted to try this place out with a fews coworker. We were skeptical of how authentic the food would taste because the cooks are not Asian.  The restaurant wasn't busy when we got there around noon but it took a while for our foods to come out.  My coworker ordered ramen noodle and I got the chicken Yakisoba. Let just said it was not bad at all. It was actually delicious. This place is clean and environment setting was nice. I would probably come back if I get the chance."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Fast service! Great customer service!!! The soup was pretty fresh and yummy! Very quiet and clean!  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The servers were very attentive. The ambiance is perfect for a date. The food, however, didn't quite deliver. The karaage chicken was not very crispy (the yuzu aioli, however, was quite excellent), and the ramen...the presentation was beautiful, but man - the broth was so, so, so salty. Flavorful, yes, but the salt was way too overwhelming. I took a hot yoga class the next day just to sweat it all out."}
{"text":"Their dry udon noodles and soups are surprisingly awesome. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very fresh homemade pasta.   So yummy.   Cool and hipster atmosphere.  Great location downtown.   Friendly staff.   Food came quickly.   Prices are good.  I like that you can get Asian or Italian in the same place."}
{"text":"It was a lovely dinner on a Friday night. I shared the Polppetas (house meatballs....wow), Salsiccia (house sausage) and main was Vegetarian Pasta.The wait staff was very accommodating of my particular food allergies. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Location:  5 Service:  5 Menu:  2 Environment: 2 Overall:  3  Situated within walking distance of the light rail and several hotels, the Noodle Bar has an excellent location that is accessible to most.  Parking may be difficult for those driving depending on space available at the meters on the street.  Location: 5  I was warmly greeted and was able to be seated immediately.  I have a service dog and the hostess, Tecia, did not interact with her.  This is something I GREATLY appreciate!  Our server, Britney, was lively and interactive when she brought out parts of our meal.  I think both of them together did a fantastic job of creating the perfect blend of professionalism with a fun and relaxing atmosphere.  Service:  5  The menu had only a few meal selections and a robust spectrum of options for those wishing to imbibe.  I lived and worked in Japan for 6 years, and the Spicy Miso Ramen was the best ramen I have had in America.  The ramen took a long time to arrive to our table and the restaurant was mostly empty. I was surprised that they did not offer a traditional option of Shio Ramen.  I was also surprised at the thinly sliced pork which accompanied the ramen.  I did not see anyone able to order any pasta dishes.  The gyoza portion sizes were very small.  I also ordered the fried rice.  This was well prepared.  Menu: 2  The layout and environment felt like a restaurant was dropped in on something between a buffet and a cafeteria.  It was functional and did not seem noteworthy.  Environment: 2  Noodle Bar is a great place if you are looking for functional food in a functional setting.  The ramen is the best ramen I have had in America.  Visit this restaurant if you would like to eat something different in a unique, pared down dining environment.  Overall:  4"}
{"text":"Tried this out late on a Friday night, and was happy to have gone. The ramen was pretty darn good, if not mind-blowing, and the gyoza was everything I wanted except for being 300 times too small."}
{"text":"I had the tonkatsu ramen. Overall, I wasn't very impressed. It wasn't really flavorful and the portion size was on the smaller side. The atmosphere was great and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a conference. I headed to Noodle Bar because I was really craving tofu. As a vegetarian, there comes a point in your travels where you get tired of just eating carbs all the time. This was one of those times. So while my group headed to Hooters, I headed for the Noodle Bar.   It wasn't a long walk from the convention center. A pretty straight shot and was a safe walk. The inside was little but I thought very cute. I was seatly quickly and both the hostess and my waiter were friendly and attentive. I already know what I was getting, fried rice and VEGETABLE RAMEN  (Fried Tofu + Shredded Onion + Vegetables + Sesame Seeds) so I ordered right after I sat down. The portions for both were substantial and I was served quickly.  Unfortunately, the tofu ramen that I came for was lack luster. I really felt it was under seasoned and bland. I was so disappointed. So I ended up eating out all of the tofu and taking the rest back to the hotel as leftovers. It ended up sitting in my mini-fridge for the next three days then hitting the garbage on my way to the airport. I couldn't bring myself to eat the leftovers. I can always eat leftovers, so I guess that goes to show my lack of enthusiasm for that ramen. Maybe the meat options are better? I don't know. I wouldn't go back there though."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Despite the mixed reviews on here, I thought the ramen was spectacular. All noodles made daily in house. Haven't tried the Italian."}
{"text":"Noodle Bar is a one of my favorite places in Phoenix, the service was excellent by Rachel, who was the waiter."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Got the chicken alfredo. Service was quick and pleasant. It was one of the best I have ever ordered. All freshly made. I think they make their own noodles from the way it tasted. I will definitely be back. Only took about 30 minutes from sitting down, eating, and leaving!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen bowls! They serve pork, chicken, and veggie based ramen broth so a win win for all eaters in the group. Great atmosphere as well. We have the shishito peppers for appt. They were amazing!"}
{"text":"I like ramen, but when I think of it I go back to my childhood days of 10 for 10$ top ramen. I loved that shizz! I have no other ramen or ramen restaurants to compare this place too, but it's a bowl of ramen that has been churched up with some goodies! I had the torigara and enjoyed it! The smell of it got me psyched to dive in and tear it up! The poached egg in it was a good addition for me. I would come back again and probably order the same thing. Give it a try for sure!!"}
{"text":"Brussel Sprouts... I'm gonna base my review on that.  A strange prospect I know but Brussel Sprouts it is. Since my wife introduced these things to me and showed me that they can be prepared in a way other broiled until death as the PA Dutch prefer, I've been a fan.  I've had them all over the world.  In France, New York, Florida, Phily, and even in Florence, Italy where my Brussel Sprouts were attached to a bush no more then two hours before I ate them... point of fact... these tonight were the best I've had. Blanched perfect for a crunch but still cooked, like a perfect green bean.  A bit of Pancetta for fun thrown about and a pesto cream sauce.  I almost ordered a second to take home.  $4 at happy hour and i need got Sprouts as a 'Roadie'.  Despite the way it sounds... I ordered more.  The Chinese - Italian chef, whom stopped to say hi, really took pride in his cooking, and embraced his cultures on both sides.  I also had meatballs, another thing I've eaten all over the place... again amazing.  It's a desire for home made, to craft elements from scratch so you can control production and put a spin at all levels.  Finally Ramen Noddles... yea the 5 cent thing from the store was an upscale homemade creation with a delicate broth that someone put a lot of time and love to develop. I'd imagine it's made every morning in the same handed down pot which tells a little bit of rich history in each spoonful. Now you ask why only 4... why not 5.   Let me tell you. My fun and invested server whom I dropped a 50% tip told me they are building desserts.  Chinese / Italian fusion trend dessert. Sign me up as a beta tester!!! I'll save the 5 for when I come back to Phoenix and get blown away by whatever creation they come up with. Until then.. I remain anticipating ..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great staff! I was helped with the ordering process and checked on frequently. Will return"}
{"text":"Name of the restaurant really should be \"Pork Bar\", since 80% of their menu items are pork-based.  Of the few items I did try, the quality of the food was fine, although the serving size for the pasta dish was pretty small.   My real beef (see what I did there?) is with their service.  Although generally friendly, the staff just seemed like they were lost and/or new.  Being seated next to an existing, and very loud, party, when there were plenty of empty tables.   Having to continually ask for items such as refills, cheese for the pasta, etc.  Being told they have run out of BREAD......seriously, what kind of restaurant runs out of bread?    I'd go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Jon Neal was quick to respond to my frustration in the poor service of the prior visit I had and even took the time to hear me out and give me a free meal. I really appreciate the damage control. Turned my 1 star into a 5 star!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Had the veggie platter for starts it was awesome!!  Jonas was our Waiter he was very helpful in our selections thank you were spot on. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I really like ramen and  this place hits the spot. One of the best ramen restaurant in Phoenix (my opinion). I work in the building diagonal from this restaurant and often enjoy their take out ramen. The broth is amazing, the noodles are just right, and I love the pork. My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey. I mean, no matter how good it is, it still just ramen. My take out normally is $14 (excluding tip) for one bowl of ramen to go. I do recommend th restaurant provide customers with larger portions or offer lunch price specials. I would definitely eat here more if it were not for the prices. Also I don't like that they will charge you the same price even if you opt out an ingredient, such pork or the noodles. (Speaking for other customers). FYI- Call ahead to place to go orders. It can take a long time to get your food otherwise."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Greatly exceeded my expectations. I was worried about eating soup and noodles while it was so hot outside but it was pleasantly light. Even the Chicken Alfredo was light. It tasted fresh and the service was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I love literally everything on the menu! Go durning happy hour!! Their drink and apps menu are great!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service. I would come here again.  The food was fresh and very well prepared and seasoned."}
{"text":"Best ramen in AZ hands down!!!! I lived in Japan for 2 years so I've had Real, traditional ramen. This place sure comes close to how it was in Japan. So happy my husband and I found this place!!!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to authentic Japanese ramen! Very tasty and filling. Family friendly and both the Italian and Japanese were very good. Well go again!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me start off by saying, I think their Ramen is really good!  I've eaten there a few times and was so excited to learn that they serve Shirataki noodles in place of regular noodles (Shirataki noodles don't have any carbs and I'm on a low carb diet).  I can actually eat Ramen, one of my fav foods with these noodles!  Then they decided to take them off the menu and not offer them anymore.  Now I cannot eat at the restaurant anymore and they do not offer any low carb options.  The service is ok, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table even though about half the tables were open when we walked in.  Wish I could still eat there though, very disappointed because the ramen flavor was so good."}
{"text":"Decent ramen spot.  Actual ramen noodles are not comparable to authentic style ( a little on the thinner side).  Had tonkatsu broth, not bad.   This place will fulfill ramen crave"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Noodle Bar. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. I live down the street from this Ramen joint and happened to walked by it one day and couldn't help myself, I walked in and asked if there was room for one. They sat me at the \"bar\" area which is tucked away in a corner- super cozy. Their menu is short and sweet which is kind of refreshing- but they have some strange options on there that I personally have never seen at a Ramen restaurant: pasta? I should try it before I judge, I'll have to swing back around sometime soon! Other menu options include small plates, salads, ramen and specialty noodles. My waitress was really attentive, despite handling lots of customers! Quick service, too.   I ordered the Hakata which is one of their pork ramen options (other is a fish and pork combo and third option is a spicy miso which includes pork chashu as well). The Hakata is a mix of the tonkotsu broth (a rich, creamy pork broth), pork chashu (braised pork belly), onions, scallions, bamboo, and pickled ginger. Delicious to say the least. Obviously this is one of the heavier options IMO because of the rich consistency of the tonkotsu broth- but I loved every bit of it. I think that the one and only thing it could have used is more pork on top! There are seven other options besides the Hakata for Ramen- including chicken and veggie options.   -Great for date night  -Easy access from the Light Rail -Good for takeout"}
{"text":"Good ramen for Phx. I especially loved the cured egg - soft-boiled and marinated! Would love if we could order it as added on.  It would be great if there is some asian fusion flavored salad too. One down side of this place is that my clothes smelt like food."}
{"text":"Good! However, little pricey for what you get. I go to a place in Chandler which is where I live and it's the same price but you get so much more meat! This place gave me like 3 small thin pieces of pork. Around the size of bacon pieces. The spicy wasn't even spicy. But then again that's each persons perspective. Cool inside and decor. The whole Italian and Asian combo kinda threw me off but it's unique. Overall, I probably wouldn't stop by again based off the fact that I got so little for what I paid for and mostly got broth but it's ok."}
{"text":"My favorite Ramen restaurant in Phx. The broth is incredible. Favorite thing on the menu is the Mr Karl Katsu. Portions are generous. Patio is dog friendly. Hope they open one up in Scottsdale soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the Ramen. Fresh ingredients with booming flavor. Excellent value and knowledgeable, outgoing, servers. Definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and get to this place!!! The ramen is incredible! We had the scorched ramen, the spicy miso, chicken fried rice and pork fried rice. Everything is fresh and spectacular."}
{"text":"Tried this spot randomly without any expectations, fantastic. Prices food and drinks are all delicious and reasonably priced. I definitely want to go back"}
{"text":"If you live in the East Valley go to Tampopo ramen. If you live in Central go to Noodle Bar.  The Noodle Bar Chef Exec studied ramen in Japan. I've had travel to Japan multiple times, I would say its pretty delicious and quite happy to find this place.  Ambiance towards modern/hip which is what I usually look for.  Limited seatings and can have long waiting lines during busy hours. You may want to put reservation if you are thinking of trying this place out of Friday night.  Parking may be an issue and requires some walking. It's part of living in the city :)  Also you are not in the mood for ramen, get the pork fried rice. Your belly will thank you."}
{"text":"So delicious! I got the Hakata Ramen to-go, and even though it was the height of the lunch hour, they had my order ready in 15 minutes. The broth was delicious and not salty; the amount of noodles was plentiful; the meat was delicious; the ginger added a touch of flavor that complemented everything else; I even got an extra egg added; and the to-go container was environmentally friendly and held up well during the 15 minute walk back to work. I love the re-branding of this place- it makes so much more sense now. I'll be coming back to try the Italian side of the menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The address doesn't really tell you where this restaurant is. The address says Adams but it is actually on 1st Ave. The food was really great, but what was most impressive was the customer service. We ordered a fried chicken appetizer. It was soggy, not crisp but the taste was fine. About 2 minutes after it was brought to our table the manager came over with a fresh appetizer of the fried chicken telling us the one the waiter had brought sat a little too long on the counter, and it would not truly represent the dish. He was correct. The fresh one he brought was crispy, hot and delicious. Smart excellent customer service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The staff was attentive and made sure we were taken care of. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge ramen lover! I've been pretty excited to eat at Noodle Bar since I heard they were open. They are located right in the heart of downtown Phoenix close to a light rail stop. Formally two separate eateries - Otakumen and Pat & Waldo's, Marco DiSanto has brought the Japanese and Italian inspired dishes together under one roof. You can order an anti pasti or one of their many pastas or you can go with one of their several ramen or wok-seared soba choices. The red chairs, cool looking lights and a display of bonsai plants really add to Noodle Bar's modern contemporary feel. I was wanting some heat and ordered the Spicy Miso (pork, egg, kimchi, scallions, garlic chips and sesame seeds). That thing was loaded with all types of spicy goodness and flavor. I love food that makes you sweat a little. And the noodle bowls are pretty good-sized portions too. My waitress delivered great service, kept my water filled and my ramen craving was satisfied for the night. I highly recommend a stop in if you are in the downtown area. From 4-7pm M-Sat, they have discounted prices on drinks and small plates for happy hour."}
{"text":"Noodle shops (particularly those of the ramen variety) have enjoyed explosive growth in the Phoenix area over the last two years as Asian inspired cuisine continues to become a mainstream element of American gastronomy (sushi bars and poke shops have also seen astronomical growth).  I've been to my fair share of noodle spots in the valley with CherryBlossom ranking right at the very top and Downtown Phoenix is quickly getting into the game.  I've been to SoSoba on Roosevelt a number of times but today was my first time stepping into Marco Di Santo's noodle shop.  In the neighborhood at lunchtime on a Saturday, a noodle craving beckons.  You'll find Noodle Bar on the west side of 1st Avenue just north of Adams Street in between Thai Basil and Harumi Sushi.  Inside one of Phoenix's oldest Art Deco high rises you'll find a restaurant that seats upwards of 50 or so in a space which is kept exceptionally clean and full of red and black hues throughout.  Marco Di Santo's concept is effectively an Asian-Italian hybrid, taking a cue from his Asian-Italian heritage.  On one half of the menu, you'll find your Italian classics like gnocchi, fettuccine, ravioli, and bolognese.  On the other half, you'll see an assortment of ramen bowls as well as some special in house Asian rice and noodle dishes.  There's also a chalk board to scope out their drink menu and drink specials.  There's no real hybrid Asian-Italian dishes per se (somewhat to my disappointment), but I made an effort to mix in Asian and Italian as much as possible for my first visit.  For a starter, I had to try the Gyoza.  Tiny little hand folded pork dumplings stuffed with pork, cabbage and garlic accompanied by a spicy soy based sauce (five dumplings in all).  For my main dish, I actually chose to skip the ramen in favor of one of their house specials.  The Chicken Yakisoba sounded like the perfect compromise between wanting something resembling a pasta dish, but with an Asian tilt.  Seasoned chicken, housemade noodles, carrots, and cabbage all cooked together in the wok and topped with chives.  For the dessert finale, I went all in on their Italian option.  The Vanilla Panna Cotta comes dressed with a blackberry compote and lemon flavored whipped cream so, yeah why wouldn't I?  Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to about $27.  The Gyoza was a pretty solid starter that can be shared by two or eaten by a single hungry animal like me.  I really liked the sauce it came with, adding just enough heat to keep me on my toes without losing any enjoyment.  The Chicken Yakisoba is a relatively simple dish, but the seasoning they used really elevated what would otherwise be a somewhat bland mix of ingredients.  The noodles in particular were excellent and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  The Panna Cotta came out nice and cold and the lemon and blueberry toppings gave it a pleasant amount of tartness without being overpowering.  A little more of that blueberry compote would've been great, but overall a thumbs up for the dessert.  Overall, a good first impression.  Next time I'll be here for the ramen bowls themselves (and probably explore the libations), but I can confirm that even the non-ramen items are indeed worth a try.  Keep your eyes on chef Marco Di Santo.  Something tells me this won't be the only creation he'll envision for the valley food scene when all is said and done.  Until then, he's got a Downtown spot worthy of praise similar to his next door neighbors.  And that's saying something."}
{"text":"I'm glad I stopped by this place on my way home to PDX, the place was little empty it might be because I went there around 8pm. The waitress was nice and fast service. This is a Japanese mix Italian place. So we decided to ordered a smaller place which is chicken fried rice. The fried rice was a good portion for $5. We also ordered spicy miso ramen...I'm a ramen lover and I have to say that this bowl of ramen was SO good! The spicy kicked me up, the pork and the egg!!! The ramen here is better than most of them in PDX. The last dish we ordered was Chicken Alfredo. The pasta noodle look different to me at first but mannnn the taste and texture of pasta noodle was better than it looked and taste was fantastic!!! Thank you to the cook, owner and waitress."}
{"text":"Small place with comfortable dinning room and attentive, friendly staff. They anticipated our needs and brought my two year old something she could eat that wasn't even on the menu without any fuss at all.    Loved the food.  My husband ordered the Spicy Miso and I ordered the Yaki Soba.  Both items are delicious.    The miso is large with lots of stuff in it.  (Beautiful like a Cobb salad but exotic and hearty).  The miso broth is a show stopper.    The Yaki Soba had these awesome noodles that are lightly sauced and boldly flavored with the absolute perfect texture and consistency.  These are what noodles are meant to be like!  The soft boiled egg was the perfect compliment.  The jerky-like meat took a little getting used to and seemed salty but I ate everything and would order this again in a second."}
{"text":"This place deserve a zero star for customer services and food. I came around lunch time to an empty place with two waiters, and it took them 15 minutes to seated me. They weren't very attentive at their job either. When bringing ramen to me, they gave me a big ass serving spoon! And when I asked for a soup spoon, they gave me another big ass different kind of serving spoon. How dumb. Either dumb or very careless of how they treat their customers. It's the worst restaurant I've ever been to. And ramen tasting, it wasn't good. It was salty and it did not taste like broth got cooked down for many hours."}
{"text":"Super solid. Appetizers SOLID. RAMEN 7.5/10. Service LEGIT. Beer ON TAP. 100% definitely will come back."}
{"text":"What a great find in downtown Phoenix! I am half Japanese and half American, living in Japan through my childhood, I can vouch for the quality of ramen here. They put their own spin on it, and it's incredible. I got the spicy miso, it made my nose run, was the perfect sized portion (bigger portion than my other fave place- Tampopo Ramen) and bursting with flavor. A soft boiled egg to perfection and just '100' all around. My husband got the chicken one (I forget the name) and although milder spice level, still great flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly in both. I also have to recommend you try the karaage. They put their own spin on these fried chicken bites and add a sauce to them, but with the Japanese mayo dip and scallions, I was pleasantly surprised.  All in all, I was impressed with this place. Like many cafes in Japan, they also serve Italian food. I will have to try it next time. my only recommendation would be to have some bento boxes available for quick pick up for lunch. maybe some chahan with a gyoza and karaage, or yakisoba to go.  No complaints, all praise. Give the place a shot. Legit ramen at good prices.... and great ambiance too.  PS- Jonas is a great server."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday based on the strong reviews. Service was slow, but I attributed that to a late lunch. Went back today because Harumi Sushi managed their wait so poorly (no engagement or instruction for the line. Today I was seated semi-promptly, but then sat for 10 minutes with no waiter, no water, and no drinks. When a waiter delivered the drink order to the group next to me that came in after me, I walked out.   As for food from yesterday, Shoyu ramen was okay -- the broth was rather \"chicken soup\" like.  I should add that I hate the idea of doing reviews on service, but seriously, watching multiple restaurant staff walking around with zero customer touches is poor."}
{"text":"I discovered this little gem on yelp. It was a short walk from my hotel which was nice. The map on google was a little confusing, it's not actually on w. Adams the entrance faces 1st ave. I arrived at 3:00 pm and their happy hour is from 3-7 they have small plates for $4.00 and drink specials. After talking with my server about the different ramen they serve I decided on their most popular, the spicy pork miso. Boy was I surprised , the minute she sat the bowl in front of me I could smell the broth and I knew It was going to be amazing... it was the best ramen I have ever had  and I've ate ramen in Japan several times . The broth was so flavorful with just the right amount of heat . I also ordered pork fried rice from the happy hour menu it was a huge serving and equally as good . I even ordered another fried rice to go for lunch tomorrow. I will crave both of these dishes until I come back to Phoenix for another fix."}
{"text":"Drove all the way downtown to try this place and it was a mess. They had a large party that clearly threw them off resulting in a bunch of empty, un-bussed tables, a lobby full of people waiting to be seated, and half the menu items being unavailable. It took them forever to seat everyone and then forever to get around to everyone. We left without even getting any water. Unfortunately, they were just very unprepared and I'd probably never go back because of it. Oh and the bathrooms were pretty damn gross."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, friendly staff. What more can you want? I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was fantastic, the portion was big I had left overs! Definately worth the 13 or so dollars."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Great ramen and drinks. Their gyoza is really good too. Great service and the flavor is on point. Also love the fried rice. Their dessert game is the only thing lacking here. They don't have consistent desserts and run out early when they do."}
{"text":"Kind of an odd spot that supposedly serves both Italian pasta and Japanese ramen.   We arrived for dinner on Monday and there were no Italian pasta options on the menu, only ramen. Ok.   We got a bowl of ramen and a chicken fried rice. The ramen uses thin, white noodles, instead of the thicker yellow noodles I am used to. A bit of a surprise. You also have to pay extra for an egg.   The fried rice was very flavorful, but it was pretty greasy, and a little mushy in my opinion, as if they used fresh rice to make it instead of drier, leftover rice as you are supposed to.   Overall, interesting concept, but just ok on the execution."}
{"text":"I got the spicy miso, very very tasty! Although I service was a little spotty. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"OMG! So good. Had the torigara pork ramen. It was delicious with a bottle of DiGiorgio Cabernet. Perfect. They have great craft specialty beer and wine list. For an app we had the karaange fried chicken with a citrus aoli. Yummmo"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was really slow at 5.30 pm. Ordered Spicy Miso Ramen, pork fried rice and gyoza they were tasted decent and fresh but it was only on server who ran around and the other one mostly just took pickup orders and helped handout some orders."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food it was very good and the waitresses and hostess was very pleasant. We will be back! Had the Miso Spicy it was spicy not hot. I enjoyed it. And my husband had the pork fried rice. Very good on both!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and we ordered the spicy miso and he got some tora option and they were both really good. I liked the miso much better though. I recommend this to any ramen lover and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Okay first off, I have never been to a Jap/Italian noodle bar and that just sounds bad and absurd. Once more my skepticism has been thwarted!!!  I was heading for the spicy miso ramen. The place looked more like a cafeteria than say a sit down style of joint. I was seated immediately and the server was great. The food came up pretty quick. Now, I am a ramen fanatic. I see the bowl and there is the usual egg, noodle, veg, and pork, however the broth has tons of spices floating around in it and sesame seeds which I have never seen. I then ate it and wow it was really good! I would say it is in my top three in the US and Canada. So cheers to Noodle Bar and thanks for disproving my skepticism!"}
{"text":"Hungry for ramen and this place is the closest to the Phoenix Convention Center where I was attending an event.   At first, I was very surprised that none of the cooks are Japanese so I was a little hesitant, but I tried it anyway.   The service was good  and the place was clean. I ordered Hakata which is close to Tonkutso. The broth was fine, but the eggs were missing. I also had their chicken fried rice. It was very oily at the bottom therefore I just couldn't eat it.   I've always love Ramen and I've had them all over the country or even in Japan. This is the worse so far. It's not bad, but it's not great. If you're hungry for Ramen and short of time then this is place is not awful to try."}
{"text":"Yassssss love love love it keep up the good work yall!! Warm hospitality and just great vibes !!"}
{"text":"I was slightly dubious walking into Noodle Bar. A ramen shop that also serves Italian noodles? My general attitude is that the only good ramen restaurants are the restaurants that specialize in only ramen. I was pleasantly surprised by Noodle Bar though. Inside this hip Japanese/Italian fusion restaurants lies a very delicious bowl of ramen that I could definitely see myself getting again.   The tonkotsu broth was tasty and the noodles were the thin kind that you don't see too often and wonder by, because they are fairly delicious. There was a good amount of chashu sitting in the broth with some ginger sprinkled about. All of this melded together to form a delicious authentic bowl of ramen that I eagerly slurped up.   Be sure to order something extra though (I got extra noodles). I don't think a single bowl of ramen is enough to fill yourself up here."}
{"text":"If you like ramen, please go here. This place was awesome - they offer a mix of Italian and Japanese dishes and all for a good price. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and was in heaven."}
{"text":"Dinner out with a friend today. I was excited to try this place because I love noodles and they have Japanese and Italian noodles. I was looking forward to the ramen but was disappointed. It wasn't horrible but the broth was way too salty. However, we tried the Italian noodles dishes as well and I would return here for the Italian dishes. So flippin' good!!"}
{"text":"Dashed in at 9:30 pm ( they close at 10pm) on a Tuesday night to try the place out for first time. Location is great, being slap in middle of downtown Phoenix. It's no secret that this city has been lacking in the food dept downtown choices for a loooong time. I read about Noodle Bar on Yelp and saw reviews were positive. The food was pretty good-- but not out of this world. My server on the hand, wish I had gotten his name to include here, was top knotch! Good service can win anybody over..."}
{"text":"The food here was sort of below average.   My waiter was nice but my ramen was way too salty and I had to actually water it down with a full cup of water.  The other staff (hostess, busboy) seemed to just look right through us when we met eyes or passed them, which was odd because I thought as an employee, courtesy should be their priority.  Overall, not a good dining experience and the food was subpar.  Definitely would not be coming back."}
{"text":"It was good! I came here one day for lunch while serving Jury Duty downtown. The place was clean, the staff was very courteous and the food was delicious. I would certainly go back if I ever find myself downtown and hungry again!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we enjoyed it very much.  We started with the delicious meatballs.  My wife had the Penne Pasta and I had the Spicy Miso Noodle Soup.  Both were cooked to perfection and the blend of flavors were amazing.   Our server was Jonas and he was attentive, knowledgeable and made our entire experience better. Even though this was our first time, the next time we are in Downtown Phoenix, we will be back."}
{"text":"Sadly sadly sadly disappointed by this place. The first time we came to eat here it wasn't horrible but I wasn't in love with my dish. The ramen my boyfriend ordered was good but not the best.  The second time eating here, we got take out which was horrible. We ordered the spicy ramen and curry ramen. The curry ramen was SO BAD it lacked any type of flavor plus they just gave us a bone with 30% meat on it...and on top of that like two pieces of a few veggies. It was a sad example of a soup and we had to throw it out. Such a waste.  Overall: Customer service: 3 Food: 1 Ambiance: 4 Parking: 3"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a ramen place open up and after weeks of dreaming, I finally went to try Noodle Bar. I ordered the Hakata with an egg and the Tsukemen. After visiting Japan during the cold winter, Tonkotsu ramen with chashu and a soft boiled egg has a special place in my heart, so I had high hopes for the Hakata. But it was average broth with average noodles. The Tsukemen was also nothing I had before for the wrong reasons; the dipping sauce was oily, not thick, not rich, not flavorful. Even though I was disappointed with my choices, I would be willing to try Noodle Bar again."}
{"text":"Currently sitting at my table without my food that I ordered 30 minutes ago. Appetizers have been brought out, however, the main dishes have not. Meanwhile, several other tables have been served their meals even after arriving 10-20 minutes after us. We have been checked in with once for water refills, but nothing regarding an apology for the wait of the entrees we ordered.   My friends and I are disappointed. This is our first trip to Phoenix and were excited to try a new ramen place, since we're coming from Las Vegas. A place known for their food, customer service, and serving in a timely manner. As I'm wrapping this up, another 10 minutes have passed and some of the food has finally arrived. Still, no apology for the wait or even acknowledgement for such.  Maybe not important enough to add in, but there was a couple here that left 5 minutes ago because after waiting for 15 minutes, their water was never brought to them, nor were they checked in with. Should I mention that my friends, myself, and the couple that left are/were the only brown people in this establishment and all other non-brown people were served in an efficient timely manner??  Thanks, noodle bar. This review is to note your customer service, the lack thereof. Not the food that I still haven't tried while writing this because I'm honestly so appalled at the service displayed here today."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  It was a recommendation from a co-worker.  Not a good idea.  The staff was very unfriendly and not attentive at all.  We went at lunch and the place only had 2 other tables occupied.  After we got drinks and ordered food there was a bit of a wait, no problem as I knew they made your food when you ordered.  I requested by dish without mushrooms and instead got a mushroom infested dish.  By the time the waiter came over to check on us after we got our meal, and I told him it was mushroom full, he actually tried to take the bowl while I was eating.  I told him I didn't have time to wait for them to re-make it.  Now, he did give us the lunch for free, but not once did we get refills on our drinks and after I told him they couldn't re-make my food he pretty much was not interested in us at all."}
{"text":"Great noodles bar for noodles-lover like me!!! We ordered torikara ramen and ravioli with 2 side dishes. Great taste! The decor is really interesting and exhibit different noodles from diff countries. Staff are amazing and the owner is just fantastic! We ended up getting dessert complimentary. Awesome place and would definitely visit again! ^^"}
{"text":"The food last time was great! This evening we checked the hours on yelp and it said open until 10pm. We showed up at 9:30 and the doors were locked! People were inside enjoying all the deliciousness whilst we stared in through the window like orphans in the famous tale \"A Christmas Carol\". A very nice young lady came out to inform us they just closed. Sad day for us indeed."}
{"text":"Hell to the yes!!!   We need more restaurants like the Noodle Bar.  Excellent food.  Great staff.  Conveniently located."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  My buddy and I work downtown several days a month and at least 2-3 times a month would have lunch here.  In the past the food has been quite good and the service quite good as well.  The strange thing is that if you want extra noodles their policy is to wait until you are \"halfway\" through your meal before they'll bring the extra noodles.  In the past I've just asked they be brought with my meal because I don't want to have to wait when I'm ready for the extra noodles.  This shouldn't be a big deal.  We are talking noodles, not brain surgery...  So today, my friend and I sat down to order and learned they were not serving anything from their Italian menu due to \"technical difficulties.\"  Then they pointed out that they are not serving the bottom half of their Japanese menu.  So literally there is only 25% of their regular menu available.  My waiter turned in the order, along with the request that extra noodles be brought at time my meal delivered.  This is when things went off the rails.  A man sat down and asked if he \"could speak to me about my order.\" He introduced himself as the general manager and proceeded to explain their policy of not bringing out extra noodles early.  I explained that I've done it that way before and he told me I had not.  This wasn't true because I know I've done it.  We are going back and forth and I'm incredulous because here I am, a regular repeat customer, who is only asking for extra noodles to be brought with my meal.  I said \"fine, don't bring them.\"  He left to speak with the chef.  Then he came back to my friend and ask if he wanted to cancel his meal too.  My friend was confused as he had not ordered extra noodles.  The GM then explained he had cancelled my lunch order.  That is to say that not only could I not get extra noodles served at the same time as my meal, I couldn't get any meal.  We ended up leaving.  At one point during this whole conversation the look on the GM's face was such that I didn't know if he was going to scream or get physical.  I wasn't yelling, I wasn't rude.  I simply said either bring them with my meal or don't bring them at all.  I was willing to accept their silly policy.  I eat out a lot and go to a ton a different restaurants.  This was absolutely the WORST treatment I have EVER had by anyone at a restaurant (or other establishment for that matter).  I'm thinking of ways I can give him the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to having a bad day.  But I really can't think of any reason that justifies such horrible behavior.  I'd like to go back because I like our regular waitstaff and the food is good.  But with this guy as GM I don't see ever going back.  Again, the waitstaff is terrific and none of this blame falls on them.  This is the manager's issue.  He might want to take some anger management classes.  I'm still a little in shock that I was treated this way in a restaurant I've eating at well over a dozen times in the past 6 months."}
{"text":"Ended up here after encountering nothing but closed restaurants on July 3, due to the next day holiday. We could smell how awesome it was before we entered the building. Not only were they open, but they had happy hour until 7! Craft drafts for $3 is the best deal I've heard of. Plus $10 sake bombs (maybe the best cold sake I've ever had) and $4 small plates. We got 3 of the small plates (chicken fried rice, polpettas, and raviolo) and they were all phenomenal (and decent size)! We also got the pork yaki soba and that likewise was amazing. We had leftovers and they were great the next day too. I'm super glad we stumbled onto this place, and can see myself being a regular. Service was great too. Everything was clean. Nice atmosphere. Can't say enough how much I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Second time to this restaurant (and second iteration too) and I am just not impressed!  The decor is nice, the service is great, but the food is just mediocre.  My husband had the rolled lasagna and it was completely cold (ugh) and I had the pomodoro (nothing special about it).  If I ever come back, I'll try the ramen and give it a shot."}
{"text":"Bit of a disappointment here.  I was lured in by the previous reviews but left with a hole in my pocket.  It is interesting that they offer both Ramen noodles and Italian pasta in the same place.  I opted for the pasta Bolongnese.  The pasta was good.  I appreciated the au dente noodles.  But sauce was just okay, kind of mild.  Maybe it is supposed to be that way but it didn't do much for me.  For some crazy reason I ordered beer with the meal and the beer selection here was odd: one IPA, one very sweet porter, one light beer, and two wheat beers.  The server was awfully patient with me but there was no choice that really matched my tastes.     I should have ordered red wine but the eclectic chalkboard menu was hard to digest.  I was shocked to see that my meal was $30.  Felt a bit pricey for what I got.  Nevertheless this could be a fun place if you are prepared for it.  Avoid the beer.  Get Ramen with Sake or Italian with Red wine.  Also, they do have a happy hour and that could be worth a try."}
{"text":"Noodle Bar around 3pm is pretty low key. In fact, I was the only diner so I kinda felt like Beyoncé having the entire place to myself. I like the concept at Noodle Bar: one asian kitchen, one Italian kitchen. After looking though all of the photos on Yelp! It seems as if the menu has been condensed and the prices increased ever so slightly. I asked my server for a recommendation and after a serious internal struggle I went with the Spicy Ramen.....although the beet gnocchi was calling my name as well. Everything about the service was perfect. Almost everything about the food met my expectations. I did question whether of not the chicken appetizer that I ordered was properly cooked because it seemed a bit undercooked to me. I didn't say anything to my server because I wasn't trying to totally Diva Out over some chicken, but he noticed himself and took the appetizer off of my final bill.  5 Stars for Noodle Bar because I was super impressed with exceptional service and the integrity of their Spicy Miso Ramen dish."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The service is always great; they check on us every so often, which is nice. I've only gotten ramen but it's always delicious. They were able to make my boyfriend's ramen vegan and very spicy. I would recommend coming here. I had an awesome birthday experience here. The service was great. I had the Yaki Soba which is a very tasteful vegetarian dish. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to start my review by thanking Nomas our very nice waiter and the General Manager of the restaurant for making this a much better experience than it really was. I will also begin my review with a breakdown of my rating:  Service: 5 stars  Ambience: 4.5 stars Food: 2.5 stars   We got to Noodle Bar at around 4:30pm today. We were super excited about trying their Ramen because of the good reviews and beautiful pictures. we've seen on Yelp. When we got there, the restaurant was almost empty with about 2 tables occupied only. We were seated immediately and were given the menus. We ordered a drink and water and reviewed the menu. Nomas our waiter returned with our drinks and asked us if we had any questions since it was our first time there. When I did ask, I unfortunately discovered that most Ramen options were made with pork and because we do not eat pork, we were left with only two options to pick from, the veggie Ramen or the curry (beef) ramen and the curry was already out for the day! Since we didn't wanna eat a veggies only dish, we decided to order the Karaage fried chicken for appetizers, the lemon chicken fettuccini and the Chicken Yakisoba for mains.   The karaage chicken came out pretty quick. Although looking really appetizing, not all pieces were cooked properly. Our waiter came to check on us and we shared with him that they were undercooked. He sincerely apologized and immediately offered to replace the dish for us. A few minutes later, a new Karaage dish came out, now chicken was cooked a bit better. I still felt like some pieces were not cooked all the way through but since it was dark meat, it was kinda hard to tell for sure. The aioli that was served with it was delicious. Overall, it if wasn't for the downfall on the cooking, this dish would have scored 4 stars.   Our mains were served a little while after that. Looking pretty good, we expected to be blown away. The Yakisoba wasn't any thing over the top. The veggies and the noodles tasted good, the chicken, just ok. I finished the whole plate though, I was very hungry!   My husband's lemon chicken fettuccini looked amazing but again it fell short with the chicken being so under cooked, it was red on the inside! My husband stopped eating it after about 5 bites and just focused on the fettuccini which to be honest, was absolutely delicious!!   When our waiter returned to check on us, we showed him the undercooked chicken and he now was extremely apologetic! He went away for a min and returned saying they would take the dish off our bill. He also took the dish away and came back apologizing again. Not only that, a couple of minutes later, the General Manager came to us and was very apologetic and wanted to make it up for us in any way. We thanked him because we were already pretty full. He explained to us the new changes and the renovation and new menu and he wished for us to return so they could make it up for us and show us that they are much better than what we experienced today.   I think the place would be worth a try again. Maybe we will give them time to complete their \"reset\" phase before returning though. We understand during times of change, things may fall through the cracks so we will probably give them a chance again in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely Epic! Got the Tori Toma and asked for it extra spicy, not sure what spice they brought me but it was on fire. I can honestly say it was everything I hoped for and my wife and I will definitely be return customers."}
{"text":"New ramen joint in town so I definitely had to try it out. I had the Hakata (tonkotsu) and my brother had the Spicy Miso. The ramen came out quickly and looked super promising. Upon first taste, I really enjoyed the broth. It was super rich and flavorful. However, after a few bites (slurps), it became too salty. My brother agreed that his was too salty, also. We ended up just eating the noodles, meat and veggies without the broth, which is a shame because usually I want to drink all the broth in the end. I almost wanted to ask for hot water to add to the broth to dilute it a bit..   I might give them a second try to see if it was just a one time thing. We did visit on a Saturday late afternoon when the place was pretty empty. Perhaps, the broth had been simmering and became more concentrated.   I also noticed Tsukemen on the menu that I have not seen at any other restaurants in the valley, so I'm tempted to go back to try theirs."}
{"text":"This is a great find in downtown phoenix!!!! I have to say at first I was curious about the mix of Italian and Asian cuisine but our curiosity has been answered !!! Meatballs and ramen!!!!! Where have you been all my life!!!! Seating was a little weird and service wasn't top notch that's why only 4 star! But hey it was a busy night so I will be back for sure to eat and experience it all again!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!  Great food! The spicy miso is to die for, also had tried the Alfredo so good!. You could taste the freshness of the pasta. Great service  Will go back anytime for sure."}
{"text":"The waiter didn't seem to be overly knowledgeable about the menu.  Nice decor. I had the Torigara which was ok.. strongly reminded me of Campbells chicken noodle soup with a littl"}
{"text":"I know giving this place a 1 star is extreme. But the bathroom here is disgusting. And that concerns me because if they're not cleaning their bathroom, how clean do you think their kitchen is. Gross"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. So was the Wren House Kolsch. Would have gotten 5 stars, but it was a little loud for a conversation."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried rice and thought it was very good. I'd like to go back and try the ramen!  The service is great and the restaurant is nice. Parking can be kind of difficult, but that's true of anything downtown.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Walked into Noodle Bar a bit hesitantly the other night when I noticed that they sell both Japanese and Italian food. What are they playing at? I wondered. Sat down anyway and ordered the Hakata Ramen and was delightfully surprised at how delicious it was. I'm only in town for the weekend but I am eyeing up sneaking in another visit tomorrow before I leave.  I had a cool server as well."}
{"text":"Owner welcomed me and explained the restaurant concept, and service was great the whole time. Best ramen broth - I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Yaki Soba and husband daughter ordered Ramen.  All three were delicious.  Dark and Stormy with house spiced rum was very good.  Will come back."}
{"text":"The spicy ramen is really good, although the food was extremely slow to come out. The waitress said that they were prepping for dinner, which resulted in us waiting for over 40 minutes to receive our ramen and meatballs. It was a little frustrating since we were eating before a baseball game so we didn't have that much time to waste.   I'd still go back to get the spicy ramen, but probably not on a day where I'm on a time crunch in case it takes a while."}
{"text":"Tried the Hakata, tukumen, and started with karrage fried chicken. Hakata was good soup wasn't salty meat was sliced too thinly. My fiance had tukumen that is served cold you add all the ingredients yourself. The fried chicken was delicious marinated chicken was great. Fair warning the fry the skin separately so don't freak out when you take a big bite is skin only. I'll come back and try another dish."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. Spicy miso was the bomb-dizzle! The restroom was a trek to get to and someone blew their nose on the wall above the urinal but other than that. This place will be one of my top spots."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. It's super chill. My waitress was so nice and awesome because I can get very picky and a little difficult to deal with, but she handled it like a champ. I got the fried chicken and the tori toma ramen. The fried chicken sauce was so good. I wasn't too impressed though with the chicken and soup. The soup was alright. It was salty and bland. It was my first time there and what I really wanted was the spicy miso. But they were all out of it along with rice, beef, and poached eggs. Seriously? Yes I was upset but I was willing to try. The place is great but the food was okay. I'm going to go back to try the spicy miso because I hear it's great."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan ramen bowl( I don't eat meat) It was delicious! Had my leftovers the next day and bit into a chunk of pork and found several more pieces.. pretty bugged by the careless cross contamination. Probably won't go again.."}
{"text":"I came to the Noodle Bar for Yaki Tori (which I hadn't had since I was stationed in Japan). It was taken off the menu months ago because it didn't sell well. I was also surprised that the menu I was given had no Italian dishes listed (noodles and pasta advertised). I had the gyosa and torigara ramen in broth. Both very good. Service was so-so. Not very busy, but only 1 server seemed to be working. Not very attentive."}
{"text":"Man I hope this place stays around.  Eaten here maybe a half dozen times for lunch and dinner.  Spicy miso is one of the best things I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"At first it seems strange to have Italian and Japanese share the same food setting, but it's not baf.   The noodles are fresh and can stand up to the sauces. I did their pork special and also had their curry ramen. I couldn't finish either and had it for lunch the next day.   You could do worse for a quick and inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"This place has great potential, if not already amazing.   Cool ambience; great Toshiro Mifune posters in the back hallway! Our waitress was pleasant and sweet, the only issue was her lack of familiarity with shochu. She was young and it was completely forgivable.  We had the raviolo small plate - amazing! My friend ordered the Hakata ramen which looked fantastic. He consumed that entire bowl in record time. I ordered the Tsukemen because I enjoy cold noodle dishes. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the \"rich dipping broth\". Perhaps I am unfamiliar with traditional tsukemen, but I at least thought I could consume the broth. The menu does not describe it as spicy nor oily which is all that it was (and I am no wimp to spice either). It was full of chili flakes and after every bite, my lips were slick with oil. Not sexy. There was no depth of flavor and pretty unpalatable in my opinion. I asked if they had another broth to use, then declined because I did not want a ramen broth substitute (though that would have been much better). I would suggest this place describe how spicy/oily it is, or better yet, completely redesign their tsukemen broth. All the side items and noodles with this dish were delightful.  In the end, I gave it 3 stars because I think I ordered one of their weaker items and so many dishes looked fantastic. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"So delicious and chill. I recommend the ramen over the pasta due to the intense flavors in the broth. I also recommend ALL of the appetizers."}
{"text":"After the show there wasn't time to leave downtown before places closed.   So we checked Yelp to see what was open and good.  Found this place.  First impression:  cozy, simple.  We were seated reasonably promptly (they had to clean the table...it wasn't ready).  Waters came out quickly as did the menus.  Menu was very small.  Not a huge selection.  We ordered hakata, spicy miso, and karaage.  The first two are ramen dishes, the latter one is a fried chicken.  All were extremely good.  Good flavors, reasonable portions.  I didn't much like the bamboo in my hakata, but that's just me.  My wife liked it fine.  I would have to say this is the best ramen place I've found in the metro area so far.   A bit far from my home, but when in downtown this gem will be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch today and the couple close to us had the chicken fried rice which looked good so we ordered it as well. Food was mediocre, service was just ok. Tried to mind our own business but couldn't help but notice the female manager threatening the couple next to us to call the police in a very hostile way. Wow! Not sure what was happening but the manager was extremely inappropriate and caused a scene for everyone to see."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The guy who attended to us was super excited about expansion and seemed so happy to work there. This made the experience even better. I definitely need to visit more!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place based on the photos. First let me say it was not easy to find. I used walking GPS and from the angle my friends and I were coming, you can't see the sign at all. My friends and I all agreed the place looked cool once you walked in but not that noticeable. You could easily pass it by for the Thai place next door.  We get inside and the place seems on the dead side. For us it was perfect because we had somewhere we needed to be and only had an hour to spare.  We walk in and are seated instantly by the hostess. She was kind and patient and got us waters while we waited for our waiter.  After that things went down hill a bit. The waiter seemed to be ignoring us. We could feel we weren't getting the same level of attention as other tables. My friend was not pleased as he had questions about the food and he felt the plates were not explained to him well. The menus weren't very descriptive on what stuff was so we relied on the waiter to tell us.  In the end I got tired of trying to figure it out and just went for quick, easy, cheap, and something I knew - chicken friend rice. My friend ordered something as well but I don't recall what.  My food took a little bit to make but for $5 I have to say it was a very big portion and tasted delicious.  However things went downhill again when we sat and waited for quiet some time and noticed my friends order wasn't coming. Eventually we asked the waiter who informed us he accidentally didn't submit it. I honestly don't know what was going on in his head to make him completely forget the only good item my friend ordered.  After that I felt a little bad as my friend was now hungry and irritated with feeling ignored and unimportant as other tables, and then having his meal completely forgotten. The reason I felt bad was my friend began catching attitude with all the staff. I don't believe in snapping at and talking down to people when they give horrible customer service or ignore you. Show how you feel when you tip.  I will say I would have been more sympathetic to still tipping high had the place been busy and packed or we had a large party at our table. In both situations I can understand slipping now and again and forgetting to enter an order.  But with a slow night and the customer orders bottled beer and an entree, it's hard to imagine why. Plus no one checked on us to see if we were ok or how the food was. At that point we would have checked on his food. Instead we had to call the waiter over to ask what was up. And we had to request a check from the hostess because after eating no one returned again.  Maybe we caught them on an extremely off night but either way I don't think my friends and I want to return."}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot since the last time I was there. I was really disappointed to see the shishito peppers eliminated from the menu, and the spicy miso ramen was completely different. The meat was different, the flavor changed, and it was not spicy to me at all. Unfortunately, that was the only spicy ramen still on the menu. Also, while in my previous review I mentioned the good music, today was awful overplayed hits from the 90s. I don't know, maybe the iPod broke and they put on 96.9 but I was not digging it. Overall the experience was fine, but just not as good as before."}
{"text":"The ambience here is very hip. I ordered the hanakata. It was very good but I felt the sliced ginger and chopped onions was a bit overwhelming. The egg I got was kind slimy and not how I normally get it when I go to New York. The water was very cloudy and tasted a bit funny. I couldn't tell if it was flavored or if it was just how their tap water is."}
{"text":"Best Japanese noodles downtown, the torigara is legitness...  Service is on point too."}
{"text":"First time here and my husband and I loved it. The chicken fried rice was soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"We ordered the veggie platter as an appetizer and I would probably give it 3-stars. It was mostly cauliflower served with some grilled peppers and a balsamic and cream sauce around the edges for added flavor. My boyfriend didn't care for it at all, however they did have some great ramen! We both ordered the spicy miso ramen, each with an extra order of noodles and it was too much for us to finish. We both ended up taking the extra noodles and broth home and had them later. By then though, all the broth has been absorbed, but the noodles were deliciously infused with all the ramen broth and spices! Definitely would recommend this place to others and we will for sure be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! Reasonable price! Especially since I've seen crazy prices in LA! Great services and all the staff are friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Oodles Of noodles and yet there is a sign outdoors that says \"low carb\", which is fine and probably just an advertising faux pas.   My colleagues and I came for lunch on. Friday at around 130 pm and we were the only patrons. Nice ! (But maybe a sign ) We all had ramen but I would have been interested to explore the Italian menu items as some of the yelp pics looked delicious. However due to the summer season where demand is low they only have the Japanese menu. This consisted of 5 ramen broth flavors and several appetizer which we didn't try.   I got the Shoyu Roman which is a combination of chicken broth and fish broth and includes Chashu (pork belly) half an egg, Menma (preserved bamboo shoots) , and nori (seaweed). We were told it is a bit fishy but I found it could have been more fishy! The flavor of the broth was good but still a little too salty for my tastes. I asked for some vinegar and the waitress was really nice to bring me a tiny bit in a teeny saucer.   Another curiosity I have is that both my chashu and the menma were somewhat cold and I think they could have been a bit more generous with the menma as that was the only \"veggie\" in my bowl aside from the green onions. Give the price point of 12 bucks for a bowl of ramen, I at least expected a larger quantity of embellishments if the slices of the chashu were as thin is these little guys.   The plus side of my ramen was that the consistency of the noodles were good, not over-cooked nor too chewy.    My colleague with the curry ramen said that his beef rib was really fatty and I definitely confirmed after seeing it. However good news for my doggie !   Overall if I would have been hungrier I would have given it a full three stars but now it's a 2.5. The waitress was very nice though so this rating is only of the food!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Medium sized restaurant (approximately 15 tables and 2 elevated bar-style tables). Decorated with a modern-Asian feel. Noise level was good for conversation. The restaurant on a whole has a modern/trendy vibe.   Food: Approximately 6 Italian inspired options (fettuccine/lasagna etc) and 10 Asian inspired options (soba/ramen etc). I wouldn't call either traditional but more modern infusions. I thought the soba was great! They also salad options. The alcohol menu is decent as well, with several Craft beers on tap.   Service: I was very well taken care off, was able to make small adjustments to my meal with switching out ingredients. The wait staff was very friendly and prompt.  Price: Very reasonable  Summary: A great downtown option for noodle infusion inspired dishes!"}
{"text":"The ramen is absolutely delicious! I have seen some of their Italian noodles and don't look as good. Would definitely recommend if you want delicious ramen that's very flavorful! It's a huge bowl for $10-12 average. Service isn't always the best but food typically comes out fast!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!! Great ramen. Our server Crystal was amazing, since we don't eat red meat she had the curry ramen made with chicken broth without the beef. The ramen was perfect and delicious, not very over powering flavors like some of the curry noodle I have had lately. The noodles were amazing and stayed firm right to the last slurp... yumm.   The fried chicken went well with the ramen however I wish they had more veggie or chicken option, or they allowed replacing the beef in the curry ramen with chicken. I think they charged extra for the chicken but eventually I was happy to have got a comforting bowl of hot ramen on a cold night. The Yakisoba chicken noodles were also good but the ramen was better."}
{"text":"Only difficulty I had was finding parking..  but that's a given when you're trying to go anywhere downtown.. has nothing to do with the restaurant... now service was awesome.. quick with smiles..my server kept the tea pouring lol .. my food came out quick and was delicious.. hit the spot!! Thanks for a great lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Nested in DT Phoenix it is conveniently located and good location distance for evening dinner soup. Located near ASU and when other restaurants are closed this is a good place to order from and fast service. The curry, noodles and miso soups are delicious. However, the prices are high as $14 for a Ramen soup is too much for the size it delivers. Otherwise, good place for soup."}
{"text":"Didnt like their ramen. Period. My husband ordered curry ramen and his definition of the taste made me laugh! He said it's like the indian curry with noodles with diluted sauce. I ordered tonkotsu and it's okay. Nothing special to it. If you are gonna call yourself a ramen shop, you definitely have to invest in making your broth. There is a fine line between asian fusion and just putting stuff there and call it ramen."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I had the spicy ramen and a beer. Great for lunch and happy hour. Would return had great ambiance and food!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here to try a new Ramen restaurant before the J Cole concert. Not only is the food amazing, the servers are hilarious and very helpful. We needed to borrow a charger and not only did our server go and search for one, she put it in plain sight so that we could charge it before the concert!! Totally paid off because we met j cole after the concert!   On a food note--I am vegetarian and they worked with my dietary restrictions! Thank you!! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service was, well at best ok, but it was at least efficient. Half the menu was unavailable BUT lucky for us they had the half we were interested in albeit the appetizer we wanted was also out. So why 4 stars and not 3? It was the food. What we did get was so so damn good, it made us forget the rest."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience, I went here a few days ago because I wanted noodles in the area. I had ordered something like a clear broth noodles or something like that and it was disgusting. The broth was clear and okay appearance-wise but the smell was very average, didn't make me expect anything. What was the killer was the taste, there was absolutely no flavour other than the taste of salt and MSG. The meat was cut into PERFECT squares of even thickness which was dry and flavourless. It was so bad I felt like the salt squeezed all the water out of my throat and left a dry feeling. I don't recommend coming here ever. In addition, their waitress was very rude and rushing, she should learn more English because it didn't seem like she understood most of what I said either. When I asked for another menu (there were three of us), she came to take the order instead."}
{"text":"I'd love to give Noodle Bar a higher rating after hearing rave reviews from friends and coworkers, but I'm struggling to even give them 2 stars. My experience here spans two days:   On Tuesday night, I ordered take out through the Postmates app at 730pm. The order was accepted with no issues. At 815pm, the Postmates person texts me and says that \"I just got to Noodle Bar to pick up your food. Noodle Bar told me they are no longer accepting Postmates orders. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.\" I really want to try this place so I decide I'll just go pick it up. Five minutes later, at 820pm, I called Noodle Bar to place a pickup order. The lady on the phone tells me they close at 9pm and it's too late to order. Excuse me, you have 40 minutes to put together a bowl of ramen. How is this not possible?!? And, why are you on the Postmates app if you're not accepting orders?!  Fast forward to Wednesday. I've been thinking about Noodle Bar for the last 24 hours AND really want to give it a try. I call to place a pickup order of Shoyu ramen and bolognese pasta. The woman on the phone states that they aren't serving Italian food today. Why are they only offering Italian on certain days of the week? Their website doesn't say anything about this!! She says they can do the ramen and it will be ready in 5-10 minutes. Wait. A. Second. The ramen will be ready 5-10 minutes, yet you couldn't take my order yesterday when you had 40 minutes before closing? Whatever... I still order.   The to-go portion wasn't huge but it was a decent size meal. I was full when I finished it, but an hour later I was hungry again. The Shoyu ramen only comes with a very small serving of pork - three thinly slice pieces. In addition to noodles, there's half an egg, a slice of seaweed and some scallions. The broth is very flavorful and the hard boiled egg was cooked perfectly. For $13, I'd expect a larger portion and a more generous serving of meat. I don't want to be hungry again in an hour!  I doubt I'll be back. There are too many other restaurants in the Valley for me to waste my time with Noodle Bar.   -1 star, issues with Postmates order -1 star, issues placing to-go order -1 star, no Italian food served on Wednesday  -1 star, portion size and lack of meat  +2 stars, broth and egg were perfect"}
{"text":"Went to the noodle bar last night for dinner and had a really good meal. My boyfriend got ramen and it was delicious! We have gone to other noodle bars before and this was the best I've had in Phoenix. We also shared some great appetizers. We also had really good service. She was sweet and attentive. Over all really cute place."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. My wife felt stomach pain and could not eat anything other than coke, so they sent us extra coke for the road trip. Also the shoyu noodoI had is great."}
{"text":"nice place to have Asian noodles in soup, very delicious and we went there several times during our short stay in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Rest easy, Phoenix: We officially have an awesome ramen spot.  Being a valley dweller my whole life, I've been plagued with the absence of a good, local ramen place. Making the lengthy drive to Tempe's Republic Ramen for a large bowl of \"Okay, I guess\" was getting old, fast. Alas, Noodle Bar has come to Phoenix, bringing solace and tasty noodles to relieve us restless ramen folk.  Hyper authentic ramen? Not quite. Does that upset me? Hell no. Noodle Bar's broths and combinations are innovative and exciting. I've tried nearly every one of their ramen bowls and none have failed to impress me. I'm always psyched to go back and try another bowl. Not to mention they have other tasty Japanese soul-dishes like Chahaan rice.   This place is well on par with the likes of LA's Little Tokyo izakayas and yatai diners. If you're looking for that satisfying post-nosh belly rub, Noodle Bar is there for you."}
{"text":"A deeply confused restaurant on no fault of the servers. They serve both Japanese and Italian food based around noodle dishes. The concept seems shaky, but the food is even shakier. I ordered the Abura Soba and the girlfriend got the Torigara. The Torigara chicken ramen had an ok broth, but was largely unspectacular in total and was exceptionally oily. Regardless of how well you make your pork broth, or any broth for that matter, it should not be as oily as it was. Ok, so the ramen was mediocre, why 2/5? The Abura Soba was an absolute mess. The noodles were not soba, and the flavor was...off. Something didn't mix well. It could have been the awful lo mein taste, the lack of discernible flavor direction, or the horribly made noodles, but I'm not sure as I gave up trying to enjoy it after one bite.   It'd be different if Noodle Bar advertised themselves as making all in-house noodles, but to me, they certainly didn't look, nor taste it. They're eclectic and expensive with average portion sizes and I could not see myself back there. It's a poor restaurant concept and I would strongly suggest they refocus their attention on one genre. Awful... very very awful."}
{"text":"This was so delicious! My boyfriend and I went for lunch for the first time and absolutely loved it! The atmosphere was so calm and everything arrived at the table fairly quickly. The hostess was nice and so was the waiter! I got the Curry and can I say sooooo BOMB. I loved the flavor of the broth and the brisket. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is clean, cute & an ace. Four in my party dined here and made the happy hour; it's  3-6 daily. I ordered 4 of the 5 food items and will surely repeat the fried rice with shiitake mushrooms and the fried chicken. The cucumber salad was tasty but a bit spicy for me but I shared each plate. The last choice I made was the arugula salad, also very good. When I return I want my own curry ramen with short ribs, I sampled the hubs and it was flavorful. The 2 guests has a pork ramen she enjoyed and his dish was a pasta with meat also enjoyable. We concurred we'd all revisit this joint.  The service was friendly and helpful. It is so convenient to Symphony Hall, etc., can't wait munch here again, I'm salivating thinking about the food."}
{"text":"My favorite thing at the Noodle bar is their fried rice.  Go figure.  I like the Ramen too and they have a good selection of Ramen and pasta.  The place is a bit strangely laid out and if you use the restroom you have to navigate the back area boxes."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today.  Had to wait nearly 30 minutes to get our ramen, which is nuts -- put noodles in boiling water, wait 3-5 minutes, put into bowl, pour in soup and garnish; that should take 10 minutes tops.  Waitress got really salty with us when we asked about our order, and we later realized she made a mistake on our bill and charged us for a dish we didn't order.  We were in a hurry to get out of there, so we'll write it off as a learning experience in where not to go.  Aside from the poor service, the ramen soup and flavor were good, but serving sizes very small for the price.  The karaage (fried chicken) was a rip off ($8 for about five pieces of chicken a little larger than chicken nuggets).  If you just use larger bowls and give customers a bit more for their money, train the chefs to dish bowls and get them out in 15 min or less, and get rid of the bitchy hipster waitress, this would be a really good place."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I came to visit Phoenix and had to try the ramen when I saw it walking around downtown one day. The staff was very attentive and nice. I love the ambiance in the restaurant. It was a nice walk from the hotels close to the convention center. I ordered the cucumber tsukemono to start and it was tasty! Refreshing with a little kick from the rice wine vinegar. The chili threads gave it a nice crunch too. Then I order the spicy miso ramen. What I loved about it was how perfect it was. There was just the right amount of spice, meat, noodles, and broth. I've had ramen where it was a small bowl and I left still hungry. It was super flavorful and satisfying. Definitely recommended I have gone to places where I get maybe two pieces of meat and barely any noodles and ended up just having a ton of broth for dinner. But The Noodle Bar did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I had a very good vegetarian late lunch here. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful and they altered a menu item to accomodate my food desires. The meal I had was tasteful and healthy, well prepared with great presentation value. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Most delicious ramen I have ever eaten in my life! Not to mention the delicious fried rice is to die for. If you haven't been here, you need to go."}
{"text":"I was downtown for a training today and needed a place for lunch so I decided to try this place. I thought that it was strictly Asian and Ramen noodles but I quickly discovered they also served another one of my favorite cuisines. One side of the menu is Asian and the other side of the menu is Italian. I went ahead and opted for Asian and ordered the Gyoza appetizer while I reviewed the menu. When they arrived I was amazed by how tiny they were. I thought they were really cute but I have definitely had better. They were a tad too greasy and the taste was pretty plain. I definitely made use of the chili oil that was served with them to pump up the taste. I had opted for the Hakata Ramen and it arrived a short time later. Again it was OK but nothing to write home about. The pork was a little too fatty for my tastes and I thought the inclusion of the Ume plums just didn't feel right. One thing that I really did not care for was their restroom. It appeared that it may be a shared restroom with other restaurants in the vicinity and in addition to being very old and shabby, it was not kept up very well. So all in all it was an OK lunch but pretty pricey for what you get. If I worked in the downtown area it would not be a place I would frequent very often."}
{"text":"Yakisoba and special stir fried noodle with bbq pork.  Nicely done.  Worth returning."}
{"text":"Great spicy miso!   Service was great, food was delicious. Enough said, come and enjoy."}
{"text":"While we were waiting for our food during lunch today we saw a cockroach on the wall. We let the hostess know and she seemed unperturbed and said 'I don't see anything' and walked away. We let another waitress know since by this time the cockroach was strolling around on an empty table. Fortunately this waitress spent time to actually look and disposed of it. We're pretty reasonable and aren't going to get up and leave because of a cockroach but I feel like their presence should be something that the staff is concerned about."}
{"text":"Phenomenal broth and noodle consistency. The pork Chashu is what stopped my ramen from getting 5 stars. For someone who loves the fatty pieces, this was almost all fat and seemed under roasted, but it wouldn't stop me from coming back and trying ramen without Chashu. Fastest place I've ever been served ramen in the states by the way."}
{"text":"Talk about a place with great flavor. SPICY MISO RAMEN is Crayyyyyyyzzzzzzzzz. The staff is on it and super nice . Such a fun place . They also have a Great Italian menu ."}
{"text":"Absolutely would NOT recommend. If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would. Walking in the ambiance is horrifying, with loud music that almost sounds like you're in a club. Hostess chewing gum with an open mouth and handling food while doing so. Got the torigara which was served to me topped with ice cold, supposedly \"charred\" corn, and when I sent it back the chef poked at it to warm it and sent it right back to me rather than remaking it. Noodles very obviously not handmade. Manager, Kevin, was extremely unprofessional and even argued with me when I expressed my complaints to him. Will not ever be returning here and would advise everyone else to do the same. Disappointing, to say the least."}
{"text":"My sons favorite downtown restaurant for some time now. Today I understood why when I visited for the first time. Friendly and attentive service. We had the basic sake which was delicious. The shiitake fried rice may be the best I've had...no carrots and peas here! My son loved his happy hour fried chicken and raves about his ramen with a full rib in it. A fun, hip, tasty downtown restaurant when your in the mood for Asian or Italian noodles! The only draw back, not really any gluten free choices. I hope they will consider adding rice noodles and a miso based soup so it would be gluten free friendly!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant, went there before going to a concert. Good service, friendly serve and the meal was delish!"}
{"text":"Ramen worth the trip downtown! We go about once a month now, and I crave it in between. I love the shoyu and the hakata, and my hubby loves the spicy miso. I still haven't tried any of the Italian offerings, because I can't resist the ramen! The fried rice is very yummy, too."}
{"text":"Vibe is super cute and hip!   Started w the Papago orange blossom wheat and SO perfect for the Arizona heat - plus it makes me miss the San Diego beer scene so much! Followed w the lumberyard red which wasn't as good IMO, but still nice and refreshing!  Appetizers: -Karaage was good but super tiny nugget like portions  -Cucumber was also good but small non nugget like portions. Although more acceptable for a cucumber salad  -Arugula was great! The pancetta was perfectly complemented by the cranberries and the portion size was good!  Ramen: -Spicy miso: broth was best of the 3 I sampled. The noodles and veggies were also the best of the ramen I tried.  -Hakata: broth also pretty good and my friend seemed to enjoy it! -Sapporo.....Tbh I didn't love this. The broth itself was fine, but I don't think I like my chicken broths quite as much as pork. The butter noodles though.....really threw me off. I will not be getting this again.   And now I'm here again on the same day waiting to try the pasta selection w my bottomless pit of a stomach, so I'd say...this place is pretty good!  UPDATED MENU ITEMS (post symphony dinner): -Bolognese was delicious but I wish there was a little more sauce. -Cacciatore looked AMAZING. I wish I had as much sauce as this one...Majorly jealous and proceeded to eye this for dinner #2 -Yaki soba was not my fav bc I personally like a little more vegetable/meat in my dishes  OVERALL after this MASSIVE review, I'd def come back!!! Not so much for the Italian noodles, but I want a bowl of my own spicy ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Not great. I had such high hopes for a place specializing in noodles, but no. I got the vegetarian ramen and it has such a strange flavor and a fishy odor. My meat-eating lunch companions also tried mine (and also hated it). I only ate a few bites...   As for my friends, they also didn't particularly enjoy their ramen, though they thought it was better than mine. One was too salty and the other too fishy. The noodles are fine, though I personally prefer the alkaline ramen noodles with a bit more bite to them (just a fair warning if that's what you're expecting)."}
{"text":"Just spent thirty minutes finding a parking spot knowing they closed at 9. It was only me and I wanted a single bowl of ramen. I was told they would not serve me because their kitchen had closed early due to it being Tuesday night. Very uncool."}
{"text":"Pretty decent stop.  I was expecting a lot more of a casual scene, but it's at a moderate tempo between casual stop and dining.  The selection is pretty nice, but the price of it isn't that great.  A lot of regular places would serve the same portion for much less for each specific cuisine.  Still a nice place to get a noodle fix when you're desperate in town.  Chicken karaage is a highlight."}
{"text":"Date night spot where you want to a eat a little but not too much before going out.  Trendy upon first impression, depending what time of day you go.   Regular to the point where I only order the fettucine alfredo.   Their ramen was a little salty for my taste, but they may have backed off the sodium since I last tasted it, all good because the alfredo has proven fair enough to not take the risk many times.  Vibes are good, occasional live sax on the weekends. Good for takeout too."}
{"text":"The wait was 30 min even tho there were tables available...the hostess said she was not seating people because the kitchen was behind. So we left...but not before I asked her about vegetarian options---there's ONE on the menu...a bland-looking tofu dish. Everything else has meat and/or fish stock and sauce in it. That information is not listed on the menu. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone with allergies or limited diets."}
{"text":"So tonight was my first night in here and will definitely NOT be my last! I had the Hakata (not sure on spelling) ramen and I'm telling you it was BURSTING with flavor!!! Literally all my little taste buds just WAPOW punched with flavor all at once!!! Same with the pork fried rice. Just amazing!!! The pork in my ramen was MELT in your mouth good and I am not a big pork fan. I'm just sad it only came with two pieces. Can't wait to go back and try other things! Great food and very friendly service!"}
{"text":"In a rush, human beings tend to make bad life decisions--coming here was a bad life decision.  Unwary customers should note that this restaurant: - Doesn't give out small bowls at customers' requests because they claimed they \"don't have any.\"   - Staffs liked to pretend they do not understand Mandarin especially when it comes to requesting for items they should have i.e. bowls etc. (Because you know, pretending to not understand your native language can remove you from responsibilities such as providing adequate service to customers)  - Does not honour the 10% check-in discount (False advertisement should be removed)   We ordered: - Egg & chive dumpling: Had like around 5/12 dumplings that were cracked and leaking out fillings. Chives tasted fresh but the wrapping was too thick and doughy. Average at best.  - Lamb noodles had only 3 pcs of meat the size of small erasers (noodles were al-dente) and broth was bland. Nothing extraordinary.   - Beef noodles were served lukewarm, the broth tasted like lamb and all other meat is not entirely just beef. Honestly just meh  It all sums up to, if you want to be pay $12 for a regular bowl of noodle soup only to be treated like dirt, then this place will not disappoint! Will we return? The answer is hellz no! I can get pay less and receive horrible service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Although I was first wary that a noodle shop could successfully execute Italian and Japanese noodles, Noodle Bar showed that this was more than possible.  PROS: - Shoyu ramen: The pork was soft and the flavor permeated the meat, the noodles were chewier than usual (which I love), and the six minute egg was HEAVEN. I love eggs, and these were one of the best (I had to add extra egg). Good portion, too. - Cucumber salad: good level of vinegar, but could have a little more of a kick and be a little sweeter (though I could be biased, growing up with Taiwanese cucumber salad). Great little appetizer though.  - Ambience: the place is well-lit, with good music at a good volume, great service, and general good vibes all around.    CONS: - Spicy miso ramen: people seem to love this, and I generally love all things spicy. Unfortunately, I found the spicy miso ramen waaaaaaay too salty.  - Pomodoro: my s/o isn't super into Japanese food, so he ordered the pomodoro his first time. It tasted perfectly average.  - Curry noodles: it was a little soupier than we expected, and the pickled ginger (which I believe is also on the Hakata) was a little much. Not quite as fragrant as I'm used to. Next time, when I try the Hakata, I will make sure to ask to not have any pickled ginger."}
{"text":"The ramen here is so yummy! They have a lot of great choices and they also have Italian food but we haven't tried it yet! My boyfriend and I have come here five times in the last two months so far always late night ranging from 8-11pm. The service is excellent! We're always greeted and seated right away and the staff here are very accommodating, funny and kind! I switch between the Spicy Miso, Hakata Ramen and Shoyu--all of them warm your soul and have TONS of yummy flavor. The appetizers are also delicious; though the food does come out super fast!   This place is romantic with dimmed lights, and a lit candle adorning each table in the evening, not too much noise, no rush and intimate! It's definitely perfect for a first date or one thousandth date. I highly recommend this place! Try everything!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen noodles soup and trendy decor. It's definitely not the most authentic but it's good. Was a bit confusing for me because they serve ramen noodles and Italian pasta.  To use the restroom is a bit challenging because they share the restroom with other businesses in the same building. I was locked out after I used the restroom and wasn't able to go back to the restaurant. A nice gentleman from the catering business next door walked me troughs back to the restaurant, thanks to that gentleman.  It's funny right?"}
{"text":"Not the best ramen place. I know of better. Go elsewhere.  Not much flavor  although the noodles are all cooked pretty well.  But it's not worth my drive."}
{"text":"This is probably the best ramen i've ever tasted. I'm from LA but im just visiting Phoenix for a convention and I wanted to try Ramen and found this place! The broth is really good!!! Easy to find. Customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Unsat. Service was terrible and the beer was flat(probably just pored wrong) and the ramen was subpar to other local Japanese restaurants. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. They seat fairly quickly for how busy they can be. Their food is so delicious! Try the fried rice with pork. I have to add that the restaurant does present as clean, and maybe I just happened to get unlucky. Maybe one day I'll come back, for now I just don't have the stomach for Noodle Bar or spam musubi..."}
{"text":"Pretty average ramen and fried rice. Went in for lunch and it wasn't very busy but the service was slow. Over all lack luster experience."}
{"text":"The best ramen in Phoenix. My friends who don't steer out of American cuisine absolutely loved the food here too."}
{"text":"surprised at all the negative reviews because I had a good experience. Noodle Bar is basically like any other noodle place in the GTA right now. To be honest I'm not quite sure how so many have popped up and why they're so popular. In the end the noodles are the same, the broth, the meat...  Noodle Bar is in the Chatime Scarborough plaza and it's actually quite close to the Chatime itself. The sign is big and it's hard to miss. The inside is actually quite spacious and seating is fine. Service was standard and our waitress could speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin. The default seems to be Mandarin but when she realized we didn't speak it she switched. There actually is an English menu if you ask for one, contrary to what some reviews say here.  To be honest I don't even remember what I ordered - most of the menu items are very similar. We ordered a noodle bowl with beef brisket and one with sliced beef. The one with beef brisket had a much stronger taste (too salty for some) than the sliced beef one but both were okay. It came out steaming hot as you can see by the photo.  A little more expensive than your average noodle place but unfortunately there is just so much choice around that it's quite forgettable. I probably won't be back not because it wasn't good necessarily, more that there is always another option."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot in downtown Phoenix! Great vibe and stellar food!  Did I mention they have sake? I'm sold.  Can't go wrong.  I can see this being a hot spot.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"The combination of Japanese and Italian cuisin is very unique. Every ingredient is home made and special. The environment is cozy and fridendly. The food is delicious and affordable. This is the best noodle house in the town and definately deserves 5 star rating."}
{"text":"What an absolute sh t show of customer service. Fist acknowledge your client, accommodate said client and promptly service your clients needs. 101 of service. Its the third time Ive eaten at this establishment and the last. When three associates are setting up tables rather then serving a client a drink of water then they have their priorities all screwed up."}
{"text":"Some of the best ramen I've ever had. I had the spicy miso. The people I was with had Italian and they said it was okay, but the ramen was 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pasta noodles used for ramen is not bad. Broth is good. Ordered the hakata ramen. Could use more pork chashu. Only came with 2 medium thin slices of pork. Extra pork was $3."}
{"text":"My roommate and I came in for happy hour + ramen   one Thursday. The atmosphere and setting was really nice and we got sat and served quickly.   I got the curry ramen which came with beef (if you don't eat pork, there are only 2 ramen options available). The broth was very good and flavorful. The noodles were good as well, though I have had better. My only complaint about the ramen itself was the meat. It was a little tough & dry and would have been nicer if it were slightly juicier.   The drinks were at a very good price and they have happy hour on Saturday which is a plus. My only complaint with our server is when listing off the draft beers available, he felt necessary to categorize the \"more girly\" beers for us which we didn't really appreciate.   Overall: good happy hour & satisfactory ramen. I'd come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I LOVE noodles. This is basically my idea of a perfect restaurant. It's kind of like a Noodles & Company where you can get either Italian noodles or Asian noodles, but much classier and fancier. It was a really tough call, but I settled in getting the lemon herb fettuccine with roasted chicken, while my coworker tried the ramen. He said that the ramen was good, and my pasta was excellent! There was a bit too much chicken for my taste (since I'm really only here for the noodles) but I enjoyed it. We then both got green tea ice cream at the end, which was awesome. I would totally go back and try more noodles if I found myself in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Phoenix residents, you no longer need to wait for your next trip to California to satisfy that ramen craving.  We FINALLY have a DELICIOUS ramen spot. This place is not mediocre like the other ramen spots we have around the valley. Service was fast and super friendly! There are so many drink options both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. I think I'll have to try the Japanese soda next time...anyways, my boyfriend and I got the spicy miso ramen. It definitely cleared my sinuses right up...runny nose and all lol! The broth was so flavorful and the pork was perfect!  Their portion sizes are probably how much I SHOULD eat buuuut I eat way more than I should, so I would add more noodles and meat next time lol.  This place is open late too...I can already see the number on the scale go up! Haha  If you want some good ramen this is the place to go"}
{"text":"If you like spicy food try the Spicy Miso Ramen. It is so good I have been dreaming about it.  The restaurant itself is cozy and hip. Service was attentive and welcoming. It has an interesting take that has two different regions of cuisines united under a single ingredient, Noodles. Because of this strange pairing you can get Italian or Japanese food which is odd but I think pretty interesting in practice. It allows for plenty of options instead of having to stick with one menu. Prices are reasonable for downtown and the wait was short.  I plan to return to try out some other dishes but for now I will stick to the Spicy Miso on my next few visits. So good!"}
{"text":"This place is unsanitary. The chicken was so dry and maybe overcooked because it was SPOILED it has disgusted me to no end. Will never return."}
{"text":"we came here since I tend to always get a bit home sick and need to get my fixing of Asian food. we ordered 2 Ramen dishes, the first one was a Spicy Miso Ramen and the other one was the Sapporo Ramen. Each ramen bowl has eggs, green onion, pork belly. the prices are pretty reasonable for ramen and the portion size is average not to large but not to small. The decor seems to be urban modern. there was no wait time here and the staff were very good at checking in throughout the course of the meal. Only wish was that they offered a complimentary side dish. Our ramen took longer than we anticipated and wasn't really updated about it. Overall the food was good and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"More than decent! The ramen noodles are actually authentic japanese noodles.  They do a great job with the Cha Su and other toppings but the broth :( ( I chose Tonkatsu, pretty much a staple for all Ramen places) was oily and thick.  Not salty, and really didn't taste like Tonkatsu.   Some other great ideas on the menu for Ramen as well.    And really great service!  -1 Star because 1/2 the menu is dedicated to Pasta/Italian food.  And super busy at lunch time during the week (wait times of 15-20 minutes)"}
{"text":"Had a blast at Noodle Bar! The environment was great. The staff was friendly. The chef was amazing. Our waiter Jonas aka Jodeci was the best. He was personable and very knowledgeable. His smile is infectious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"FYI this place no longer serves their Italian menu, super bummed about that. That was what I was looking for but when they gave me the menu I thought half my menu was missing. I asked about it, and they said they no longer serve the Italian menu. Only the ramen."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix this week and tried this place for the first time. Ordered the potstickers from the happy hour menu and chicken torigara ramen for dinner. It was pretty good ramen, nice and flavorful. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good ramen dish. Their menu also has some Italian pasta dishes and other Japanese dishes also."}
{"text":"We just came here for appetizers. The food was really good, especially the salad and Ramen. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"WOW! Discovered a new place to eat in downtown Phoenix! Food was very good and the prices are very reasonable! Definitely will be coming back to this place!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant since it originally opened as Otakumen a couple of years ago. I've seen its ups and downs and feel like they're now truly in the swing of things. The good news is that their ramen is delicious. I usually get the Hakata and my guy gets the spicy miso. Both are incredibly tasty and it's probably the best ramen in Phoenix.   But, the bad news lies in the management and employees of the restaurant. I've been to this place many times and I've repeatedly told myself \"maybe things will be better next time.\" But I've had enough. On one occasion, the restaurant was empty except for two other tables and when the host took us to a small table, we asked if we could sit at a larger one. The host said no and continued to seat us at the small table. That was odd...   Then on another occasion, we arrived at the restaurant at 9 pm (knowing it closed at 10 pm that night) and were turned away because the manager didn't want anyone else to be seated. We had just seen the hostess seat a group before us, so we were a bit taken aback. There's also been countless times the servers were disorganized, the management was curt, and regular menu items were sold out (in the middle of the day). Overall, the ramen is great, but the employees and management need to be streamlined and more professional."}
{"text":"Ramen was decent. The Hakata was good but I feel it was too oily. I didn't like the noodles. The spicy ramen was okay. Asked for light spicy but it was still pretty spicy. It didn't seem like they had many different options of spice. Love that they have beer here! The service was quick and server was friendly."}
{"text":"Their menu has changed for the millionth time. All ramen is pork based now. I went with the potato gnocchi. I paid $13 for a kids meal."}
{"text":"Was excited to try out a new downtown noodle spot but was left disappointed in the portion sizes for the price. Ordered the Alfredo dinner portion at lunch and it was comparable to a snack size or an appetizer portion.   While they are new to downtown, I envision some growing pains & hope they find he right mix."}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen try Curry  and spicy one , one of the best restaurant in downtown of you like noodles ."}
{"text":"Dope! It looked nice and the food came quick. I liked the noodles and our waitress was so sweet. I'd love to come again."}
{"text":"Gimme all the noodles.   I'll be back for the Italian stuff, I'm already loving the ramen and gyoza. Super simple to order 'n eat.   It's great to have new option for lunch while downtown for work meetings!"}
{"text":"Great place with lots of options. All the food is fresh. They ran out of gnocchi which was disappointing, but I got a fettuccine dish that was delicious. Not too expensive."}
{"text":"I've been to noodle bar once before my last visit. Last I was here, we had 2 pasta dishes and both were generous portions. We were even able to take some left overs home! I can't remember our servers name but she was great. Seems as though she was the only one on the floor and getting smashed with tables. I recommend starting off with the polpettas. Tasty and easily feeds 1-2. For our entrees we had the Amatriciana and the potato gnocchi. 2 out of the 6 items listed under entrees were no longer available dude to new menu changes. No big deal. A good 35 minutes goes by and we finally get our food. You should have seen the portions that were given to us... it only took 4 bites for me to be finished with my meal and my boyfriend finished his in the same amount of time. Needless to say, we were still starving after we were done. Being in the restaurant industry, we let our waitress know she was fantastic and understood they were short staffed. We also mentioned that we had come here before and the portions were much bigger. She let us know they were making some menu changes and that she would bring it up to the kitchen. Everything was delicious... however, we won't be coming back. It's embarrassing to spend $12-14 on such a small portioned dish.. Oh, and manager never came by once to apologize or say anything at all. Don't see myself ever returning!"}
{"text":"The shishido peppers and fried chicken dish were awesome. I got the tomi taro ramen and my husband tried the spicy miso ramen. Both were excellent. This was a good pick."}
{"text":"Nice little place with good options to choose from. They did not have any pastas or Karaage chicken when I went in. Although the short rib was my favorite. Probably go again during the day to catch that karaage chicken. Worth a shot! Mostly all the ramen dishes are pork."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Try the Hakata Ramen. Not sure where to park. I work downtown so I walked here. Nice walk if it's not 1000 degrees out. Would come here again for sure."}
{"text":"The sapporo noodles were amazing! Perfect blend of garlic & ginger in the noodles & broth.  The Yaki Soba was good but not mind blowing like the Sapporo.  Good service & selection of beers/wine."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good atmosphere and modern look.  I was a bit hesitant as it's a combination Italian, Japanese Noodle Place.  I decided to go with a Ramen Plate and I have to admit it did not disappoint.  The ingredients were fresh and noodles delicious. A good portion for the price.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"Such a dope spot, the noddles are imported and the broth is made from scratch! It's worth paying for parking. Crystal always waits on us and is more than helpful with explaining the menu and offering up new suggestions. They even accommodated my three year old with the Torigara Ramen. Which she loved! I got the Spicy Miso Ramen and let's just say Mi-So happy I did because it was packed with so much flavor and the broth was spot on! Don't sleep on this hidden gem in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Holy deliciousness! I was at a gift show downtown and a friend suggested we go! We had about a 20 minute wait, but boy was it worth it! I loved every single flavor that was mouth watering in my spicy miso ramen! I seriously have been craving it ever since. I'll be going back next time I'm downtown. Small place, excellent and mouth watering ramen! They also have an Italian menu as well."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for a couple shows and decided to try out this restaurant that supposedly \"specializes\" in Italian pasta and ramen.   We were greeted and seated with drinks and even able to put our orders in in a timely manner. We were the first group of people in for dinner time so we thought it wouldn't take long for our food. Our appetizers were brought to our table pretty quickly.   Our waitress came over to our table 3 times to fill our water glasses but no acknowledgement on when it came to the status of our food. We sat there for 45 minutes waiting for our main dishes. There were a couple of guys who were seated behind us that didn't even get their water glasses until at least sitting there for 20+ minutes. None of the 5 serves seemed to want to grab their order. I saw a few of them look over at the guys but then continued with whatever it was they were so \"busy\" with, without even letting them know that they are aware of the guys presence.   Once we finally got the food, no one came over to check in with us on how our dishes were not did anyone apologize to us for such a long wait (mind you, there were about only 3 other small parties of 2-3 in the restaurant with us.)   Their ramen is sub par and isn't worth all this waiting around blankly. I ordered the shoyu and it tasted like it was made from an instant soup base instead of the long hours of prepping and simmering (is that the proper term?). I'm a big fan of ramen and frequenting SoCal and even Las Vegas they have better ramen that what this place was serving.  If you want to broaden horizons and share delicious food with the world, make sure you do it right and take no short cuts."}
{"text":"Service was great!   but they were out of almost everything? (it was weird, like half their menu was un-order-able?)  I got the spicy miso, it wasn't bad.  It's just I was expecting a more hearty ramen bowl.  I've been too a few ramen places in phoenix and this was pretty mediocre.    I will say the restaurant was cool and server were helpful.  I can only recommend this place if you really want to try ramen in downtown phoenix. If not, then go somewhere else.   Downtown has much more to offer."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when I came here but I had heard good reviews from a few of my friends and so I went on a Thursday afternoon around 1pm with 2 other friends. It was pretty slow and we were seated right away. The lighting and decor was very nice and clean (great for taking those insta pics :P) I ordered the Hakata Ramen with an added egg for 50 cents. I really love tonkatsu and didn't know what to expect. The ramen came out fairly quickly and it looked really good! The only concerning thing for me was the broth looked really oily, which I'm not used to seeing the separation of the oil but overall flavor and texture was good. It wasn't too rich or too salty. The ramen noodles were cooked well, not too chewy but also not soggy. The chashu was flavorful and tender. The soft boiled egg was also very good.  My friend ordered the spicy miso ramen which is also a popular choice. It was definitely not what I expected the broth to taste like but it had a strong chili pepper spice to it rather than a deeper boiled in spicy that I've experienced at other ramen places. But he really loved it and said he would definitely get it again!  Overall this place has pretty good ramen located in downtown Phoenix where I'm sure there are plenty of other things to do nearby. Parking was fairly easy to get and if I ever had a friend come visit, I'd consider taking them here."}
{"text":"The Mrs wanted ramen, so we hit this sweet spot.Tried the Fried chicken app and Spicy ramen. Both were exceptional. From the broth being spicy but not overpowering to the egg being done perfectly.. I wanna go back- get some pasta and more ramen!  Tyler, our waiter was awesome. Professional, personable, and just a cool guy. Doesn't get better than that...  But it did, because when we asked about getting great pizza he referred us to two great guys sitting at the table next to us. Picture a young Charlie Sheen (like Major League) and an older gentleman of leisure  who know their sh##! Per their recommendation we are off to Forno 301 now!"}
{"text":"worst customer service and whoever answered the phone to take phone orders does not even know the menu and doesn't even bother to CHECK the menu before telling a customer what is \"safe\" to order. If you are the manager of this place, you need to hire better staff. I'd rather wait for accurate information than have someone guess.  I specifically asked what ramen does not include pork, the girl answered \"I'm pretty sure the only one is the shoyu, so you should order the shoyu\". I asked can you makr sure there's no pork in there? Come to find the menu online after I ordered and see the order when I picked it up that it had chunks of pork in it. And when I pointed out the pork all they did was use their hands (possibly wearing gloves) to pull out the pork and give it back to me. I asked for them to make it again to the issue that for religious reasons or if I were to be a person with allergies that they should be making another order."}
{"text":"First time here. A coworker and I stopped in for lunch. It was super busy, not an empty seat in the house. The hostess was nice. Our server seemed over extended and did her best to accommodate all her tables. My 2 star rating pertains to the food. I ordered the lasagna and it was awful. For the price paid I had high expectations. The entree consisted of a plain, burnt big layer of noodles that had grill marks on it. I was turned off by the burnt grill marks but being hungry and not wanting to leave my coworker eating alone I forced myself to pick out the saucy meat and managed to eat that along with a couple bites of the noodle. It would have been nice if at minimum a small side were included with the meal. On a better note my coworker liked her spicy misu noodle soup bowl. I personally thought it looked gross. There was an odd colored 1/2 boiled egg floating in it. Perhaps there are other items that are good here as the place was busy. I hear their happy hour is great."}
{"text":"Visited the place two times while on a business trip.  Had tonkotsu ramen and chicken karaage the first time for lunch and spicy miso ramen and the appetizer pork fried rice the second time for lunch.  Didn't expect much, but I was very impressed.  I'm from NYC and this place outdid the several places that I have frequented in the city.  The ramen was done very well. Portions were just right and the preparation and taste were very good. And while ramen isn't actually too \"authentic\" these days owing to the fact that it's very popular and trendy, this place didn't go overboard.  Service was OK, but the staff could have been a bit more aware, diligent, and responsive during lunch. Dinner time, the place did get a bit busy and the wait staff did its best to keep up. Not much to complain.  The appetizer fried rice portion during happy hour was huge. At the happy hour price of $5, it cannot be beat and was a meal in itself.  Beer selection was very good and the pricing was very good, especially since I'm used to exorbitant NYC prices.  I would go back.  The place does Italian pasta as well. Didn't try, but this place is a go to place for ramen.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just came in from Los Angeles for work so I was starving. Found this place on Yelp. I was a bit hesitant as it's a ramen AND Italian restaurant but the reviews were promising. I ordered the hakata ramen, added an egg and karagge chicken.   Karagge chicken was plump and juicy but lacked any real flavor. I almost asked for a salt and pepper shaker. The accompanying aioli wasn't anything special. Just mayo with some sesame seeds.  The ramen broth lacked depth. Portion size is questionable considering the price even considering pricing in Los Angeles at legit authentic Japanese ramen places. That extra $1 I paid for the egg? You only get HALF an egg. Chashu was bland. Noodles were a little too soft for my liking but that's just personal preference."}
{"text":"THE BOMB.COM .. the price matches the taste. The appetizers were off da hook and had us looking foward to the entree. I ordered the Spicy Miso and others had different dishes that were delish. We had no complaints about quality, texture or taste of the food thatwe ordered nothing but compliments. I commended The Manager, Dave Green and apologized to him over and over again as I once, swore this place off. He and his staff were very professional, as well as busy but maintained and served in adequate time. I have no complaints,, problems or issues with the Noodle Bar its staff or food. I wanted to try everything and order on the menu except for \" Thankyou Please Come Again\" it was that damn good. There was a time I was indifferent about this place. Shortly after it opened. When this spot opened  under Pat and Waldos. I was excited to finally have a ramen or noodle spot I couldnt wait to try it. I went in there in the 3rd day they were opened the place was empty, and there was a reason for it. It was horrible, the fried rice had the texture and tade of oatmeal and I did a better job with a cup of noodlesor 10 cent bag.  IF YOU ARE SCARED TO GO BACK AFTER 1 BAD EXPERIENCE, PLEASE, GO BACK AND TRY IT AGAIN YOU WILL BE SURPRISED!"}
{"text":"A-MAZING! I lived in San Francisco for 3 years and never even had Ramen this good there. I have only been twice and got the Torigari Ramen each time, and I added roasted corn to it. SOOOO GOOD. The meat practically melts in your mouth, the noodles are cooked to perfection, and the broth is FULL OF FLAVOR. Service was great as well. I would absolutely recommend this place. I can't wait to go back so I can try some of their Italian food also."}
{"text":"if I could eat here every day I would. So much variety but everything is great!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service if they're open to serve you. System constantly crashing resulting in random closings!"}
{"text":"This Ramen was absolutely fantastic. Some of the best I've had in a long long time. I have definitely found my new go to place for noodles"}
{"text":"Great food, fun vibe! Their food is consistently yummy and well presented. My waitress Chantel was really attentive and sweet. I got the raviolo and the salsiccia solo - both were excellent. I'll definitely be stopping in for lunch again soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Hakata ramen and substituted the noodles for the noodle they use in the spicy miso ramen... soooo delicious!!!! I wish they had wooden chopsticks vs the plastic kind, would make it much easier for eating, especially when I'm too stubborn to use a fork This place offers an intimate dining with a very welcoming entrance and greeting! Also wish they hd edamame on the menu... but the ramen is super yummy!!!! Don't forget to add the extra soft boiled egg and extra meat"}
{"text":"I found this place quite intriguing in the sense that you could choose from either Italian or Asian style noodles. I am a fan of both ethnic cuisines, so this was an obvious choice for my group of friends who could not decide on what type of food to eat.  I ordered the Curry Ramen and substituted the Beef for Chicken with no problems. The flavor was amazing, perfectly spiced and the portion was impressive.  My friends ordered the Tori Toma Ramen, Spicy Miso and Pomodoro pasta and they all had great things to say about their selections.  As for small plates we ordered the Chahan Fried Rice with chicken to share and let me tell you this is not a small plate! It could easily be a full meal. It was delicious and the flavor was not overpowering or oily like most fried rice I am used to having back home.   The staff was friendly and even though we came in close to closing they did not show one bit of disappointment to keep the kitchen open a little longer.  Good food, good service and staff!"}
{"text":"Coming from Orange County, I have specific expectations when it comes to ramen.  While my coworkers wanted something warm on a cool day, they found Noodle Bar.  Upon glancing over the menu, I noticed that there are several options on noodles from various cuisines.  If I'm not mistaken, this establishment focus on Italian and Japanese noodle dishes.  Interesting combo but I'm always adventurous when it comes to food.  I ordered the Hakata Ramen with Extra meat and shoyu egg.  When the bowl was placed in front of me, I was still skeptical on its ability to amaze me.  Presentation looks familiar and the choice of bowls was even thought out.  My sense of smell did trigger familiar memories of prior ramen experiences as well.  Then I examine the egg and how it was cooked.  This is a big deal for me on technicality in terms of cook, presentation, and flavor.  It was surprisingly spot on! I sampled the soup and it was bold.  I slurped the noodles and consistency is pretty darn good.  I gave the bowl a toss and dash in some chili spice.  It rocked!  To think that I doubted its ability to compete against heavy hitters in OC. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish to bottom of the bowl.  I can't want to visit here again and sample their other dishes to see how well their fare.    I would recommend this place for ramen if the craving strikes.  As for other dishes, only time will tell but in terms of ramen, its a worth a visit.  Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did."}
{"text":"Yo, Fam, this spot is fire fire fire, bomb-sauce, lit woke flame, high key-swag   Start w the Raviolo. Please. Your future children are even saying Please. They need you to consume these nutrients and this magic, embody it, and pass it on into their genes. Who else can they count on but you? If you don't do that for them, do you even love your future children?  Anyways, other things i ate were bomb too. FOR INSTANCE- the yaki soba and the abura soba were both flame swoll. Soba is the new soda. I was especially a fan of the abura soba because it is no-nonsense (just like me). Its essentially just a poached egg, some noodles, and little pork bits (just like me). There's a velvet beauty to its simplicity (just like me).   Next time (and there will be a next time), I need to hit up more of the italian options. If they are anything like the Raviolo, Noodle Bar may hold the answers to world peace.   Support World Peace."}
{"text":"Got a tiny portion of bolognese pasta for $14. I was actually insulted when I saw the food. If it was an appetizer for 1, I would have understood. I will say the pasta was fresh, and very good, but even if I was in an airport, I would have thought this food was a rip off. The table behind us, some co-workers, has 3x the portions I did, in that their bowl was actually full. The good news is they had a tasty beer, server was okay, but didn't deliver the food, nor check on us. I had to ask for cheese with my bolognese, and the bread was not good nor tasty. This was a fail, and if I thought they would serve this portion again, I would NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!   I really don't understand why both me and my dining companion got so short changed, but they might have thought we were tourists and could get away with it, at least that's what it felt like. If you disrespect me personally, I take it very personal, which I feel was the intent. The server should have checked on our food (the place is not many tables on a Wednesday night) and call out the kitchen staff for the insulting portion they put out tonight. I would never serve this portion to someone unless I wanted to see if I pull one on them. Also, he should been there with the cheese and or it should have been offered when the food was delivered, instead of us having to ask. If everything was done right tonight I would have been happy to provide 4 stars, as this is 100% something that is controllable, but tonight was the wild west of dining for me, and I am not happy to write this!"}
{"text":"Really cool place! I had never been to a ramen restaurant before, Noodle Bar was a hit. I was starving after going to science with a twist at the science center, and was glad to see this place I had just bookmarked was walking distance and open late!  I thought it was cool they had both ramen and Italian pasta options. I wanted to try something new so decided on the vegan ramen and made it not vegan by adding an egg.  The portion was huge! Too much for me to eat, which is rare. Everything tastes really fresh too. The vegetables, tofu, and noodles were all a delicious combination in the broth. The broth was a little salty to just have a spoonful on its own, but otherwise really good! Prices aren't too bad either. Service was great too! Got our food quick and they never forgot about us despite the huge party of people that came in haha. I haven't tried many restaurants in the downtown Phoenix area, but I have to say this is one of my new favorites there."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I've got to say things have taken a real downturn. In a revamp of the menu they got rid of the one vegetarian ramen on the menu. That ramen was some of the best I've found in the valley! Service has also really declined- last time I went our server was standoffish about questions and was not polite. The staff tends to congregate near the soda machine which looks very unprofessional. This used to be one of my favorite places downtown, but unfortunately I will not be back."}
{"text":"I had an awesome birthday experience here. The service was great. I had the Yaki Soba which is a very tasteful vegetarian dish. I will definitely be returning. Sadly they got rid of the Shishito peppers... Hence the missing star. Great place though, remodel looks awesome. Ramen is very good, probabky best in downtown but yaki soba is by far my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen! Awesome appetizers. Great service. I wish we had one of these in so cal!"}
{"text":"I was excited to stop at  the Noodle Bar for some ramen, but I left a little disappointed.  The restaurant is warm and inviting, though a little confusing, now that the two restaurants have combined. Our server was extremely friendly, and he patiently answered my many questions. I tried the chicken karaage - the breading was very soggy and the chicken was pretty fatty. I also tried the shishito peppers - these were a little crispy, but bland. For entrees we ordered the torigara and the la machaca. The torigara broth was flavorful, but a little on the oily side and the chicken was lacking in texture and flavor. The la machaca had very small burnt pieces of what I think was beef in a very salty broth, I wouldn't try it again. The best part were the noodles, they had a pretty nice chewy texture. I may go back and try something new. The Italian entrees smelled pretty good, but it will be a little while before I make it back."}
{"text":"Had a large group of people to appease and the Noodle Bar offering both Japanese and Italian was a good option. However we went so late at night (around 9pm) that they were completely sold out of the Italian side of their menu. Everyone in our party still managed to find something they enjoyed.   Everyone in the group ordered a different type of ramen, and all left happy. I went with the Tonkatsu ramen, and it was delicious. Enjoyed the woodear mushroom touch.The waitress kindly brought me some chile flakes and paste for the side to add some heat. We really LOVED the gyoza, tasty and tender.   The music was loud, but I guess for a downtown place on a weekend that may be a normal thing. Seemed like overkill given the small amount of people that were in the restaurant at the time. We had to yell over each other to keep conversation. Bathrooms were gross, it was the kind that is shared in a back hallway with other businesses. Décor was very cute, fun things to look at throughout restaurant.  I would definitely go again when in the area.  Looking forward to trying the Italian side of the menu."}
{"text":"Quality noodle bar. I have had better, but can't go wrong with this place. We had the appetizer of gyoza with the hakata and spicy miso ramen. All were good, but we both preferred the Hakata to the spicy miso.   I suggest trying this place. Can't go wrong with anything it seems."}
{"text":"pro: the food is really good. The customer service is great as well.  Con: it is right at downtown so it's a big challenge to find a parking."}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere, exceptional service, good food, great first time Ramen experience (Try The Sapporo or spicy Ramen, also gyoza is really good)  Would definetly come back and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Really devious food. Good happy hours. Monday-Friday 3-7 pm.   $4 for fried rice during happy hour. Menu said small plate, but it's big. Tasty and fatty. It was good but not for health option  Aruba soba was also good. It's oily.   Great services."}
{"text":"The noodle soup is too oily and not much flavor but salty. The beef is overcooked, hard as rock, not tender not soft.  The hot sauce is dry and not spicy. 8 bucks for a small noodle like this?  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent miso ramen and happy hour!  The restaurant is hip looking and I liked the fact u can go with someone who'd like Italian pasta instead and still can enjoy a meal together"}
{"text":"I'll give this place a solid 3 stars. I liked the decor a lot.  Ramen was actually just ok to me, went out of our way to come due to reviews. A little disappointed but I also have something to compare it too as it's not my first intro to Ramen.  So far none I have tried in phx have touched what I used to get back home  in chi town (sad face).  Ok food wise I had the traditional ramen and the kiddo had the spicy miso (she enjoyed hers). I tried her broth but it was still just ok to me.   So overall ok...I would possibly try again one day but won't go out of my way to drive 28 mins.   Still on the hunt for that yummmm factor when it comes to Ramen."}
{"text":"Noodle Bar is a mix of Japanese and Italian cuisine, two of my favorite types!  Being a ramen fanatic, a stop at one of the local ramen shops is always required when we're traveling!  After getting a few recommendations that led to Tampopo Ramen in Tempe but not being impressed with pictures of their food, we ended up here.  Plus, these guys were located super close to our hotel.    ATMOSPHERE: Décor is very modern.  High ceilings, big windows, warm colors with contrasts of bold red liven up the space.  Two open-view kitchens are adorned with a mix of high and low tops.  MENU: Japanese & Italian apps, five flavors of ramen, Italian pastas, dessert, sake, wine.  Their menu has changed dramatically within the past year according to photos.  FOOD: Shoyu Ramen - $12.00 I was planning on trying the Sapporo Ramen (red miso) but it sadly got axed.  No problem as I love me some shoyu ramen!  The broth was hot but not searing, dark in color with medium boldness and a slightly bitter aftertaste, unbeknownst why.  The straight noodles were perfectly chewy.  Thin and tender slices of chashu, half of an unseasoned medium egg, bamboo shoots, green onions and a nori square topped the bowl.  Not the best I've had but still good.  SERVICE: Justin was our friendly and professional server.  We walked in on a Saturday night about an hour prior to closing and they were very slow.  Food delivery was quick.  TIPS: Come at least an hour prior to closing.  I overheard someone telling the staff that they can close 20 minutes prior to the posted hours since it was a slow night.  Our server Justin informed me that the Sapporo Ramen would return as a special soon.  Too bad I don't live in AZ as I would've loved to have tried it.  OVERALL: What a great concept of blending two cuisines into a sole biz.  Nice digs, good food & service.  If we're ever back in the 602, we'll definitely return."}
{"text":"The pickled cucumber appetizer ain't bad.   Unfortunately, I was hoping to get some noodles. I came in to grab what was supposed to be lunch with a coworker, until I asked if they have a veggie option for noodles. Our server told us that wouldn't be possible because all the noodles are cooked with animal broth. I opted for the salad instead. Only problem is they didn't have any salad (even though it was on their menu) because it doesn't exist in the summer since they can't generate enough business to support their normal Japanese/Italian menu.  (As told by our server)  So the only option was the pickled cucumber, which was great but definitely didn't hit the spot. Typically, I'm not picky but this is the first restaurant I've been to without any veggie options. The food seems yummy and if they added at least one vegetarian noodle option, I'd love to come back."}
{"text":"Came in last Monday and it was a little slow, was surprised when they told us they might be out of they're pasta dishes, even though we were there to try out their ramen.  Service was great and our orders came out quick. Presentation of the ramen gets them 5 star woo"}
{"text":"Authentic!  Well thought and executed.  The Ramon is on point however the handmade pasta is fantastic.  Been back a couple times and will continue to come back!  Great sake program and interesting wine program."}
{"text":"Food and service was way better the second time around. The staff really wanted to make up for the time before and even the new manager and chef came to see how we were doing. The food was good and I loved the new dessert the chef gave us to try out. I forgot the name, but it was between a pudding and jello. It was light but full of flavor and the ginger flavor really tied the whole thing together."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a 0 star review. After MONTHS of asking my boyfriend to come here with me, we finally made it out again. We had been there a few times and I loved their fettuccine alfredo. The service and food had always been impeccable, this is the reason why I wanted to come back in the first place. So today we both happened to be free for a late lunch so we went on down . BIG MISTAKE. Apparently, the management in the restaurant had changed and so did the menu since we had been there. The first thing the waiter asked us is had we been here before , we said yes. Then I had tried to order the shishito peppers and the waiter said they didn't have those anymore. We ordered the cucumber appetizer instead. I attempted to order the SAME thing I've ordered every single time I had been there previously... the chicken fettuccine alfredo. The waiter failed to mentioned that the chicken dish he put in for me was not the same as before. As a matter of fact it wasn't fettuccine Alfredo at all. Let's stop right here and assess- if you were a waiter here and knew that the menu had changed in the last four months and someone who had confirmed being here before ordered something that had changed on the menu ... would you be courteous enough to tell them that the particular item has changed? Well not our HORRIBLE waiter. He just carried on and brought me out the new dish. Okay whatever, I guess I should have read the menu more closely and magically have known the menu changed (sarcasm). I attempted to eat the dish and take accountability for not reading the menu closely .... I am not a picky eater but the chicken was dry, over cooked, no flavor, tasted and smelled old. I took one bite but stopped myself before I puked. I tried to eat just the noodles but they were dry and tasted like sand paper. My boyfriend felt bad and insisted that I order something else and called over the waiter.  I told the waiter this wasn't what I expected nor did it taste good AT ALL. The waiter who perhaps was having a bad day, was unapologetic and asked me if I wanted a box for it to take it home.... UM no, I just got done telling you that I did not like it . I wouldn't even feed that trash to my dog. The waiter and left and came back promptly saying that unfortunately the manager was not going to comp the meal because it was the most expensive dish they make ( even though the dish was gross and practically untouched ). The fact that he was gone for 2 minutes \"talking \" to the manager very clearly told me that they probably have had this issue before. I then told the server never mind I don't want anything else because at that point he had the worst attitude I had ever experienced at a restaurant . When I told him nevermind , he literally smirked at me and scoffed \"PERFECT\". WOW I have never experienced a less caring waiter it was obvious he had a bad day. Now if I thought this guy was rude , I was in for a surprise.....  Here comes \"General manager \" Kevin White. He had no time to hear about how horrible his waiter was . He was basically demanding that we pay for the food that I barely tasted. Okay, that's fine I do not care I'll pay for it. All I wanted was an apology for the poor service. Nope, this guy refused to acknowledge his staff's incompetence and poor tasting food. He continue to stand there and argue with me over how this was my fault and insult my intelligence saying It's not his fault I did not read menus, and also say just because a dish isn't satisfactory to a customer that doesn't mean he should have to cover it, saying he \"orders food all the time that he doesn't like but he always pays in full for it\".  My boyfriend was shocked at their aversion to even consider offering to comp this inedible dish, and when asking them if the $6-8 cost of goods for the dish they would lose by comping was worth losing our business for ever and that it's hard to understand how they wouldn't consider taking care of it the manager insultingly snapped back with attitude asking \"you a manager or have you ever run a restaurant\".  Is this guy for real???  I tried explaining over and over again that what I VERBALLY ordered and communicated with the waiter was previously on the menu and I assumed it was still on there considering the waiter never said anything when I order . Not ONCE did he accept partial responsibility for the problem on behalf of his horrible waiter and he definitely never apologized for the disgusting food that was brought out to me. It's very clear that this manager could not care less about his customers . I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant in my life . I guarantee if the owner would have witnessed these interactions she/he would have been deeply embarrassed from the lack of respect, manners, and customer service that occurred this day . NEVER AGAIN . Not only did Noodle Bar lose a customer but I am sure the observing customers were also disgusted by Mr. Kevin White's behaviors as a \"manager \" as well ."}
{"text":"My mom highly recommended this place so I decided to come here for lunch. Service was courteous but slow, considering it wasn't that busy. We had to ask for various items twice.   My mom thinks the menu has changed.  I ordered the lamb noodles house special at 11.99, while my husband ordered fully cooked beef noodles at 9.99. My parents ordered the cold chicken noodles at $8.  Portion sizes were a little on the smaller side.    Overall, I thought the food was average.  The lamb noodles were tasty but lacked any kick or anything special to them, same with the beef noodles. Surprisingly, I liked the cold chicken noodles best. They seemed to be the most flavourful menu item that we ordered.   Would I return? Maybe."}
{"text":"We walked in because the restaurant we were trying to go to was closed. So maybe it was our fault.   The restaurant serves noodles, ANY noodles. Where it Chinese or Japanese or Italian. While it is a nice concept, the broad range, means that things will taste mediocre at best.   I ordered the chicken ramen and it was okay. The soup flavor was okay, but the broth wasn't very hot and it was also extremely oily. I get that ramens like tonkotsu ramens are a little more on the oily side because pork is oily but chicken isn't that oily and you should be skimming off the top fat layer as the broth is cooking. Also the noodles were very stiff. I understand that the noodle are suppose to be made in house but the noodles weren't made very well. Japanese ramen noodles are suppose to have bounce and chew to them but I think they thought that meant rigid?  My bf got some udon/soba stir-fry that wasn't good at all, I had a bite and it tasted like the crappy chinese food you get delivered on Monday night.   Overall the service was nice, the food was ok (or at least mine was), for the price, I also expect more than some chicken and bean sprouts and an egg. I would like to see a little more color.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Noodle bar was delicious. The food took a little bit long, but that was okay because I've been craving some authentic ramen and I got it. The venue is no as others are saying, but it still could be good for groups. The tonkatsu ramen was delicious. And the fried rice was super on point. Heads up to all military families, they DO support the troops! :)  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Lunch at Noodles today....  i experienced pops of exotic flavors with each bite!  Staff were friendly, great service, and  modern decor."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Probably the best ramen I've had in Arizona so far. It's kind of confusing though because while everyone at the restaurant seemed to be ordering Ramen & Japanese food, there was a whole 'nother side on the menu for Italian food. Seemed like there is a bit of an identity crisis here.. and this is coming from someone who is half Japanese, half Finnish!   I wanted the Hakata ramen but they were sold out so I got the Spicy Miso. It was super salty, but the pork was excellent! The Karaage was so so.. I think the koromo needed more oomph.. like more ginger, garlic and salt. It bothered me slightly that the staff didn't know how to pronounce any of the Japanese words, like \"KAH-RAGE\" instead of \"KAH-rah-AH-ge\" but whatever. The gyoza was very small but ok. The sauce was a bit spicy and my daughter couldn't eat it unfortunately. Would be nice to have soy sauce, vinegar and rayu on the table so we could mix our own sauce.   I liked it and will probably be back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"The Spicy Miso ramen is my absolute favorite!! No other ramen in AZ compares!! Noodles are so delicious and there's so much flavor! Service is always good, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for ramen noodles. I normally don't eat pork ramen, so they have chicken and vegan options. I got the chicken and it was delicious.   I feel like this place is going to blow up with popularity soon.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A little trial and error at first, but now we always get the same thing. The Spicy Miso Ramen. Omg it is soooooo delicious.   It has a nice kick, so if your shy on spice I don't know what I'd recommend it. But with the pork, the egg, the perfect miso broth... now my mouth is watering.   it is such a great place for my ramen fix.   It's right down the street from my work so I can all it in, they will separate the noodles from the broth and I take it home. Just fantastic.   My only advice from my most recent visit there, is while they were yummy, their Gyoza (potstickers) was a total rip off. I was skeptical at first bc he said it was $5 for 5, but talked me into bc he said they were fresh made every day.... but he neglected to tell me how TINY they are. A typical gyoza is about 2.5 inches long, and theirs was 1.5 at best. And kind of skimpy on the filling too. I was disappointed.   Other wise, great food, great service, and my husband and I love it."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I work right around the corner from this place. The first time I tried it, I ordered the fettuccini alfredo ( comes with chicken and mushrooms I believe) and I fell in love. I didn't think I would like anything more than that, but I was wrong. The second time I came in, I planned to order the same, but reluctantly I decided to kinda venture and try something else. I ordered the Yaki Soba with Tofu (not vegetarian, just love Tofu) and the man who took my order also informed me that the sauce they use is not vegetarian. I thought that was nice, but it didn't change my order, lol. I'm addicted. I cannot stop thinking about the Yaki Soba! The Tofu was perfect, and the noodles were deliciously flavored and seasoned. I've gone twice to order again and one take out order. Going again today after work. Lol, this place has won this foodies heart. If I didn't live so far I would come here everyday. The only \"complaint\" I have is that for some reason I'm basically invisible to one of the night time waiter/server. Literally every time I go there it's like he doesn't see me, and I have to get my order taken and drink refills by the maître d'. But at least the job still gets done. Still deserves 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"We have visited this place numerous times. Dishes seem to be consistent in relation to servings and flavors. Never seem to venture out from the Torigara though. Would give 5 stars if they brought back some apps on the old menu, specifically the mini sausages. Staff is attentive, parking can be a little hard to find on evening when there are events as you have to park at a meter but it's expected since its downtown."}
{"text":"I think I'm a Pho snob! This was the first time with ramen. I don't believe the broth was as substantial as Pho. I guess I expected more flavor. I will return again to have to Spicy Miso, then I will make a final judgement."}
{"text":"Best place is town for Ramen Noodles. Spicy miso is the best! Plus if you want some Italian food they also got you covered. Great happy hours and great staff. The chef Castro is a master of his craft. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The food is good here. we ordered the spicy miso and the tonkatsu ramen. They were both good. I suggest you add an egg to the tonkatsu.   My only complaint is parking and location. It was hard to find. It's in between Thai basil and the sushi joint.   When I tried to call, the phone number doesn't send me anywhere.   If that is all fixed with phone number and correct location when we google maps, I'll change my review to 5."}
{"text":"As other reviews have correctly noted, the ramen is just mediocre. The atmosphere is good. The servers are attentive. The location is great. But the food is just o.k. The broth was not flavorful. The noodles tasted like cardboard. The vegetables were just tossed together and nothing special. There are better options in Phoenix. I live within walking distance of this place, so I really wanted to like it. But I will not return."}
{"text":"It was our first time having ramen and were pretty happy. The setting in restaurant was nice and relaxing. The waiter was nice and helpful, he explained to us what he liked and why. We thought it was a strange mix to serve Italian pasta and Japanese noodles but my son tried the chicken alfredo which his favorite meal and liked it. The rest if us tried the ramen hoping it was a pleasant expierence and it was! I  ordered the hakata which had great flavor minus the ginger which I'm not a fan of, I also would have preferred the ramen like noodles but was happy overall. My husband ordered the torigara and it was delish! We ended up trading bowls and I ate every last bite left."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, got food poisoning the 3rd time : I enjoyed the food when it stayed down, don't think I'll ever be coming back : Changing review: Just wanted to update this to say that the owner reached out to me which was sweet and I didn't expect that. I have to add that the restaurant does present as clean, and maybe I just happened to get unlucky.I had an awesome birthday experience here. The service was great. I had the Yaki Soba which is a very tasteful vegetarian dish. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I ventured here in search for decent ramen.... I was sadly disappointed. We tried the \"Spicy Miso\" and the \"Sapporo\" ramen, neither of which had a good or authentic Japanese flavor as was told to us by our waiter. I almost couldn't even finish the Sapporo ramen because it was so bad.   However, the only reason I gave this place 2 stars was because the fried rice was great. If you want some good appetizers I would recommend this place. Just don't go expecting the ramen to have an authentic Japanese flavor.   I lived in Japan for a quite some time and might have different expectations of ramen than your average American, but for those in search of Japanese comfort food (aka ramen) this is not the best option."}
{"text":"Nothing really bad to say about this place. Good service, cute ambiance and food was ok. Wasn't the best ramen I've had or top 5 but it was ok if I needed that ramen kick! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great customer service and some delicious food items. I tried the Spicy Miso Ramen and I could not get enough. It was packed with so much flavor I literally couldn't stop myself.   They also had a few Happy Hour items do I decide to grab the Shiitake Fried Rice to go for lunch the next day.  It tasted delicious even though I didn't eat it fresh so it's a must try.   Good food, great service and price!!!"}
{"text":"Oodles of oodles Bangin bowls of scrumptious noodles Pasta dishes are deliciously cruel The bolonese is fucking brutal Conquers your palate like something feudal If the menu here dueled The winner would be the noodles, fools"}
{"text":"My goodness, this place was amazing. We got the meatballs, karaage, hakata ramen, and spicy miso ramen. Meatballs were ok but the chicken was juicy and flavorful and the ramen broth and meat was very rich and full of umami. Love it"}
{"text":"Was having an intense ramen craving during Phoenix Comic Con and luckily Noodle Bar came to the rescue. As a person who loves really spicy food, it's hard to find restaurants that actually deliver (especially Japanese cuisine, which tends to be more on the mild side). Their spicy miso ramen was deliciously spicy and full of flavor. I always ask waiters to make it as spicy as possible. They said they weren't able to add more to it but brought out two additional spices that can be added to your liking. The noodles were super fresh and the dish was reasonably priced for the portions provided. Would like to try out their Italian noodles when in town again."}
{"text":"I received an email from Noodle Bar that they were running $6 noodle daily special from September 30 to October 6th. I love a good noodle deal. I arrived around 5:30PM on a Friday for happy hour. The place was pretty dead. It finally picked up after 6PM.   I tried their version of the Taiwan beef noodle, which was the special noodle that day. I was surprised it wasn't too bad for Phoenix standard. My friends had the bolognese, yakisoba, Hakata ramen, Chahan fried rice, gyoza, and vegetable plate. All were pretty good expect for the vegetable plate was cauliflower in balsamic vinegar. The potion was small and wasn't great at all. Save your money and order a different veggie item.   Our waiter was attentive and friendly. Enjoyable atmosphere to dine and relax. It's another great addition to the Phx downtown district."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's 22nd birthday. Place had a good vibe and a variety of food selections for anybody's craving. Will definitely be back the next time I am in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"2.5/5, but rounded to 2 because that's closer to how I felt. I ordered the beef fried noodles and lamb noodle soup. The noodle soup was very salty, but without much other taste. Noodles and lamb were unremarkable other than being so salty. The fried noodles were overly oily with only a small amount of beef. If it was just mediocre food, than I would've rounded up to 3. However, the service was subpar. The waitress kind of threw the menus at us when we first sat down, then didn't collect them after we ordered. Later when we tried to pay, we clearly made eye contact with her while our cash was visibly sitting in the bill tray. Not sure what happened, but she decided to continue scanning the room. I think we were one of three tables at that point so I'm not sure how she could miss us? We waited until it was clear she had no intention of coming over before having to shout out to her a few times.   TL;DR: mediocre food and service"}
{"text":"Had the shoyu ramen and my friend had the donkatsu ramen. Both really good! We went around 6:20pm on a weekday and there was plenty of room. It was also still happy hour - so appetizers were half off. I definitely want to try the pasta dishes they have. If only I had more room in my stomach!"}
{"text":"I had to add to this review.  This really is the best Ramen place in Phoenix that I have discovered thus far.  As I am doing a low-carb diet for awhile, I was crushed that my Ramen addiction would  be put on hold... but nope, Noodlebar has a couple of low-carb options! One is using the Shiritaki noodles which are almost no carb, or you can just get bean sprouts instead of noodles altogether.  I really thought I had died and gone to heaven, because the low-carb Ramen is virtually no different at all with the Shiritaki noodles.  In any case, wanted you to know the incredible options available here. They are closed until August 7 for renovations (as I sadly discovered yesterday), but looking forward to resuming my 2-3 times a week habit when they're back!"}
{"text":"I would go back for the karaage alone. My favorite karaage in North America had been at Guu Izakaya in Vancouver, BC, but now it might be here. Hakata ramen with an added egg was also very good: rich broth and properly springy noodles. Quick service for a late lunch/early happy hour, and reasonably priced. A new bookmark for me!"}
{"text":"Noodle Bar is one of the numerous noodle bars in Scarborough area. Similar set up, menu, food and taste.  I even forgot I came here.......  There are so many restaurants just in this plaza alone serving noodles.   This probably summed up for most of the restaurants in this plaza. I always ended up order noodle and a tofu or squid bbq skewer wherever I go. I am yawning already."}
{"text":"Nice options for a quick noodle lunch dish! Great option including gluten free. Food made fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Spicy ramen kicked my boyfriends butt! it's SO strong! Jonah was very nice and suggested things we both would enjoy. I have a new favorite ramen spot...."}
{"text":"Coworker and i stopped for lunch. May well be the best caprese I've ever had the burrata,l and tomato's were not only beautiful but it tasted amazing. Also got the meatballs. Beautifully prepared and plated. Tasted delicious as well.  My coworker got a ramen bowl. The aroma from the other side of the table made my mouth water, there wasn't a bit left in the bowl.  Highly recommend a visit for any meal."}
{"text":"Im giving this a 4* because the service was good.   Menu was pure Chinese and no english. The Beef Noodles was so salty and oily.... not my kind of food...."}
{"text":"A service here was interesting. The waitress took our orders, but we were all scared of her. We ended up eating the selections that she recommended. Nevertheless, the food was between good and OK. We would probly come here again if we were hungry, but otherwise we would look for other places to go. The place isn't pad, but it isn't that welcoming either."}
{"text":"Noodle Bar is my favorite downtown spot!!!  The spicy miso is great but the appetizers are my favorites. Their Caprese is presented in the most beautiful way.... Super excited about the new cocktail menu too..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with a friend for dinner. We walked from our hotel so parking wasn't an issue. Didn't have to wait for a table as we got seated right away. Jonas was a waiter and he was absolutely fantastic. The food we got was subpar which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars, but if 10 stars existed, Jonas would get 10 stars and more for service.  We ordered the chicken fried rice, hakana ramen, and chicken yakisoba. Fried rice was meh, no flavor until we asked for chili sauce which made the dish way better. Yakisoba was extremely oily and lacked flavor too. Ramen wasn't bad, but the broth was average and the noodle wasn't chewy or flavorful. Would I come back? If I was really hungry, yes. But honestly, Jonas was such a great waiter that dinner was pretty good. We asked him for condiments, drinks, utensils, etc and he didn't keep us waiting at all. Props to you Jonas"}
{"text":"I had their spicy miso soup. The miso soup was just okay. To me it wasnt spicy. I felt like the more I ate their noodle and the soup, the saltier it tasted. It was also too oily. The service was great thats why Im giving 2 stars. I didnt finish my bowl of soup. I dont think I will be back because it wasnt all that great to me due to the saltyness and oilyness."}
{"text":"Our waiter was named Jonas. One thing to say, he was exceptionally attentive and helpful. Do come here if you have a craving for ramen! Totally would recommend. :) Food was good. Everyone enjoyed it. Savory and delicious. Good spot to eat at."}
{"text":"Love this place and is my go to whenever I can step out of the office to grab a quick bite during my lunch hour. I'm really disappointed that they're not on UberEATS. Get with the times Noodle Bar, get on UberEATS!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab a snack before heading to the airport. Noodle Bar was about 2 blocks from the hotel and within a 5 mins walk from the Renaissance. We arrived around 4p and it was happy hour. There was a few patrons inside enjoying their drinks and we were led to a table since we wanted food. We were given waters and the menus.  We ordered the pork fried rice and the karagee. Both are very flavorful. I felt it was salty, although my friend enjoyed it and didn't think it was salty.   The friend rice had lots of flavor and was very filling. You can easily make this 2 meals! The karagee was also enough for 2 people. I didn't care of the mayo sauce, but again, but friend liked it.  Our bill was only $10 on happy hour! Don't forget to ask about the HH prices. They forgot to give us the HH menu, and the guy told us the prices. Great prices for the amount of food you get! Friendly service and very attentive."}
{"text":"Was recommended to check this place out by my bartender at Tranquillo bar at The Clarendon Hotel, and I'm glad I did. Went on a Saturday evening and it was not crowded at all. Food was delicious. Beer on tap was great.  Service was speedy and friendly.   As an avid ramen lover from NYC with some of THE best ramen spots, I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"A must for the Pork Fried Rice. Perfectly seasoned and a great smokinesss. A great grab and go item. I will be back."}
{"text":"Thank god for Noodle Bar. I've been here 3 or 4 times since they changed their name. I must say, the restaurant is much improved! The ramen is actually very good.... I usually get the spicy miso and it is so tasty, though it could be spicier. The broth is rich and the noodles have a good chew. The egg is always prepared just right (not too runny, not too hard...you know...perfect). It's definitely the best ramen in the downtown area. They also have tasty gyoza and very good fried rice (that is fairly inexpensive).    If this wasn't enough, the Noodle Bar also serves fantastic Italian food! I've tried the lasagna and the polpettas..... both are covered in a delicious red sauce that clearly is made with red wine (super flavorful.... ) and served with creamy ricotta. I'd recommend either or both."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend for both of our first times. Very cute, modern interior. Pretty simple and clean. We sat down and I ordered a glass of Sauvignon blanc. They don't have a full bar but they had enough selection. We started off w the chicken fried rice as an appetizer. The portion was quite big considering it was an appetizer but very good. Good amount of flavoring. We gobbled it up. So by the time our ramen came, I was already kind of full. I ordered the Tori Toma ramen which has tomato, wiri-wiri, chicken chasu (which is like pulled chicken), bean sprouts, kimchi, sesame seeds, garlic chips and chili flakes. This ramen didn't come w an egg so I added an egg. Yum!! Only complaint was that the broth was lukewarm... I usually like my ramen broth to be very hot.. but I will definitely be back and I'll make sure the broth is not lukewarm!"}
{"text":"They don't have any vegetarian option. How is that possible in 2018 in one of the largest cities in the US? I was told the chef wants to follow authentic recipes. That's wonderful and I get that, but you are also isolating a large portion of clientele who want to spend money in your restaurant and now can't. Not sure this is a smart business move, nor is it a move that puts people before the chef's wants. Tradition is great until it isolates people."}
{"text":"The waiter was friendly greeting and explain that they just opened in would be with me in a minute after getting others drinks. He was prompt getting me a menu as I asked for a order to go. They have a new menu there's no more tofu. Which was rather disappointing. I got the Yaki soba which now comes with chicken that is fried. But not in the good way. It's a weird fried no breading chicken. I also got the Bolognese with extra sauce. And that did come with extra sauce I'm glad I ordered it that way at no extra charge. Chicken Yaki soba head really good flavor but they must have run out of carrots that day I had about two tiny specks of carrot a bunch of cabbage and a very little bit of chicken.$16 was a bit much for what I got. I hope they bring the tofu back I would have like to try it. Not sure if I'll go again."}
{"text":"This is near Comerica Theater, so it's a natural place for dinner before a concert. We were fascinated by the Italian/Japanese combination. I had the rolled lasagna, my husband had spicy miso soup, and we shared an interesting appetizer of fried chicken bites with an aioli dip which was just yummy, without the \"bite\" that aioli often has. We also split an order of Brussels sprouts. The food was excellent, service was good and very friendly.  The drinks were \"OK\" and it was a little warm in there - took a while for us to cool down after the super-hot June evening temps. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Noodle bar is great and they have vegetarian ramen options!!! I've only had their Asian style cuisine but I'm sure they're italian is just as good. A great location in downtown and enjoyable place to come for a bite!"}
{"text":"Good service, and the kiddos both liked the ramen noodles they ordered (which is a big deal).  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the caceo e Pepe pasta, amazing. Great taste, fresh pasta and portioned just right. Fiancé had some ramen with the chicken broth, that was tasty as well, not too thick of a broth."}
{"text":"We were going to the sushi place next door but the line wax too long, so we decided to come into the Noodle Bar .. glad we did, the waiter was very good and the food was amazing.  Fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"decided to come and try this new place.  I did not know what to expect as the menu is not posted outside for customers to see.  Menu was all in Chinese and no English.  with my limited Chinese reading i ordered B2 which was sort of a sour pork and tofu sauce with noodles.  that dish was as expected... it was not bad but very oily.   They also have dry noodles with meat sauce with cucumber as well.    as with many mainland china places now .. its almost guaranteed that \"the voice - china\" will be playing.   they have a projector here that i suspect plays \"the voice\" on a loop."}
{"text":"Amazing overall! Enjoyed everything that I ordered. It was our first time exploring a new location and it was the best choice made. You won't regret it either!"}
{"text":"Great Ramen, good selection, reasonably priced.  And fabulous service!  Will come again and again. Eventually after trying all the different Ramen on the menu will try the Italian pastas."}
{"text":"I was downtown for a concert at the Van Buren, got there early and decided to walk a few blocks closer to the high rises a get a bite to eat. I actually confused Noodle Bar with the chain Noodles & Co., but was pleasantly surprised when I walked into what was clearly an Asian ramen restaurant.   I quickly ordered a pint of Koffee Kolsch from Hess Brewery and a Pork Ramen. I've had that beer before, and was happy to see local beers represented, and even weirder ones, not just Four Peaks or San Tan. Not as familiar with ramen, but my previous forays into the ramen world left me unimpressed and underwhelmed.   Not so with this Pork Ramen. The broth was amazing, one of the tastiest liquids I've ever consumed, and carefully arranged sliced scallions, shiitake mushrooms, soft boiled egg, some type of fish cake, seaweed, and of course, juicy pork on top.   Nothing was an afterthought - there was love in every bite, the noodles were a perfect delivery system for the broth, and the other elements pleasant, tasty morsels in their own regard, and especially when combined with that savory broth - I imagine that is what kings have when they are sick to feel better - shoutout to Noodle House for converting me to ramen!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen in town! I eat here about 2 times a week, if not more. The spicy miso is the best dish I've ever had, besides my chimmichurri,  one hint get it with extra meat and extra broth. You won't regret It! Also their gyosa is perfection! Try the chaakhan chicken or their fried pork rice! All those are great appetizers. Service is great! Overall the spicy miso is king! In fact, now I'm craving again! So go check them out!"}
{"text":"Spicy miso is the best ramen I never have, and the chicken karaage is also crispy and tasty,and servers are nice."}
{"text":"I got the Hakata ramen bowl I think it was around $13. I've been to a good amount of ramen places and most come with an egg but they charge you an extra $1 for an egg.  I was a little upset at first when I got my dish because they used different noodles. They were thin noodles, not the traditional \"ramen\" noodles. They should really explain the noodles they use on their menu for each dish. But the noodles ended up being really good or I was just really hungry, who knows!   Over all this place is pretty cool, I think it's kinda neat how they incorporated Italian pasta dishes and Japanese noodle dishes. A little spend for me but, you're in the city. With that, the pricing is normal and fair. The building itself looks pretty new and clean. Although, the staff was just okay, they weren't rude nor they weren't personable either. First off the meals took a little long then it should and no one really paid attention to my group, we never got our water's refilled or get asked if we enjoyed our dish. Our waiter basically did the basics, took our orders and only came back to our table to give and get the check."}
{"text":"Place is very clean and the service was good. The ramen was decent. They have great appetizers and drinks, but the  ramen was average."}
{"text":"I work in the same building and it makes me really happy to have some good fried rice around the corner. There are tons of restaurants in downtown, but this place brings a part of what was missing.   So far, I've tried the fried rice and karaage fried chicken and it comes with a delicious sauce. The torigara ramen is definitely my favorite though a friend of mine tells me the spicy miso is delicious.   I've also tried the pomodoro, which is okay. I don't think it's anything too special, the meatballs were kind of dry when I tried it but I would be willing to give it another try if I was in the mood.   The restaurant itself is also nice. Very modern decor that works well to contrast the building. Love it.  Prices and location are great. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this place. I tried their TORI TOMA Ramen. The chicken tasted disgusting it was probably old or not cleaned well. My husband ordered the fried rice and that wasn't good either. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"First time here. I love Ramen Noddles. Need to work on service. Had a hard time getting a servers attention to pay my check."}
{"text":"We went to this location after catching a ballgame at Chase Field. Great food, great service, and cool ambience. Would totally recommend the Sapporo Ramen & Gyoza."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! After trying it once, I'm convinced it's the best Asian restaurant around. Everything was amazing from the dumplings to the ramen. The noodle bowl I had was one of the most flavorful dishes I've ever eaten! I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. First restaurant we've eaten at in Phoenix and it was great. I got the hakata ramen. It's a pork broth ramen with thin noodles. I usually dislike thin noodles in my ramen but I actually looooved this. The noodles tasted fresh and the broth was delicious. I also got a chicken fried rice and it was so savory and delicious my boyfriend couldn't resist sneaking a few bites. My boyfriend got the carbonara pasta and it was perfect. He fulfilling and satisfying. He licked his plate clean. Definitely would come back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the space at noodle bar. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Menu is varied from Japanese to Italian. I am a fan of both the ramen and the meatballs. Clean, and intimate space. I go here several times a week and always seem to enjoy the vibe. Have taken several friends here. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This was a brisk walk from the Talking Stick Arena with some friends.  The service was great.  The ramen was delish.  My only tiny hiccup?  I paid to have an egg added....but only got half an egg.  Why not the whole egg?"}
{"text":"I was told by a native Italian this is the best place to get homemade pasta in the entire state so I went. I had the Beet Gnocchi and my friend had Ramen. It was delish. The gnoschi was a bit bland to me but it might have just been my taste buds were off that night. The waiter we had was beyond wonderful! All the staff members were terrific. We were pretty spoiled. Very friendly, welcoming and and accommodating.  The decor is  cool. The dessert of lemon custard with fruit won some, \"best of\" award. It really is outstanding. The only negative is it is a rather small limited menu. I will definitely go back and try some other dishes. Oh yeah, the Gyoza app was simply to die for! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance and nice staff. The Spicy Miso soup was good. My advice would be to try and make your own noodles. The hours of operation are limited and could be expanded on weekends.  Overall I would recommend this place if you enjoy soup."}
{"text":"I think this ramen is very nicely made. It looks very unique. The ramen was good although I wish there was more meat. There were two very thin slices of meat. The broth of the ramen was good but a bit on the saltier side. Just a little bit. I got the spicy miso ramen and I like how it comes with the chili threads. The threads are not spicy though. Well... at least for me it was was not. The server was really nice. They do not have their own parking so you would have to park at a parking meter or find a parking garage nearby."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my kid. She gets ramen way more than i do and this is the first place she liked the miso broth at so that is something. I thought the spicy miso was pretty great. The chicken broth one was safe and mild but also good. They make a good fried rice as well. I am not a fan of the Gyoza though, there was a little too much onion/ or garlic in them.   The service was quick and responsive, the food came quickly as well. She was also very helpful in describing the options so I could make a good choice. I am not a big ramen fan in general so I dont have much experience in comparison but my kid thought it was solid so that is wortha try if you are around."}
{"text":"We found Noodle Bar after looking for nearby restaurants that were open late after attending First Friday at the art museum. The agedashi tofu was delicious, with a crispy fried shell, tender inside, and generous amount of bonito flakes. We tried both the torigara ramen and the yuzu chicken ramen, which appears to be a special. The torigara broth was very flavorful with a peppery kick. I couldn't taste much yuzu in the yuzu chicken broth and also found the toppings a little sparse.   Overall, service was fast, our food was good, and everything was very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Its my first time here and I'm beyond impressed. From atmosphere to happy hour and main entree. My gawd....the gyoza...better than anywhere I've had in AZ. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Yum! I ordered the ramen with an extra egg and it was delicious. The restaurant was slightly difficult to find, I circled twice before I saw it, but it's sandwiched between harumi sushi and a Thai place. Parking is sparse, it's dtphx after all. The ambiance is hip and modern. The sErvice was good and the food was delicious. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Great Noodles!!!!  The Italian noodles are pretty good (except for the ravioli and they are NEARLY exceptional).... the Asian noodles; however, are the best thing on the menu! Yakisoba with pork was flavorful, pork was tender, and made with fresh ingredients.... The meatballs are on the cusp of good (too much pepper (and I enjoy spices quite a bit)).... The gyoza would be excellent if not for the dipping sauce (WAY TOO SALTY (and I love love salt))....  Solid choice, staff is pleasant and helpful. Parking might be an issue but we walked so I can not comment further. A whisker loud inside but lively and a great casual dining spot!"}
