{"text":"I have a great service when I go here! The food is great and service is friendly! I love the spicy salmon and it's very delicious!"}
{"text":"The sushi is quite decent. But it's not as good as similar all you can eat sushi restaurants nearby. Other than sushi, the garlic beef is amazing. Overall it's alright for the price"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. They lost one of our order papers and kept us waiting for an hour and half. We asked many times and they didn't tell us they didn't have the paper. When we decided to leave without waiting longer the cashier argued with us and they demanded full payment even though they didn't provide all the food we ordered, we were still hungry and it is an all you can eat restaurant. Will never go back again and wont recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Poor service.  The restaurant brings you not even half of your selected items. When the servers are asked how come many of the items did not arrive, they simply replied to re-order. Again, our table re-ordered and again, not even half of the items arrived.  Then out of nowhere, one of the servers mentioned it was the \"last call\" to order more.

Why open a restaurant and then to mess with customers?
Our table will remember of the experience and never go back."}
{"text":"So, they remodeled the old Tokyo Sushi because it got fined for food hygiene or some other health hazard. The result: the same old generic sushi place which serves average food. The cleanliness is dubious and overall nothing has changed. The same old slow service, orders that never get completed and items that you will never receive (such as miso soup or seaweed salad). 

There are some better sushi options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, came in the afternoon. Not a bad price for lunch and its all you can eat. Hard to beat $15 in my opinion. The issue was the service was so slow, like intentionally couldn't eat as much as I wanted to. Simple orders took a long amount of time. Hard to do for lunch. My favorite was the yam and crab stick rolls. The sushi quality wasn't bad, but I'm not a sushi critic by any means."}
{"text":"My expectations were definitely lowered since its an AYCE, but it's a special surprise for sure.

First off, no sashimi at lunch time but it seems there are no downtown buffets that do.

My first visit was during supper and the sushi was pretty solid but the kitchen beef dishes stood out the most.

At lunch this time, the sushi was good and varied. The nigiri was alright ( the rice was just a tad dry).

The beef dishes were really the standouts here and a non-sushi lover can definitely find his/her fix here.

The service was very quick and the menu selection is gigantic."}
{"text":"This is another good all you can eat sushi place. They have some tasty and interesting roll options that are different from the usual like the Volcano Roll and the Mango Tango roll. Warning if you order 1x shrimp teriyaki you legit get one single lonely shrimp on a plate. Some of the rolls don't really look like the pictures so it is hard to tell what you are eating but everything was very good. The wait-staff was friendly but needed to be flagged down if you needed anything. Also bring your cash with you if you don't want to pay the fee for the interact machine."}
{"text":"Zushi is my current go-to all you can eat sushi. 
There's plenty of other locations downtown, but Zushi has been so far the most consistent in terms of food quality. As it is with many other sushi joints in Montreal, the owners are Chinese, and so are most of the staff. The menu is pretty similar accross the board, so I guess the main reason for my appreciation so far has been the lack of unpleasant surprises. Don't get me wrong, I think the stuff is great, but before raising your gourmet expectations, remember that Zushi is the fast food version of sushi. 

Everytime I go, there's no or little variation in my orders (with all you can eat restaurants, I prefer to save my precious stomach space for food I love most). 
I start with miso soup and seaweed salad, a LOT of edamame, then tempura shrimps, popcorn chicken, sashimi, a whole bunch of sushi rolls, and fried rice if I still feel a bit peckish. A few of the hot dishes are pretty good too, but I don't recommend experimenting with many at a time. I also tend to avoid handrolls, nigiri, and the ever-perplexing pizza sushi. I always finish with ice cream (the green tea flavor is nice, unlike the shampoo-tasting version from Seoul Chako *shudder*). You do have to finish the food to avoid paying extra, but I found that a few leftover noodles or half a piece of chicken never got me into trouble.

There has been up and downs with customer service, but it's overall fast and pleasant. If you're not sure about the whereabout of an order, just enquire about it. They only accept cash, which is pretty annoying, but at least there's an ATM machine next to the door (extra fees meh). Pricing is fair, especially at lunch (but sadly no sashimi).

Bonus: There's two Pokestops nearby!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and I don't expect AYCE sushi to be better than mediocre. Soup was OK. Sushi and Sashimi OK for the price but of course far away from really good. Rolls were below average. Had some warm stuff, that was OK, too. Would have given it 3 stars I'd there hadn't been the service. They forgot something with each round of our food and were just not very welcoming."}
{"text":"1. Miso soup = bouillon d'os......yark
2. Les sushis ont trop de riz et peu de contenu
3. Les serveurs sont po cute et incompétents
4. Les toilettes sont petits et sales
5. Pas de débit ou de crédit... C'est chiant!!!"}
{"text":"Quality has really gone down since the last time I visited. The service is still ok, 90% of their sushi is all rice, they drizzle sauce on everything making it taste disgusting, and the prices have gone up. It's disheartening. 

Although, now they do accept cards which is a step up. Their pop corn chicken is also still good."}
{"text":"This is not a buffet.  This is an all you can eat place,  you take menu items and write them down on order slips.  The food keeps coming if you keep ordering.  I had maki rolls, salmon sashimi, soups salad.  they had a huge selection - teriyaki dishes, tempura, udon and ramen.  Something for everyone.  Service good.  Beer and sake."}
{"text":"My experience was better than the recent reviews. 

It's true you don't get a warm service from the staff, but this has been my experience at most All You Can Eat places. They're busy but efficient. 

Dishes arrived fast even with many customers there. The exception would be the green salad which was ordered first but arrived after two rounds of dishes. In comparison, the seaweed salad arrived within seconds so I guess they have some popular items ready. 

When we ordered the bill the waiter asked nicely of everything was alright and he came back promptly with it and a credit card reader. 

The menu is exhaustive : sushi, sashimi, different rolls (california, kamikaze...), tempura, soup (udon)... And a whole lot of warm items on the other side (grilled mussel). 

Everything was good, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The worst AYCE sushi place I've tried in Mtl (compared to sushi crescent, sushi crystal, sushi st-catherine, komiko, sushi palace & kanda). 

First off, very rude service from the moment I walked in and it only got worse. It only improved a bit towards the end when I became rude with them. Very strange behaviour.

Now for the food: there's no tuna on the menu. At every other AYCE sushi place, I expect to see tuna. The waiter replies \"of course there's no tuna... this is a buffet...\" 

The shrimp tempura I got was cold and pretty gross. Most of he sushis were flavourless except if they had spicy mayo... 

Do yourself a favour and avoid this place with all the other restos in the area."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat experience, loved the food but service was a bit slow. Nonetheless, great servers and food!"}
{"text":"It's important to remember that when you go for all you can eat sushi you can't expect quality.  You have to take it for what it is: quantity.  Zushi Sushi is your typical AYCE sushi experience in that the food is nothing to write home about but there is a ton of it.  I found it pretty tasteless but I've come to realize that these days when I crave sushi I would much rather pay for quality and get less of it then stuff my face on AYCE sushi.

Like all AYCE sushi places you pay more on weekends and there are fees for uneaten pieces.  There service is pretty fast and they usually remember to bring everything you ordered.  Just a heads up that it is cash only so make sure you have enough on you.  If you forget they have an ATM in the restaurant."}
{"text":"came once before they rebranded and once afterwards
much much better afterwards
pretty good sushi, amazing for the price (like 14$ at lunch per person)
everytime I go I eat so much to get my money's worth (would not recommend) and I've thrown up twice out of like 10 times coming either here or the place next door
service isn't great but it's ayce sushi wtf do you expect
pretty fast delivery (5-10 minutes)
would recommend, pretty much a regular customer by now lmao"}
{"text":"I honestly heard so much bad feedback on this restaurant but one of my friends loved it so much so I went to Zushi. Their menu is so big and you have many to chose from compared to a few other all you can eat sushi places. The price is decent, it's the same as any all you can eat sushi place. Their sushi is amazing!!! But my boyfriend ordered some kind of fried rice and it was horrible, it's like they threw whatever in the rice. Other than the fried rice, I have never tried their dishes other than sushi. They don't have much staff so sometimes you have to wait until they pick up your order. Sometimes they don't really notice your hand is up which is annoying. Overall, the sushi is great, the staff are ok, i would come back again for the variety of sushis they have!"}
{"text":"After my Saturday's work , I came here with my boss and co-workers for a dinner. 

We went to St-Catherine Sushi (right next door). It was full so we came to this place.

They offer lot of options just like any other all you can eat sushi restaurent. Taste not bad. 

PS : I lot my Starbucks bottle there after I finished to eat. They kept it until I came back next day. Thanks for it. Some other place, they probably juste throw it away."}
{"text":"This is a typical AYCE sushi place.  

I've arrived in the middle of the afternoon, notice that you'll get -15% between 4 am and 7 pm.

The service is OK. You write number item on a paper sheet with a quantity, and waiters will deliver the item. The system is far from perfect, I've noticed that they'll forget to bring items. If I ask waiters about that, they will just tell us to reorder. 

Coincidentally or not, missing items are the most complicated one. You pieces of sashimi or seaweed salad will arrive promptly. But no luck for sushi pizza and Dragon eyes!

Apart from this, you have a large choice of items, you can also have bowls of ramen, different fried rice, udon, teriyaki, seafood.

Expect to have items that won't be served without knowing why. You'll be full but it's just plain, nothing amazing. You have many choices of buffet restaurants on Saint Catherine Street. Just in the area, you have 3 other choices."}
