{"text":"Finally REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican food in Scottsdale! I discovered Tia Shorty's on Yelp....the first time we went in I felt like I was at one of my family members homes. The pictures on the wall, colorful decor and music in the background. Roy the Owner came and introduced himself to us & starting tell us about how the restaurant came about. He made a few recommendations on the menu. The Crispy Tacos and Chili Colorado are some of our favs! Oh and they have one of the Best Prickly Pear Margaritas! I just love introducing my friends & family to Tia Shorty's hoping they have the same experience we do! Because we go in so much it went from & handshake to a hug! You can count on Tia Shorty's fresh food as she is in the back cooking up fresh tamales or preparing the food herself. Lovely people & delicious food I would highly recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Great little spot! Very Good, colorful and warm atmosphere, easy to talk and listen to who your with but lively music at the same time. The food was very good and the staff on top it and friendly. Tia came by and said hello and chatted.  Great little lady from Mexico giving it her all to make her dream come true.  Good stuff!  Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"I have been following Tia Shorty since her catering days and her food festival appearances and I was so happy to find out she finally opened a restaurant! Her authentic,vibrant, home made recipes is what has always set her food apart from the rest! Some of my favorites include the shrimp cocktail, chile Colorado and the chirps are slap your momma good! The environment is vibrant and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Basic standard Mexican restaurant in an outdoor mall type location. Outdoor patio overlooked parking lot. Food was decent and service friendly. A bit over priced for the food and the ambiance. Salsa better than reported on earlier reviews."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican cuisine.... Great atmosphere and great service. Try it and you'll see.  Wayne & Millie Martin"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food! Complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa was quite good and the ingredients tasted fresh.  For dinner, we went with the owners' favorites (noted on the menu) of chicken tacos and spicier beef tacos and shared the plates (2 of us).  Both were very good in terms of flavor but the portions were too small.  I could have easily eaten 2-3 more of their dinner portions which, at $12-14 a plate, means I would hesitate to eat here again. Finally, the churro desert was fantastic! The portion here was no problem at all as it was easily enough to split with somebody else.  Indoor decor was really cool.  Owners seem like very nice people and I'd like to see them succeed.  Overall positive experience.  If they were to increase dinner portions to be more comparable to other Mexican restaurants nearby then eating here would be a no brainer."}
{"text":"Excellent food! A must try if you're in the Scottsdale, Indian Bend area. We will be back. Family owned, good vibe, clean and excellent chef. Nice indoor/outdoor bar area."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Mexican food.  Chile Colorado was outstanding.  Service was solid and the chips/salsa didn't disappoint.  Don't skip the churros for dessert!!"}
{"text":"We visited Tia Shorty's for some tacos this evening and we were very pleased with our food, our drinks and our sever, Mike.  The Carne Asada tacos were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was delicious!! The ingredients seemed very fresh and it was full of flavor. For being Mexican food it did not feel like it was overly greasy and heavy. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Beans are like my grandma made. Been years since I've eaten such delicious re fried beans!  Hard taco chicken is seasoned to perfection. Salsa and chips are can't stop eating delight. Great owners who care about giving you their best in every bite."}
{"text":"Food and staff were wonderful. The food was tasty, authentic and not greasy. Our waitress was superb. Attentive, personable and helpful. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale! Great food and really friendly staff. MUST try!!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  Authentic Mexican food with owner involvement makes it really great!  We are only visiting town for the week, but I wanted to be sure to share the review for the locals.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible service, understaffed. Sat down at the bar for a margarita, the bartender said, \" I have 17 people outside\" never saw her again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and had the shredded chicken tacos. So delicious! I never eat referee beans and rice but I did today! Absolutely delicious! And the service was fast and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Beyond our grandest expectations...we expected amazing Southwest food...but not something that we would talk about for years to come.  Roy's Chili Colorado is a must, and the house margarita (try the prickly pear) is memorable...even after drinking Tequila.  Roy himself is a gem (he is the chef and husband of Tia Shorty, who has provided the recipes that will beg you to return.  And Mike, our mid-afternoon bartender/server may have been one of the most friendly and accommodating wait staff we have seen in recent memory.  Most highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was our first time. Love this place... salsa was so good full of fresh cilantro flavor. Roy was great, friendly, fun, & informative and gave us good suggestions. Rated a 4 only because I was not in love with the posole because I prefer more of a \"shredded\" pork rather than chunks of pork. However...the flavor was fantastic."}
{"text":"Tia Shorty's is in a strip mall and is what I would call a neighborhood sort of place. $9 Margheritas were pretty good, chips are nice and thin, and the salsa is great. I had chicken enchiladas Christmas style, and the red sauce was really good, but the green sauce was excellent! There was a slight messup on one diner's order as it needed to be dairy free. The waitress explained that the cook did not speak English and didn't quite get the dairy free request. Actually I was pleased that the food was being prepared by someone who really knew what it should be like. Food prices are extremely reasonable. Though there is not an enormous selection, or anything trendy like duck tacos, it's plain good food."}
{"text":"First time tonight. Loved the ambiance.  Different and quirky in a good way. I read the previous reviews and it seems the owners have taken notice. I felt the portions were adequate.  Especially considering the endless chips and salsa. The salsa.....I could not stop eating it. Perfect blend of spice and heat. After a pleasant visit with the owner Tina she informed us that they have a hotter version upon request.  There were five of us. No one had anything negative to say. Our server was attentive and the food was prompt and hot. The drinks took a little while to get,  but I was there to relax so this was minor inconvenience. The server realized it and apologized. No harm no foul.  Get the Queso. Damn good!  Family owned and you can tell the owner, who is the head chef is passionate about making it right. They have the kinks that start out with any new establishment, but I feel they will be ironed out. If you have a suggestion I think Tina the owner would be happy to hear it and make it right. My only prayer is they stick around for a while.  Great neighborhood spot and I will be back many times in the future.  If you support local food and local families give it a shot. We need places like this for their character and for their heart. Cheers Tia Shortys!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted something to eat. Found this and saw the ratings so took the chance and ate here. We will not be coming back. Service ok, not exceptional and that was surprising since it was us and 1 other table.  We all ordered a variety of the tacos and was not impressed. Never seen such small tacos. Amount of food for the price, was not worth it. Food was edible but flavor could have been better. None of us cleaned our plates. Will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious!!!!! The pozole was the best!  Only giving 4 stars because service is a bit slow. Hope this is the result of being a new restaurant  and growing pains."}
{"text":"Great food, high cost, low portion.  Went for happy hour too, so these were the \"discounted deals\".  With all the great Mexican food in town, unfortunately their cost and lacking portions are enough for me not to return.  The food is great otherwise."}
{"text":"Absolutely great, was even greeted by the owner. Staff was awesom, food was awesom. The chips are like a crispy cloud, salsa was perfect."}
{"text":"Great charming local restaurant.  Super authentic Mexican food.  Everything tastes good when you start with great tortillas. Carnitas tacos  is my favorite.  But sometimes they run out when they get busy.  (It takes awhile to make a new batch)  But then I do the shredded beef or fish tacos.  My wife loves the taco salad."}
{"text":"Great, authentic (New) Mexican food! The service was exceptional and the owners are incredibly friendly. You have to try the Chili Colorado and the posole is as good as it gets. Can't wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I really hate to give this restaurant only two stars, but after an $80 tab and still hungry, not happy.  The taste was wonderful.  The serving size was pathetic.  Seriously, the refried beans were watery thin and at most we received 5 tablespoons on a cold plate with no cheese. The side of rice was a few tablespoons and the lettuce/tomato garnish was 1 heaping tablespoon.   The main beef dish while very tasty was so small and presented as a thin quarter cup of thin sauce and tiny cubed beef.......very difficult to eat with a fork!  A thin skim of food on a cold white plate is not what I want to see for the price and in Scottsdale.  Go to Barrio Queen in Old Town if you want a large portion for the same price.  Like I said, it tasted really good, but terribly disappointing on portion size.....and hey, I am not even a big eater.  If I took my brother there, he would have to order two meals. Please fix this so you will not fail in two years. Oh, I need to mention the ambience....different.  Not sure what I would call it.  Barrio/urban/Day of the Dead cafe, with the feel you just walked uninvited to someones private family get together and they put up with you being there.  Over priced, thin portions makes for sad customers."}
{"text":"Was back in town and gave Tia Shorty's another chance and the food and service was great!  Good size portions, great flavor.  Glad I went back!   Let me start by saying the food was good, the service and portion sizes were laughable.  At noon, I walked into a less than half full restaurant and was told to sit anywhere; so I chose to sit at the empty bar.  I continued to sit at the bar for 25 minutes before anyone said anything to me; took my ice tea order and vanished for another 25.  When my tacos finally arrived they weren't much larger than a silver dollar pancake; nor where they what I ordered.  I wish this place the best of luck but can't imagine they will last long if changes are not made"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. I had Carne Asada tacos, delish. Good quality meat. My husband had Colorado Chili and he really liked it. Nice restaurant decor, good chips and salsa. Great refried beans.  Definitely will go back. A nice change from the usual Scottsdale Americanized Mexican food. Go check them out."}
{"text":"Made online reservation at 6pm for 7pm and was greeted and seated promptly when we arrived. Sat on the veranda with staff (Leslie) very attentive. Beverages and appetizers came quickly and were excellent - mas margaritas por favor!  Fish tacos are a great choice as was the carne asada tacos. Too full for desert."}
{"text":"Reallllly wanted to like this place. 3 tiny Street tacos for $17. The tacos were bland, no spice and the carne asada was a little mushy. I regretted eating there and could've settled for Rubio's. Very polite staff though."}
{"text":"Great service and super yummy prickly pearl margaritas.  I had the carnitas which were delicious."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with family.  We agreed the chicken enchiladas with red sauce the chicken and the carnitas tacos were amazing.  I loved the lime cilantro rice and the house margarita was tasty."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY!! We waited for over 36 minutes and still NO FOOD. We received no napkins and no service. The manager was rude. I cannot believe how horrible this experience was. We had to leave the restaurant prior to receiving our order. Plus they were out of shrimp and steak. Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"To start, the chips & salsa were AMAZING. We had the posole, then my sisters and I shared tamales, carne asada street tacos and green enchiladas.  Everything was delicious!!!! The environment was beautiful. My margaritas was excellent. This place is a must try if you are looking for real deal, delicious, mexican food!"}
{"text":"Very good food we were there for lunch and had the Chicken Tacos and enchiladas combo highly recommend the tacos the service and the owners were friendly !"}
{"text":"The moment you walk in the door you are enveloped by subdued lighting which really sets a relaxed mood. Then you notice the really cool art work on the walls.  The chips & salsa are the best in town & it just gets better from there!    The bartender Gina recommended the Green Chili Tamales which were the best I'v ever had anywhere! My wife had the Chicken Colorado which she loved!  Only negative was that the machine blended Margarita was so thick you needed to eat it with a spoon.  I added some to my beer & fixed that problem!  All in all we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and this place is amazing  The salsa is very authentic and the cheese dip is super yummy. Ordered the posole and it's yummy my hubby ordered the carnitas tacos and he loved them.  We are always looking for authentic Mexican restaurants and this is one of them."}
{"text":"Bomb margaritas. Explosive tacos. Cured my hangover. Best Saturday lunch ever.  Oh, and shouts to the family-friendly staff for calming down my niece when she had a fit."}
{"text":"I RARELY write reviews, but I feel the need to review this place. My boyfriend and I went to Tia Shorty's on Cinco de Mayo. We were feeling a chill night just the two of us this year, just a few margaritas and tacos, and this is right down the street from our house so it worked out perfectly.   First of all it took 10 minutes for our server to even greet us when we sat down. Then we ordered margaritas and it took 20 minutes to get them-- I kid you not! My boyfriend ordered a frozen marg, and by the time the drinks got to us, his was half melted. And the waitress said \"that was totally my bad...\"  yet she still served him this liquefied drink. He took a sip and it was straight sugar. We love margaritas, and we aren't picky, I was a bartender before-- unless it is beyond horrible, I don't send drinks back. But in this case it had to be returned! Then we waited for our food-- another 30 minutes went by. We hadn't seen our waitress for a good 15 minutes, and we were over it at this point. We threw 20 bucks on the table and told the manager to cancel the food.  Just as we were getting up, the waitress for the table next to us came out saying to them \"no they haven't put it in yet so dont worry about it\"-- So they had been waiting longer than we had at this point and their food hadnt even been started yet!! They walked out, we walked out, and another table behind us walked out as well. I've never seen anything like it. Needless to say, this mexican food lover wont be back."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of taking my father to lunch here, the food and service was fantastic, salsa and bean dip tasted homemade, and the enchiladas i ordered had just the right amount of spice.   I was pleasantly surprised that the food didn't have an overbearing salty taste you'll often experience with most Mexican restaurants.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The best tacos and salsa I have ever eaten!!! The only place in Scottsdale to eat delicious Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Tia Shorty's is so authentic and I love the fact that it is family owned and operated. The food is crave worthy and the ambiance is very unique with the sugar skull decorations & Latin celebrity wall. Definitely a great space to come for a margarita or two!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Saturday. Great place! You can tell everything is made fresh. We had guacamole ($), plus their chips w/house bean dip and salsa as an appetizer and all are phenomenal.  Entrees were off the lunch menu, a combo platter and two chicken tacos. The chicken tacos were a recommendation from the waitress and OMG, what a delicious recipe. It's a passed-down family recipe!  For drinks, I had a margarita and my husband had a mojito. The margarita was delicious. The mojito recipe needs a little tweaking as it was lacking in mint/Yerba. Nonetheless , we will definitely be a repeat customer to try other items on the menu (or just keep ordering the same!)"}
{"text":"Honestly the service was great, everyone was very nice and accommodating. The food on the other hand is not the best. The only thing I like was chips. The salsa is just okay. To me it felt like I was going to chipotle. Just mediocre Mexican at best"}
{"text":"Authentic homemade Mexican favorites. Tamales were outstanding and the chicken street tacos are worth coming back for."}
{"text":"yummy and reasonable prices. Go during Happy Hour for some great deals!!!!"}
{"text":"The food and service at Tia Shorty's is everything you are looking for in an authentic Mexican restaurant serving fantastic Mexican favorites! No other food like it in Phoenix or Scottsdale -- absolutely the best salsa and chips -- OMG on the chicken tacos and chile Colorado -- great atmosphere and attention by owners to make sure you are enjoying their excellent food!"}
{"text":"Great find in Scottsdale, very flavorful authentic Mexican food..  Great place for happy hour with has patio seating.    Menu is full of wonderful choices.  I had  the Chili Colorado (Roy's favorite)!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!  We went for happy hour to try a little bit of everything - we split literally all of the tacos on the HH menu and they all were absolutely delicious.    I have a severe dairy allergy and they handled it amazingly! Luckily everything there is homemade, so they know what is going into the food (which isn't the case at most places I might add).    My BF who I was splitting everything with isn't allergic, so they brought out separate bowls with the cheese and sauces that would go on each taco and showed him which went with each taco so he could try them with the dairy.    We even got to meet Tia herself, which was awesome.  Very excited to go back soon and so happy this place opened right near our house... new local spot for tacos!!"}
{"text":"We went to Tia's on a Saturday around 6:30pm and it was pretty empty. A few things I loved:  The whole place is family run. The owner made sure to stop by every table to see how our food and experience was, and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. Her son is one of the line cooks in the back, her (I think) daughter is the manager, etc. It's great to see a whole family coming together to open up a new business.  The real reason for my 3 stars was for my main dish. Granted, I did not get any tamales, which is what Tia Shorty's is known for (they've been selling their tamales in PHX for many years and recently decided to open a restaurant due to that success). I got a taco salad that was really just incredibly bland. This place prides itself on authentic Mexican fare, and it just wasn't that for me.  I will say that the nachos we had as a starter were delicious. They use their queso to cover them and they were ridic. I would have gladly had those as my meal!"}
{"text":"We were highly motivated to find Mexican food one evening and Tia Shorty did not disappoint!  Great ambience and a real family feel enhanced by delicious food. No kitchen nightmares noted and the wait staff was very friendly. Both Roy and Tia made sure we were pleased with every aspect of our meal. The chili Colorado was excellent as were the street tacos."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal here, the chips were thin just the way I like, and I really enjoyed the salsa. Had the favorite chicken tacos on the happy hour menu, they were small but tasty. My husband had the nachos, he said they were good but \"didn't knock his socks off\". Met the owner/chef when she came over to say hello at the end of our meal, she was very nice. Would stop in again if in the area."}
{"text":"Came in at 2p on a Friday. Was greeted by the owner, Tina, and completely taken care of by Sam, our bartender. Excellent food, service and cleanliness. The place looks great. The food came out quick. Everything was great.  Tina came and sat down with us to make sure everything was good and stayed to talk and make friends. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever tasted! The service was top notch, margaritas were the perfect combination of sweet and sour, and the decor inside was nice. Food was a little pricey, but I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I called ahead to see if there was a wait since it's spring training season in the valley and the tourists have taken over Scottsdale. The woman who answers the phone asked how many in our party. I told her 2 and she said there would be no wait. We arrive at the restaurant and there is a hostess there trying to multitask and it seemed to fluster her. She looked to see where we should be seated. The restaurant was empty inside except for 2 tables. The outdoors had about 4 tables, nothing that seemed remotely crowded. The hostess never sat us cause an older gentleman stepped in and said, \"you sit outside? Or this high top.\" I told him that I preferred neither of the choices and wanted to sit at a low table (which there were 5 to chose from available). It was 7:30 pm when we were seated. We were dropped off chip sams salsa from someone walking by but then we were ignored for a good 10 mins. No water, no \"I'll be right with you\", no nothing. Finally a woman approached our table asking if we had been helped yet. When we said no, she promptly said \"I'm sorry the server who has your table is swamped so I can get your order in for you.\" Very nice lady. She stepped up and cut veered for the server who was slacking.  After about 30 mins of waiting for our food to arrive, Leslie (the kind woman who took our order) came to our table stating that she was going to check on our order. She promptly came back and said it was going to be a few more minutes. We were starting to get frustrated,  but knew it was not Leslie's fault, as she was the only one on the staff that was doing her job and busting butt to make sure all the customers were happy. What a great employee Leslie is.  As we were waiting for our food, I kept over hearing the bartender cussing up a storm and complaining. It was quite uncomfortable to listen too.  Leslie approached us about another 10 mins later to apologize and say that our food would be out in another 15 mins or so.  We were flooredwhen we heard that. She even knew that it was not acceptable. Leslie said that she was going to get a manager to come speak to us. She felt awful, but she had no control of the short staff kitchen. An older gentleman approached our table and said,, \"yes it's going to be another 15-20 mins\". I told him that it was unacceptable especially cause it was approaching the hour mark.  His response was \"do whatcha gotta,do.\" I was floored by his response. He was not the manager, but the OWNER!  I told him that he needs to work on his customer service. He seemed unfazed by my request. He was an owner that did not know how to handle a little 4 table crowd in the restaurant. I said that we were just going to leave cause it was a waste of time. Leslie insured us that she was going to keep checking in our order. We thanked her, as she was Tia shorty's saving grace. I kept it a point to mention to the owner that the iris it  reason we stayed wa because Leslie was such a had worker. The owner does not know how to deal with situations like this. Telling a customer \" do whatcha gotta do\" instead of trying to make up for a poor dining experience is not the answer. He needs to go to restaurant 101 boot camp asap.  When our food finally came out, Leslie apologized once again. We told her it wasn't not her fault and thanked her for being such a positive light in such a terrible situation. The owner didn't care, the other servers did not care, it's Leslie that's holding this place together. The food was good, but not sure if it's s worth the hour and half wait.  If it weren't for Leslie, this place would be going under. Leslie stepped up and saved the disgruntled employees that should be working just as hard as she has been. We would go back, but not on weekend, not when spring training is in town, and I will call ahead to see if Leslie is working first. It's people like Leslie that this restaurant needs. She's a hard worker and deserves to run this place (she pretty much does already). The owners could and should take notes from her. I'm sure this place would be running smooth if she were in charge. Right now it's a big old cluster with angry employees. #teamleslie #lesliesavestheday"}
{"text":"Everything in Scottsdale looks the same. It's all beige strip mall after beige strip mall, with a palm tree and a cactus out front. Which makes it difficult to tell what sort of restaurant you're about to enter. A five star steakhouse looks just like a Panera. So here's the sort of place Tia Shorty's is.  A relaxed, casual, easy meal (everyone can get on board with a plate of enchiladas, beans and rice.) The perfect antidote to a long, long, long week of too much work and too many decisions.  The service was everything it should be - quick, friendly and attentive - without being overbearing, and Tia herself visited us at the end of the meal to see how things had gone."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. From the kind servers and the intricate design and where the answer is always yes - - holy cow. What a great place for dining even in a strip mall in Scottsdale. The fajitas were fabulous. The liquor offerings plentiful. The staff kind and engaging. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Reasonably good margaritas, well-priced for happy hour. Good thin chips, pretty hot salsa and good pricing on the happy hour soft tacos, carnitas and fish. Food was over salted. Such a great location with ho hum food."}
{"text":"A truly authentic Mexican restaurant.  I had the enchiladas en salsa verde with black beans and Mexican rice. All had their own distinct flavor that complimented each other so deliciously. I will go back if only to have the carne asada."}
{"text":"Wow! This was a completely unexpected treat. Genuine, homemade Mexican dishes. Delicious Margaritas. Great, personable service. I can't wait to go back for the carnitas street tacos and chile Colorado.  Authentic.  Reasonably priced for the real deal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Salsa is the bomb and the happy hour margarita is to die for!!! Tacos are incredible as well. Service wonderful too!"}
{"text":"This was my family's second visit to this restaurant.  I was disappointed the first time with the service.  When we walked in we could see the severs arguing over who got which stations.  Once we were seated I overheard one server(a male) discussing his problems with his girlfriend while the other server rolled up silverware. The food was good the first visit but they had run out of the albondiga soup. The second visit they were out of kids menus( which is strange) and the server took a while to get our orders and our drinks.  Once we did order out of our party of 6 only 5 received their meals.  We had to ask 3 times for utensils.  Our server this time was running around frantically and you could tell she was very overwhelmed.  The food this time was fair it was very salty. I don't think I will be back or recommend it to anyone. Hopefully they will get their act together because it's a cute space."}
{"text":"Worst service ever...... My wife and I came here on a Monday night, with absolutely no one in here, and were ignored by our waitress the entire time. No refills, no check ups... Nothing. Never will be coming back... Made up my mind before we even got our food, which took awhile too."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from start to Finnish!!  The food, and service was top of the line. And prices were good also.  I had the chilly verde! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have been able to enjoy almost everything on the menu. This place deserves five stars for the fresh and delicious Mexican food. Everything I have ordered has been amazing. Tamales,tacos,enchiladas and taco salad all delicious. You can't go wrong with anything you choose."}
{"text":"We ate here last evening and thought the food was pretty good.  The chips, salsa, and guacamole were better than most Mexican restaurants. One of the things I liked was they give you a choice between refried or black beans. I thought the service was average at best which surprised me since the place was almost empty. Also, my wife ordered vegetable fajitas and  the vegetables were only onions and peppers and overpriced at $18. The fish tacos were good, but I never saw such small tacos in my life, wow. I suggest that you are more welcoming, offer kid's menu when kids are in the group, provide small plates for appetizers, and check to make sure everyone is satisfied after the entrees are served."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with this restaurant at first glance.  We met the owner, good ambience and good drinks.  However, once we got our food, I found a shard of glass in my enchilada.  When I brought it to our server's attention she went in the back and said she would let everyone know.  She then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't glass and part of a plastic bin that had broken before.  She then presented us with the check with no discount or apology or offer to make it right.  For being a family owned restaurant, I was shocked that there was no attempt to right their mistake.  It's a shame because the food was great and we were excited to come back.  However, their obvious lack in health standards and poor customer service should have everyone running the other way."}
{"text":"The food was very average for the price.  And $4 for a glass of coke is pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"One star only the chips were good and guacamole was good.  Food was awful Carne Asada was the worst I've ever had Rice was terrible Tortillas were bad Agua de Jamaica was weak The order came in \"short\" a taco had to call it out. Little did I know it wouldn't matter since it was awful.  I would never recommend this place to anyone. It was the worst."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Chips light and terrific salsa.  Chicken tacos served with really fresh black beans and Mexican rice were amazing. Fish tacos nearly as good. Great service and pretty view of Camelback Mountain.  Finally, the lunch menu is very reasonably priced.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"THe food was excellent!  Very fresh tasting. Loved the salsa that came with the chips.  Wonderful wait staff.  My Mexican Mule was delicious!  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12, and the staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful. They walked us through the menu, recommended what the restaurant was particularly known for, and seemed to genuinely want us to have a great experience. The food was excellent. I had the tamales, and the masa was light and fluffy - truly wonderful. The Colorado chili and fajitas got rave reviews from everyone in our party. And the topper was Tia herself coming out to talk with us and make sure we were enjoying ourselves. The staff and owners are the genuine article - not the phony smiles and canned BS that you get at chain restaurants. Going back again this Saturday- can't wait! (Gonna try the blackberry mojito- that also got raves as did their margaritas)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner and to our surprise there was only one other group in the restaurant. Being as there were only two tables ordering you would think the service would be top notch....NOT! Our water glasses never got refilled, we had to ask for napkins and silverware, we were never asked if we wanted another beverage and the best part was the bartender and two servers were tasting drinks behind the bar. Food was decent, but we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa are great! I love how lightly salted the thin chips are and the salsa is great. The salsa is served in a tiny dish so it was a little annoying having to ask for more salsa.   I tried the chicken enchiladas and they were tasty, definitely hits the spot when you get the craving. I didn't like the fact that they charge $19 for the enchilada plate, it's very expensive.  I decided to try the Churros which came with ice cream, it was okay. I wouldn't order it again as it was $10.50 THAT is outrageous!   The three stars are for the overall rating, the food was great but overpriced for sure!   I strongly believe if they lower their prices it could become my go-to Mexican food spot as I love to support local small business."}
{"text":"I would never come back here again. We were looking for a place to eat lunch and stopped here because it had a pretty good rating. Besides the great tortilla chips (which they don't offer to refill), the service was terrible and the food was not great. I had one of their lunch specials (carnitas tacos) and the refried beans were terrible and had a soup-like consistency with practically no actual beans. We had to signal for our servers (there didn't seem to be one identifiable server assigned to us), who didn't check in regularly despite having only two other tables filled.  It's possible this place is popular during happy hour for drinks but it's definitely not for their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Ok.  I have been here twice.  Tried it a second time just in case the poor service was a fluke the first time.  Nope, both times the  service is strange and nearly non existent.  We love to sit in the bar area.... and so does the staff which is very uncomfortable.   Both times they were all huddled at the bar eating.  Very unprofessional to be eating chips and salsa from behind the bar and taking up spots at bar.  Total turnoff.  And it's not just the  staff on their break.  It's all of them, and must be normal as it didn't seem to phase them that there were patrons at the bar.  The staff/ bartender could really step up their game.  Be warm and welcoming when someone comes in, not put out that you may actually have to make a drink.  The food is great.   Authentic Mexican...Happy hour specials were awesome. The place should be packed.  $1 barrio blondes! You should have a full house nightly with the great food and HH SPECIALS. You have a promising restaurant if you could get your staff onboard.  A simple \"hello, welcome\" could REALLY do a world of good for your business.  We didn't feel welcome and I could tell the 2 other tables that came in while we were there felt the same way.  We felt like a burden and it didn't make for a great HH experience.  Hope this might be able to help because you do have a cute place with great food."}
{"text":"The food was good but over priced. And if you order a la crate the portions are small"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant!  Staff is great and the food is fresh and delicious.  No refried beans here!  Just fresh, homemade food.  Decor is great and crowd was lively.  Well worth it and most definitely coming back to try more.  We had the guacamole for starters and then enchiladas (yummy) and taco combo.  The rice and black beans were delicious!  Owners are so nice!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Had the finest plate of all fresh Chile Colorado Picabo.  Service was terrific. Ambiance beautiful. It felt like home in a nice restaurant.  Ownership pride."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!  Yum!!!  Seems like home cooked recipes.  Great atmosphere and a fun local vibe.  Very friendly people and owners.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, with a great atmosphere and awesome prices.... This is your place. The food was outstanding, the staff was curious and attentive and it beats out so many other Mexican restaurants here in scottsdale! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A rather new restaurant that is outstanding.  Very clean, nice decor, and excellent food.  Met the owners; they are very nice.  Tina (aka Tia) is like a mother; very caring, involved, and happy.  Her husband is very nice as well.  The food is made from Tia's mother's recipes.  I had the Chili Colorado and it was outstanding.  Salsa was to die for; bought some to take home;  all natural and full of fresh herbs and tomatoes.  If you like authentic Mexican food and drinks, this is your place.  We will return here when we travel back to AZ."}
{"text":"Lisa was a great waitress and the hostess is   The gem of the restaurant. She went out of her way and served us as well, so polite. Food was amazing for happy hour, fish tacos, not fried!!!!! Beans and salsa to die for. Cant wait to go back and try non happy hour. Truly authentic Mexican.  Wait staff is amazing, teamwork. Kitchen a bit slow. Great yelp find"}
{"text":"Small little hole in the wall type of place. Really friendly staff who made for great conversation. The salsa was really tasty for the chips and salsa. The main dishes we had - enchiladas and tacos - were delicious! The 'secret' red sauce was so good. If you want quick, friendly, tasty Mexican food this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I'm going to spare the details of this kitchen nightmare to protect the guilty. Went there on a Friday and it was a mess - could not been have more poorly prepared to handle people who came to eat and drink. After waiting for food for over an hour we had to get it to go to make it back to pick up kids.  I want this place to succeed and the owners seem nice but if they keep this up it will be vacant in 3 months. The really need Gordon Ramsey to come in and save them."}
{"text":"I had some time to kill, so we had lunch here. The staff were fast, and very friendly. The waitress was slammed and still managed to be super conversational.   It's a good place for lunch. It felt like a place my mom would have loved. Friendly staff that remember you, and cute cinco de mayo decor.   The food was generous, and damn good."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. Great location. Nice patio. Inside decor is cute. Prices okay but food and service were just average. Had to ask for refills on drinks. Guacamole was tasteless. Chips and salsa were good."}
{"text":"OMG AMAZING!  I left this place eating just about everything because it was so authentic and fresh!  The tamales are truly homemade as the masa is made from scratch too!  Drinks are out of this world.  A Run down what we tried and went home wondering when's the next time we can go back SOON:  Chile Colorado (my fav!), red tamales, chile Verde and the churros!!   You go, you'll be addicted!  The staff is amazing and friendly that makes the experience even better!  The owners are local and family, very humble.  Tina and her husband both asked for our feedback and you can tell these two are so passionate about delivering authentic quality Mexican food!   Long story short, don't miss out! You'll fall in love!  5 stars just isn't enough!"}
{"text":"Fabulous chicken enchiladas and green chicken tamales! My favorite! Tina and Roy are very personable. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican food! Our family brought us for dinner after eating here earlier in the week. They loved it so much, they had to bring us. It was certainly worth the drive. The owner/chef focuses on a small menu of dishes she feels most confident in, and it pays off! The chili colorado, steak fajitas, & chicken enchiladas were incredible."}
{"text":"I ate here today. I wanted to it because I live very close and the people were so nice. Unfortunately, it is a no....no....no!  Let's start with the chips. They came to the table cold and a little stale tasting (the salsa was good!).  I thought, if these were warm, they would be fine. Then the second basket of chips came. They were warmed and still stale. Moving on to ordering. They waiter was friendly and efficient, but I think he forgot to turn the order in to the kitchen.   Our order did not make it to the table for 30 minutes and they were not busy at all. They ran out of the house rice so they served white rice with cilantro smothered in butter.   It did not need the butter!  There was nothing special or interesting about the food. If I'm going to splurge on the calories I want the food to be worthy and it wasn't. Next time, even though it is out of the way, I'm going to Carolina's. Yes, it is greasy and unhealthy too, but it is delicious and authentic!  So....wish I had better things to say about Shorty's, . Not going back."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were outstanding. The food was authentic and delicious. Been looking for a place like this since moving here 7 years ago!"}
{"text":"not as good as expected . The staff was fine . Atmosphere was very nice . However, the food wasn't quite worth it for the price . I've noticed a trend on the reviews regarding the high price vs food quality , and I would definitely agree ."}
{"text":"My wife attended an happy hour get together with other homeowners from our area.  Although there was over 90 people the staff did a great job getting everyone their drinks and food.  Before we left that night we had dinner which was terrific.  Later in the week we stopped by for lunch and again had a delicious meal with a great and attentive staff.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've eaten -  casual atmosphere but outstanding in service and quality.   The menu is not massive but very well designed for all palates.  The blend of spices she uses in her dishes change normally routine Mexican fare into a delightful, savory experience....amazing fresh tamales and salsas ....great margaritas .....don't miss this new restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had friends visiting from California who were craving for Mexican food. Looked this up on yelp, and made reservations. We got to the restaurant and saw that there were lots of empty tables. The sign outside said something like \"if you want good food it won't be fast\" or something like that. Sat down, ordered, got our meal after a whole hour. There are not enough staff. Staff were running around and just could not keep up. We asked for our bill and we waited again for 20 mins. We saw a couple waiting to be seated and they eventually left. Customer service is horrible. A customer walked up to the kitchen just to ask for his bill. Food was okay- had fish tacos (tortillas didn't taste like it was home made), beans, enchiladas and rice were alright. If you have 2-3 hours to waste and the patience then check this place out. Not for me."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this small gem looking for \"The Cove\".  I am Hispanic and so when going to a Mexican restaurant  it has to be like \"Dad's cooking\" it is a scratch kitchen!   The chips and salsa are great and the bean dip I can say my Dad would love! we had tacos chicken and shredded beef we enjoy them both along with side of rice and beans.. The HH margaritas are a hit the sweet and sour is a secret recipe. and Amy is a doll as well as the rest of the staff very attentive.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant close to old town. Fast service, good food and yummy margaritas! Overall our table had an excellent experience just wished they weren't out of one food and one drink item we tried to order."}
{"text":"We tried this place on our way to the Christmas train ride across the street at McCormick train park. It is so incredibly adorable! The service is great. The food is delicious but prepare to pay Scottsdale prices. Good house margarita and the Mexican mule is delicious! Good for the whole family. I wish there was a Thia Shorty's in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you can tell by the Mexican atmosphere that this a fun place! Eclectic Dia de los Muertos art is beautiful and the music was good. We went for happy hour in a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We had fish and carne asada street tacos with a side of rice and beans. The tacos and guacamole were AMAZING, the margaritas were strong but not over powering and the Spanish rice was good. The only thing to comment was the refried beans were very bland but a little salt made them up just right. The waitstaff was pleasant and so cute with the red flowers in their hair this is defiantly our new go-to place for a quick Mexican food and drinks. Great place to take out of town guests and there is plenty of parking. I can't wait to sit outside in the patio as soon as the summer heat is gone! The rest of the menu looked good and we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The was staying close by at the Scottsdale Plaza Resort and was looking for something within walking distance that was casual. The reviews looked pretty good so I tried the Carne Asada street tacos. The meat was amazingly tender and the presentation was fantastic. Their chips and salsa were also light, fresh and perfectly salted. The server did seem a bit stressed with the busyness of the lunch rush but I was taken care of. I would definitely be back, great portions for a tremendous value."}
{"text":"I am not sure what all the hype is about with this place.  Maybe I just came at an off time.  Came with my dad for happy hour and sat at the bar.  Bartender was not having the best of days - previous bartender left the place a mess and not ready for the night shift so I get the frustration but he just kept huffing and puffing about it and being snappy with anyone and everyone asking for drinks.   Restaurant set up and vibe is a little tacky in my opinion.  Giant girls with dia de muertos faces or giant faces of celebrities just isn't my cup of tea to look at while eating. They do have a nice patio.   Chips and salsa: I only think they are okay, I do not get the raving reviews.  The chips are thin crispy and salty but the salsa is meh - has some flavor but there isn't even a bit of spice.. its called SALSA not pulsed bland tomatoes. And its only one salsa they don't have a second or back up salsa maybe a spicy option? For a Mexican restaurant I find that weird ... but I love spice and I know some people don't.  So its good plain salsa. Happy Hour chicken tacos and fish were tasty. Good flavor, small but good.  If thats the size of the regular tacos for $17 then thats a joke.  Prices seem a little steep for what you are getting."}
{"text":"We love Mexican food and eat it often. My boyfriend is Hispanic and he likes authentic Mexican food, not the walk through the line type. Decor was very refreshing and fun. Everyone was very friendly. Service was great. Best chips and salsa I've had in a long time and a bonus to have complimentary bean dip.  The portions were very large, I assume they adjusted them from the previous reviews that said the portions were small. I had green corn tamales with chicken, delicious beans and rice and my boyfriend had the pork with green chili with fresh tortillas and it was excellent. The waitress was very attentive and asked if we needed more tortillas to let her know. We spent time talking to the owners who are very kind and down-to-earth. We give this a thumbs-up and highly recommend it. Prices were very reasonable compared to other Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale that we've gone to."}
{"text":"The food was good, they need a drink special during happy hour. The service was average"}
{"text":"One star is generous...noon on a Saturday, no customers, one carry out order waiting, quickly seated. As soon as we were seated they turned the volume of the music to an ear ringingly loud level. Suffered that for a few minutes as we waited for our waitress to take our drink order which, didn't happen. Quickly realized service wasn't a priority for the 4 people working so, we left. Bizarre and unwelcoming experience."}
{"text":"Overall this place is good, with just a few negatives.   We came in for a late dinner and requested a table outside because inside was like an ice box (turn the AC down a little please). Luckily it was a great night so it worked out any way.   Our server was not a 10, but she wants terrible. My friend ordered a Michelada and she said they didn't have those (he ended up going straight to the bar tender who said \"of course we have those\" and made him one; when the waitress brought it she pointed out that it was made special for him...no it wasn't). I also had to ask 3 times for our order of guacamole.   The food was delicious, very clean Mexican, not like the home style restaurants that are more authentic. I had a taco salad with carnitas and have no complaints. Everyone else had tacos and enchiladas and cleaned their plates. Plus we want though 9 baskets of chips - LOL!   Over it was good but I won't be running back upon my return to AZ. I think there are better Mexican food places."}
{"text":"I thought the food was excellent, but would agree with some of the other reviews that the portions were small. Our server also used to work there when it was the COVE and she was excellent. I thought the hostess was hard to find and saw more people than just my party standing up front for more than a few minutes waiting to be seated at 6pm on a Saturday night. There also wasn't a sign that said to wait to be seated. I was surprised to find out both of the owners were sitting in the dining room while we were dining and neither one of them came up to ask if we enjoyed our dinner or even to refill a water that was empty. We also asked about salsa to go because it was on the menu and were told because they don't know how busy they will be, they can't sell salsa to go. If you have customers dying to take home some of your salsa because they loved the place, sell it to them for God's sake and make some more!"}
{"text":"Food was average. The cheese enchilada was  slightly less then hot. Best part of meal was Spanish rice."}
{"text":"Excellent And authentic Mexican food. Guacamole and bean dip for starters! The tamales (Red) were my choice and my wife had steak fajitas. Margaritas had an honest pour! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is one of the Best authentic Mexican restaurants I've eaten at since i lived in San Diego!! The best service and even the real Tia Shorty came over to our table to introduce herself and to ensure we were happy w the food!! She was so sweet and her food again is amazing we will be back soon!! Go check this restaurant out you will be happy u did!! Thanks Tia Shorty and staff you guys Rock!! Nikki & Steve"}
{"text":"I chose them due to their location being across the street from my hotel. It was lunch time and I was hungry. Prefect match.  I ordered their taco lunch special, but couldn't decide between the fish or shrimp. I did one of each. The fish taco is so delicious with the creamy chipotle sauce. The shrimp was just meh. The shrimp was not seasoned and the pineapple jicama salsa was sweet, but mild in flavor. It wasn't enough to provide flavor to the taco. Also note that the lunch tacos are street sized.  I really liked that they were single-shelled.   The beans were a looser refried bean mixture, if that makes sense. They weren't thick and dry and had a decent flavor.   The rice had a good texture and was flavorful.   My sugar-rimmed, on the rocks, strawberry margarita was perfect. The right balance of alcohol to flavor ratio. Enough alcohol to hit the spot, but not enough to knock you out on the first drink.    Service was good. Not over or underwhelming.   I would recommend."}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal with family and friends, food was awesome and the Margaritas were off the hook"}
{"text":"My wife had the shrimp tacos and I had the carne asada tacos. Both were excellent. The guacamole was ok but the salsa was very tasty. We are outdoors which was lacking a bit in atmosphere but we wanted to be outside. The inside of the place looked great. Service was efficient and appropriate."}
{"text":"Went to Tia Shorty's for Father's Day lunch. I had the taco salad with chicken and was thoroughly satisfied. The chips and salsa were very good.  My father-in-law mirrored other Yelpers with his critique of the watery beans.  My husband had the fish tacos and reported that he was underwhelmed by flavor, portion size, and presentation.  Our daughter enjoyed the single tamale and rice she ordered, no complaints there.  Not sure we put the extra miles onto our vehicle for this one again, maybe not a worth it drive as a destination on its own, but might return if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The food is phenomenal and the service is given with a warm smile and a cold margarita :)  It's a family owned business and Tina and Roy take pride in their restaurant and their staff.  I recommend the crunch tacos and the enchiladas.  Don't forget the bean dip w/ your chips!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from the get go to the table service! We actually meet with Tia Shorty and it was an awesome time speaking with her. The food is top notch, the tamales made from scratch, the albondiga soup was to die for, the flan just right and also made from scratch! I will continue to come back with my family and make this my Mexican restaurant stop in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I would never step foot in here after hearing about the rude comments from the bigots that run this place. Don't support them."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly service, festive atmosphere!  We were in town for the Fiesta Bowl and needed a place for 16 to eat.  Tia's took care of our large group with amazing food and drinks.  The green chile verde sauce was fantastic as were the steak fajitas!"}
{"text":"A little high priced and LIMITED  menu.  If you are vegetarian...not much on the menu for you. I ask if they could make a veggie tacos (most places will) all they offered was multi color peppers and two kinds of onion.  Settled on 3 small cheese enchiladas- closest thing to vegetarian, came pretty much room temp and a tablespoon of lettuce.  It was just ok probably will not go back.. We were the only people in the restaurant at 3pm on a Friday."}
{"text":"These guys have great potential and they are just getting started. I love the food that I've had so far despite their operational issues. I think they will work through them because they just opened up in this area that so desperately needs a good Mexican restaurant and shorty's certainly has great food. I'll keep coming back here for the food and hope that the restaurant kitchen will settle down. Keep at it you guys."}
{"text":"The proximity to the train park and being Mexican food sealed the deal for us on this visit. I met a friend at the train park and we hopped on over at lunchtime. I was bummed there was no shade outside to sit with our kids-- so they could roam and we could semi enjoy a few bites between chasing them. No fault of the restaurant, but could've been solved by a number of umbrellas.  The food prices were okay... $9-$12 for lunch and $7 for kid meals (which I thought was about $1-2 overpriced). They had a limited menu for lunch, but the offerings were fine.   I'm a vegetarian, so while \"authentic\" Mexican food sounds appealing, they do in fact use lard in their refried beans (which is obvi what makes them so good I'm sure but I can't vouch for that) and chicken stock in the rice. So once again, I was left with the ever-so-exciting side of black beans with my enchiladas (because no other options were veggie-friendly). I asked if the enchiladas were vegetarian and the reply, was, \"yeah, just cheese.\"   They arrived and there was a large piece of what looked like chicken in my enchilada (that was already super soggy and drenched with sauce and cheese). I'm not sure there was a tortilla under there, to be honest. I pushed it aside and ate beans for lunch.  Their saving grace were the chips and salsa that were perfectly thin and tasty. Iced tea was $3 (crazy because the margin was at least 98% on that) and the side of sour cream for my son's quesadilla was $1. The kid quesadillas were deep fried, it seemed, as the tortilla was completely drenched in oil. My kids split a meal and it was plenty large enough for them to do so given their ages (ages 3, 5), so that was nice. The drink options were slim for kids and no milk.   I think we'll stick to picnic lunches or eating at the train park from here on out."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Inconsistent slow (but pretty nice) service, waitress seemed to be waiting on the entire restaurant. My margarita was all sugar and minimal tequila and 10-12 bucks from memory (which I have no problem paying for a good stiff drink). My wife and I both had meat in our dishes (beef and pork) and it was chewy and unpleasant. We live right across the street and were really hoping this place would be good, unfortunately....."}
{"text":"This little gem has great margaritas and salsa!  We love it and the atmosphere is cool as well.  Tons of dia de los muertos images, bright colors and cozy atmosphere.  I like the location and the food and service is great.  It's not your typical Mexican food.  They have many interesting items to choose from.  There margaritas are awesome and there are many flavor to choose from."}
{"text":"it's new, slow , inept and boring. after an hour and a half, with no more than one small bowl of salsa, no plates, no straws etc... the cold ,limpy tasteless food came out. by the time someone reads this, the biz will be out of biz.     YEP.   IT'S OUT OF BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"This is a hard one.  The tacos and food are REALLY good, but every time I visited, service was EXTREMELY poor.  Haven't been there for month, could have changed but it wasn't worth going back for us."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican flavors hidden in a shopping center! My boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for great Mexican food when we travel and Tia did not disappoint. Complimentary bean dip and delicious salsa with those super crispy thin chips started the evening off right. The freshly made guacamole tasted right out of the garden. My crispy beef tacos were outstanding and neither of us could get enough of the rice is was so delish. We happened visit with the owner Roy and his son-in-law Alan as we were walking out and    Got the  dish on Tia's story. Our evening was complete. We left with full tummys, jubilant tastebuds and a great sense of family. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now.  Slushie mango margarita with queso dip, chips and salsa is the best we've had....and we are foodies!  Crispy tacos and green chili verde with warm flour tortilla were amazing!  This is our new fav Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food but their service is super sloooow...spend the money to hire more staff.  Hire a bartender."}
{"text":"Arrived after lunch rush. Sat at the bar and ordered a lunch special assuming it would be fairly quick. After about 20-25 minutes of waiting with zero contact with anyone as to why I was still waiting, I had to leave. There was only 10 customers there so no idea what the issue was. If you are going to make someone wait that long for a lunch special, you have to communicate why. Walked out.. Now I am back in the office.. hungry.."}
{"text":"I consider Tia Shorty's more of an up and coming place and I hope they stick around. The GF and I have been there several times now and it's been a good experience. More of a classic Americanized/comfort food version of Mexican, which is great when you're in the mood for it. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"My Mom and I went there for the first time, The chips and salsa were the best! They just need to serve the salsa in a bigger bowl it was so good. We both ordered the cheese enchiladas, that is our test meal to see if it was good. Well it was different, the tortillas were corn and not soft enough or hot enough, there definitely was not enough cheese inside, it fell short. But the bean dip was to die for, I can just eat that for a meal.  The rice and beans were fantastic. I will go there again for sure, but i will ask for more cheese inside my enchilada and I will try other dishes. Go Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is such a great new restaurant in Scottsdale for a great drinks and food. The staff is so nice and accommodating. The food is true authentic Mexican food. You won't be disappointed. If you love good Mexican food, go here! It is such a nice treat."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and after looking at different places in the area we decided to try tia shortys. We visited Sunday around 8pm and the food was delicious amazing recommendations made by the gal who was working at the bar. Amazing quality will totally be visiting again when in Arizona"}
{"text":"It was sooooo good! Excellent service. I loved the decor. Perfect margarita and chips and salsa to die for. Loved the green enchiladas too. Will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Came in late after large rush. Tia greeted us and was very cordial. Very welcoming, great chips, salsa and bean dip. Nice patio seating section. Food was fast as expected, meal of carnitas and carne asada taco plates, queso dip, one kids bean and cheese burrito. Great for classic Americanized Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Late post. My husband and I where there a week ago. My husband had the Roy's special, and I had the tacos both was very  delicious, and the Tina Margarita was oh soo good. All -n-all excellent service and food!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Chicken enchiladas were fresh and seasoned perfectly. We'll be back no question."}
{"text":"I am very picky with Mexican restaurants.  This place is awesome and the best, by far.  Nate is amazing but it was only amplified after meeting other employees and Tia Shorty herself.  Definitely a place I will go to often."}
{"text":"I recommended this place to some friends and unfortunately they both got food poisoning from it.  Makes me nervous to return..."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Service was awesome! A plus overall experience! Food was good, guacamole was amazing!"}
{"text":"After two different lunch visits with colleagues to Tia Shorty's, I definitely can't say I recommend eating there.  On both visits our group of seven was greeted by the same surly, unsmiling, un-welcoming hostess who seemed like she'd rather be anywhere but here.  I concur ma'am.  Each time we came shortly after they opened for lunch and unpreparedness was a theme both times.  Ask for hibiscus tea- it hasn't been made yet. Ask for potato tacos- the potato stuff required for the dish hasn't been made yet and they can't whip it up in time for us.  Um no bueno.  On both visits they gave two very small baskets of chips for seven hungry people, didn't bother to ask us if we wanted more when they were gone after 5 minutes (we did!), and then we waited 40 minutes for the food we ordered.  We won't be returning and have recommended others in our very large office down the street from the restaurant to avoid going."}
