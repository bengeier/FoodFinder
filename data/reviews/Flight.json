{"text":"Lots of local beer on tap, good appetizers, and great atmosphere! We had the dip trio and it was great!"}
{"text":"A generous 3 stars. Staff was nice. Huge beer selection on tap. Mac and cheese was like soup. Weird. We'd go back for a beer and then go somewhere else.  Should've named it layover."}
{"text":"Well we are sitting here bored, minus our amazing company. Waiting for our Reuben's since umm about 7:15. Service is terrible. The bus boy paid us better attention than our waitress."}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if it were an option.   \"Top shelf open bar.\"  No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. \"That's like top, top shelf.\" I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle.   Fucking disappointment."}
{"text":"Spectacular beer selection.  I could not count the number of beers on tap, but they had a wide selection of all the different classifications.  We did not order any food there, but everything we saw coming out looked very good.  It is a great place to go and just hang out.  The tables all have various games (Uno, Connect 4, etc.)  and there is even a ping pong table in the back.  The patio had well placed misting sprinklers to keep you from getting too hot or even too wet.  There was live music on the patio and another band was setting up inside for live music."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer! Food was great too! I ordered the club and a couple of beers after work. Very cool theme and ambiance of the place. I only wish I had a chance to catch one of the many concerts that Flight puts on every week. Would definitely recommend for beer aficionados and anyone looking to diversify their palate"}
{"text":"Go cocks! As a proud USC alumni, I love coming to Flight to watch the gamecocks. The bar is almost always PACKED for any Usc football game. The atmosphere is so fun! Lots of TVS with one large screen in the back. So many beer choices on tap and reasonably priced drinks.  Food is hit or miss. Pretzel and tot nachos are my favorite. Mac n cheese is a definite no-go here. It tastes like burnt peanut butter.  Bathrooms .. all other bars should use flight as the example bathroom. They actually have more than 2 stalls! Praise! There is hardly ever a wait.   If you come when there is no USC game, flight has board games available at their long picnic tables with makes it fun!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to go down the list   Parking:  It's expensive but that's not Flights fault.  We paid $10.00 to park across the street.  Could be bad for business though  Service:  I thought the wait staff did well considering we were 20 people deep.  I only had one issue, we asked one of the waitresses that handed us a beer for another beer we wanted to order.  She said; \"ask your waitress\".  I didn't understand that, just go get the waitress or put in for that beer.  And are you not our waitress?  Because we had multiple people from the wait staff handing us things.  Overall, wait staff Grade B   Food:  Very good.  I was very please.  And I saw everyone else's food come out, it looked good.  Grade A  Beer:  There's a lot of beer, hence the name I believe.  However, there is a competitive beer market in Charlotte.  Down the road fresh in house beer is being sold at $4 a pint.  The average beer at Flight is about $7.00 per pint.  That is too much.  Also, you have to wonder how fresh the beer is when there's like a 100 taps.  Beer Grade C   Seating:  I believe this is what starts to change things.  It's all these long tables yet it's not strictly a brewery.  There is a nice little area with pub tables.  However, you're kind of being secluded in that area.  It's in the corner after a couple of steps. I believe their food is good enough to make people want to come to eat during dinner yet the atmosphere just screams BAR.  I feel like they need to bring those large tables out after the dinner group is done, maybe around 10 pm, and give basic dining seating around 6 pm - 10 pm  Grade D   Noise:  I don't understand why there was a man between 7-9:30 pm playing guitar as loud as he could.  I'm trying to eat because you're a restaurant.  Also, I'd like to have a conversation with my friends.  I understand maybe creating an ambiance.  But this dude was playing like he was at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.   Save that for after the dinner crowd leaves.  My head was on a trillion.  Grade F   Anyway you get the general consensus.  Food is really good, service is good, parking is tough, beers are expensive, it's noisy, but it has a lot of potential.  I hope it survives and these little things are improved upon.   Thanks"}
{"text":"I recently visited this new location. It was Saturday July 23rd around 7pm. When I first arrived, I was asked to set up a membership with their location because they're considered a private bar and in North Carolina, that's the law. So I happily obliged. I didn't really want to write down my mailing address, email, and phone number, but i did it anyways. The lady at the front desk gave me a membership card that I signed and dated. The waitress then sat my friend and I down at a table. We ordered some drinks, an appetizer, and 2 entrees. The food was good, that's not my complaint. We had an overall decent experience that night. I left, and after that, didn't think too much of it. A few days later on Thursday morning (July 28th) I woke up to 3 missed calls and voicemail from the manager of Flight accusing me of coming into his establishment Wednesday night (27th) and leaving without paying my tab. He demanded that I come back to the restaurant and pay my tab or that he would contact the authorities. I wasn't anywhere near that place after Saturday and hadn't stepped foot in it since. To make matters worse, I logged into Facebook to see that one of the waitresses from this location had gone out of her way to locate my profile and message me to threaten me herself. Neither of the associates took the time to ask me if i was there or if i was truly indeed the person who did this. They immediately pointed the finger at me and violated my privacy by searching for me online. This is the most unprofessional experience I have ever encountered from a company. You clearly can't trust them with your personal information. If they can't check their logs to see that I was clearly not signed in on that day, why are they even open? They seem to care very little about following the law and staying compliant. I will ensure that anyone in my circle of acquaintances will be aware of this issue and I wanted to make sure the public becomes informed of it as well."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. This reminds me of why I miss living in a major city. Came to watch the Warriors/Cavs game. The online Facebook promotion stated \"Come watch the game endless crab legs\". Game started at 9pm. I arrived at 8:45. Couldn't get any service. Every hostess kept saying \"brb\" \"just a minute\".  Finally one hosted saw my frustration and said sorry for the delay but we don't have any more seats, you can slide in at the bar. So after waiting another 20 minutes I find a seat and sit at the bar. Lo and behold the bartender says \"crabs\" ended at 9pm. All I could do is laugh as this point. Manager comes out and says sorry we got more folks than we expected lol. He doesn't even offer to comp anything or do anything to make the situation better. That's the difference in DC or NYC. People care about their customers. They know they make far more money off of making sure folks are taken care of. Guess that's not the way things are run at flight."}
{"text":"The only reason it's getting one star is because it's a Gamecock bar. Also there's no option for zero! Every time I've come to try and watch a game, or just have a drink, the service has been less than desirable.  Went for happy hour after work the other day.  It was early so the place was pretty much empty.  3 of us sat down at a table and flagged down this fat, bald bartender when we noticed he was serving the table right behind us.  He immediately snapped at us with his hands in the air and literally yelled, \"Give me second, I'm really busy! Just give me a second!\" Again, the place was empty, several other staff available. Why the attitude and refusal to serve us? Not saying this was it, but just noting the fact that the table behind us were your typical white male bankers in blue shirts and khakis, and we were a table of diverse women. Just sayin. We got up, paid for our one round of drinks, and went and spent our money at another bar who didn't blatantly discriminate. I asked to speak to a manager and no one seemed to care. Disappointing and lame!"}
{"text":"We stumbled into Flight after wandering around the Uptown area. The garden greets you with a lot of open space, an outdoor bar, plenty of seating, tvs, and cornhole and jenga.   Once inside, it was very loud as they had a live band playing. However the band was awesome, they even inspired me to dance a little. They also had shuffle board and some basketball games dispersed throughout the venue.  For a Saturday night it was completely dead, maybe 15 people at the bar? They serve food, but we did not try it. They had drink specials ($3 Dos equies), but we were more impressed by their large selection of beers on tap. They had local breweries like Wooden Robot among others for selection. A big enough list to fill front and back of a large sheet of paper.   We don't come to Uptown often, but if we do again I wouldn't hesitate to stop by Flight for a good time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for drinks and music in Charlotte North Carolina.  Great food, great atmosphere, great beer, wonderful staff."}
{"text":"Great idea to turn a club venue into a beer garden. The lat tone I was here it was Re:public and I met Common & DJ Dummy. Anyhow, I stopped in on a lazy Sunday. It wasn't packed, but the game was on (GO CAVS!), so I ordered a pint...that turned into two and an order of Totchoes.  Tater tots, covered in beer cheese, bacon, pico de gallo & jalepeños. It was more than I expected, but delicious and filling. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Lazy as fuck employees. Bartenders suck balls. Wouldn't get cornhole out for us though it would only take them \"20 whole minutes\" on a Saturday night when they have no business"}
{"text":"Came here for karaoke and they didn't keep anyone's song on. There were 5 other people in the bar and they cut off people in their songs saying people were killing the vibe. There was no vibe and the drinks honestly are overpriced."}
{"text":"Nice draft beer selection.  It ends there.  Tacky establishment with tacky ass Gamecock banners hanging from wooden joists.  Urinals have urinal cakes with Clemson Tiger football helmet logos on them.... Not Cool.  I won't come back due to obvious poor judgement and hatred of my beloved Tigers.  Go Tigers!   56-7!"}
{"text":"Flight has to be my favorite place in Uptown Charlotte. The bartenders and waiting staff are so friendly and the environment just tops it off. I ordered 3 different IPAs which the bartenders recommended and they hit it on the dot. Not to mention this \"Garbage Plate\" my friends and I had which at first sounds like a weird combination of things but man was it so good! I will be recommending Flight to all of my friends and everyone I see."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like Flight as it added another much needed option in Uptown. However the food was underwhelming and the service was beyond disappointing. Our waitress abandoned our table after we ordered our food and we had to flag down one of the runners to check on the status after 30 minutes. Flight is great if you are looking for a bar late night with snacks, but if you want to meet here for a meal, there are far better options with better service in uptown."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!! here on business coming from LA and catching a show at the theater across the street (one of my favorite bands Drew Holcomb and the Neighbors happened to be in town) and I stopped in here to check it out. Jianna at the front was very nice and welcoming and appreciated her positive energy! My waitress Hailey was very kind, prompt and helpful, she came and got my order, got my drink and food and even checked on me so promptly even though the place was so crowded! Love that kind of service and she did it with such a great attitude! She also gave me recommendations about what to see around the area and what was good on the menu (the tater tots were amazing!!!) overall a great first meal in Charlotte for me and a really great vibe accompanied by great food and service= 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place.  Tons of beer on tap.  Large stage,  Nice beer garden. Open space.  The appetizers we did have were good.  Bacon wrapped poppers, some fried pickles..all good.  Staff was on their game as well.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Love the wide open space! Fantastic beer list and they even offer liquor and wine! I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of musical acts they book! I like the outdoor area a lot, feels like a real beer garden! Haven't had the opportunity to try food yet but look forward to giving it a spot next time! Service was great!   Women's bathroom was a little too dark, especially in the sink area! Suggestion is to improve the lighting!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday and it was dead. They were out of the first three beers that we tried to order, yet the server didn't know they were out and had to come back 3 times before we finally found a beer they did have in stock. There are games and stuff to play and I'm sure it gets busier at night but it was definitely not the Sunday funday location we were looking for. For it to be a place known for draft beers, they really need to stay on top of their stock of kegs and knowledge regarding what they have and don't have."}
{"text":"A group of us popped in here on a Saturday night to find the place completely dead. We were all buying drinks and saw a sign for karaoke that night. Since the place was soooooo lively we decided to sing. Now keep in mind, if you're going to advertise karaoke past 10 pm you're not going to get the voices of angels. Long story short \"management\" (quotations bc it doesn't exist here) shut the music off within 3 songs. Again the place had NO one in it. There were 18 of us - all buying drinks and having a good time. Get a life people. Loosen up. Have some fun.   I would not recommend this place again to anyone. I came when they first opened and for a Christmas party and it was super fun. See previous review. The place has declined since and probably explains why no one was there.   Dirty bathrooms. Sticky floors. All the bartenders look depressed, except the girl who had a little personality. Food still on the tables. What a mess!!   I always leave true honest reviews, and did not expect such a disappointing night here. Would not return - even for free drinks. They better fix something ASAP or they won't survive in CLT."}
{"text":"Flight is the beer bar that uptown Charlotte has needed.  We have breweries all over this city, but no place uptown to really  chill out and enjoy NC beer in a venue that wasn't first a restaurant.    The space is BIG and open.  There is a really long bar and space towards the back that could support live music.    I was very impressed with the long list of NC beers.  I love having 40+ options that are all local (within the state) in one location.  They also have a full bar and wine options.    The outdoor patio has misters for really hot weather (i.e. 9 months of the year here).  I just dropped in for a quick drink - but initial impressions were above and beyond my expectations."}
{"text":"Delicious pretzels and totchos. They have a good selection of drinks, including several ciders for those of us who don't like (or are allergic to) beer. Casual atmosphere, saw a bunch of guys there right after work so they were dressed up, but not everyone was. Also had games in the back and a bunch of tics including a large projector screen to watch the sports events."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to flight I have had a great time! I first started going because a lot of my friends live in fourth ward and it is convenient but then continued to go because my friend stephanie works for them and tells me about their events! I love going to the drunk spelling bees, whether you're participating or just watching it's always a good time! The food has always been good and I love the beer selection. I can't wait for this weekends \"wreck your resolution\" !!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Ordered delivery through uber eats none of the orders had the condiments that went with it. No utensils were included as well. But it was hot and tasted fresh. I was informed that if I wanted the condiments that I would have to come to the restaurant myself to get them."}
{"text":"Music was great food was good definitely need to work some kinks out but it there first week so we will see but expect great things Music was a great side"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Ping pong,beer and food!! Joe Arocho, Moe Johnson, Andrew Woods and the staff are fantastic!! I strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday when live bands were playing. Bands were awesome !!!!  Had a Rueben with steak fries that were absolutely amazing. Best Rueben I have ever had in my entire life!!! Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Flight is a little bit of everything, and that's what I love about it. I finally ate here, so I wanted to write the review now - because you know I like telling you what to eat.   First off - All you can eat crab legs. Why is there such a need for this in the city? I don't know. But I don't mind it either. Come in on a Monday night and score crab legs for $35.99. You get one order of hush puppies, an ear of corn cut in half, and a few potatoes - Note: They don't force these down your throat, SAVE ROOM. Then they will keep refueling the crab legs until you say no. It's amazing. They also have garbage plates, poutine (and perogies on game day,) because this is your friendly neighborhood Charlotte CLEVELAND bar! Heyo, transplants of clt! Welcome home. On a very serious note: if it's not Monday, get the garbage plate and poutine. They're both fantastic and really seem to hit the spot.   I don't want to forget to tell you either, Flight has 80 taps. 80 BEER TAPS. Most are local craft, there's a handful of out of towners (hey northerners, they've got Great Lakes on tap!). Hang out, have a beer or five, they do live music and it's a wide open space. What's not to love about Flight?! Check it out. I'll meet you there."}
{"text":"We went Friday night around 10:30. We had a fairly large group just grabbing beers from the bar. They had a ton of bartenders just standing around while 2 people served us. Not very efficient.   That being said there was a good selection of local beers on draft with the option for 22 oz pours. My friend and I shared a soft pretzel that was definitely not worth $10. It was very dense and too chewy. We enjoyed the presentation as it came out hanging from the same device I use to hang my bananas at home!  The band that was playing was good but too loud. Maybe I'm just an old lady.   The front patio is awesome. Nice long tables. We had a group of 10-12 people and fit at one picnic table comfortably.   They're new and if I'm out in the area again I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"When I heard they do Taco Thursdays, I cancelled all dinner plans and went straight there.   I've been to Flight before, but only during bar crawls so this was my first sober experience. I love the openness of the \"garden\" and how much seating there is. Located right near the light rail so it's easily accessible for all.  Back to the food... when it comes to tacos, naturally I love authentic but can also appreciate American versions, too. If I'm going to eat an American style taco, I prefer tortilla options (corn all the way). The flour tortilla was a letdown for me. There was a good amount of spice in the filling (I had chicken and beef) and there was definitely a good amount of filling. The best tacos are so stuffed that you have another meal after you're done to eat with chips, amiright? Overall, not the best taco experience I've had; I wouldn't go back for them.  What I WILL go back for are those tochos! Tots. Beer cheese. Enough said."}
{"text":"I mentioned in my last review that it felt like most of the employees were just hanging out but the last few times we came here we were able to get decent service. I came on Friday night and it was not crowded and I kid you not 5 employees were by the front table the whole time we were there. We even went up and asked for a menu from the group and they continued to just sit and chat with each other. It's been a while since I actually left somewhere because it was so bad. These employees need some training or better management."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to find a place that makes delicious Appletinis.  It has the perfect amount of sweetness and alcohol.  Your cheesy fries and pretzel with cheese is good as well.  The menu has a nice twist with Flight themes.  I also like the different events they hold.  Fun times are always had at Flight!"}
{"text":"Cool bar with lots of space and picnic table seating.   Went here to play Citizens of Humanity with some friends.   Tots and fries were pretty good. I probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again - too soft and fell apart.  It's next to Lucky's, so you can go next door if you get bored."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very cool, chill vibe, would be great for a private party. Pretzel with beer cheese and mustard is great. Awesome live music outside, dog friendly."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection! The new updated menu is fantastic. Trivia on weds is fun and I love the live music on the weekends"}
{"text":"We came her for the first time for a USC away game (my boyfriend and I are alumni and this is the gamecock bar of charlotte). The first time, we came in before kickoff to find most seats were taken but we grabbed a few and ordered a bunch of food. Unfortunately, my boyfriends little brother decided he wanted to join us and it's primarily a beer hall and they check IDs at the entrance, so he couldn't get in. We tried again for the USC v ECU game which was a home game and it was much less crowded, but still had a ton of energy. Both times, we had the same waitress, Diana, and she was awesome! She transferred our entire first order to go so that we could go meet up with the brother and then the second time, she remembered us (!) and checked in on us regularly despite a big crowd. She was awesome! Also, both times we got the pretzel with beer cheese... Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment and layout. I ordered 4 of my favorite beers and......they were out of all of them. I would've given this a higher rating but I had to settle on beer choice so 4 stars."}
{"text":"Place is your typical bar.  Food menu is extremely limited.  No vegetarian or vegan options except for a sad salad which is really weird considering it's 2017.  My brother got the salad and I did the brat which was ok.  Would've loved more options for food.  Beer selection is average so it doesn't help raise its rating.  Wouldn't recommend.  There are better places."}
{"text":"Went to flight as a work happy hour. I'm not a beer drinker so appreciated the diversity of ciders which was almost as good as having some wine.   Bottom line, it was a good experience. Lots of space, good service, cheap drinks for Uptown, and it was clean with some great music going on but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Flight boasts a very impressive beer list. I'm not a big beer fan but I had the Good Morning Vietnam and it was great. The food is great too. I had the burger with blue cheese on it and it has been days later and I'm still thinking about that burger! It's a bit loud inside with the music so when the waiter was taking our orders we had to talk louder. If you eat here, you may want to bring a seat cushion because the benches are pretty hard as all benches are. I have a ton of natural cushion and still had a sore booty. I want to give Flight five stars but we waited an insanely long amount of time for the waitress (who was as sweet as she could be) to get our receipts and payments processed. I believe she said there was something going on with their system. Flight had only been opened a few days so we didn't get pissed but it was just annoying. Next time I come back I plan on eating outside. Looks like this will be the place to listen to great live music!"}
{"text":"I love that Uptown now has a huge space dedicated to craft beer. With so many microbreweries around it was definitely time.   The service we had was outstanding with our order being taken quickly and my water glass never reaching the half way empty point. I got the chicken brat and fries and my old standby Red Oak. Unfortunately I was not wowed with the brat or the fries (which were underdone) but the beer was as good as ever. Some of the beer listed was quite expensive ($8 a pint and up) but Red Oak was reasonably priced at $5 a pint. They get points for letting you have a small sample of a beer before you commit to it.   My main complaint with the space was the noise level. Inside and outside both had loud music playing. It isn't just that I am old - we were there pretty early on the weekend and still had a bit of a struggle to communicate.   The beer menu is huge but the food menu was not so much. I would definitely return for a beer but would eat before I go."}
{"text":"Is Flight a beer garden? That is perhaps up for debate - I mean it's on College Street. And the garden-y part of it is probably more inside the building than out. But that doesn't mean that it's less interesting. You do have picnic tables, after all. So perhaps a pass on the purest definition of garden and you can see how it would work.   The place certainly has beer. Plenty of beer, all lined up in pretty taps on the wall, and they are happy to provide you with samples of said beer. I don't know if there is a limit, but if there is, I've never seen it. On certain days of the week (Tuesdays?) you can even get a 22 ounce for the price of a pint. On other days (Thursdays?) you can get cheap tacos. The message here is check for specials.  Staff is very friendly, though they do tend to go off on their own, so you might need to track them down from time to time, but when you find them they are happy to help. And unlike many bars, the food is tasty, whether you order something simple like Totchos (nachos made with tator tots) or the fancy-looking pretzel. It's fancy because it hangs from a banana hanger. It doesn't change the taste, but it looks cool. And they have a dessert one too."}
{"text":"I went here after seeing their advertisement for all you can eat crab legs. For $35.99 every Monday night from 5pm-10 pm you can get all you can eat Crab legs plus hush puppies, boiled corn, and potatoes. They were delicious and amazing. I will definitely be back for some more! Also, I love the atmosphere of Flight. It is like a beer hall with long benches and tables. The other great thing is they have 91 beers on tap with lots of great flight pairings. I had the \"How bout them apples\" flight and it was one of the best combinations of cider I have ever had. To top it off, we had great service! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Guys, they have totchos. Do I really need to say anything else?! Tater tot nachos. Tots smothered and covered in beer cheese, bacon, jalapenos, pico, and sour cream. Yes. Oh hells yes.   Flight is a place that uptown really needed. It's the perfect marriage of a live music venue and craft beer garden. They have over 90 beers on tap, plus a full bar. So, if you can't find a drink option that you like here, then maybe the problem is you.   The menu isn't huge, but it doesn't need to be. I love the presentation of the homemade pretzel. It comes out on a banana hanger. Last visit we had that, the totchos, and beer battered cauliflower. I like that there's a build your own brat section on the menu.   College football-wise, they are the home of South Carolina gamecocks. There's bunch of fun board games. Follow them on social media and check their website for bands and upcoming special events."}
{"text":"I've been to Flight a couple of times with a larger group, and we've always gotten great service. All of the bartenders are really knowledgeable about the beer selection and provide good suggestions and samples of beer. Their on tap selection is vast and features local, regional, and beyond.   I like the open layout of the venue and the long banquet tables mixed with smaller high tops. It's a great place to watch a sporting event! My only complaint is with the food selection. It's mediocre and will satisfy your munchies (as long as you're not vegetarian). The nachos were made with pita chips, which is original but ended up not being very good. I would definitely recommend this as a great bar, though!"}
{"text":"I've tried to give this place a decent chance, but there are many places I'd rather hang out at when I'm in Uptown. The first time I went it was part of the big Halloween bar crawl, the place was PACKED as expected and I was fine with waiting for a bit to get a drink. Last weekend I met up with some friends there, the place really wasn't that busy for its size and we waited FOREVER to even get acknowledged by a bartender - I'd expect better considering it was a Saturday night. By the time we did get drinks I got two vodka cranberries - one was mostly vodka, the other all cranberry. Then there was their live band - they were terrible, unless of course you were drunk, When they finally finished and the DJ took over my ear drums were thankful. I likely won't return given that there's plenty of other options close by with better service, consistency, and music."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in town. Great staff and even their menu is pretty tasty. I would recommend the tachos to anyone but their garbage plate is also delicious if you can't make up your mind. I frequent Flight with friends and am never disappointed. Also, side note: the bathrooms are ALWAYS clean... even late night on Saturday. Great spot for good beer and bar food plus live music."}
{"text":"I came here for St. Patty's day and had a good time.  The bartender was really friendly, and not that fake friendly crap either.  She was legit.  I enjoyed all the drinks she made and although she was very busy, she was super attentive, which I appreciate.    The environment was nice.  There was a large range of people and age groups.  They also played some fun music.  I think I liked every song, which is rare!  Overall a good time here.  It's a large spacious bar with many drink options to choose from."}
{"text":"The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food. Definitely recommend the pretzel or tater tots."}
{"text":"The fact that this place serves garbage plates is an automatic five stars in my book! If you're not familiar with what a garbage plate is ( it's a Rochester, New York legend) do you were self a service and stop by flight and order one of these bad boys. It's not exactly diet friendly but it will be worth it! Once I got past my excitement of the garbage plates I still enjoyed the atmosphere and the helpful staff at flight. They had tons of beers on tap and the bartenders were very knowledgeable about the selection. They also had tons of fun activities like bocce ball and ping pong to keep you busy while you're drinking. I would highly recommend everyone to stop in and check out flight."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage service. Would rate negative stars if possible. Good beer selection."}
{"text":"The Southern Fries are Ahhhhnazing best $7 bucks k spend. Rusty our Bartender started off rude but made up for it. Came here for $1 shots which were strong . Good music; different genres ."}
{"text":"This place is alright. It's kind of out of the way.   Lots of open space for events I guess. I'm not to fond of the staff. They seem to be to busy to be proactive and helpful to customers."}
{"text":"I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Garbage and totchos on a menu. You know you made it to the right place. Also more beer than you know what to do with. Flight has a huge space with a nice outdoor area plus another bar. They've got a stage for djs and live music and tons of tvs up for sports. They really have everything you need here so I'm surprised to find it somewhat calm on most nights.   But that's one of the reasons I've been enjoying flight so much. It gives enough space for everyone to be spread out enjoying what they like. Whether it's playing ping pong inside to corn hole outside. Or just sitting at a picnic table and enjoying their wings.   Flight has a lot of events so watch their social media to try and take part in a drunken spelling bee or play bingo or join up with friends for a night of trivia and compete for awesome prizes (like a yeti cooler!). Flight seriously has some great specials and can give you the best price on craft beers on some nights in the whole city. Some beers get down to $2!! That's insane!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Flight despite some of the negative reviews. I came here as part of a bar crawl. I only ordered beer so I can't speak about the food.   Staff and bartenders were friendly. My group got served quickly with no complaints.   Beer list is solid- something for everybody. Prices are competitive for the area.   The coolest thing is the ambience. Very laid back environment. They also have a Jenga set outside and have an area for musicians. I would definitely return to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I came here recently to listen to U-Phonik (1990s & 2000s coverband - they are great). Nice & chill, great sound, ok priced beer ($4 for Corona beer special from my recollection) - nothing fancy, no crazy crowd, just good old fashion small venue with NO cover. Talking about an affordable night out!  AND if you haven't heard this band before, and you are a child of 90s & 2000s music, they are coming back on July 22!"}
{"text":"Beer selection was GREAT and the food was exactly what they advertise it to be. It would be a amazing place to watch a sporting event with that huge screen inside and they have a nice outside area with its own bar. Our service was pretty slow but they did just open so hopefully that will get better. Be ready to pay a few bucks more than you do at the breweries but I guess that is to be expected with the wide selection they have."}
{"text":"I went to a private event at Flight, so my review may be a little skewed.  The private event I attended was my first time at Flight. The atmosphere inside is very fun and fresh - the space is really open and there's ample room to dance, sit, be at the bar, and just hang out.  I ordered a few drinks, which were all random concoctions of the bartender and they were great! Their normal band - Under the Belt - was there. I enjoyed their music variety and danced a lot.   I would definitely like to check out Flight during a regular night. It seemed really fun and I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're reading this, it's too late.   Not a fan. There service was bad. Just want my Reuben. Has been an hour.  Also beware of the shoddy furniture - table shook worse than Indonesia in 2006 (big earthquake then BTW!). GREAT COMPANY THOUGH. TERRIBLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I haven't had the food--so my review is only based on the venue and drinks.  It's a really cool venue, it's located right in the heart of uptown. It's a great location for the nightlife on the weekend or the happy hour crowd during the week. There is plenty or space and seating inside the bar, as well as the outside beer garden space.   They have A TON of beers of tap--over 90 of them! There are so many options for any and every kind of beer drinker. They have a full liquor selection as well, but the beer is really the highlight. They have drink specials which is always appreciated.   I'm interested in trying out the menu, it looks great!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect!! Outdoor area, indoors in huge, long row bar, live music, food is heavenly & the service is spectacular!! Every single person I have encountered working here has been phenomenal!!  Best tip about this place: there's live music!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Service sucks. People are horrible. Drinks are overpriced. Food is terrible. Don't waste your time here. Go somewhere else. Take your hard earned money and go to town somewhere else. People here suck. They are so miserable. Don't even waste your time. Bye."}
