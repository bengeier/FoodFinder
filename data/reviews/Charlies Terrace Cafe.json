{"text":"Well, the staff is really nice and friendly. The muffins are moist. The coffee is hot and the iced tea is iced and brewed to perfection. I really like the cafe as a whole. My only complaint is with the prices. I know it's a little expensive because its on campus. But does an iced tea and a muffin really need to $7? Overall though, great place to get a bite and hang out."}
{"text":"So this place is well known by art students, but not all art students (but it should be). It is located in design north on the second floor. It is a coffee/tea/bagel/korma/salad/sandwhich kinda place.   Happy Hour is 3-5pm, half of espresso drinks.  I am in love with the vegetable korma, get it with greek yogurt for extra yuminess.   I like the convenience, especially in the morning when you didn't eat breakfast, just stop by old faithful Charlies and grab yo'self a bagel.  Americano with a splash of soy is my choice for espresso drinks. It is very good, just the right amount of coffee taste with the soy to mellow it out a tad. I like my coffee to taste strong, almost like it punched me to wake me up and this American is the one for me.   It is also a nice place to hang out and kill time before your next class. Plug-ins are limited for you laptop users. THE PATIO IS THE BEST PART, ESPECIALLY DURING COOLER MONTHS YOU CAN SIT OUTSIDE AND ENJOY. (minus the smokers, even though there are no smoking signs it happens and it sucks.)"}
{"text":"Usually this is a very nice and customer-friendly place. However, today I received the rudest and most unprofessional service I've ever received on campus. As I walked in, the worker and two vendors were talking about training concerning the coffees. After waiting for several minutes without being acknowledged, I asked, \"Excuse me, are you open?\"  Apparently aghast that I would interrupt him, the ignorant  male European vendor showed disgust on his face and twirled his fingers around his head as is to insinuate that I was crazy. The student behind me and I looked at each other in disbelief. I asked the worker for the manager's name and he proceed to tell me that they were in training and that the manager wasn't in. He then went back to his \"training.\" After receiving my food, I then asked another worker for the manager's name, and he pointed to the first worker that I had spoken to and replied, \" he's the manager.\" The manger, hearing us, then proceeded to look at me in disgust because he had been caught in a lie. This is one black woman who will NEVER spend her dollars at this so-called establishment again. The next training that they should receive is customer-service training."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service, great cashiers who are laid back and willing to converse.  The awesome thing about them too is that I used to have an early class, and they would be willing to help me get coffee and pastries a few minutes before they officially opened.  Consistently good coffee, chai tea, bomb pastries, and an awesome happy hour at 3pm for half on espresso drinks.   Do note, they have moved to downstairs."}
{"text":"what can i say about a place like charlie's?   if you don't go to asu, there's no reason you would ever come here unless you were  visiting someone. actually, scratch that, you probably wouldn't ever come here unless you're a design student.  located on the second floor of design north, charlie's is the go-to break spot for students when they need a coffee fix.  during the school year, i come here daily (sometimes twice daily, depending on how many hours i've been in the building) and they always take care of my coffee needs.    the employees are super friendly and they make a great cup of coffee. they're always playing good music and they even do coffee art. cute!   they also carry bagels, sandwiches, pastries, naked juices, and bottled water if you're interested in that.  down the hall there's three vending machines that carry soda and snacks if you need a sugar fix.   oh and at 3pm they have happy hour (half off all drinks with espresso)."}
