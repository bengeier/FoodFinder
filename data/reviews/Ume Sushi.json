{"text":"We love eating at Ume.. We moved to the area in the last year, and were missing our old downtown sushi joint, when Ume opened just steps away from our condo - so we decided to give it a shot.  We noticed immediately that the prices were quite reasonable, and that there was a wide menu selection even beyond the sushi, so if you are dining with a sushi newbie, there are plenty of non-threatening options.  We have always had excellent service, and have always been offered a private booth.  We are always offered something complimentary - sometimes it is miso soup and edamame, sometimes it is an extra appetizer.  We have done both dine-in and takeout, and we are always greeted with the same excellent service.    I've also noticed that the restaurant is doing a lot to improve itself since the opening - there has been the gradual addition of decor and nicer menus, and over the summer, a new patio.  It is nice to see that they are not just coasting, but are actually investing in creating a better and better dining experience  A definite thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Lunch bento was extremely small and unsatisfying, and ingredients were not very fresh."}
{"text":"This sushi place is one of the better sushi restaurants I've tried in Toronto. I LOVE the Volcano Roll- it has cheese, avocado and tempura inside and is covered in a spicy sauce. The miso soup is also really good. I like to order the tofu as an appetizer- it is soft and covered in a delicious sauce. I have ordered one of the dinner bento boxes before with sushi, sashimi and tempura but was disappointed that only 1 piece of shrimp tempura was given. The standard at other sushi places is at least 2 pieces of shrimp tempura. Other than that though, the quality of the food in the bento box was pretty good.  For seating, there are several booths off to the side which offer more privacy as well as regular tables. There is also some outdoor seating.   I've been here at very busy times when the restaurant was full and also at times when I was one of the only customers in the restaurant. Service is always polite and friendly, but I feel that Ume Sushi really needs to have two waitresses working at peak times. I've noticed that service at those peak times with only one waitress tends to be quite slow, and it's hard to get her attention. I'd recommend installing buzzer buttons in the booths to make it easier to call the waitress without leaning out and waving.  The washroom in this restaurant is so clean and always smells AMAZING! I also like the Bento Box magazine (a magazine about Japanese restaurants and culture in Toronto) that they have in the newsstand by the door."}
{"text":"It's a decent restaurant! I didn't try their sushi, so can't judge the quality of their fish, but the chicken katsu was pretty good. My friend ordered the kamikaze roll and it was a decent portion :) looked very good"}
{"text":"There was a person handing out coupons ($1 for a dynamite roll) and that was the main reason my friends and I tried ume sushi today.   When we went in, it was very dark, and we found out that the offer for the coupon was only available for take-out.  But nonetheless, we decided to eat lunch here anyway and grab the take-out afterwards for later.  I ordered the sushi lunch which was 8.95 plus tax.  I think the best out of the whole meal was the salad.  The dressing was perfect and the vegetables were fresh.  Then my sushi came and it was around 9 pieces of sushi with 3 maki.  The sushi was very small, the rice was only a little bigger than my thumb.  The fish were fresh, but the portions were surprisingly small.  My friend got the beef terriyaki and she said she ate better beef terriyaki.  Also, other than the sushi, there was no side dish at all, which in other sushi places, at this price, there is usually other fried items or side dish.    Service was fine, pretty good.  Overall, nothing was bad, but nothing was really good.  And for that price, it is definitely not worth it.  I like Sapporo sushi closeby a lot better."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and tried the spicy salmon maki roll. I have to say that I wasn't expecting much and only came here because it was Labour Day and nothing else seemed to be open that I was in the mood for. The spicy salmon was delicious! A burst of flavor with each bite - they were so good that I went for another round.  I also sampled the chicken katsu, which had just the right amount of crispy, drizzled with katsu sauce. The miso soup was decent and the salad wasn't too shabby either. There was only one waitress working today so service was on the slower side but other than that, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ume for years.  They're always consistent and their take out is quick.  Dinner portions are huge and lunch portions are a great value for the price."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10:45 on a Saturday night, and got told they were closed, even though all the signage said until 2 am. Didn't bother inquiring further, as there are lots of other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food with great service. They are very focused on customer satisfaction. The prices are very reasonable. Their Take Sushi meal is a particularly great deal. Although I usually get take out, the few times in which I dined in, I found the staff to be very friendly and attentive. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Very good taste they have over here! It's not that easy finding good sushi restaurants,  but this one is. The price is ok,  but unfortunately the space is a little bit small. Try it. Got green eyes and Salmon roll. Really good."}
{"text":"The worst staff ever... i order beef donbury and mentioned specifically without egg and when it showed up it was mixed with the egg. I asked the staff, and he denying that it was egg, so i firmly probe to him again is this not egg?? Then he checked the kitchen and giving me the excuse why it was wrong order.... instead of saying sorry for the first time.  Just to proud to admit the mistake in my order. Apparently miso soup is extra.  I understand if this is Nami in downtown everything is extra.   Sushi was just okay, \"big OKAY\" with this price you can get better quality like Ichiban.  NOT RECOMMENDED!!   unless you have no other choice. Would I come back?? Big NO.  So sad.!"}
{"text":"Sushi is expensive enough as it is, Ume Sushi just had to go and raise my expectation on this particular dish. I swear, my food addiction is going to keep me single forever.  I arrived at the computer repair shop across the street at exactly the time which the store states it opens, and nobody was there. I was so pissed, I needed something to eat. I was hoping the Ume Sushi would be a slightly frugal means to sushi. It was not. A wonderful and super smiling Korean woman--probably named Grace--greeted and sat me in one of their only three or four booths normally reserved for 4+ patrons, and offered me that foul tasting Korean rice tea. Grace (let's just call her that) looked like she jumped off of the pages of a Korean home-decorating magazine with her warm smile and all. A red sweater, an adorable apron, the woman looked like Lady Christmas.   Each sushi platter averaged around $8-13, and I was beginning to worry for my wallet, knowing my appetite. I think I ordered the Fire Mountain Sushi which had spicy tuna in it, three pieces of sashimi prices at $5, and something else, with a soup, and gyoza.  The food came in the proper order; soup, something, sashimi, gyoza, sushi.  I wasn't expecting much, and therefore...my expectation were blow right out of the water.  I have never seen prettier sushi arrangement in my life. I've had more expensive sushi at where people who wear ties eat sushi, but it could not compare to this. Whether it's traditional to keep things simple or not, Ume Sushi really got my appetite going. It's almost like they've heard of me: 'That guy who can't stop eating'.  The size of each piece of sushi immediately justified the price, and the ingredients used are so evidently fresh. The fire sushi things was generously peppered with two types of roe, one of which was black in colour, the colour of expensive for fish roe! This was my first solid food since having my wisdom teeth removed, and it was painfully delicious!  I pretty much forgotten about everything else I ordered, but the $5 for three pieces of sashimi needs mentioning. It was the thickest cut of any sashimi I've had, and it was very fresh. I would like for Ume to lower the price by $1, so I'd be able to order two orders without feeling like that I'm actually purchasing seafood. I didn't think I'd be able to fill my stomach with what I ordered, but after my meal, I was hardly able to jaywalk across the street in a safe and speedy pace to avoid oncoming traffic. Death by well-fed...that would be undesirable.  My carrot garnish was meticulously carved and folded into the complex shape of a butterfly, and the lotus flower probably made of radish almost had me breaking all etiquette and just eat it like a beef patty. I resisted all urges.  I would have offered my compliments to the chef, if Asian people did that sort of thing.  Lunch cost me $50 including the generous tip I left for the motherly figure woman who probably owns the place (you just know these things).  I have compiled a small pond of saliva writing this review and now will be calling all my friends who live around Yonge & Finch to see if they're available for sushi. I'll call my ex-gf if I have to!"}
{"text":"Just missed the lunch special, which sucked. Came at 4:30pm and was the only ones in there.  Service was horrible even thou place was empty maybe it was there break time for the staff.  Ordered a sushi platter. Quality was on par with other places.  Lots of private booths for you to enjoy your meal and TVs as well.  Place is pretty tiny as well.  No Ice cream here folks =(  Still kinda disappointed on that.  But we got soup and salad with our meal."}
{"text":"Just an average sushi place. However Ume is definitely not below average place. You will get what you came for. If you are looking for nothing too fancy this is a good place to try. Lunch specials has great value."}
{"text":"Came for the Lunch special.   Sushi/ sashimi combo ($12) is okay. The quality isn't the best... maybe slightly better than what you'd get at an AYCE place. I'd rather pay more for better sushi, or alternatively go to AYCE.   The bulgogi lunch, which was decent. Just a typical bulgogi  It was difficult to flag down a waiter during the busy lunch time.   I don't think that I'll return"}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty small and cozy, but I was happy with where they seated my friend and I (at the side 2-seater couch tables with a privacy curtains, it was very comfortable and spacious).  We decided to try the \"Ume 2-Person Dinner Set\" which includes: 2 Miso soup, 2 Seaweed salad, 1 basket of Shrimp, Broccoli, & Yam Tempura, 1 small Sushi & Sashimi boat, 2 bowls of rice with 2 dishes of either Beef, Chicken, or Salmon teriyaki (we ordered the beef & chicken, beef was good but chicken could be better), and finally 2 Green Tea ice cream!  The quality of their food seemed pretty fresh and tasted good.  The waitress had a very bright smile and was super friendly, she made sure our cups were never empty.  Their music playlist was also great.  Overall, I would surely recommend this cute little restaurant to anyone for dinner."}
{"text":"This place has reasonable sushi and Korean food but the quality is not that great for the price. The lunch specials are good value but otherwise I would not recommend. For Korean, Huh Ga Ne next door has more authentic food. For sushi, one of Toronto's best is down the street on Yonge called Hamaru. Not a well known place but it's fantastic."}
{"text":"With so much competition in the area it's hard for me to give this place more than a 3. It was just average for me. I mean the food was good I can't complain. I ordered a dinner bento: came with salad which was okay, California roll a bit dry, salmon teriyaki which was tender and not overcooked, sauce was a bit too sweet, and the tempura was crisp not too much batter or too oily. I tried a piece of those special rolls and it was good too. But I feel like this is just the standard of most Japanese restaurants.   Unfortunately I found the place way too cramp. Service was okay, the server was nice but maybe a bit forgetful. She didn't bring us tea or asked us what we want to drink, didn't bring us utensils, or dishes for soya sauce. However I was curious to try some of the Korean bar snacks they had so maybe I need to come back another time for that!"}
{"text":"I had an overall nice experience at Ume Sushi. You can't actually see this restaurant from the corner of Yonge/Finch, so this greatly reduces foot traffic to this area. I decided on the chicken terriyaki bento for 8.95. Right after I ordered, the waitress came out with a very good miso soup, and complimentary edamame, which was nice.  There are some days when you are not in a good mood.  I just failed my cfa exam, so honestly I don't want to hear anyone else talking.  Of course, even at yonge/finch you have old loud men, who should retire talking about bay street matters.   I guess there's a large pension fund closeby...  In any case, the bento box came shortly after.  Every component of the box was good, 3 california rolls, white meat, cucumber with sesame sauce, rice, and a salad.  The rice had to be the smallest portion I had ever seen.  I wish it had come with more. The salad was the stand-out, with a very nice dressing.  Everything was nice about this restaurant, but there's just something missing with the restaurant itself and with the food.  It's good quality, but just isn't inspired.  Koreans making Japanese food, whoopee!  I have to say though, less than 1.5 hours after lunch I am really hungry.  Some extra rice would have been nice."}
{"text":"I go here when I am craving Sushi that is cheap, quick, and decent.  The lunch specials are well priced and if you pay with cash when ordering take out you pay 0 tax ---- er I mean you get 13% off.  When it comes to sushi the saying \"you get what you pay for\" usually holds true.  You are paying less than $20 for most sushi combos and dishes so please do not expect 5 star taste.  Lower your expectations with the price you are willing to pay and you will be satisfied.  Ume Sushi is great to satisfy your cravings for Sushi and for anyone trying Sushi for the first time as it is an acquired taste....you wont feel so bad if you do not end up liking Sushi because you spent almost nothing.  Cheap prices. Quick Sushi. Subpar service."}
{"text":"Ume sushi was pretty average IMO, for the price and value, the food was okay but portions on the small side. Fish was fairly fresh but each piece was small. service was so-so, not over the top friendly. Its an okay place if you're craving sushi but not really a place for good sushi."}
{"text":"I have been walking on Yonge street in North York for quite a while and this is the first time I ever decided to take a turn to Finch west.  Sashimi is simply amazing here. They were nicely served on a plate with some sort of decorative mountain (picture below). It was colorful, fresh, and tasty. Maki rolls were alright.  Staff is friendly. Complimentary meso soup and tea. Free WiFi.  I suggest that you stick to sashimi and if you want maki rolls then go to a cheap AYCE that does not serve sashimi."}
{"text":"Worst food,  we order sushi all we got rice and avocado no fish( volcano sushi) . Bento,we order beef teriyaki worst bento i ever had beef was smelly. Waiters kept us waiting for our bill for 15 minutes ."}
{"text":"Ume sushi is conveniently located at yonge and finch. Whether you drop by to dine in or order for takeout, you will not be disappointed.   Decent menu Decent prices Tax included when you order takeout with cash Patio for a small party available in the summer Bento boxes or a la carte sushi  Efficient and good service Alcohol available  Cute booths for small parties SEA URCHIN sashimi or sushi    If you live close by its definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"I want to give them a 2.5 stars, because two seems a little too harsh, but 3 seems a bit highly.   Wasn't impressed with the food.  The Kalbi rib was not tender, didn't look of good quality.  I usually love short ribs, but definitely not from this place.  Sushi and sides were ok, nothing spectacular.  Price isn't exactly cheap either."}
{"text":"Great Sushi and Service.   You know when you walk into a place and you just get a good calm energy and vibe without knowing why. That's how I feel about this place every time I walk in to grab take out. Ume Sushi is a quaint Jap/Korean restaurant near Yonge and Finch. From the outside it doesn't really stand out among  the row of shops and restaurants beside it but if you get a chance do stop in. The interior is dimly lit and cozy there is a few booths on the right for diners who prefer a little privacy. Their menu is not very big or elaborate just a good amount of selection. Tried their lunch specials which is pretty good but hands down their Spyder Roll is the best I have had in a very long time. This is just your awesome everyday lunch or take out joint and from my experience it has been consistently yummy. I'm sure I will be back soon cause there's just too many nights I'm just too lazy to make dinner."}
{"text":"It a cozy place with friendly staff and also they are serving good and fresh sushi.if you don't mind smal places it is recommended ;)"}
{"text":"I suspect, being so close to my office, I will be here a lot now. :)  This week I tried their Sushi & Tempura Bento Box for $10.95. I received 5 pieces of salmon sushi (it was my request for all salmon, I think it typically comes with assorted fish), shrimp and vegetable tempura and 3 California rolls. I'm happy to say, another hit! The tempura was light and crispy and everything was delicious!  I think the thing that impresses me most about this place is their attention to detail. I have a friend who is a... well, let's just call her a \"finicky eater\"; she practically provides a list of do's and don'ts when ordered. I don't think these guys have ever missed the mark with any of her numerous demands.... um, I mean \"requests\". The speed and accuracy of their service here is second to none! I think they warrant being on my Friday Favs list now!"}
{"text":"Went to Ume last night to get take-out after wandering into about 4-5 sushi restaurants just to realize they don't take credit cards...Ume does.  The girl was super nice, quickly took my order. I got the Philly roll, shrimp tempura (came with 5 pieces), dynamite roll, spicy salmon and Kamikaze Roll. I asked for avocado in my philly roll and she didn't charge me extra - thanks!  The whole order came to $41 with tax. Yeah, this is why I don't do non-AYCE sushi places.   The rolls were great, the spicy salmon wasn't that spicy though. The Kamikaze Roll was the best - it had tuna and salmon and avocado and cucumber, I don't know how they managed to roll this monster up! It comes with 8 pcs and it's 7.95 on its own.  The shrimp tempura was good, not too much breading but I found that the tempura wasn't fluffy enough, it kind of hurt my gums when I bit into it...delicious regardless!  The restaurant itself is very small and cozy, they have a couple booths and a bunch of tables. In the summer, they have a nice little patio. There's Japanese rap/rock/pop Lady Gaga looking people on TV, interesting? I thought it was porn at first. I waited for my order for about 5-10min.   The price is fine for what you get, it was expensive because i'm a tank but I think a normal person would pay $15-20 and be satisfied!   I'll come back here again if I can't get someone to haul my ass to an AYCE place, just because it's expensive."}
{"text":"After looking up several Japanese restaurants around Yonge and Dundas, I decided instead to go scout out one that was closer my home. My quest for some satisfactory Japanese take-out lead me to Ume Sushi which somewhat hidden if you come out of Finch Station and walk to your right along finch ave towards the condos. Korean operated but looking very distinctly Japanese, even though I was ordering to take home I felt relaxed in it's small and cozy Japanese tavern (Izakaya??) style interior with fusuma-motif booths on one side. The staff at the counter warmly greeted any guest who stepped in and also thanked them after settling their bill. I decided to make it simple by just ordering the Rainbow Roll and the Chicken Yaki Udon.  What would like though is that for a Korean operated establishment I wish that a few select Korean dishes apart from the Bulgogi and Bibimbap were included on the menu. This would allow customers who want a quick pick me up to get the best of both Korean and Japanese dishes without having to go to a korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Great sushi quality and I highly respect the chef's professionalism! He knows how to handle and make authentic sushi and sashimi. Because a lot of sushi place just gives you unprofessional rice in sushi but he knows how to \"cook\" sushi rice authentically. Also the fish quality is very good, very fresh and great portion with reasonable price! I highly recommend ume sushi!"}
{"text":"I livee close by this place and it's always been consistently good, the calamari is always crispy and the rolls are always very good. It's a good local place!"}
{"text":"Very small and dark with patio seating available  edamame beans and miso soup while you wait for the main course $35 for a 35 piece sushi/sashimi boat The boat itself had great presentation and the sushi rolls were so huge that I could barely fit it into my mouth. Everything tasted good but I thought the raw fish could have been more chilled as I found it to be a bit on the warm side. Overall a good meal  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Best sushi in young & finch area. I love the Philadelphia roll and the rainbow roll there. They have awesome sushi and sashimi too"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Now that I'm in Seneca College for 8 months, I'm most likely going to be in the Yonge/Finch area for food quite often. Checking off the list of places I haven't been to yet, I decided to try this place for lunch.  First reaction to this place is that the A/C was either not enough or was simply not on, because it felt rather uncomfortably warm inside (especially today considering it was hot and humid). At least I got a seat and didn't have to wait?  It took a bit for me to be served a tea and menu, but eventually I was. The place was full for 11:45am and there were only two servers, so I'll excuse them. I eventually ordered the sushi and sashimi lunch (L16), which came with a soup and salad.  The soup and salad tasted quite decent, not too bland and not too salty for the soup and a fairly delicious dressing for the salad. My order came in almost immediately after, and my initial reaction was the little flower decoration to my top left of the plate. Quite cute!  Fish variety was definitely lacking compared to other sushi restaurants, but considering it was simply a lunch special I didn't take it too personally. However, the pieces were quite lukewarm. I generally like my sushi/sashimi/roll to be somewhat cool, but these were definitely on the warm side. The salmon and butterfish were definitely fresh, while the tuna was not as fresh. The california roll didn't come with tobiko, which kinda disappointed me as that's the best part in my opinion.  Total amounted to $13.50 and I paid $15 total, which I think is reasonable for this place. It's overall nothing special, but not bad either; a passable place that I would stop by if I'm craving sushi at Yonge/Finch."}
{"text":"I had salmon teriyaki. It was $13.99+HST. It came with three generous portions of salmon along with miso soup, salad, and rice. Was quite delicious."}
{"text":"We got the small Sushi boat for $25, and it contained delicious, fresh, well made, and well-priced sushi. It also came with miso soup & salad, as well as beautifully cooked edamame. The wasabi and soy sauce were perfect. Loved the quality and the variety of the fish. Sushi, Tuna, Squid, Eel..  It's a small sushi restaurant, and the service is personal and homey. Fantastic ambiance."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.. private and quite and perfect for a night out. Service is fantastic and the food outstanding.  You have to try it.. we do once a month for sure"}
{"text":"Still four star worthy.  Went there yesterday (Saturday) for lunch.  Low noise level (which we love).  Not sure what its like during the work week with the lunch crowd as have never been during the week.  Quality of the fish is fresh, cut fairly thickly, good temperature (not overly freeze your mouth off which is a good thing), good quality rice and soya sauce.  Edamame were VERY fresh, delicately salted and melt in your mouth.  We ordered kimchi (of course, this is a MUST with hwae dup bap) and it was divine!!!  Seriously divine (but you have to pay for it - fairly pisayo at $2.95).  The owner's cho-gochuchang which she makes for the hwae dup bap is one of the best I have ever had.  Vegetables were spotlessly cleaned and spouse enjoyed his well-presented sashimi dinner board.  The sashimi is cut more in the Korean style which we always enjoy - generous proportions of fish. The owner is a very classy and personable woman, good wait staff and an overall positive dining experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars but close to a 4!  Went here late on a weeknight (approx 9:30pm) & they were still busy but had several tables available. The space was definitely a bit tight especially close to the cash.   Service was decent & fast. We always got what we asked for asap, though it would be nice if they gave us some tea or utensils before we got the food.   Loved some of the rolls here. The dynamite was about average (8 pcs), unagi roll (6 pcs) was nice and sweet but it is most likely their speciality rolls that will get the high rating cuz the volcano roll was absolutely amazing.... This may be my new sushi takeout place... But if only there was free parking! Great for those who can just walk over though.   Ume sushi also offered some korean snacks/dishes.   Would love to be back to try more rolls"}
{"text":"It's  a cute little place on yonge and finch. On the night we went, they forgot to flip the sign to say open... we loitered and peeked for a while and decided to go in when we saw eyes peeking out at us. It was near empty, and obviously we promptly informed the owners... so still uncertain, is it usually empty, or were customers deterred by the dark entrance and the \"closed\" sign?  The dishes we ordered were very well done. I was never so impressed with a simple spicy scallop roll. There were so many layers of flavor and it seemed like care was put into making it even though it was a small order. The tempura were very nicely fried as well and went down so wonderfully with the beer.  Will have to come again and try more substantial dishes... excited just by the thought of returning."}
{"text":"Ordered a sashimi lunch with some vegetarian maki one day. Their sushi is decent. but it didn't wow me. It's very close to work though, so if the weather isn't that great I can pop across the street if I want some sushi.  The place is very small & doesn't have much seating. So if you want to eat lunch here best to either go early or just get take out."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is conveniently located at the Yonge and Finch intersection.  This place doesn't have the AYCE sushi option, is very tiny and they play 90's teen pop music, but still deserves 4 stars for the fresh sashimi and Maki rolls. You will probably going to spend less if you go to an AYCE, but you will very likely get a lower quality food than places without that option. The restaurant is clean. The servers are well mannered and quite friendly. I tried the spicy Maki combo and since I was still hungry I ordered an assorted sashimi and shared it with a friend. We left as happy customers and I think we got our money's worth. They also have free wifi! I recommend a sushi boat if you come with a big group. The only problem is the super tight and tiny booths. The seats are wooden and not too comfy."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials at Ume Sushi till 4 pm everyday!!!! I am IN!  Conveniently located right by Finch Subway Station..if you are driving there is a municipality parking lot a few step away.  Great selections of special lunch items from $8.95 with Korean and Japanese items and with 24 to choice one, I think you will find something you enjoy!  Service was a little slow in the beginning since I was seated in one of the private booth and I think they forgot that I was here!!  Sushi Lunch ($8.95) with Salad, Soup and Edamame all tastes good. Great plating and good value!! The only complaint is they all served to me the same time!!  The sushi might not be the best I had, but at this price point.. it is good value.  I definitely will be back again for lunch soon.... I still have 23 other items to try out!!"}
{"text":"I typically go to Sapporo Sushi since it is only a block from my apartment, but after seeing reviews for Ume Sushi thought I'd check it out to compare the two. Now while the décor at Ume Sushi doesn't quite compare with Sapporo Sushi which is nicer inside, I'd have to give the edge on the dishes to Ume overall.   Salads at both places are very good but different. I love this as it gives an incentive to change back and forth. The miso soup tastes quite different at both with Ume's having a slight fishy taste (or so I thought). Now for the actual sushi. We ordered a Maxi combo (California, Salmon & Dynamite Rolls) as well as the Red Dragon Rolls - we weren't in the mood for sashimi although I normally do eat sashimi as well. The fish was noticeably larger than at Sapporo and the rolls were more carefully rolled and slightly larger than Sapporo Sushi. I didn't care for the sauce they put on the sushi though or on the place. The wasabi was of a higher quality.   The only negative was they obviously put some lime overtop of the sushi rolls and that made my tongue swell or it was the other sauce... but overall very good quality. Will go back to try the sashimi at some point.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were there last Sunday at about 4:00pm. The restaurant is small but clean and very pleasant. The decor is black and burgundy and they have a strong Japanese theme, including a few private booths. They even sell saki sets and teapots. Everything was good from the service to the meal portions. They also serve tea in ceramic cups, not plastic. There is a teensy patio with about 4 small tables out front, facing Finch Ave. that looks like it would be very enjoyable in nice weather. They currently feature oysters for $1.99/each. We parked for free on Eldora Ave, you can find paid parking spot along Duplex Ave also. I would recommend this restaurant for whenever you're in the Yonge Finch neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  Tiny place but nice fresh sushi!  Combo came with edamame, soup and salad. Does not include ice cream.  Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I have mostly had take-out from this place. The takeout experience has been a good value with decent prices and the service experience is good.  The quality was good and not the best.  My in-restaurant dining experience was good.  I typically have sashimi and the fish was fresh and a good variety for our 55 piece boat.    Freshness - 8/10 Variety - 9/10  For sashimi eaters it's a good price and quality is good.  It's close to home and pretty good for the area."}
{"text":"Very fresh food! We eat there often and we absolutely love it! All chef's rolls are great! Hamachi grilled tuna appetizer and beef terriyaki are recommended!"}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant almost every single Friday for lunch.   I order L16 sushi and sashimi dish and get a side of spicy tuna rolls.   Comes with delicious salad, soup.   The place is small, and gets packed at lunch.  Contrary to what is posted here, they do not actually take reservations, as I just called and attempted to make one.  Fair enough.   Overall... good experience.  We keep going back."}
