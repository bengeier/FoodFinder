{"text":"Great tea selection in a coffeehouse that's unique 'cause it's in a converted gas station."}
{"text":"ordered a Thai tea with soy milk. it was transcendent. this may have had a lot to do with my San Diego soul positively withering in the August heat & needing a cold beverage in a serious way. either way, well crafted, topped with a mint sprig. gay-friendly, felt welcome there with my girl."}
{"text":"worst coffe place ever hethe owner treats employees like hell does not comply to government standards he is a looser Bill since he lost Circle H bbq he still has not given me a w2 and ir affects my new business in Michigan however Bill does not care so he is getting audited  by the federal goverment"}
{"text":"Oh yes! Copper Star is a definite favorite. They have an awesome vibe of it's own the moment you walk in. By far the best BLT's in town and their salads are wonderful. Typically I order an iced Harney and Sons Tea, chai tea (iced) or basil lemonade. Once in a while, my husband and I walk over in the mornings and order a delicious morning bagel with iced coffee.  Overall my satisfaction is guaranteed at this place. There have been a couple of times where my chai tea has been too milky but the baristas are friendly and always willing to help in any way. Beware of their baked goodies! I've accidentally ate the entire monstrous thing unintentionally! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say? I think I am in love with this place. The homemade-in-house Chai was yummy to my tummy and the big piece of moist and pretty chocolate cake actually made me scrape my plate! It is really cute and funky inside and they have a nice outdoor seating area.

Go here now!!"}
{"text":"Billy Sandweg has the best cupcakes ever!!!! They are huge, and yummy. You won't be disappointed, they beat Sprinkles cupcakes any day."}
{"text":"I love this place! I try to make it in frequently instead of going to Starbucks. The staff is so nice, the music rocks, the food is great, and the coffee is always just right. Great place!"}
{"text":"Worst iced tea I've ever had.  It may as well be water for all the flavor it has.  One star for the cool building."}
{"text":"Love the feel of copperstar! So comfortable here and the staff is amazing!!! Lavender mocha for life!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix and wanted/needed morning coffee.  Of course turned to Yelp for suggestions.  Copper Star is within cruiser bike distance from where we were and had consistently good reviews.  Admittedly I am somewhat picky about my coffee and I just order coffee.  Found Copper Star to have very good coffee.  Good selection of tasty muffins too.  Very friendly staff.  Enjoyed the coffee so much I had to go again before departing.  Always love when local coffee places do well.  Beats the big chains by far.  Will definitely be back on the next trip."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm in Phoenix for just a few months and this has become my go-to coffee shop. I love the quirky and vintage feel, and the food and drinks are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there the other night (Friday), went inside, waited about 5 minutes, the girl working behind the counter (brunette with glasses) finally came inside from smoking, did not wash her hands, took my order, seemed very annoyed, handled cash then proceeded to make my drink.  The coffee was good, I would have to say that it was the machine that makes it.  

I would never ever come back here at night.  I hear the morning crew and service is awesome.   Something that is lacking at night.

If you want to go to a place where the worker hangs out more with her friends outside, smokes then makes your drinks,  asks if you want to add a tip, and then is rude in the end..then come here on a Friday night...Lux is getting my business.  

My advice: Get rid of the girl on Friday night, maybe then you would get some more business instead of her friends  hanging around."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good music, interesting staff to have convos with, the owner is so friendly & helpful. 
Favorite coffee : mocha with coconut syrup or their regular coffee. 
Their food is also delish, I eat the curry chicken pita, egg and cheese bagel, BLT & hummus pita pretty often. But the best part is the handmade, fresh & creative pastries, there is always something new to try. The chocolate chip cookies & German chocolate cupcakes are the bestttt. Best coffee shop in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went back to Copper Star today. I ordered a vegan apple cinnamon muffin, which was much better than the pastry I had last time. The cinnamon was oozing out of it and I never would have guessed it was vegan! 

The staff was also super friendly today, and they helped me choose an iced green tea (which came in a 7/11 Slurpee size cup...dang!). It took me an hour to sip the whole thing down but there's no rush here! It seems like a good place to hang out!"}
{"text":"The large window makes the space warm and inviting. The food I got (hummus plate) was decent. I came over for a short stop in between meetings thinking I could get a bit of work done, but ended up leaving as soon as I finished my food because it was so cold inside I couldn't concentrate."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place, love the atmosphere, coffee and bakery!!!! However last time I was there the garage door was open and it was a beautiful winter day.  I enjoyed everything but the second hand smoke coming in the building by the people at the table outside...even one of the workers!!!  I know its a pain in the a#% being a smoker these days, but as a non-smoker I expect a business to have rules about smokers when its an open building."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great vibe, their vegan muffins rock and they put the time/effort into their coffee drinks. To the Starbucks drinkers out there--support local businesses like this. So much better. Unique expresso flavor here, bomb."}
{"text":"I love this place- It's not pretentious what-so-ever, the Ice Tea is good and has free re-fills, the Coffee is nice, the people that work there are cool/ friendly/ cute... and the bathroom sink is really cool also, if that helps anyone... You actually don't mind washing your hands, what a concept. The pastries are really good, but I wish they had more of a selection of Apple filled croissants in the afternoon, although the cupcakes look good, but as Frank Zappa said- \"Some people prefer cupcakes. I, for one, care less for them.\" 

Yeah, it's also a converted gas station, but aesthetics aside, this place is a great chill out spot for my Sunday ritual of actually relaxing from the work week. Check out the community board as well, it's nice to see what's going on around the Melrose/ Coronado/ Downtown community.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"First time in and this place is awesome. The lovely lady behind the counter bought me and my boyfriend a coconut macaroon, which was very tasty. Drinks came out quick and both were delish. They use great coffee/espresso and the barista knew what she was doing. Bottom line great drinks, treats, and service :-)"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Copper Star for the past 3 years.  I love the uniqueness of this place - the drive thru with cheerful baristas (os) and  the owner (Bill)  is actively involved in the community and knows his fellow business owners.  Nicest guy you could ever meet. 
Ok.   Now let's get down to business. Coffee-
Everyone has a different taste in coffee. I love this coffee so much that I buy their beans by the pound.  It usually is a mix of Ethiopian, Guatemalen and Sumatran or other roast.  Anyway - I can't say that I have been to  a whole lot of different coffee bars in Phoenix,  but the ones I have been to don't  measure up in flavor, freshness and robust flavor of the beans. Nor can anyone  match  the friendliness and unpretentiousness of the staff. 

 I have only tried the scones and muffins.   Scones are a difficult feat in most places but Copper Star has some of the tastiest.  Try the chocolate chip or cranberry walnut scone.   During the fall they make homemade pumpkin muffins  (using fresh pumpkin) that are to die for.  They run out so fast you have to get there early.  I wish they would offer these year round.Yum!    Because of the coffee, service , and the limited # of goodies I have tried so far, plus their community involvement,  I am giving this place 5 stars.
The patio is very small  with a nice fountain and you can bring your dog - After your coffee take Fido across the street for a bath at Wag-N-Wash (but that is a different review).  So, if you happen to be in the neighborhood stop by and check out Copper Star.  You'll be glad you did. 
(Say Hi to \"Mr Bill \" for me!)"}
{"text":"love this place. The outside is so inviting you want to run right in! Great coffee and de-lish treats!! The staff is so friendly and it is a great neighborhood hang out!! yay for small coffee shops"}
{"text":"This neighbourhood coffee shop has everything one could possibly desire.  Fresh coffee? check.  Delicious baked goods the size of a toddler's head?  check.  Friendly staff who make recommendations based on previous orders?  check
This is the place my children prefer when we are getting a treat- they love the rice crispie treats and brownies.  
If you haven't been here yet, you need to stop in and see for yourself what a great little gem is hiding out in Melrose!"}
{"text":"First time here and got a free pastry heck yah! All the employees were so awesome!! thank ya guys great coffee :))"}
{"text":"Losing a star for something I saw today: customer returns an espresso drink, complaining that it's missing the toffee syrup she requested. Barista adds a few pumps of syrup and then stirs the customer's drink--a drink the customer's already tasted--with the spoon she is using to prepare fresh drinks, then puts the spoon back in a pitcher with the others used to prepare fresh drinks. Am I too fastidious in demanding basic hygienic standards in restaurants? I mean, this isn't someone's home kitchen. When I worked in food service something like that would be a reaming from the manager, at the very least. Jeez. Hopefully this kind of thing isn't universal among the employees here. Nevertheless, it's probably back to the drawing board for me on coffee shops."}
{"text":"What a cute place!  I got a mocha raspberry latte and my friend got an iced coffee.  The salted blueberry muffin was pretty good.  Prices are reasonable.  This place is great to relax and work or to catch up with a friend.  Great outdoor patio for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I went here with my dad today to try something new. I ordered a lavender mocha and strawberry chocolate chip muffin. The muffin was delicious! It was rather large and well priced, definitely a two person muffin. Unfortunately, I didn't really care for the mocha. It just didn't taste very smooth; I had it iced, perhaps it's better hot? I asked to have a replacement drink, which the barista was glad to do. I ordered an iced coffee with cream, and because of the price difference, I was given a chocolate chip cookie. Again, unfortunately, the coffee was pretty weak, and there wasn't enough ice to make it a cold drink, so it was a watery, lukewarm cup. Which was strange since I'm pretty sure the coffee came from a pitcher from the fridge. So, three stars for the terrific muffin, but I probably won't be going back for more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the staff was even better! I love the cute neighborhood area it's in because it makes it feel way more laid back than other chain store coffee shops. I'd recommend the zucchini bread, it was to die for."}
{"text":"More style than substance.  The garage motif is done in such an adorable way that makes this a great space to hang out.  But coffee is just okay."}
{"text":"I love this little spot. 
Decent local coffee spot. The raisin bran muffin is to die for. USUALLY pretty friendly, knowledgeable staff. Though I think I've walked in a couple times to an upset irritable manager? It happens. I get it. I too, work in the industry. I live on 7th ave and the ambience is just beautiful for the area... Keeps me coming back again and again and again."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and the only thing I was impressed about what that the establishment is located in an old gas station. 

The people working here are not too personable when talking with customers. I understand they might get tired of doing that for 5 hours, but if their friends come in leaning and hanging out on the counter while talking to the employees for half hour or more. Then it's time to get re-train some of these workers to be more customer oriented because they're losing focus. They're talking loud on the phone while on shift - pretty much everyone in the place could hear her business.

The coffee was \"ok\" nothing too special - I like that bitter/sweet taste in my drink, but that wasn't present. 

The custom art on the walls are neat and makes the atmosphere of the place more welcoming, but there's a disconnect between that and the worker's attitude. I wouldn't mind coming back to this place and giving them another try... I'll re-review until then."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the peach tea!!! Quant lil local place to eat, drink, and be merry!! Thanks Copperstar for the good vibes......"}
{"text":"LOVE. I went for my first time on a saturday around lunch. There was a steady amount of people, but not so much that I couldn't concentrate to study. Super friendly staff! The owner was there working, was incredibly friendly and was sen conversing with customers. Great customer service! I had an Iced Lavender Mocha and curry chicken pita! Great food! Even better Customer service! Officially one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"OK, so keep in mind, this is a good community coffee place, and I come here a lot because it's close and they have free refills on plain coffee and at long last, reliable internet. I wouldn't want a starbucks here instead, but still there are some constant stupid complaints I have about the place. 

Today I sat trying to read something as their phone (an annoying cubicle sounding telephone) rang and rang for about 5 minutes straight. It's a small place, so this was loud and really annoying. Then there is their music. It's not great. They just have employees (nice people) playing streaming music on their phones. Music ranges from tolerable to bad, but it's never ever ever interesting music. And then, when the employee gets a call on that phone, it amplifies their ring tone over the speakers, until the employee picks up their phone and cuts out the music while they chat to their friends.  And cleanliness. their mens room is disgusting. I have a 2 year old and he always has to pee. I'd rather my son pee on a truck stop toilet. They also have a real fly problem. 

It's a cute place, the kind of community coffee shop that puts up really bad local artists work (a good thing to do). But this place with just a little effort could be so much nicer."}
{"text":"We loved this place! My husband and I stopped here this weekend for a quick coffee and bite. The lattes were delicious. I got the lavender mocha latte and YUM!! Not too sweet which i loved and a bagel sandwich which was so good my husband stole half of it. The staff was very friendly and quick. The environment was very relaxed and cool. We will 100% be going back again."}
{"text":"The best blended chai tea I've EVER had! I stumbled upon this place and am so thankful I found it! The food is delicious too, you just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Best Mocha's hands down! 

My wife and I have been card carrying members for awhile now. We will always pick up a cup when taking our dogs to Wag N Wash. Friendly staff and comfortable little patio. Support local biz and give Copper Star a shot."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Free Wi-Fi. They have a nice patio area, a drive through and a nice layout inside. I will be back to work here again tomorrow."}
{"text":"Been in town for a few months now, when I go to have coffee with someone this is the place I pick. Nice and comfortable....coffee shops today don't give enough comfort, there are some nice big sofas to sit on. :) 

place is decorated with \"good\" local art, unique setting and love the style of the place."}
{"text":"Love this place and Sunday they have a really good live blues duo between 11 and 1 pm"}
{"text":"Local local local.....all treats are made from scratch :) around the holidays you can buy homemade pumpkin pie made from scratch. Great patio for beautiful Phoenix days and awesome place for your dog to hang out with you."}
{"text":"Great location, super cool conversion of an old gas station. My only gripe would be that barista didnt rinse portafilter before pulling my espresso shots , thus my cappuccino tasted burnt. This is however a common problem at most indy coffee places."}
{"text":"Needed to get out of the West Valley last Saturday and decided to put on the pretense of being productive at Copper Star. It was very quiet and laid back. I sat on the purple couch for 4 hours and savored every drop of my latte. AND double bonus for being within walking distance of the Fry Bread House. Perfect lazy Sat afternoon!"}
{"text":"I. love. Copper. Star! 

Why?

Cool location (converted filling station with working drive thru...how cool is that?)
Unpretentious (cute!) staff 
Cool owners (they so \"get it\")
Fab coffee (never bitter, extra foamy when I ask!)
Yummy cupcakes (never dry and lots o' yummy frosting!)
Groovy music
Great customers

Just wish I lived closer....I'd be here all the time :).

I dare say this is my favorite coffee place...in Phx...ever :)"}
{"text":"Good coffee and usually a quite work environment. Friendly employees. 
I'm not so into the style of the place and probably wouldn't take anyone here that I was trying to impress but its still better than most. Better than the bucks for sure."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop. Excellent spot overall to post up and do some work or meet someone for  conversation. I told the barista that it was my first time and she said 1st time customers receive a complimentary pastry. IMO the only negative is they don't have cold-brew or toddy coffee but that's not worth knocking off a star. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. I noticed it while driving down 7th Ave. the other day and it looked so quaint I decided to return for a drink. I recommend the black tea they have. It's delicious and pretty generous for $2. The atmosphere is relaxed with what sounds like the silversun pickup station playing in the background. The staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Their scones are divine and it is a nice little place with fine coffee.  I only wish they would not let dogs in.  I am allergic to them and it rather spoils my meal.  If they had a sign on the door -- no dogs, except service dogs it would be fine.  The ones brought in are not service ones.  Their scones are delicious and made daily.  Go there!"}
{"text":"Love this place to work on my laptop, great drink selection, nice menu and very affordable, nice staff too! I love it when they have live music!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee shop. So many teas to choose from. Great people. Lots of delicious looking baked goods, I'll have to try them next time, mmm... The menu also looks great. It's nice and quiet for working. And there's an outdoor seating area. Dig it! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Thank you Copper Star for the decaf iced tea! Not many places have decaf iced tea and you have several flavor options! Service is great, everyone is friendly and the prices are good too! One small thing, could you offer some GF, VG or V options on your menu? I would love to have my breakfast here as well."}
{"text":"Copper star is the best! Friendly staff, yummy treats and their jalapeño cheddar bagel is amazing! The lavender mocha ice coffee is really good too."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood coffee shop. We go here nearly daily. Good cup of coffee and everyone's friendly. Love the brown sugar and mixed nut scone: just make sure you have several people or 3 days to eat it cause they're HUGE!

Like the changing local artist work they display."}
{"text":"This is a great little local coffee joint! I love the way they have the drive-thru set up and how they incorporated the old gas station vibe in their décor! The first time I went they gave me a free pastry to try, which is a really nice touch. The coffee was great and the staff was very friendly! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a neighborhood local, and regretfully cave in to going to Copper Star to get coffee when Im too lazy to make it myself.  

Product: EVERYTIME i order their drip coffee, I immediately regret it.  Burnt, gritty, and occasionally tastes like it was reheated leftovers from the day before.  \"Iced Coffee\" at Copper Star consists of ACTUAL leftover coffee...  instead of tossing the leftover coffee when it's time to make a fresh pot, the coffee is put into metal containers and submerged in cold water and put in the refrigerator, then served  to customers the next day.  If you have in-house pastry people and a staff who has a clue what they're doing (too much to ask...?) i would expect fresh strong-brew that is immediately chilled, or for the progressive local spot, a proper overnight cold-brew.  No organic or fair trade coffee is advertised or offered, and no one has ever been able to tell me where it comes from.  
I give this review 2 stars because they have great bagels.  From somewhere else.  How do you screw up bagels? They don't.  Thank you for putting my butter or cream cheese on yourself while my bagel is still warm.  This is what keeps me coming back...lol  However, they are regularly out of bagels by 9am.  Perhaps ordering more would solve this problem?  Or would that just be common sense?
As I sit here today eating my bagel replacement (a Banana Nut Muffin), I was compelled to write this review when I discovered half of the browned banana in the bottom of my muffin.  The last one i had about a month ago had a small piece, so it didn't phase me.  I considered if the muffin was meant to have half a banana in the bottom, but then I'd never had one like that, and i certainly take the extra effort when making my own banana bread to carefully smash the banana before i add it to my batter BEFORE baking!

Staff:  If someone frequents a place at least once a week, they would expect some level of recognition, particularly if they are unique looking or have enigmatic personality.  I consider myself VERY unique looking.  The same staff looks at me like I have a second head growing outta my shoulders, or they seem dazed and robotic, with a Stepford Wife unprompted expectation of an order to be rattled off without greeting.  My mate used to work there, and no one seems to every recognize them, either.  I think it's weird.  
Speaking of weird, let's chat about Bill.  There is another blocked review referring him: \"The owner (who I have met about 8 times now-- his name is 'Bill') is completely used-car sleazy and gives me the closeted creeper horrors. I sat at the bar for about a month working on my computer-- listening to how he talks to his mainly young-lady employees. His tone and the things he says range from offensive to condescending and inappropriate. Funny thing about having a completely open workspace-- the customers can hear everything you say...\"
I have the same experience with him and have been appalled at the blatant sex-oriented comments said in full company of customers...  I wonder what Bill's wife thinks of his ladies at the the coffee shop.  

Customer service starts with a smile, and listening skills.  If you would be busy LISTENING to what i want, instead of busy cutting me off with \"is that all...?\" you might actually get my order right, thus getting me out of your line and out of your life in the fasted way possible, which is clearly the intention of the bitchy girls who work there.  

In short~
Local businesses fail because they don't appreciate the people supporting them.  
Bill's favorites get away with murder and treat everyone like lesser folk.  
Not every idea is a good one, especially ones regarding serving old coffee.
Mash the bananas before adding them to the batter, and order some more friggin' bagels.  

why do i continue to come here...?  I'm going to The Refuge next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for my morning latte.  It has a hip interior to hang out and some patio seating as well.  But usually, I go through the drive thru.  Yup, this independent coffee shop has a drive thru. The staff are always friendly as they walk up to your car and take your order.  When I \"forget\" to eat breakfast at home, I order a breakfast sandwich here-  your choice of bagel, ham, egg and cheese.  They also have an assortment of baked goods.  The coffee is way better than any chain, especially ones with weird mermaid logos, and in my top tier of independent coffee spots in Phoenix as well."}
{"text":"Lovely place I suggest you go check it out if your nearby and want a coffee"}
{"text":"I found out about this place after we lost our progressive talk radio station in Sacramento.  I started streaming Nova-M Radio from the Phoenix station on iTunes and heard an advertisement for Copper Star a number of times.  When it became clear that I would be moving to the Valley I made it a point to come by this place.  I was SO not disapointed.  They have pretty good mochas and if you hit them at the right time they will have whipped cream infused with some flavoring....nice touch.  I can't say anything about their wi-fi since I don't have a laptop but just for the atmosphere and their support of good radio I have to max out on the star count.

*********************

Addendum 3/4/09

Nova-M is dead but Copper Star lives on and rocks just as hard as they always did!!!"}
{"text":"coffee's good, atmosphere's great: very funky/urban, desserts are to die for (it's their best feature). I just wish they had a more expanded lunch menu. Just wanted a nice salad and some protein after the gym and settled for their signature curried chicken. It was very little salad, very little chicken rolled up in a LOT of bread, which I don't eat. 10 bucks for that and a cup of coffee and I left starving.......oh well, it's great for coffee and dessert! Bill  if you read this PLEASE give us more options."}
{"text":"I feel like such an asshole for never having been here before this week. A friend recommended it to me saying, \"it's kind of like Lux, but gayer and nicer\". Sounds good to me!

This place is so cute! There are few tables outside and even a little fire place. Inside feels spacious even though it's not a large place. The coffee is fine, nothing phenomenal but tasty enough. Everyone was friendly. 

Two things that made me fall in love:
$2 enormous iced teas
FREE SOY MILK. Well, maybe not free...but I've never met a coffee shop that didn't charge half a dollar extra for soy. THIS IS AMAZING. I was so pleased when I ordered two medium sized iced white mochas with soy and my total was only $8 and some change. 

I wish I had come here sooner. I could have logged all those college study hours here rather then all those other lame soy charging snobby barista'd $5 for a microscopic small cup coffee shops. Ya know?

I can't wait to try the hummus plate and their veggie sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great smoothie with a great atmosphere!  Our waitress, Clarissa, was absolutely money in the bank! Cool cool place!  I will definitely make my way back there when I'm wandering about 7th Ave."}
{"text":"Copper Star, I love you.

After buying our house in July 2015, we needed to find a new coffee shop. I order an iced americano probably 5-6 days a week and prefer to support the local coffee shops rather than the chains. I found Copper Star and I'm so happy I did!!

Copper Star is my Daily Happy Morning Routine place. I use the drive thru, the staff has my order memorized, and I'm always greeted with a friendly \"hello!\" and a quick chat about my day/car/lipstick shade/what have you. Within just a few minutes, I'm zipping to work with my perfectly made iced 1/2 caff americano with cream.

Helpful tips - enter the drive thru from the west parking lot entrance. Both sides of the old gas pumps are fair game for drive thru speediness. Parking is not plentiful but there's a little lot behind the shop and some street parking as well. Food is super yummy. Ask for a stamp card and get your 10th drink free. Also, for your first visit, you get a free pastry!

If you're hanging around, the indoors is a really cute space with lots of variety of seating options. The patio is great too. Music is always on, and you'll see familiar faces if you come here regularly. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place to unwind and try a non- big chain coffee spot in the valley. Free WiFi is fast, Sunday jazz music is awesome. Didn't catch the name off the band but they sound amazing.

The food/drinks here are really good, and well priced! All 3 items I sampled (especially the hummus plate) were delicious. Free pastry for 1st timers too :-)

ONLY downside is since the place is small and everything is cooked right there, your clothes/belongings will stongly smell of a bacon(from their popular BLT)/ coffee mix for a while! Will have to do laundry each time, but will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. Hey have great drinks here, BUT recently I have a big knock against them. They are constantly playing loud, heavy rock. Call me old if you want, but I prefer to go to a coffee shop to study and to have a little bit of peace and quiet. It seems like it is constantly loud now here. I have overheard others complain about the same problem. It could be a rising problem if it continues."}
{"text":"Nice staff! Great sandwiches! Great coffee and drinks! Free wifi! and great hours! 6am to 9pm or 11pm (Fri. & Sat.). Nice local feel."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm officially off Starbuck's...when I'm in Phoenix at least. I ordered the coffee of course because how else are you going to determine the quality of a coffee house without testing the main ingredient. So one iced coffee with irish cream and low fat milk...Boom! my new favorite coffee house. The decor is quaint and artsy. Stone floors and brick walls mean a nice cool escape from the insane heat we all live in and the guys behind the counter actually seemed like they were happy to be at work. I even like the building itself, which appears to be converted from a 50's gas station with a single serving pump which now serves as the drive-through. Tomorrow morning I'm gonna head down early and enjoy a newspaper in my new favorite coffee house."}
{"text":"Good drinks and good food. Laid back and easier to find a seat than Lux. Try the Curry Chicken Salad sandwich. That's my favorite meal. Super tasty. The breakfast bagel is solid too. As for drinks, I like mine iced and their white mocha and their tuxedo are my favorite coffee drinks so far. Sometimes they have live music. I was there today, Sunday early afternoon, and they had a good jazz unit playing. They also have loyalty punch cards."}
{"text":"Clarissa explains it all! I've been here twice and had Clarissa help me both times. She is always friendly and very helpful with strange questions like \"where are the tables in this place from?\" Besides the amazing Clarissa, they have good drinks and a nice quiet environment for chatting or working. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great little shop.  They have a good product, that is worth your money and time.  Its a great place for conversation or to get a little work done.  Everything you could want in a coffee shop.

But that's not all...

When you buy your coffee from a big soulless company, *cough* Starbucks *cough*, you not only experience an inferior product, but you transfer local resources, your money, out of the state.  By supporting local businesses you promote competition, keep the money circulating in our community, and foster a more connected society.... That being said I am a quality monger and if Starbucks ever actually makes coffee/espresso that is the best, I will eat my words with a nice dry cappuccino.

Anyways try this place out, I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Copper Star Coffee is one of my favorite local, central Phoenix, coffee houses (in addition to Hob Nobs and Lux). Copper Star Coffee is located in a converted, vintage, automotive service and gas station right along a growing 7th Avenue corridor. What sets Copper Star apart from some of the other local coffee houses is their car hop service. There are times when I find myself in a hurry and a drive through is convenient. Although there is a Starbucks equipped with a drive through a mile north, I prefer to keep my dollars local and the fact that Copper Star has a drive through help me do just that. Each time I visit Copper Star, there is always something different in the way of pastries or muffins. On one visit in November they had scratch-made pumpkin and raisin muffins. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin in any form other than pie, but I over heard someone there mention they were really good. Being in a festive mood that day I bought one and was very pleased. As far as I know, everything is made in-house or is local. The Batista's pull a mean shot. When it's 110 degrees out, nothing tastes better than an iced double americano (no cream). I'm not sure where they get their coffee from exactly, but it full-flavored without being over roasted. Free WiFi is a great perk as I've gone there several times to read my morning digital news. The staff is always friendly and the service prompt."}
{"text":"After driving past this coffee place (used to be a gas station back in the day) I decided to stop one day and give it a try. I'm a big fan of Cubanos so I was excited to try one here. The Cubano was excellent....not to mention the DELICIOUS pastries behind the glass counter. The staff is always nice and greet me when I walk in. Honestly, I would rather go here than to those OTHER coffee places nearby which are always crowded and overrated. Last time I went to the OTHER place, my Cubano tasted like an Americano with extra sweetner added. I was so upset that I dumped the coffee and went back to Copper Star. Unfortunately I live on 180th Avenue and I have to wait until I get to work (15th Avenue and Indian School) before I can get my coffee fix!! Anyway, this place looks nice and clean. Give it a try next time you're in the area of 7th Avenue just north of Indian School. Look for a gas station with a coffee sign. The parking is limited so you may have to drive around a bit before you find a parking spot. Sometimes the garage door is open and the smell of coffee hits you as you're driving up."}
{"text":"Nice, local coffee shop with great coffee. The place has a nice vibe- definitely a place where you could stay at for hours and get work done. 

I had an almond milk coconut cappuccino and it was delicious... Their baked goods looked really good too."}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days and found this gem.  A great place to have breakfast, coffee and hack on some code."}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise in finding this place.  After a lunch out with girlfriends we decided to stop for coffee before heading back down to Chandler.  We were pleasantly greeted by a delightful young lady.  She asked if the we had tried a Cubano.  She described it and I had to try it.  It was the BEST coffee I've ever had.  Very pleasant experience.  I will definitely stop in again when in the area."}
{"text":"Great experience!  After taking my dog for a hike this morning, I finally made it to Copper Star for a cafe mocha.  What  a cute, rustic place.  I tried out the drive thru and was suprised at the immediate service since there was no window.  My dog and I sat for a bit and was plenty surprised with them taking care of my drink on the house.  They were short handed and thought I waited too long...did not seem too long compared what Starbucks.  This may be my new coffee spot."}
{"text":"I just moved from NC and found this place through Yelp. I am so thankful I did! It took me back to my sweet NC! 
Oh, and the lavender mocha is simply amazing!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and I LOVE the curry chicken salad sandwich (easy on the red onion). Also a big fan of their ice tea and generous refills. The brownies and cupcakes, however, are dangerously addictive.

They recently expanded the menu to include a whole host of new sandwiches all made with fresh, locally produced meats. If I can break my curry chicken salad habit, I will definitely try them.

The free wifi is okay but don't be surprised if you lose your signal occasionally. 

If you sit out on the patio, you may get to enjoy some exceptional people watching. BONUS!"}
{"text":"Best (and by far the biggest) muffins and scones I've ever eaten. Better than the elite muffin stores I frequent in Manhattan. More fruit, less sugar, and fresh made every morning on the premises. Get there early if you're a scone lover. The coffee is of course very good. Tea selection is even better with many varieties to choose from.
A funky converted gas station with great service too!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Copper Star. I was looking for a local coffee shop that offers drive thru service. I saw that Copper Star had great reviews so I thought I'd check it out. I went in early Sunday morning and once I pulled up to the drive thru, I was greeted by a young lady who was very nice and extremely helpful! They didn't have any type of menu outside, being that this was my first time, I wanted to see what they had to offer beyond the regular latte or cappuccino I always order.

I let her know I'd never been before so she gave me a rundown of their specialty drinks (she was extremely nice about it, not annoyed like some people at other places tend to be). That's when I heard her say Lavender Mocha, lavender syrup made in house, and my eyes went wide! I haven't had a lavender mocha since my many trips to my fave local shop in Seattle so of course I had to order it.

Did not disappoint! I loved loved their lavender mocha! I also asked for pastries, which she then preceded to tell me that since it was my first time, I get a free one. Woohoo!!! I ordered the blueberry scone which was fresh and ginormous! It was very delicious! All-in-all, this was the perfect visit with delicious coffee, a delicious scone, and great customer service. I will absolutely be coming back, only next time, I'll bring some friends along to try my new favorite local coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy with this place overall; drinks are good, service is friendly, atmosphere is enjoyable, and I delight in the immediate neighborhood, where I inevitably have to park.  

My one complaint: though they do technically stock rice milk, they never actually have it.  What gives!  I'm tired of coffee places thinking it's adequate to offer soy as the only dairy alternative.  I ask for it every time and every time they are still out.  C'mon guys, this game is not difficult."}
{"text":"Went in this morning while my dog got groomed next door. Great atmosphere, nice to just kick back, relax and read while you drink your coffee. I ended up with a vegan muffin, which i don't care about but it still tasted good. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Best drip coffee in Phoenix, hands down.  The staff is extremely friendly and gracious.  I also love their deviled egg sandwich.  I've definitely taken every out-of-town friend here.  I've heard (though have not tried) that their cupcakes, which are made in-house, are to die for.  The place is great for studying - tables abound.  I've conducted a few interviews here for various things and have always found the atmosphere to be great - quiet enough but enough background noise/music (and the music choice is great) to make it lively.  Just left Phoenix and I will miss Copper Star!"}
{"text":"I really love the eclectic and FRIENDLY staff (Hunter is so chatty and all around awesome). But really, it's the vegan muffins that keep me coming back. This place is a gayborhood gem."}
{"text":"This place is great. The people are nice, the coffee is so good, and the free wi-fi is definitely a bonus. My only complaint? That it isn't in my neighborhood. 

That said, I go to Copper Star for the coffee. I could go somewhere closer, like one of the three coffee places within walking distance, but Copper Star does it better. The various bakery treats are okay, nothing phenomenal but certainly edible. I can't comment on the sandwiches, never having had one. 

The tiny patio is nice for cooler weather or enjoying the day with your canine companion. Be warned, it fills up fast with only two tables.

ETA: Chocolate chip cookies have recently been added to the baked goods line- up, and man- are they amazing."}
{"text":"It's a really cool place. The employees are super nice and they have a lot of options, not just drinks,but treats as well. I got an iced coffee and a chocolate chip cookie and I was super happy with both. Definitely a place you should try here in Phoenix, with great drinks, treats, and service"}
{"text":"Loud music on radio.... burnt drip hot coffee.... nasty iced coffee.... service just okay..... bagels and cream cheese good but not outstanding. I live within walking distance of this coffee shop and usually just go up the street to the new Starbucks for faster service and surprisingly BETTER coffee. Sad as I love to support Melrose  District small businesses whenever possible. My next door  neighbours feel the same way. 

It's just meh..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Copperstar Coffee on and off for about four years, and regularly for about two years. I keep coming back because, every time, I always receive excellent service.  There was a period in 2011 to early 2012 where the service wasn't consistent and I stopped going for a while. However, I'm very glad I gave it another chance as the service has been PERFECT ever since (about mid 2012). Not being able to incorporate very much dairy in my diet, Copperstar is very accommodating, particularly with its almond milk option for drinks, as well as being flexible on substitutions on its meals. They also make a crazy good BLT that comes with pasta salad, chocolate chip cookies that make your heart melt, and a hummus plate that rivals anything Pita Jungle has. Great atmosphere, music is not your cliché hipster Starbucks style. They play a great variety, my personal favorite is when they play nineties music. Do yourself a favor and go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Simply chill, beautiful atmosphere tucked away in the center of Phoenix. The coffee is just as warm and sweet as the hospitality. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Nice friendly atmosphere.  Drive through.  Oh, and, small point, good coffee.  (Only good---not great, but I'm a coffee snob.)  When their wireless shifts from spotty to stable, I'll be there all the time. 

PS: Get there at an insanely early hour, i.e., 6:30am, and you'll have yummy muffins just out of the oven.  mmmm......."}
{"text":"Very good coffee, excellent customer service, cool atmo, reasonable pricing! Today was our first visit...and will be our first of many!"}
{"text":"I really like coffee...alot... this was an absolutely delicious cup... (house brew) basic black.... sooooo smooth...very good Salad also...the staff was super cool in addition to providing great service... fun bonus today (Sunday) there was live music and these guys were good!!!! Big fan I'll definitely be returning!!!!!"}
{"text":"copper star has a special place in my heart for sure. the atmosphere is perfect for a small meeting or for reading or studying. it is also very cool inside and is located in an area great for thrifting. 

the coffee itself is good. their milk steaming ability isn't excellent, but they pull consistent shots. their chai is great and their sesame ginger tuna sandwich is actually outstanding. 

since its opening, i have probably visited copper star more frequently than any other coffee shop in phoenix."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about their BLTs. After the first bite, I'm pretty sure I let out an inappropriate noise of pleasure. Just--just take my word for it and try it please. I need to know I'm spreading happiness in the world by convincing even one person to order it.

Their chai is also really good. Think Starbucks, but heavier with the black tea.

Bathrooms and dining area are both very clean and spacious enough that even those with disabilities will have no trouble maneuvering their way around. The art on the walls/industrial-hip theme/and creative furniture add to the atmosphere. Love it, really recommend this place"}
{"text":"First of all, great coffee and drinks.  That's enough for me.



However, for those of your who more into the scene than the content, this place is cool.  It's hip w/out being hipster (or \"wannabe-at-any-price\").  It's casual and comfortable, pertinent yet woody, and yes....tasty muffins.  

I have not had any meals, tho my compadres have, and they reported all A's !!
I HAVE had about 5 different coffee drinks (not at the same sitting), and all them get my barista's gold star.  Oh yeah, fun people watching too!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service was outstanding! And my coffee was delectable! The ambiance, music, decorations, & design of the seating area was optimal; stylish and functional (and plenty of space)! The bathroom was also really nice! I'm only here for three days but plan on going back! :)"}
{"text":"I have been going here on and off for the past 3 years.  It is just a 2 minute bike ride for me from home, or 6 minutes when walking Jack my dog. Everyone here is friendly and attentive.  It has a cozy family atmosphere and they actually remember your name after your first 2 or 3 times coming in.  I usually just have a drip coffee but have to admit that it is always tasty, never too strong or too weak.  The pastry case always looks awesome!.  They have a variety of coffee drinks from hot, cold, to frozen.  They also have sub sandwiches and artisan sandwiches as well.  I highly recommend the curried chicken salad sandwich, the recipe is actually Bill's mothers.  You gotta check this place out!!!!  I give all of my 10 thumbs up..."}
{"text":"I love COPPER STAR, from the staff, to the food, to the coffee, every thing is amazing. They deserve 10 stars, but I had to rate them 4 stars for one reason. The band on Sundays. The band plays for 2+ hours at deafening levels that make the inside of the place unusable. They take up all the soft seating and reduce the spaces for people to actually sit an enjoy a coffee and/or a conversation. 

Will I come back? Of course I will. Will i be forced to go someplace else for my weekly Sunday escape? Sadly, yes, because their is no seating most Sundays and it is getting to hot to sit outside."}
{"text":"Can you give extra stars for cute barristas? That's probably unfair. Plus, it's unnecessary because Copper Star earns five stars on its own merit.

Phoenix has yet to turn me on. Now, I am sure there are many hidden oases of awesome out here in the desert, but I haven't found many. Thank you, Copper Star for not being a mirage. I enjoyed your coffee. I'm glad you have free wi-fi  and I really like the feel of your cafe. I'd say it's crisp. That's the term I'd give to Apple products if I didn't dislike Apple. Crisp: you've got it, Copper Star. Next time I'm in Phoenix...let that not be soon, I'm going to linger at one of your tables and savor another cup of joe and be content."}
{"text":"Copper Star is far and away my favorite local coffee shop.  It's everything that I want in a local coffee shop.  The staff are super friendly and have a fun quirky artsy hipster vibe.  Yes, that's one specific vibe.  The owner, Bill, is often there and is a super friendly local guy.  

The coffee is really good.  Both the brewed coffee and the espresso beverages are very smooth.  The coffee they serve is not roasted to death, so it isn't nearly as bitter or biting as the coffee served at a certain multinational coffee mega corporation we all know.  

The pastries and cakes are out of this world.  They bake them in an open kitchen that you can see as you order.  I have never been disappointed by a single baked item I've purchased here.

There is sometimes live music.  The crowd is friendly and local.  Free WiFi.  Great spot to sit and read, socialize with friends, or go for a first meeting.  Can't get enough of it."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter where I am in The Valley, if I want my special coffee or some amazing desserts, Copper Star is what I think of first.  Bill and his young staff are go-getters, and no matter who I have to \"initiate\" in making my coffee, they're always energetic to do so.  Also have used them for catering breakfast, and they're extremely attentive and very reasonably priced.  Their best-kept secret?  The Chicken Curry Salad (yes, salad...try it that way instead of the wrap).  And I don't even like curry!  I only wish they still made their peanut butter fudge squares!  Highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. The drinks are way overpriced and service is below average.  Barista didnt even call me to know my drink was ready.  It just sat there for awhile and me and another customer were waiting to see who's drink it was.  My chai latte was $5.50 for 20 oz.  pretty overpriced. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Big fan. Went with Nathan S a couple weeks ago. Great atmosphere, spread out and ample seating inside and out. 

I got an iced coffee, it was good. They also had a flyer stand up so Nathan could plan his week accordingly. Thanks Copper Star

Also, it is convently located right next to Revolver Records a great 1-2 punch for a Saturday afternoon"}
{"text":"The coffee was good the brownie was a bit hard tho. Love the atmosphere & decor. We sat outside, inside is even nicer."}
{"text":"Best coffee. Best employees. Best ownership. Best location. Best food. Best prices. Best neighborhood. The best."}
{"text":"Hands down Copper Star has the BEST chai in the valley. Great atmosphere and is open late."}
{"text":"I just moved to Phoenix from LA and being a coffee addict I started looking around for a coffee shop next to my house. I got hooked after the first time. The staff is awesome!! Friendly, funny, charming and the coffee is amazing! Walked in on a monday night and they got live music! WHAT?!?! By far the best coffee shop I've been to. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Copper star wins five stars from me! I've enjoyed two visits to this lovely little coffee house in the melrose district of 7th ave, both have been delightful.  The owner was very nice in giving me an extra stamp on the \"punch\" card for my first visit.  I am a big fan of being rewarded for my loyalty so after 9 drinks (from apple juice to plain ole \"drip\") you get a 10th free (and we're talking lattes!)...
There is a diverse quiet crowd here, and everyone pretty much keeps to themselves in a good way.  The music was not over the top, but current and enjoyable.   The shabby art on the walls is kind of fun to look at while they are steaming up that extra foam.
I've sat outside both times and have been inspired to do a little after coffee antiquing, although I have yet to venture off of the patio with my latte.
All in all, A+, great coffee, delicious strawberry cupcakes, good people, chill atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Service is friendly and quick! Great food and coffee! Really good atmosphere. Busy, which is a good sign. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great spot for coffee. Seating indoors and outdoors. Drive thru available. Good vibes and good coffee."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this joint before I moved to Vegas. Now I am back and finally made my return trip. Is it p[ossible they got better? It must be because they did.

It used to be a gas station, which is suiting as I run off coffee just like my car on gasoline, though I pay more per gallon for mine. Comfy couches, hip artwork, tons of music that is on my ipod playlist anyhow, I love this place.

I had possibly the best tuna fish sandwich that I have ever had in my life. Lemon ginger something or another...devine. Also iced green tea as I was feeling a bit ill and in need of rehydration. Hit the spot and has free refills all day. I would also reccomend the baked goods, as they are fresh baked and completely sinfully , irresistable

The service is friendly and efficent just as I remember it. Anytime I have been here I was treated kindly, politely, and rather like a friend. 

This is one of my favorite spots in the valley and when I retire at short bursts I try to visit daily."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and had a couple of hours to kill and discovered this gem! Nice intimate inside seating and small patio in a converted gas station. The staff was amazing and loved talking with Alicia. Was gonna get an order to go, but they had a wonderful jazz band playing live music Sunday afternoon. Had an iced coffee that was delish and  the hummus bagel. The hummus is outstanding. This is a great place to enjoy a coffee and a light fresh baked snack with friends or solo."}
{"text":"I drive the stretch of 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback very rarely, but running errands today caused me to take a slight detour. I'd never noticed Copper Star before until today, when I was driving north and noticed the retro gas station, and then word coffee, and then the word WI-FI in big letters on the window. I quickly made a u-turn and parked my car on the street (their lot fits like 2 cars at most).

I walked in and the place was really open and airy with a kind of industrial loft setting. The barristas were real friendly and my iced soy latte was really good. Apparently Copper Star blends, roasts and grinds their own beans and they've done a quality job.

I sat down in a corner seat and relaxed while The Shins were wafting through the sound system, which was fitting, as it seemed like a Shins kind of place. One of the barristas then went back into the open air kitchen to continue frosting freshly baked cupcakes. The crowd seemed local and quite a few people seemed to know one another as they walked in, so it seems like Copper Star's become a neighborhood institution. 

Cool concept - a coffeehouse in a converted old gas station. They also have a drive through window for all the folks on the go. 

All in all, a great find. I'll definitely come back again a few more times to see if it merits adding another star (or, perhaps, deleting one - which I'm hoping won't happen).

---------------

EDITED TO ADD A 5th STAR: Coffee's been consistently good since the first time. And a couple weeks ago I reverted back to being 5 and had a chocolate-frosted cupcake with sprinkles and I contently went back home and watched 3-2-1 Contact and Voltron. Thanks Copper Star!"}
{"text":"The service is wonderful. I was given a free pastry because it was my first time in. It's busy but still feels roomy. This place is great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've stopped here several times now (both inside and drive-thru) and have found coffee, food, staff and environment ALL to be pretty awesome.  Quite a lot of variety on the menu in regards to drinks, and surprisingly a lot of tasty food options-- last time I was in, my friend ordered the curry salad, which looked amazing!  Baked goods and lattes are very yummy as well, and (the fellow that I presume to be) the owner is such a hospitable and considerate human. Bonus points for being in a really lovely neighborhood and vintage shopping area, I quite enjoy introducing people or bringing out-of-town guests here for a sip and bite while perusing the nearby shops."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Coffee drinks are good average, baked goods are absolutely fantastic. Scratch baking at its very best!"}
{"text":"If you're trying to stay away from some of the big names but still want a tasty cup of joe, then Copper Star is an excellent choice! 

Since it's right on 7th Ave, it is easily accessible on your drive downtown.  It's a converted old gas station.  You won't miss it! 

The vibe is cool, the staff are great and the coffee is delicious. They've also got a yummy selection of breakfast food, too!

So, go get yourself an iced coffee to help deal with the summer heat! Go! Right now!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place and I didn't even go inside! I loved their little drive through. You pull up and they come out to you, take your order, then make it and bring it to you. Not really a place to go if you're in a hurry, but it was fun to visit anyway. The iced mochas had a good mix of coffee+sweet+kick in the pants to keep you going.

Even though I didn't go in, they get 4 stars because the service was great and the associate that helped us was super cool. She was really helpful and efficient (we did not wait long at all) and wished us well. She also saw we were formally dressed for a wedding, asked non-intrusive, friendly questions and sent us on our way. If I were a Phoenix resident, I think this would be my go-to, solely based on a positive drive-thru experience!"}
{"text":"Highlight to the Melrose District. Can't go retro / vintage shopping without some Copper Star cup o' Joe."}
{"text":"super chill atmosphere with nice rolling door to open it all up to outside, perfect for fall to spring in phoenix!
coffee is top notch and bagels are huge, baked not boiled so deal.
lunch is great the curry chicken sammy is a delight and ice tea gets free all day refils. this is my new office away from office.
and to the guy that likes to put his shoes on the couch: please stop, its pretty lame."}
{"text":"i hate to admit it but.. i love that this place has a drive thru!  i'm a real grab n' go kinda girl a lot of the time and i think this brings me to copper star more often than i realize. (until *surprise* my stamp card is full again?!)

the coffee is not the best in the city.. but at least it's local and that counts for something. plus i like the concept of gas station gone coffee shop.  

(and i love stars.)"}
{"text":"What a hip coffee shop! Delicious cinnamon roll, compliments of the shop as this is my first visit!! And certainly not my last! Did not want the usual (Starbucks, etc) and i can't say enough about the excellent coffee, atmosphere,  and staff! What fun! Art work on walls is for sale by local artists. Everyone here including patrons are in a good mood, and why not?"}
{"text":"We use to go to Copper Star for many years. Ever since new staff are working there. Not very friendly (this was a few months back). There has been some male staff who were very friendly and love their job. This one female employee was rude. And she  looked like she did not want to be there. I noticed a new menu I had mentioned that this menu is new to me and that I was not ready yet to order. Obviously they were not very busy that day. This employee would be standing there with this impatient look. When I ordered something she would tell me they didn't have it. And I ordered something else and she would tell me the same thing. I asked her. What do you guys have? She would tell me and I just ordered a coffee and left. Their menu items listed appeared more expensive. And the art work on their walls has gotten uninteresting unfortunately. A friend of mine when there and told me that the manager lost his restaurant business and I'm wondering that is why the prices went up. I wish them luck."}
{"text":"5 stars. I'd originally put 4 simply because it was my first visit, but now on my second and this spot is great. I like to ride to good coffee shops ( in this instance on the Triumph rather than cycling on the road bike ), spent about an hour or so relaxing and reading a good book. Copper Star Coffee feels like it will be a regular spot for me. The patio area looks pleasant and I see myself spending some time out there as the temperature drops eventually. Inside is cozy and inviting. 

The staff is very friendly and the service great. I tried the breakfast bagel, with egg, ham and American cheese: very very tasty, simple but right on. The Americano was just right though, looking back, I should have opted for the 16 oz vs the 12oz. All in all a great place to spend a morning, AND it's open early. I'm an early bird and with most spots downtown not opening until 7am or so for me, in the summer, that's just a bit late lol. Especially if I'm going to be cycling there from N. Phoenix.  It's just off of 7th Ave with a little parking area adjacent in addition to street parking.  

So, I like this little shop located in a former service station quite a lot and look forward to more visits and to trying the variety of pastries, food and caffeinated  goodness.  Great little place."}
{"text":"We had two tuxedo mochas with almond and they were delish. Not as creamy as other places but still a solid drink. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in the area, hand's down. Drinking the best coffee in an old gas station and mechanics shop, all the better. 

Copper Star is never empty, and it is small and cozy, but there always seems to be room for everyone. While they have given the inside the hip, artsy cafe makeover the outside remains true to its historic roots. Copper Star (and the owner Bill) have been huge supporters of the Melrose area business and the historic district's community for as long as I can remember. 

The service is usually fantastic, but if you ever have an issue, all you need to do is let them know and they will certainly take care of it. Stop on by!"}
{"text":"Small quiet and comfortable! Menu looks great as most coffee joints do but this had \"tuxedo mocha\"."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I spent an entire day here working on a project for grad school. It was comfortable and had great prices."}
{"text":"I chose Copper Star because of the good reviews on Yelp. It truly did live up to its reputation. 

Lets start off with the decor. Its a converted gas station so that is just cool. The garage door is all glass now so it has great natural light. There are a couple of sofas, a few big tables for large parties and a few smaller tables. However there is limited seating overall because hey, old gas stations just weren't that big on the inside. There are a few outside patio tables with misters to keep the heat down but the misters on the right side of the door seemed to be leaking or something so sitting on that side would be like sitting by your yard sprinkler while its going off, effectively eliminating that side of the patio for seating options. 

They have a good selection of coffee and non coffee drinks I had a frozen toffee first and a cookies and cream next. My husband had an iced chai. All of the drinks were super yummy, the cookies & cream being my favorite. If you want something sweet & caffienated then this is the drink for you. My husband said he really enjoyed his iced chai too. They had a good selection of pastry type items. We had the cookie brownie which was both tasty and monstrous in size. I saw an award up on the wall in which they were voted best cupcakes. 

They do also offer breakfast and lunch type items, eggs, sandwiches and the like. While I did not partake this time I definitely would. They had a nice open kitchen which was clean and tidy. 

The service was awesome! Everyone raved about the service in previous reviews and they lived up to it. Whatever they are doing in terms of hiring and training it is working. The staff is genuinely nice and seem to care about what they do. Kudos for that in this day of crap customer service. 

The bathrooms overall were clean although the small trash can for putting towels in had begun to overflow and was in need of attention.

This is a good coffee place for everyone. The snob, the teen, the middle agers, retirees. No one would feel out of place here.

I drove 24 miles to have coffee there and would definitely do it again. Well done Copper Star! Well done."}
{"text":"Moved to midtown Phx about 1 year ago. If I was to ever move out of the neigborhood, I would miss Copper Star Coffee the most. It's my favorite coffee shop I've been to in AZ. The staff is super friendly, there is plenty of room to lounge around and play on the internet (for free). The menu is awesome! I don't have much of a sweet tooth but all their pastries look delicious. I think they switch up the art on the walls like every two weeks or something like that so it's nice to see all the different art work. On Sunday mornings theres this 3 piece band that comes in around 10:30 or 11:00 and plays old country and rock tunes. 

I love how I stop in every morning before work and Cindy or any of the other ladies know exactly what I want. 

If you live in the neighborhood and haven't been to Copper Star yet, you are blowing it."}
{"text":"This is simply my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. The staff and owner are friendly, the drinks are all excellent, and there is a lovely outdoor space with plenty of seating, trees, and a water fountain. They even give out free drinks sometimes (including today, their anniversary) And free refills every day! I live on a tight budget, so I deeply appreciate that they do this for their customers. I have never felt unwelcome here or as though I'm overstaying. It's just the kind of small local business that you feel good patronizing and that leaves you with a smile. One word of caution is to bring a sweater if you plan on sitting inside since their air conditioning is no joke."}
{"text":"This place is great. 
I am a Starbucks convert for sure.  Great bakery items, great customer service and great coffee.  
Highly recommended in my book!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an afternoon coffee with coworkers after lunch. Great coffee and great customer service. The baked goods in the case looked amazing, would love to go back and get something with my coffee next time."}
{"text":"This is my go-to coffee shop! Awesome and friendly staff. Whenever I head in there I know I'll be taken care of! 
All of the pastries are made in house and they are usually great! I'm glad that there has been more variety lately. I would like to see more options when it comes to food. Everything I've had is good but specials every once in a while would be nice."}
{"text":"Super cute gas station turned coffee shop!  Great customer service and manager gave us 2 free pastries since we are first timers. Stop in if you're in the area !!"}
{"text":"Cool, trendy coffee shop with great iced coffee and amazing baked goods. This is one of the best spots in Central Phoenix to grab a cup of coffee/tea and a snicker doodle."}
{"text":"I'm proud to be in the neighborhood of Copper Star!! This coffee shop is the real deal. Not only do they make an awesome dirty chai, they have food if you're there working on your computer that is really good and the service is top notch. The owner knows us and he is always involved in serving his customers and very \"hands-on\" from what I can tell. I pulled up to the drive thru one day and he was getting out of his car, just getting to work. Before even walking into work, he ran over to my car to grab my order and rushed my coffee (my regular: Red Eye w/ 2% milk) out to me in seconds. That's what makes this coffee shop really stand out and a key location in the Melrose district!"}
{"text":"Most amazing coffee shop in phoenix, great prices, AMAZING pastries, its clean, fresh, fun- The food is simple and flavorful and well done every time- It has been my favorite hange for 10 years"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Great atmosphere with great service and excellent espresso. What more could you ask for in a coffee house? I plan to return often."}
{"text":"This is a Phoenix gem.  I love their creative adaptive reuse of an old gas station, including using the former pump area as a \"drive through\".  The owner is friendly and engaged, and remembers me even though I'm an occasional customer due to not living in the area. The staff are all great as well. Coffee and food selections are great, and their bagels are fresh made daily!  I love the \"health nut\" bagel when they have it.  Great local spot. Oh, and their patio is dog-friendly for the months you can stand to be outside with your pup."}
{"text":"It's a really great little coffee shop with a nice atmosphere. My personal favorite order is the lavender latte. It's a great place to meet up with people and has great indoor and outdoor seating. It's a pretty good place to work on things, but they have a limited number of outlets placed (somewhat) awkwardly so come prepared. Overall, I really enjoy it here!"}
{"text":"I love Copper Star for their awesome coffee and pastries and even more awesome staff. The coffee and coffee drinks are always yummy and balanced, not over-roasted or acidic. The pastries - well let's just say if I could, I would enjoy one daily....delish! The owner Bill and staff are all wonderfully delightful. There is a refreshing authenticity and that permeates the space here and it's the people that work here that have created it with warm hello's, smiles and conversation.  Thanks Copper Star for your consistent \"awesomeness\" and your warmth! @the_furu"}
{"text":"This place has the best Cubano Phoenix has to offer!! From that bold burnt cane sugar taste and smell, to the delicately dissolving espresso blending under this milky-coffee goodness! 
Ever so delicious and satisfying!! :)"}
{"text":"I love the laid back atmosphere, the old school cash register, and the open feel.

In terms of food they usually have an assortment of baked goods for sale.

For coffee I'm a huge fan of the Cubano and the Tuxedo, both phenomenal coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever visiting Copper Star. I can't even guess at how many times I've driven by the place and never noticed that it was a coffee shop! Reason being: it's converted from an old gas station. Which. Is. AWESOME. Haha! Totally fits the Melrose vibe.

The experience was very enjoyable. The man who served my friend and I was very polite and very bright/positive/kind. My friend ordered an Arnold Palmer and was served a HUGE cup full of delicious, obviously-made-from-scratch beverage. We were then told that refills for the drink would be free all day, even if we decided to leave then come back later! Wild.

Have not tried the coffee yet as I was not in much of a drinking or eating mood, but I do intend to visit again soon. They were serving food around us the whole time we were there and everything looked really good. They also had delicious-looking pastries, plenty of seating (inside and outside), and even some cool little handmade trinkets.

If you haven't been to Copper Star Coffee, it's honestly one of those unassuming little hidden treasures and deserves a visit the first chance you get. Very unique little place. Can't wait to go back when I'm thirsty for some coffee!!"}
{"text":"Very speedy service - multiple people working the counter. The gentleman who took my order was extremely pleasant and welcomed me with open arms when I asked if they still honored the free pastry on your first visit. There is an outdoor seating area with cute benches, plants, and a fountain as well as tables inside. I got a black coffee which is good and a blueberry scone that is very good and huge! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"very unique place! i have only been here once so far but what i mostly like about this business beside the great service, decor, and tea is the hours are good, i luv LoLa's coffee bar too however they close at odd hours, Sundays i either chill at home, catch a movie or grabb a cup of joe. At Copper Star Coffee they stay open till 9pm Sundays which is an okay time for me. I have yet to try their coffee but the one time that I have been there i tried the \"king size\" earl grey tea which rocked! I plan to pass the word around and also will be going back real soon! kewl place go check it out!  =X"}
{"text":"I think the coffee is pretty good. The service on the other hand, is hit or miss. I usually hit up the drive thru and some of the baristas are pretty friendly. However, there are a couple of guys the are a bit dismissive when I go. One guy in the morning ( not sure if he is the owner) told me to pull forward after I ordered and the turn off my vehicle. The tone was pretty rude. I now only use the drive thru in the afternoon."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite coffee shop!  Their iced chai is the best I have ever had.  They also have a really great assortment of baked goods made right there.  The cupcakes are divine.  I have also had the bagels, which are also delicious.  I am ready to go back and have a rice crispy treat!"}
{"text":"Cute and fun! Staff is the typical coffee staff they are somewhat chatty with regulars and cold to those who venture in. Overall cute, bring friends and a good laugh. Support local coffee houses."}
{"text":"Such a cute bohemian little rest stop to refuel on caffeine and good food. The shop itself is an artsy throwback to old school fueling stations. 

The space is a bit small and fills up fast, especially on the patio. They carry Harney & sons tea (which scores them allot of points in my book). I ordered the green tea blueberry drink. It was closer to a smoothie than I expected, but so delicious.

I also got a cheesecake muffin, a hummus plate and some bagel egg sandwiches. It was all very reasonably priced. The hummus plate had all sorts of goodies to go with the homemade hummus. The ingredients used were all high quality. The muffin was most and fluffy."}
{"text":"Love Copper Star. There's something about it that is so reassuring. Whenever I need to hide from my crappy job I can always count on Copper Star to be there, waiting with good coffee and a cupcake. 
Warm, inviting and never swarming with annoying hipsters or yuppies."}
{"text":"Copper star coffee has a very warm and welcoming feel when you walk in. The owner and all of the staff members are very kind. The owner offered me a free muffin on my first time visit because he did not recognize me has a regular customer.

I enjoy coming here from time to time to get work done and the regulars there are all very friendly. This is a great place to stop in for a meeting or if you just want to work at a café.

As someone who only drinks black coffee, I do not find their regular coffee very enjoyable. It often has a bland taste and comes out boiling hot. This normally would not be a issue, however, the cups do a poor job of insulating the coffee so the drink itself changes temperatures drastically over a short period of time. Hence, the three-star rating."}
{"text":"I work around the corner from this place, and having driven past on my way to work for a few months, I finally got the chance to give Copper Star a try, and I've been back 3 times in one week.  The design and overall feel of the interior is wonderful.  Especially now that the weather is getting cooler, I loved sitting inside next to the large open door, enjoying a lovely day.  I was there for a few hours working on my laptop, and I enjoyed that the people around me were a break from the normal \"coffee shop crowd.\"
Speaking of the coffee shop crowd, the employees here are nicer than any barista, anywhere.  Seriously.  They greet everyone with a smile, and take your beverage order without judgement (how refreshing!) while willing to give recommendations if you need a little guidance.

But the thing that really pushed it over the top for me is the baked goods.  OH.  MY. GOSH.  This morning I stopped in to get a muffin on my way to work and half an hour later, when I finally got a chance to eat it (still warm!!), I literally walked around telling half my coworkers about this muffin.  It was that good.

Thank you copper star, for becoming my new regular coffee shop."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and decided to come to this coffee shop in the morning before taking my brother's dog Otis to get his claws clipped at Wag n' Wash... and I am sooooo happy I did. I was met with smiling faces and great conversation all around. I had a fantastic iced vanilla latte and enjoyed the misters outside on the patio. I realized I had forgotten my brother's apartment keys and had to wait for my brother for almost an hour after the dog's claw trim  so I sat outside with Otis and this gentleman who works here came outside and because it was hot, I troubled him for some water for Otis and without hesitation, he not only brought out a water bowl for Otis, but, he also brought out a cup of ice water for me!  He was so nice, wonderful and personable! After a short conversation, turns out he is the Owner of this place! His name is Bill and I am eternally grateful for his kindness and amazing personality! Thank you for making Otis and I feel welcome and comfortable! My brother, Otis and I will be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recent Saturday afternoon with some family while we were in the area.  I had looked for a local sandwich shop on yelp and was pleased to have  found this spot... hell, it was close enough, so we gave it a shot.

The buildling is an old gas station I've driven by many times before ... never would I have thought that it would be creatively converted into a small sandwich and coffee shop... but I'm glad it did!

The small outdoor patio had a few people there (and some pets) and the indoor seating area was small but empty enough that we found quick seating.  The table/chairs were a bit awkward (a bit wobbly), but we made do.  We all had sandwiches (I the Curried Chicken Sandwich - how have I not had this before, it was outstanding in flavor!! and my sister's whose sam'ich I also tried was the Deviled Egg - also delicious) and afterwards we decided that, with the unique selection of alternative-ingredient baked goods they had on display, we'd try a few out.  

When we had first walked in, this girl's big, FAT delicious looking cinnamon roll had caught my eye.. and after lusting after it throughout my meal, I decided I'd go back to the walk-up counter and get us one to split... waa!  They were all out!  Bummer... BUT, we tried their spice cake and their danish and they were excellent.

I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and awesome owner, delicious drinks, yummy food, and free wifi! What else could I ask for? Oh yea, to be within walking distance? Check and mate ;)

Even better; they have loyalty punch cards so I'm often getting free drinks. Seriously, go and enjoy the cozy neighborhood hangout that Copper Star has created."}
{"text":"skyrockets in flight-fat kid's delight!

i had a hankering for a heapa helpin' of some hot stuff... so instead of stopping by the deutsch siblings, we stopped at copper star. why don't we stop here more often? creatures of habit or just plain old creetchies? anywho, the lovely lass who tended to us was just a little slice of cake with a plop of peachie. my raspberry mocha and his cinnamon variety were thoroughly tasty, but the zinger here was that she sacked us up a chocolate chip scone,completely on the house, since we had been mia for so long. 

i usually have a bone to pick with scones, desert dry, hack inducing crumby, chunky things that end up in the bottom of my cup, eventually landing on my face with a wet plop when i get to the dregs. this guy!  oh, he was the antithesis of sconedom, with....i don't know, 17 cups of chocolate chips?! a delicious monster of a thing. we raved, we gushed, we chomped and mushed all the way home. 

thank you nice lady! we will never stray so far again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but lukewarm staff. The guy who works in the mornings (weekdays) and the owner are awesome, but some of the staff act like they're annoyed to be taking your order. Their pastries are excellent and the coffee is ok--it depends on what you order. I've always had a much better experience on weekday mornings vs. evenings and weekends."}
{"text":"Ok, let me ask you a question. :) If you live 15-20 miles away from a coffee house, does it make sense to drive all the way over their to get your fix? 

YES-if it's this place. 

Starbucks WISHES it could be this place; they are most likely on their own hands and corporate knees praying, only to find them go unanswered. Lol. It wishes it was as cool, had as great a drink selection (not just coffee either-try the raspberry tea!!!), and has an inviting atmosphere that is great for hanging out and socializing. 

Wait! Did you say socializing John? In a coffee house? In Phoenix of all places? 

Yes. :) Believe it. Come here for their coffee. Stay for their great service. Fall in love with its refreshing sensibility and the satisfaction of patronizing a local business. 

Go here. NOW :)"}
{"text":"Copper Star Coffee is always best when it is cool enough to open up the doors. Hurry folks I think that season is already over. Great location! Awesome service! Great beverages and more than enough possibilities to strike up an interesting conversation if you make an effort. 
I love all the dog owners that go in there."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and snacks. Vegan options available."}
{"text":"Copper Star is awesome! Great drinks, tasty food, superb people watching and cozy atmosphere. I love the free wifi and local art that is abundant on the walls.

Eclectic variety of clientele that share one common cause... supporting local business. Just say no to Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived down the street for three years and never tried this place. I knew they sold coffee but had no idea also offer amazing food and pastries. The BLT I just wolfed down was arguably the best I've ever had!!! Warm, thick bacon with deep red tomatoes and toasted wheat bread. Delicious and I ordered from my car and drove thru!!! The girl who helped me was a joy and this place has definitely stole my heart. Keep up the good work Copper Star!!!"}
{"text":"Iced lavender mocha. Yes, really. I've never heard of such a thing. This is my second visit here and hey we're just as nice the second time. Phoebe, the barista who creates my drink (with almond milk and Hershey's milk chocolate syrup because it mixes in cold better than the Ghiradelli), said they make their own lavender syrup here from steeped lavender leaves. 

I also had a piece of banana nut bread which was delicious...and HUGE! Easily 2.5, size of Starbucks and 100% tastier. 

This place should definitely warrant a visit or ten. I just moved here from Cali and was looking for an artsy mom and pop place. This is it."}
{"text":"Love it.  We're from Washington state and we were getting desperate to find a real coffee house.   Excellent choice.   I had two shots of perfectly prepared mellow low acid espresso that was presented in an awesome demitasse with an equally awesome soda water \"chaser.\"    The vegan pastry - had given up hope of finding any such thing in Phoenix - was awesome.   My husband is an obnoxious Washington state coffee missionary.   Likes to tell baristas how to make coffee.   No need to do that here.   They've got it down.     Great music.   Interesting indoor/outdoor seating arrangement and the whole place is an excellent use of an old garage.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I LOOOOOVE the environment
There's a clean energy here like none other
Lots of light

Buuuut I have yet to find a drink that I can say is better than average. The coffee is okay. The black tea is subpar. The chai is half decent.

Were it not for the atmosphere here, I'm not sure what I'd come for.

Lux has them beat in taste. But the clean and vibrant vibes here are great."}
{"text":"The owner is awesome, the employees rock, the goods are great, and that's just the inside!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite coffee spot in town. Their coffee is good and they're bagel sandwiches are delicious. My girlfriend and I always stop by if we are in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood coffee house in an interesting neighborhood.  Love their $2 LARGE (very large) green ice teas and that they are very generous with refills.  curry chicken salad sandwich is a tasty lunch on the run and i agree with the cupcake reviews.  (for an interesting meal, walk south a few doors to the frybread house then come back for after-meal coffee at Copper star).  

Sometimes live music on Friday nights.  I am mostly there in the evenings so am not sure of the atmosphere at other times of day."}
{"text":"Copper Star Coffee is not just a run-of-the-mill coffeehouse. It is a quiet and cozy neighborhood centered envirionment that was built on the lot of an newly renovated and converted old gas station. Locally owned, Copper Star is a good place to stop by for your traditional morning cup of joe or your extra particular espresso beverages. Also offering an array of specialty teas and fruit smooties, Copper Star is most notable in my book for their fresh, in house baked goods. I highly reccomend trying one of their frosted cupcakes...scruptious! In a hurry? Call in your order for pick up or use their drive-thru! Free wifi for customer use as well as long couches and lots of natural light, Copper Star is not too big, not too small, and perfect for those who want a mellow, non-pretentious, smoke-free place to drink coffee. 

One gripe: I do not reccomend their Chai tea lattes-- they seem too sweet for some reason. 

I do however, love their mochas and their antioxidant smoothies with pomegranates and Acai."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to add to a review pile-on, especially when all that needs to be said has been said. But in my effort to drink more local coffee, and less of The Siren's, I have to add my oh-two.

I dig Copper Star -- good coffee, friendly crew, a drive through. Heck, one time, I even got a free Powerball ticket there.

I only have one quibble, and it's a small one. I only mention it because I care. It's the excessive and cheesy signage.

I liked the little hand-painted sandwich board, that read, \"drink local coffee.\" It fit perfectly with their local business vibe.

Now that sign has been repainted in a more generic manner, and moved to the side. In its stead is a gigantic white vinyl banner, on it, printed in stark, black, all caps \"DRIVE THRU COFFEE.\"

Gag. 

So now there's the generic sandwich board, the huge banner, the flappy flags, and the neon in the window. 

I understand that they are trying to increase business. But now it's looking like a used car lot, and reeks of desperation. People don't like to patronize desperate business, because it's sad, and makes them feel sad too.

Please, Copper Star, dial it down a notch. Share your message with confidence, but without shouting. We will still love you!

EDIT: OK I stopped by the very next day, and the \"DRIVE THRU COFFEE\" banner was replaced by a huge red banner with all caps white lettering that reads, \"SANDWICH KING OF 7TH AVE.\"

Ulgh."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have used the drive through as well as gone in and they have great brunch/lunch food and good drinks. Their chai is my favorite. They also offer almond milk which I prefer."}
{"text":"chill atmosphere, lots of natural light. the chai is ehh. Wi-Fi kinda slow (several users when I went).
bakery items were good and coffee is good. I go here to study."}
{"text":"It's hard to give them 4 instead of 5 stars, but only because they are great enough to be in the same conversation as Lux, Cartel, Giant, and Lola. What is amazing: service, the baked goods, the location, and the hours (one of the few places open at 6 AM). My only nit-pick is the coffee. It's mild for my taste, so I also add an espresso shot."}
{"text":"Very friendly employees and environment! Seems like everyone knows each other! I ordered a white mocha non fat milk ...tasty and sweet still but to me a little pricey was 5$ for the smaller size. Decent food selection offered.  I didn't try anything myself but someone with me did and enjoyed it. Inside space is a bit small as I  came here to study with a few people and wouldn't recommend going back for study group purposes."}
{"text":"While the scone was delicious the coffee was to be desired and as cool as the place seems you have to know someone behind the counter to get good service.  They had forgotten to make our sandwiches, did apologize and gave us 1 free drink card hmm seems like they could have done better. I don't believe ill be back again too bad some places live by reputation rather than quality!"}
{"text":"Good place for coffee..the Cubano and tuxedo mocha is a must try if you want to try something different"}
{"text":"Pretty nice service however, the drinks were mediocre, leaning more toward bad. The Thai iced tea was not a Thai iced tea I tried before in my favorite place."}
{"text":"Awesome menu! Great variety of drinks, pastries, sandwiches. Amazing service! Love the unique environment. A must stop when we're in the area."}
{"text":"First off, the atmosphere is pretty cool. It has a laid-back and indie kind of vibe going on. Lots of interesting people drinking their coffee, some students, some people having conversation--it's all good. I'm not a person that is bothered by the background noise of a coffee house (in fact, the noise helps me focus), hence why I frequent them to study. So why the three-star rating?

Atmosphere aside, this place was a little odd. It kind of feels like a sideshow of sorts and coffee house awkwardly pieced together....

1. When I walked up to the display counter I checked out the various muffins and cookies (which are monstrous). I placed an order for a mocha and then asked the person upfront what one of the cookies were, as there was no label for them. She looked at them, looked surprised and said that she didn't know and would have to ask someone to find out. Then she stood there and stared at me. After a few seconds she asked me if I wanted something. \"Um.....yeah, I wanted to know what kind of cookie that is so I can figure out if I want to buy it...??\" Duh. Seriously? Are you not going to sell me the cookie? Am I crazy to expect that you'll ask someone next to you if you don't know? Strange. 

2. The place was eerily quiet when I first sat. No music. No loud voices---people were basically quiet and doing their own thing, surprisingly. (usually there is that ONE loud person). But then something in the air stirred and this guy starts playing the trombone... okay, not bad (a little odd of an instrument choice, but I won't judge. Also, the jazzy music was pretty cool to study to.)...then another guy picks up a harmonica and mic....hmmm, interesting. Kind of folky, not bad....Annnddd then this guy starts singing and playing a guitar. Ok, seriously? Trombone, harmonica and guitar? And it seems like they are all playing three different songs. I pull up the coffee shop's website, nope, this little \"musical adventure\" is not listed on their calendar. So can random people play live music whenever or was I just privy to a special random performance? I mean it was around 4pm on a Sunday, so I wasn't expecting there to be any kind of live entertainment. 

Also, the disjointed music has now become a distraction (see, I've lost all concentration to study and started writing this review instead ::sigh::). 

3. Parking: there are like four parking spots? You have to park on the neighborhood side streets--not sure if there's a permit requirement or a free-for-all. So park at your own risk. 

4. On the plus side, the mystery cookie was pretty tasty and the coffee wasn't bad. I got the lavender mocha, it didn't really have any lavender taste (maybe they forgot it?), but I liked that it wasn't overtly sweet or syrupy. 

Overall, I'm not that impressed. If you're going to have live music--cool, just let your future patrons know through your website or some kind of sign. Also, your staff needs to get it together a little. They just seem like they're floating around, just hanging out behind the counter a little clueless."}
{"text":"Cute indie coffee shop. Nice staff. Usually get a drink to go but today decided to sit and take it in. Comfy place overall, but very weird use of space? There are two huge couches in the middle of the seating area- which essentially makes it so there is less seating overall. I'm not sure about you- but it exceeded my comfort level to sit on a couch in the middle of two strangers. Also- the purple couch has A LOT of city miles on it. Might be time
To retire it."}
{"text":"Coffee and food are always great. Can't always connect to the Wi-Fi though. Love this spot otherwise. Good vibes"}
{"text":"Local First!!!  I is small but there is always a few local neighborhood regulars there and is becoming quite the gathering place for those that live in the area..."}
{"text":"I really like that this place has a drive-thru.  Coffee is good and for the value, the sandwich was great as well.

I'll be back to enjoy this great locally owned business."}
{"text":"An awesome coffee shop! Good for going to study for a long time, meeting friends to talk, or listening to live music (Sundays). This is the main place I go to study, they have enough space to spread out and you can stay as long as you want. Very friendly staff!

They have very good ice coffee and drip with good cappuccinos as well. One of there best things is there baked goods, which are freshly made in-house every morning. (On your first visit they will give you any baked item for free). They have only a few food items, (bagel sandwich, vegan plate, curry salad/ wrap, hummus plate) but they are also all made in-house and very delicious. All prices are very reasonable. A coffee shop you need to check out in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The exposed wall and industrial-like atmosphere is nice. 

The coffee is good. 

The best thing about this place is the staff. Unlike the majority of independent coffee shops, they are extremely friendly and helpful.

I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience there. While I was waiting for my food, I noticed a couple of items just sitting there and I'd heard them calling names so people could pick up their orders. No one ever asked my name so I asked a woman working there how do I get my order. She very shortly said it'll be coming. I asked if I could get my iced tea first and she slammed her hand down on the counter and said very nastily we have many kinds of teas. I'm 61 and have never had this bad an experience. No matter how busy you are, if you can't treat customers professionally and cordially, maybe you need a different job."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a perfect place to study (which is what I am doing) to just chill. Great coffee, super chill at atmosphere and workers. Great baked goods and food is quick."}
{"text":"Finally took a walk over to this place after living down the street for 1.5 years. Great selection of drinks, including non-coffee items, and an assortment of pastries and bagel sandwiches. Friendly, attentive staff even offered us free pastries to welcome us on our first visit. The seating area is larger than I'd guessed based on the size of the building, and the drive thru stayed pretty busy. Great neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"I went to Copper Star for my first time today. I love the laid back environment. The Barista was more than welcome to give me some recommendations when I told her it was my first time and even gave me a free pastry for my first visit. I had the Cubano iced and it was delicious!!. I definitely recommend this place to coffee lovers and for people that want to try something new and creative."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really nice. Love the outdoor patio with the metal art and concrete/bottle table. Nice change from the chain coffee shop. Customers very friendly and talkative. My drink tasted yummy but it wasn't frozen enough otherwise I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite coffee joint! I go at least once a week. 

The local hot spot hosts an assortment of amazing coffee choices, pastries and a couple of sandwiches in a relaxed, but thriving atmosphere. My coffee drink of choice is a 24 oz iced vanilla latte with only 2 pumps of vanilla and almond milk.

The staff and owner are super friendly, inquiring about your day and genuinely caring about every customer that walks through their door. It didn't take them long to learn my name and know my order, which creates an even better customer experience.

There is no going back to large coffee chains for me. If you are around this area of town, please stop in for a delicious coffee and sweet treat! Don't forget to ask for a punch card as well...you will be back."}
{"text":"I have mixed experiences here at Copper Star.  Overall, it's a really nice, hipster coffee place where I can study a bit and surf the webs.  

I can't offer feedback on the coffee because I'm a tea drinker.  It's the monster, refillable iced teas that keep me coming back.  They have several to choose from, and are very generous with the servings.  This is a very good thing in the summer time.  

The pastries are freakin' awesome.  Love the baked goods, except maybe for the bagels.  They're just ok.  Otherwise, if you love a great muffin, they have 'em.

The lunch items are a weak point.  I've eaten lunch here a few times, and I was never satisfied on any occasion.  The first time, they didn't have the ingredients necessary to make the meal, and tried to concoct some frankenwich that was just odd.  I ended up swapping it out for hummus plate that was just- meh.  The second time, I ordered the turkey sub. Again- meh.  Today, the veggie sandwich.  It wasn't very good, and it didn't have the same ingredients listed on the menu.  Also, the lunches don't come with chips or salads or any type of side.  Go elsewhere for food.

Other than that, it's a great place to chill out and study.  It's also a nice stop-in while I get my dog grooomed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year now, and it has become my favorite neighborhood coffee shop. Between excellent service, delicious coffee, and a great patio, this has become a weekly must for me. The only things that would makes it better would be a proper bike rack and regular vegan pastry options."}
{"text":"The coffee is good, the sandwiches are great and the cupcakes are amazing! It's hit or miss on seating. I have know some people who have had a hard time connecting to their wifi but I haven't had any problems."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ambiance of this coffee shop and the lavender mocha is a dream. Their drinks are fast but sometimes their food takes a long time. 

My biggest thing though is that the staff/customer service is very hit or miss. Sometimes they are very friendly and pleasant. Other times they just stare at you and wait for you to say what you want. Today however they were really rude and literally slammed their hand on the counter when my mom politely asked if her iced tea was coming, which was taking an unreasonable time to get. The behavior was very uncalled for, obnoxious, unwarranted, and off putting. It made me sad to see, since I'm a regular and like to shop local, but think I'll go to starbucks next time."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for the more mature, laid back version of Lux, I come to Copper Star. Coffee is not as good but service is great and place is inviting. Great neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"Pure perfection! I highly recommend the Iced Cubano and Breakfast Bagel sandwich. 
Goodbye Starbucks... Hello Copper Star!"}
{"text":"I love that this is an old gas station.  Hooray for recycling buildings into something new rather than tearing them down.  I've been a fan of this place since it opened.  Today I tried the applesauce spiced vegan cupcake, and it was pretty amazing.  You should try it too!"}
{"text":"I like the creativity of using the old gas station for \"drive thru coffee\". People are nice, coffee is good, and the wifi is free so overall, this place works. Good place to grab coffee before or after class or to do homework, for those who are GCU students. The Americano is always a good option if you're not sure what to get."}
{"text":"We had the best experience at this funky, friendly little coffee shop in the Melrose neighborhood of Phoenix! The staff was so kind, and appreciated that we brought our own coffee cups. They gave us a free pastry since it was our first time in (haven't eaten it yet, but it looks like a mighty fine Cranberry Pecan Scone). We got a breakfast bagel (sesame bagel, honey ham, egg, no cheese), and it was delicious. The coffee is great & is doing its job as we're on the road to Cali. We will definitely be back the next time we're coming through PHX!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite coffee spots in the valley! Copper Star is very chill, down to earth, & has the smoothest coffee! My favorite drink is the cubano hands down!"}
{"text":"Always enjoyed my coffee and service here. They make a great blended caramel coffee. Service could be a tad faster. Still 5 stars"}
{"text":"Another yelper mentioned their litmus test of basic coffee to see how good the joint is. My personal test is a white mocha/velvet/whateverplacescallmydecadentescapeinacupthatsbadformeandIdon'tcare. It is very easy to get a poorly poured, improperly mixed, poorly portioned white mocha, either bitter, too sweet, etc etc. Every time I came into Copper Star, it's perfect. If I am away from my house, this is where I go."}
{"text":"Really liked the vibe at copper star cafe. It's a hidden gem in my opinion. It has an authentic coffee shop feel. It does not feel like several other coffee shops in the valley which are trying to be hipster. Copper star coffee is hipster! The live music was awesome. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Staff is friendly, customers are friendly. Even made a new friend. One of the best coffee shops in the valley."}
{"text":"First time today and will not be the last. Friendly and that counts during a morning rush. Thanks !"}
{"text":"First time at this cafe and loved it! Coffee was great, staff super friendly, inviting and comfortable ambiance. Already looking for an excuse to stop by again."}
{"text":"It's an okay coffee shop, they have wifi but didn't take advantage of it.. Kinda mellow but nothing amazing as far as ambiance goes. The mocha was decent, not spectacular. Since I live downtown I probably will go check out Cartel or Jobot if I really need my coffee fix. Both are closer and probably feel and look cleaner than this joint, they should air it out a little bit..smelt kind of ripe mixed with the coffee beans lol ..just saying!

3 stars"}
{"text":"i've been to copper star since it first opened, pre-yelp days for me and my locavore ways were still being established but eversince my first copper star experience I've been in love with this coffeehouse. I just love their place, the former gas station turned coffeehouse makes this place as one of the places i bring out of town guests to show them that Phoenix does have its little gems and 7th ave or \"melrose\" is just quaint. Anywho, I've had good chai here, and yummy creamy nonfat vanilla lattes but only recently did I try a pastry treat. The lady behind the counter was a sweetheart and she made me feel extra special when she liked my \"human\" shirt and asked who designed it... yes that day i was proud to be a Gay Black Woman... as my shirt starts off with. I bought myself the nonfat vanilla latte with carrot cake cupcake that had what seemed was an extra dollop of cream cheese frosting, DeLISH! it was truly carrotrific, and the cupcake provided a great sweetness kick to go with my extra caffeinated beverage. Copper Star may not be a Lux with it's urban chic interior, or the real bohemian interior of Lola on Roosevelt or the hipster cool of Cartel in Tempe, no, Copper Star is simply cool with its venue and hold its own with its great drinks, coffees and treats, so hence Copper Star is truly a coffeehouse star!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Just moved to this area from California not too long ago and I'm stoked Copper Star Coffee exists. I'm pretty basic when it comes to a cup of Joe, but I know what I like, and this place has it. The fact that you can drive through is amazing, and the inside is really cool too. It has a hip, if not classic \"coffee shop\" vibe, but cozy and inviting all at the same time. The menu isn't overwhelming, has all the classics you expect at a great coffee spot, with some specialty items as well (the lavender mocha is pretty awesome). 

I recommend. Convenient, quality coffee and great service."}
{"text":"Fun place. Cute, hip environment!  There is a very competitive coffee environment in downtown (between Lola, Lux, Giant, Fair Trade, Hob Nobs, JoBot, etc.)- but they are definitely making their mark! A relaxed place to hang out, talk or study. It has more of a \"rustic\" feel than some other coffee shops. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Phoenix's Encanto District. Whenever I'm back in town visiting my parents, it's a pleasure to come back to Copper Star Coffee.

Part of the reason to head to Copper Star is the ambiance: it's a converted vintage gas station with a quirky, welcoming feel. Light streams in through the glass-paneled garage door and, with the cafe's tall ceilings, the space feels at once very large and very cozy. I've come here to work in the past, but unlike some coffee shops, Copper Star is never completely overrun by laptops. There are always pairs or groups of friends here having a good time. Nevertheless, if productivity is what you want, the shop is never too loud, there's free WiFi, and there are a couple plugs along the west wall. I've definitely had some productive afternoons tinkering away at one of their long communal tables. 

The quality of service at Copper Star has consistently been excellent. The folks are nice, approachable, and ready to help, and interacting with them has always been a joy. The coffee is good -- I'm a no-fuss, black coffee girl, but trust them about the iced cappuccino on really hot days -- and, if you're more of a tea person, they're one of the few places nearby that stock Harney & Sons, one of my favorite tea blenders in the US. I've had a couple pastries and the veggie sandwich, and they were delicious.

In sum: If you're a Phoenician in need of a charming, quality coffee shop in your neighborhood to spend time with friends or solo, go to Copper Star.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"This was only my second time at Copper Star Coffee. Both times I used their drive thru. I'm not really a coffee drinker, but sometimes I crave some sort of sweet & delicious coffee concoction! Because I am not an avid coffee drinker, I left it up to the barista. She made a delicious drink for me & I asked her how I should order it the next time I came. She said it was a \"Dulce de Leche iced latte, with 4 shots of espresso\". I was very thankful. 
Today, I left the house craving that same drink.  I sat in the drive thru for a bit & this woman comes out so I asked if I can have an \"Iced Dulce de Leche latte\". I fumbled my words a bit & she gave me a squished up, disgruntled look & said, like a complete bitch, \"You want an iced dulshaylaayche latte?\" Totally making fun of the way I messed up my words. So I repeated syllable by syllable & she still had that stupid condescending squinty look on her face & said \"So you mean CARAMEL?!\". I had enough. I wasn't there to be belittled by a miserable woman who clearly hates her job. I understand that coffee is her first language, but it isn't mine. I am a customer & I shouldn't be made to feel like I am an inconvenience to your place of business by ordering a basic iced latte. I told her to forget about it & started to pull away. Of course her snarled lips & squinty, annoyed face immediately dropped and she started telling me to stay. Too little, too late, you miserable woman. Find a new job."}
{"text":"I've written other reviews in the past and I have contributed MANY pics (one of a frozen fountain went viral in my FB purview). I've been a patron since they opened their doors. It took them a while, and I remember driving past every day to work, south on 7th, on my way to my position of public service (as a dedicated state employee) watching that sign (opening soon) for months and months wondering WHEN they would finally open.

Anyway, I noticed a couple of less than favorable reviews in Yelp and though I dont challenge their accuracy, and though there are MANY excellent 5 star reviews I feel compelled to reiterate some observations.

The owner (and his Board of Director(s)) rescued a dilapidated gas station and invested money to redeem and try to retain the integrity of the neighborhood feel of the original building.

The bathrooms have some interesting design, by a local. (I had started a list of PHX bathrooms of note on Foursquare and then got distracted -- the former Florist and the former/current Christopher's had some interesting ones.)

The bakers in the past AND present have/do all create delightful confections (though I continue to petition for more savory).

The interior ambiance is sufficient. And has gone through some changes over time to meet the whims of customers and ownership.

The landscape is maintained by a local who is also a patron.

The cute little fireplace is stoked by a local, whenever he chooses to come by, and feels like doing it.

This is a dog friendly place and I love all the dogs that frequent it.

The owner...he cares about what he does and he is quite engaged in his neighborhood and his community. This coffee shop, this project, is something he CHOOSES to do. He is supported by his Board of Director(s) because of the service this small business contributes to others.

So, remember that there are NO automatons here. What is here is a choice, despite health, wealth, hassle, obstruction or disappointments.

Thank you to the staff, management, operations, ownership (and Board of Directorship) for keeping on--keeping on."}
{"text":"The setting is very cool and the coffee is good. The ONLY reason I gave it three stars is that there were so many flies inside, we finally took our drinks and left. My friend and I hadn't seen each other in awhile and we were looking forward to spending some time talking and chilling, but the utterly annoying flies landing on every exposed part of us every other minute made enjoyment impossible. I have no idea if this is normal here, and I apologize if it's not...but it certainly was the day we decided to visit."}
{"text":"DANG IT! my cubano was so good!! 

it was recommded to me by the carhop. i wanted something on the sweeter side that was also strong. this came with 2 shots of espresso, cinnamon and milk. it was perf.

i also liked the car hop. he was so cool. i told him it was my first time so he did jazz hands as a welcome. 

i also picked up a chai latte for my friend and she said it was amazeballs."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this small coffee shop.  The espresso had a nice smooth flavor.  The space is very cool, and the environment is very laid back.  I went on open mic night.  Had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Eeeeeeeee.  Fool me once, shame on me.  Fool me twice, shame on me, yet again.  I keep wanting to love Copper Star for many reasons, but just can't get over that one major issue I have each time.

Upon giving Copper Star another shot, met with the same results we were.  I guess it should be a hint when a coffee shop gets awarded Best of Phoenix for their muffins and baked goods, but never a mention about the coffee?  That's kind of how it feels here.

The baked goods are quite good.  The cupcakes and muffins are very fresh, almost shockingly.  The place itself is quaint, delightful and has a very neat look - great idea with the gas station theme.  Coffee itself though, I could do without.  Automatic pulled shots that were well over 40 seconds.  Cappuccino that wavered between watery and milky, to a faint, faint background of burnt-roast-taste.

CSC is probably one of the better places to get a baked good in town.  If coffee is really your thing though, head east a half mile."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, cool staff. Really artistic inside and the place use to be a gas station. 

On your first visit you get a free pastry and they are amazing!! 

I highly recommend it.  Don't know why this place doesn't have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"wish they had a 10 star button. What a great place. great staff and great drinks. oh and you have to try their cinnamon rolls...............OMG good...great atmosphere just a great staff."}
{"text":"Came by with my boyfriend, who is here visiting from Canada, and we ordered our drinks and cinnamon roll just to find out it's their 11 year anniversary so FREE DRINKS!!!! Wowza. This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"5 stars for aesthetics alone. kudos to copper star for beautifying a former gas station. They always have interesting art and cool vibes. Good place to get work done."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I come here everyday for coffee... just about:)  The staff is very nice, they get to know their customers and remember their drinks.  They start making my coffee before i even say a word.  On saturdays and sundays i will indulge in the various flavors of croissants or scones and they are so delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Customer service is amazing and the coffee exceptionally flavorful and tastes like how coffee should taste."}
{"text":"My fave coffee shop in Phoenix! They make their own chai and it's DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"\"Buy Local Coffee\" is what a sign out front of this establishment says.  So that's what I did.  I went to Copper Star Coffee to get my drink of choice, an iced coffee with cream.  I enjoyed the flavor.  It was better than Starbucks and quite a few cents cheaper.  SCORE!!!  I became a regular.  I stuck with my ice coffee for months but their bakecase was calling my name every time I would enter.  I found out Copper Star bakes their own pastries fresh daily.  Another SCORE!!!  No preservatives or high fructose corn syrup.  I started adding a scone with my iced coffee.  They have chocolate chip, lemon, blueberry, etc.  Delicious!!!  The apple sauce spice cake is now my favorite.  It is a vegan pastry.  It is flavorful and the glaze is so slight but fantastic.  Not a vegan by the way.  

I have been slowly branching out among the Copper Star menu.  Try the Black Cherry Limeade.  The specialty coffee drinks are quite good too.  The blended toffee drink rocks.  The antioxidant smoothie is refreshing.  The other smoothies are okay.  They use syrup in those.  I don't know how healthy that makes them.  (Real fruit please).

Let's talk about their sandwiches now shall we.  I have tried their sesame tuna, the curry chicken, the deviled egg salad, and the veggie.  All of them are winners.  You wont be disappointed.  Copper Star just unveiled there new sub sandwiches as well.  They use a local butcher's sausages for their subs.  Awesome.  Way to keep it in the community.

-internet access
-community board
-art work
-misters for the heat
-water bowl for dogs
-drive thru car hop service
-frequent customer stamp card

The Copper Star building is an old service station cleverly gutted out and made super cool.  The staff is great and they stick around.  Not a high turn over.  It must be a great place to work.

Parking can be tricky.  The majority of the parking is on the street and the parked customer cars creep into the surrounding neighborhood.  You may have a little walk.  Big Woop!

A must.  Check it out."}
{"text":"It's my first time here and I'm definitely coming back! It's a cute little coffee shop, great space for studying and/or meeting someone to catch up. The coffee is AMAZING and I had a chocolate coconut scone that was super yummy! I love the vibe this coffee spot has and the employees were great! I had mentioned to the cashier that it was my first time here and she gave me my scone for free! Such a nice gesture especially when I was only planning on grabbing a coffee with plans to study! I got a 16 oz iced Tuxedo with almond milk.  I LOVE that they have alternative options to milk. She warned me that if I was vegan the powder in the tuxedo wasn't all vegan which I appreciated because if I was vegan I would want to know that.  Overall awesome experience and cool retro with a modern twist coffee shop vibe!! I just heard someone order a breakfast sandwich I definitely will have to try one next time! They have punch cards and they have a drive thru! Even though I really would recommend stepping inside and taking a look around!"}
{"text":"Copper star has the best chai tea lattes, and they don't charge extra for soy milk."}
{"text":"This local Coffee shop is just a few blocks from where I live. I'm not that hard to please. I simply want good service and fabulous coffee. I get both at this place. Love the free wifi. Sometimes I go here just to get away and catch up with online stuff/emails. Give it try. ~X~"}
{"text":"I am always...always...{did I mention ALWAYS} on the hunt for a perfect cup of coffee? 

So when we walked in, not only was there quaint patio seating, the inside of the shop with cozy AND there was a band playing!  On a weekend morning...When does that even happen? ...in real life?

Right, back on track, the coffee -- today I got a cold brew -- and you know  good cold brew (for me anyway) only requires a little bit of cream, or dairy of choice, for it to perfectly balance and they hit it SPOT ON.

The baristas were so relaxed {coffee shop vibes} and quick. My fellow coffee consumers were either studying, relaxing and listening to the music or outside socializing.  There was no rush from anyone..it was perfect.

For the people looking for the perfect place to socialize without a hustle bustle of traffic or people, this is your gem. 

//cheers//"}
{"text":"Loved my cappuccino and gluten free muffin, delish, comfy couches and free wifi, very clean, friendly staff. Really nice experience. It's right next to Wagnwash on 7th ave. Gluten free muffin tasted like a regular delicious muffin"}
{"text":"This is nice, lil coffee bar, good to study, bcz their music isn't too loud and if is it, they can turn it down for u. Also they do have a great coffee, is strong and tasty, better that in starbucks. The people that comes here is a lil bit different from other coffees that I like to go, but the ambient is quite and relaxing.... I WOULD SAY YES COME HERE AND ENJOY A GOOD COFFEE, STUDY AND HAVE A CONVERSATION BCZ IT IS NICE!!!"}
{"text":"It's like Lux, but smaller, and that's ok. Cool vibe, good coffee."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I've been searching for the best chai latte in town and I think I've found it here. It's a delicious fresh blend they make themselves. Just the right amount of spicy and sweet. The manager who served me was super nice and I even received a complimentary muffin because it was my first time here! how cool is that! I love the vibe in this place as well. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"By far one of the most original ideas for a coffee shop. Good atmosphere and local art on display. The coffee? Delish with a hint of awesome. Highly recommended. By me. Because that's what I do."}
{"text":"I'd definitely come back here if I lived closer... Really cute, welcoming atmosphere and good prices.  The iced tea comes in an enormous cup with free refills.  I try to avoid evil styrofoam so I asked for it in the somewhat smaller plastic cup, which was like a normal Large.  The guy charged me half the price and still gave a free refill (I can't believe I finished the first one but it was really good iced tea!).  There was a cut-up chocolate cupcake at the register for people to sample, which tasted like a rich brownie.  All of the cupcakes and other desserts looked homemade and delicious but sadly I had to refrain.  The street parking wasn't bad when I was there - no meters to worry about, at least."}
{"text":"I truly regret having to post this review. I'm giving this place five stars, so it doesn't negatively affect the score. However, there is one employee in particular who I've just reached my limit with. The only reason I'm complaining about him on here is out of a concern for the shop's well-being. I fear that if a customer were to come to Copper Star for the first time when he is working they would form an entirely inaccurate opinion of this wonderful place. 

I don't know his name, but he is usually there for closing shifts. He has a septum piercing, and tends to wear a look on his face of utter disdain every time I step through the door. 

As a fellow barista: I get it. Dealing with the public can be rough. Therefore, when I interact with anyone in customer service I'm extremely tolerant of grumpiness. People have bad days. That being said, this particular barista has NEVER been pleasant out of the upwards of five times that I have been to the shop while he's working. 

I truly, truly love this place and hope that this review is understood purely to be an effort to help. The pastries are amazing, and literally every other barista is fantastic."}
{"text":"Get the cubano! This place is great and local. Drive thru has a rustic feel as the location once served as a gas station. 5 copper stars!"}
{"text":"Best coffee, speedy service, and everyone is in a great mood. I love stopping here."}
{"text":"One of those small places that can really hold its own. Parking is very limited and they share a very small lot, so there is the luck factor if you're driving in. The decor and atmosphere is great. Such a neighborhood coffee shop. I ordered a caramel blended drink and it was REALLY good. Totally recommend and worth every star."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to post a review for this location for some time now. Better late than never, right ? I give this place a hands down 5 stars mostly because of the interaction I witnessed between the owner and his customers one morning. Nice guy! I am not a ritual coffee drinker, but this place is in my hood and it has such a relaxed feel to it. I can tell you guys that the few times I have ordered a coffee at Copper Star I didn't need a nap that day. If I drink coffee it's not for the flavor but because I have stuff I want/need to get done that day. It worked."}
{"text":"I tend to be in the group that's more lukewarm about this place. It's not bad by any means at all. I love the location and the set-up of the place, but I don't think their pastries and non-coffee drinks are anything special. I don't drink coffee, so I guess I'm missing half of what they have to offer. Regardless, this is a great place to go chill and have a conversation at.

This place is five blocks from my house and I really should make a habit of coming here a bit more. I tend to hit up Lux more often, but I think this place offers a more homey feel. Lux is cool, but ultimately you feel like you're eating/drinking in an art space and Copper Star is more of a place to get cozy and do your homework over a cup of tea. Anyway, definitely check this place out because it's become a fixture of sorts in the upper central part of downtown and on First Fridays."}
{"text":"A neat local Phoenix coffee shop. Adding to the charm, it used to be a full-service gas station. Now it's a delicious little coffee shop that has car hops. These nice gals will take your order and bring you delicious, tasty caffeinated beverages. And homemade pastries and muffins to go along with. Don't forget the Italian sodas!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, wonderful food and an awesome staff.  One of my favorite coffee shops, if not my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is quite a drive from where I am but I don't even mind. We came here after a friend of mine recommended that I go check it out since I absolutely love all things coffee! My wife and I decided to go one day after craving a nice iced coffee other than the usual chain spots. We were greeted as soon as we walked up to the counter and we ordered our coffees. We were told that we could have a free pastry each since it was our first time which was awesome. I chose the rice crispy treat (my favorite) which was gooey and delicious. I love the vibe here is laid back and chill. I highly recommend anybody who loves coffee and a cool environment to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Now my favorite coffee shop! House coffee is always hot and fresh - something missing from most neighborhood coffee shops, unfortunately. I enjoyed a scone - best scone I've had in a long time - dry, as it should be - not soggy/soft as is my typical experience at other shops. Relaxing, comfortable atmosphere - attracts a mature crowd - which I like. College kids are in the minority - which is great! And, finally, the staff is super nice and attentive - something missing from 80% of all shops."}
{"text":"I loved the environment (quiet and sleek) and the coffee was good enough, but Copper Star's free wireless internet was completely maddening. I'd hoped to do some work, but an endless parade of disconnects drove me to more friendly internet confines at Lola's, which was a shame, because I wanted a sandwich."}
{"text":"First impression: holy crap, this Cubano and brownie are A-MAZING! There's an eclectic vibe in here, with music playing that adds to the ambience but is not too loud to have a conversation, local art is for sale on one wall, and then there is random art and a mixture of large tables, bar stools, tables for 2, and a couple couches. Definitely a unique place to hang with friends and enjoy a cup of great coffee!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick coffee and pastry. 

Amazing coffee, best I've had in some time, and coffee is literally all I drink. The blueberry muffin was fantastic as well.

Very, very pleasant staff. Great, quick service and no attitude. 

Cool location, both outdoor and indoor seating with some great art. Reasonable prices.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5 Stars. A real, true, legitimate coffee shop!

What I Liked: Coffee was decent (ordered an Iced Mocha). The fresh-out-of-the-oven Cheese Danish was AMAZING though...and definitely worth a trip back. The atmosphere was peaceful, the staff was friendly, and I LOVE that they bake their own goods in-house (a rarity these days).

Room For Improvement: The coffee was decent...it was good...but I was hoping for outstanding. I prefer a stronger, smokier roast. Also, the wi-fi was deplorable. It was beyond intermittent--it would be on for one minute, then off for 5. Very frustrating.

Overall: If they improved their internet, and I ordered stronger drinks from them, then Copper Star is/would be the perfect coffee shop. I'm a fan; if you live anywhere nearby, you owe it to yourself to frequent this place. ...Why can't we have a real coffee shop like this in Ahwatukee!?!"}
{"text":"I spent 5 weeks out of the country and the first place I spent money upon my return is this home away from home. It's a great location, yummy products, priced right, and a fabulous staff!"}
{"text":"I'm okay with this spot.  First and foremost, thank you to the employee who (when she found out it was my first time stopping in) gave me my lavender mocha on the house.  That sort of friendliness and service is what many places lack!!! This place has the potential to be great.  I liked the music variety overhead, and the variety of small and large tables. And, of course, the staff was super chill, which is always a good thing.

The downsides: it had a funky smell.  I am not sure if it was the open kitchen concept - but it wasn't a familiar or the most pleasant smell.  Unfortunately, one of the coffee house guests was singing to himself (he has every right to! and this isn't the coffee houses job to tell him otherwise!), but it just disrupted my steady study mode... I will add that their restroom was not horrible, but it also wasn't as neat as I usually like to tolerate - it could use some fixin' up.

However, it's cool. The lavender mocha was more legit than I expected (I have never had a lavender drink in my life), and their baked goods looked amazing - try the no-bake cookie (but share it with a friend!)"}
{"text":"We used to love Copper Star. The owner Bill is fantastic and we wish him all the best. Unfortunately for the last six months almost every one of our orders came out wrong. Either something is missing from the order, wrong bagel or wrong sandwich, iced instead of hot, etc. The food is very good and when the coffee is what we ordered, excellent. At this point we have to try a new coffee shop. We have tried for months with Copper Star but now we feel like the staff is on pins and needles with us because of the past mistakes. This is uncomfortable and quite frankly there are too many options in Phoenix to be dissatisfied. Maybe someday we will go back but not for a while."}
{"text":"Stopped into this super cute shop Sunday morning for a coffee and a bagel. The staff was very attentive, the coffee was piping hot and delicious, the sesame bagel
They toasted for me was bit short on cream cheese and overall I had a wonderful experience. I will be coming here on a regular basis now that I live on this side of town!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  It's located in a converted gas station. I ordered the tuxedo mocha (normally I am a strict coffee only guy) it was amazing. Not too sweet. My wife only gets nonfat lattes but the foam on her latte was thick and creamy. We also got a molasses cookie that was soft, chewy and delicious.  I cannot wait to get back to that side of town.  It was a perfect little coffee date place."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, cool decor, good iced tea and iced chai, great bagels and tasty cupcakes!  I had some trouble logging onto their WiFi, but my computer tends to be petulant."}
{"text":"What a charming little coffee shop! I'm in love! I recently moved into the neighborhood with my boyfriend and we are so excited to be spending time here! The venue is nostalgic of times long gone, the baristas are so nice and so helpful, the bathrooms are always clean and the product is tasty! Best of all *drum roll please* DOG FRIENDLY PATIO! I will definitely be frequenting this place- if you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Copper Star is a drive-thru and sit-down coffee shop that serves locally roasted, fresh, hot coffee, frozen coffee drinks, smoothies and fresh baked goods. They also have a few sandwiches and a delicious hummus plate that comes with kalamata olives and warm pita bread. I think they now have a daily homemade soup as well. And during the last holiday season, the owners wife was spotted making homemade pumpkin pies! I don't think anything on the menu is more than $5.50. 

Nice atmosphere, not too crowded, not too loud. Free wifi - the password is on the wall above the hallway to the restrooms. A great neighborhood place to hang out, but you can also drive through. Great service. Cheerful staff. Delicious goods. And you can feel good about supporting local business instead of a huge soulless chain. The owner, Bill, is super friendly.

My one gripe is they have had the same two couches and red lounge chairs pretty much since they opened, but I don't think they have EVER cleaned them. They now look disgustingly filthy and I'm always shocked when I see someone actually go sit down at them. I can't sit over there, I have to keep to the wood chairs and tables. I go to Copper Star once a week, but the filth on the fabric covered seating is grossing me out enough that I may reduce my visits until they have the upholstery cleaners come in."}
{"text":"I hate it when I wake up early on a Saturday! I mean, the one day of the week when I don't have to set the alarm and I can sleep as long as I like, and BOOM, wide awake at 7 anyway! Theoretically, I know I should be take advantage of the cooler morning temperatures and mow my lawn, but that's what Sundays are for, right? If you ask me, Saturday mornings are much better suited for relaxing and sipping coffee. Thankfully, I live just down the street from Copper Star Coffee (and luckily for my dog, Copper Star is right next door to Wag 'n Wash). The setup of this place is perfect, super cute converted gas station, and plenty of space on the patio for my pup to play greeter. You can get pretty much any kind of coffee/espresso drink you like, but I really dig the plain 'ol brewed coffee. Oh, and don't get me started on the tasty treats ogling me from their strategic position inside the glass case. The pastries are so yummy and cupcakes are irresistible (and share-with-a-friend-enormous). 
Hmm, on second thought, waking up early on a Saturday may just be my body's way of telling me get to Copper Star before they run out of chocolate raspberry croissants."}
{"text":"Stopped by when I needed to kill time before going back to office and ordered an iced Cubano and a breakfast sandwich.  The Cubano was really good and the customer service was good.  They have free water you can help yourself to and free Wi-Fi.  It can get crowded in the mornings, I was there before 8:30am on a Wednesday and it was a little empty but soon filled up quick with large groups so really wasn't enough space for people wanting to work on laptops afterwards.  I enjoyed the vibe of the place and the espresso so would definitely return if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Great Lavender Coffee. Great vibe to the place. Being my first time there, they gave me a free pastry of choice: a large brownie! If I was from Phoenix, I would def hang out here"}
{"text":"Super friendly people who work here and great coffee! Couldn't ask for better! Much rather give my money to a local small busy owner than a franchise. Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"Best part of this place its in Melrose, my neighborhood. Support local business. Amazing coffee selection and breakfast items. Vegan Bill is yummy, BLT is oh so good (they are very generous with the bacon), and the egg breakfast bagel is yummy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  It may be an acquired taste for Starbucks drinkers such as myself.  I'll admit I usually drink iced NF sugar-free vanilla lattes with whip at Starbucks.  I told the barista and he was very nice about trying to make a similar coffee concoction.  (Are they \"baristas\" everywhere? Sounds so pretentious.) I'd like to say I loved his version but it wasn't as sweet.  (I know, I'm a huge sweet tooth spoiled by corporate coffee peddlers.) My mom usually gets a Venti White Chocolate Frappuccino so the barista whipped up something similar but she also felt hers wasn't sweet enough.  I say hey, check the place out, the atmosphere's GREAT and the staff sure does try but if you like your coffee drinks sweet be forewarned, they may not taste sweet enough."}
{"text":"Super cool spot to get some java and check email. Great prices locally owned. Very cool art work that switches out every month."}
{"text":"Whatever to Copper Star? It used to be so good. The desserts are hit or miss but mostly miss. The outside area is never clean or swept."}
{"text":"Dear Copperstar, I really, really wanna love you... But I can't! 
I've done the drive-thru, to-go and dine-in- once each, and I've been left wanting every time. The place is so cute- chic, trendy, neat eclectic decor that is so in right now. Staff are equally eclectic, laid back and downright adorable. 
Unfortunately, the coffee sucks. Extremely acidic and fruity- just not my style at all, and I'm a Starbucks-everyday kinda girl. I also tried the blackberry-peach muffin and the cashew-white chocolate cookie, and both were over-baked- very dry. Tasty, yes. Yummy, no. 
I was there with a friend who ordered a Thai iced tea, which was mostly milk. After drinking almost half, she went up to the counter to ask for more tea, expecting to pay the 50-cent refill charge. They took her dollar bill, did not apologize for the weak drink and gave her no change.

I'd like to say I'll be back, but I won't, not after 3 disappointing visits. 
I want to support local businesses- but I can't force down stuff that doesn't taste good. :("}
{"text":"Is it possible to have a crush on a coffeeshop?

This place is, by far, my favorite new discovery in ages.  I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in.  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly, so I really wanted to check it out.  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so sooner.

My friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect.  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty.  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks.  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie.  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches!  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future.  Before taking our drinks, my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display; I must admit I drooled a bit.

Because it was such a nice night, we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks.  It wasn't long before more people showed up.  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside.  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier, and I ended up going inside to buy one.  My choices were vanilla, red velvet, lemon, and strawberry (I think).  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable, but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies!  Very nice touch.  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles.  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies.  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happy.

I've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru.  The first time, the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order.  When I told him I didn't, he told me he would give me one, and he did - along with three stamps!  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake.  The smoothie was just as ood as the first, but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti.  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte.  That sucker far surpassed the vanilla lattes I usually get at Starbucks.

I love supporting local businesses, and I'm only too happy to return to Copper Star time and again.  I suggest you do, too!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. So my best friend and I were originally gonna go somewhere else but it was 21 and over and she's not. Then we tried to go to Jobot. But we didn't realize it was First Friday and I didn't want to be in the mix of that. Too busy and too crowded for my liking. Well she found this place. Apparently it used to be a gas station. It looks like it might be drive through. But it's trendy/hipster and I love it. It's a smaller place but that's still cool. Also when it's your first time, you get a free pastry. So that's pretty awesome! I got a chai cupcake and my best friend got a oatmeal cookie. Both of which are big! Lol so I recommend splitting or saving for later. The coffee is good. I got a white mocha iced latte. My best friend doesn't like coffee so she got a coke lol. But it was in one of the older bottles so that was cool. It's in downtown Phoenix but it's not like the most ghetto part of Phoenix either. I was very pleased with my experience here. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to Copper Star Coffee after reading reviews on Yelp.  It wasn't a hard sell because I'm a huge fan of cupcakes.  And many of the reviewers were raving about the cupcakes, so I had to try one.  We both loved the coffehouse.  Great drinks, great prices, and yummmmyyyyy cupcakes.  My boyfriend read his book and I did some work on my laptop.  The environment was cozy and comfortable.  I definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"First time to Phoenix!  Read great reviews about this coffee shop. The mocha lavender is smooth and lives up to the hype!  My first time to this coffee shop, I didn't get a complementary pastry which I read about in a few reviews, however, my tip amount on my credit card transaction was generously changed from $1 to $6. It could just be a mistake or it could be someone fraudulently overcharging manual credit card receipts to cushion tip amounts. Whatever the case, I can't get a reply or response from the management of the shop as phone calls and emails go unanswered. PLEASE REFUND THE TIP AMOUNT as generally I don't tip $6 for a cup of joe, regardless of how delicious it was. Maybe this review will get a reply. I'll copy it so I can post it on every site. Here is to hoping someone resolves the issue. Cheers."}
{"text":"Ok, I tried the drip instead of the espresso this time. It was drinkable. I'm too scarred from the last time I tried the espresso to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Nice place.  I took my whole family on a Saturday night.  Great friendly laid back place.  Try the lavender mocha.  The wait staff even had a nice time helping the staff out with some deliveries."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaaaassss! Amazing customer service, local not conglomerate, best BLT. And the bathrooms are pretty cool too. Parking can be dicey but it's worth looking for a spot."}
{"text":".. it's  an independent coffee shop .. which starts out at 5 stars just for not being Starbucks ! Ok I know sometimes that ain't enough ..  so here we go 

Service - excellent ! Super friendly staff.. did I say super .. yes super friendly staff who try to make it a point to remember your name and even your drinks. I have only been here the mornings and early noon so I'm not sure if they have anything going on at night/ evenings . 

The drinks are great and they are more than willing to listen if you want your drink one way or another. The place is clean and cozy .. which in real estate speak means not the biggest ! :) 

Free wifi , so yayy. Welcoming to anyone and everyone - more win. 

The restrooms are crazy clean and definitely wins for the fact they are comfy and spacious enough to change your clothes in ! ( I come in from work at times and love that I can change my clothes here without feeling crammed ) 

Has a very pleasant wonderful vibe and that alone makes this place 5 star worthy and throw in that service it's like sprinkles on your fav cup cake - just can't be beat. If you live near by you have no excuse to go to star sucks - heck they even have a drive through !"}
{"text":"I love copper star! They have the best earl grey tea ever. It is never bitter. Free refills all day long too! Their cupcakes are also terrific. I have had the strawberry and vanilla cupcakes and they are always moist and delicious."}
{"text":"Check this place out! Great coffee with a friendly staff and cool vibe. Not a hipster coffee house. Just an awesome place to come and grab a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Could be the best Chai Tea Latte we have ever had! Spicy and full of flavor. The Americano was top notch with a very smooth roast. They will also make a Cubano Americano Style or Latte Style. Enjoyed a couple of excellent muffins as well. The staff was super friendly and upbeat. The dinning area was clean with plenty of room to sit or stand."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this coffee shop, I wish I lived closer! The building is adorable (converted gas station), they have free wifi and they are vegan-friendly. I hear wonderful things about their cupcakes, but I haven't checked to see if they carry vegan cupcakes. I did have a vegan apple cinnamon muffin there a while back that was delicious."}
{"text":"Supporting great local small businesses

I have always been a supporter of locally owned small business. So, I am always excited to find new businesses I haven't been to before and Copper Star Coffee was no exception.

Unlike, the chain coffee shops , Copper Star Coffee actually makes you feel welcomed.  The artwork on the walls grabs your attention and gives you something to look at while you wait on some of the  very best coffee you have ever had.  

Trust me, when I say, I love coffee. I am always trying out new coffee spots and Copper Star is serving up some of the very best.  Copper Star has the best Americano, hands down, the perfect mix of rich espresso and a light layer of crema. They also offer a  20 ounce drink sizes, so for the professional coffee drinker.

In addition, to a large variety of coffee and tea, Copper Star has a delicious display of muffins, brownies, scones, cinnamon rolls, cookies, and breakfast sandwiches. On my next visit I'll be sure to try a few.

If you're ever in the neighborhood, please check it out
and unlike that chain coffee shop, this is a local shop and you know you are supporting the local economy.

{"text":"I have driven by this place for years and never stopped in.  Today was finally the day and I can kick myself for what I have been missing.  The drinks are great, and the food is even better.  The atmosphere is really laid back and all the employees really seem to love the place.  I will certainly make this place a regular stop from now on."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and we were looking for coffee and a quick breakfast bite. For the best of both worlds my friend and I split a breakfast bagel and a cinnamon roll. These were topped with a triple espresso. Mmmmmm...hit the spot. I'd take this place any day over starbucks. The interior is comfortable and homey."}
{"text":"Tried an iced cubano, was delicious!

But 3 stars for service---line went slow mostly because of returned food/drinks that were sent out with errors or just completely wrong. Staff was friendly about it, just made things inefficient, & I almost left due to the wait time but glad I stayed because the cubano was tasty. 

Parking was a bit of a hassle too, I had no idea where to park so parked at a business next door.

Might come back...not sure yet."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review from a comfie seat in the Copper Star cafe itself, using its free wifi. For a laptop-wielding downtown resident like myself, outlet accessibility is as important as wifi and this place gets the thumbs up. The owner and staff are very friendly. They seem genuinely delighted to see every customer walk in. The place is fairly packed and I recognize the faces of at least two fellow downtown professionals as I sit here. The coffee is good. The scones are excellent. The ambiance reflects exactly what I look forward to as the future of downtown Phoenix:  scaled down, unpretentious but urban; loft-like bricks and open ductwork. Given its proximity to my home, I'll probably spend many weeknights here when I have late projects."}
{"text":"i absolutely adore this little coffee shop off 7th ave. It can get super busy on the weekends and parking can be a little bit of a hassle however, the employees are wonderful, helpful, and the coffee is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place! The lavender mocha is one of my favorites! The staff is nice always smiling."}
{"text":"I have been in super lock down mode for school work as this semester wraps up, and I got to really take a tour of this place while I worked here-I moved three times!

Yes really!

I got a ride here while my friend did a study group at ASU so I could give Lux a break and got down to laptopping and reading after buying a very good decaf soy latte. I settled down into my table and noticed the place didn't have a lot of buzz for a Friday during the day. 

About two hours into my work, a woman came in for a book signing wearing an unironic fanny pack and I moved so she could have the table.

Then I moved to the sofa but was distracted by the perfectly coifed guy on the sofa wearing a silk button down shirt a la most graduation photos circa 1993 kept muttering to himself how to improve his writing quite theatrically. 

I moved to another table when my laptop needed another boost from the outlet but then had a very harley davidson old man with what seemed like his granddaughter but looked like a runaway from Suicide Girls, pre-teen edition (she was wearing short shorts with thigh high socks and a big baggy sweatjacket-it was like 30 degrees out!) sat at the end while waiting for their orders to come though.

Finally, I ended up in the corner red chair to plug in again and my friend met up and we got another coffee and a snack. By that point, the place was starting to get packed and a family now at the table literally in front of me, the guy kept talking about his body-building competition, what he knew about computers, hooters (to which he talked about to his wife's PARENTS) forever forever forever forever....

We had to go after that and escaped to Lux.

The place itself is fine, the coffee and treats have been solid, but the people here are really distracting to me-therefore, it drops a star as a place to concentrate and do work.

Sorry! And I really hope that body building competition in two weeks gives you a chance to build some more bod to impress the waitresses at Hooters!"}
{"text":"We had a 2-for-1 print out, good for up to $6.00, so we decided to come here for lunch and get sandwiches last Saturday.  On the menu board, there were 3 post-its on it saying \"Out of Sandwiches\". They told us that they stop serving sandwiches later in the day, so we ate some where else.
We decided to return the next day on Sunday, and the same 3 post-its were on the menu board again! We were not happy! We got there earlier than we did on Saturday. This time they told us that they are out of a lot of the items that are needed to make sandwiches, & they are awaiting their shipment. But they said that they could only make us Tuna Sandwiches...So we went ahead & got that.
This left us with a bad impression about this place & will most likely not return.

In the mean time, while we were in line....2 more customers walked in & noticed the post-its, too....They turned around & walked out.  Apparently, they are losing business by not having there 'shipment'. 
...The tuna sandwiches were quite dry, & not much flavor...

(....Hmmm, maybe they should just stick to coffee, cookies, & muffins.)"}
{"text":"Cool place, great service,  was loomlking forward to the lavender coffee /late and was terribly dissapointed,  there was no lavender taste to be detected.  Sigh"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time this week I had this delicious coffee. Great place especially for a mom on the go! Cubano latte and the pastries were amazing. The girls at the drive thru this morning were so sweet and will keep me coming back !"}
{"text":"Awesome wifi,  but........ The fruit flies almost dragged my law books away.  I felt like one of those poor children on the miracle network asking for donations....all I needed was a camera close up of me holding an empty cup, with  Puss n' Boots eyes and  the flies all over me.  Can we close the door and get an exterminator up in this joint?  Superior wifi....just don't eat anything here ...unless you like larva."}
{"text":"This is the place that I go to de-stress, to do homework, to celebrate a happy occasion.  I will take any excuse to go here.  I love that when I walk in I am always greeted with a smile and that there is never attitude.  The baked goods are irresistible but the coffee is what keeps me coming back.  There isn't a better soy latte in the entire valley.  It is deep but mellow and never, ever bitter.  I love CSC!!"}
{"text":"This place attracts a diverse crowd of people, which is awesome. It's a great place to grab coffee and a tasty treat and get some work done on your laptop."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem in Phoenix! Been meaning to try it for awhile, we saw it driving by after leaving another coffee shop awhile back. SO glad we were able to finally make it over here. Full menu, which I loved, as well as SO many options of pastries to choose from. The staff is AMAZING and ALL so nice! All the girls were so happy and upbeat and seemed genuinely excited to have us in for the first time (we told them). The Cubano is delicious! I like it better hot than cold and I get mine with almond milk. The ONLY teeny little part I did not like about this place was the charge for almond milk.. A lot of places don't do that anymore, it's usually just an option of milk to choose from - a little disappointing, but I would still come back. I got a little card to start collecting stamps, which I love any place that rewards returning customers. They even sell clothes and jewelry which was a unique, cool touch to this place. They have a drive through which I can not express how much I LOVE THAT! Can't wait to use that next time, for my first time in I wanted to go IN. All of their pastries are VERY large, and with a sweet tooth like mine, I can't wait to try everything they have! Hands down, great amazing place I was so happy to find. I put pictures on my snap chat that day and I got SO many people asking me where I went! Was happy to spread the word on this hidden gem, I look forward to telling more people!"}
{"text":"I like this place but never had a proper customer service until today provided by Keylan (sorry if I spelled his name wrong). Very friendly and knowledgeable, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hidden gems I've discovered in the North Phoenix area. The coffee is amazing and you even get a free pastry on your first visit (the scones are to die for!). This place is very rustic and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I love their scones.  I'm not a huge coffee drinker and I'll admit that I often review coffee houses based on their baked good offerings.  I enjoy supportin glocal businesses which is what is important to me.  The location is cute and they have free wifi.  Lots of people are seen working here with their laptops open with a scone before them.  Seriously, you need to get the cranberry scone.  Crumbling and crunchy on the outside.  Tender and perfectly balanced sweetness/tartness on the inside.  I'm hungry again ...."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried so far has been delicious.  The cubano, lavender mocha and thai iced tea are all unique flavors.  Today we also indulged in a BLT and a vanilla cupcake with raspberry cream cheese frosting.  My favorite beverage so far is the cubano.  I love the amount of foam and flavor in the foam.  They leave the lid off of your drink and make a beautiful design in the foam.  I never really order a BLT, but I'm so glad I did!  The bacon is quality.  It's thick and meaty.  I would have liked a little less mayo, but nonetheless tasty.  The cupcake was beautiful to look at.  The cake was pretty plain, but was vanilla after all.  The raspberry cream cheese frosting made the cupcake.  All of the employees were friendly and cheerful.  My husband and I sat at the bar.  We were in awe as we watched the barista operate like a machine to make all of the drinks.  Even though they were fairly busy, the level of service never faultered."}
{"text":"SO... I was out looking for a WIFI place to study some boring insurance stuff and went to Star-rip off your-bucks. (I don't drink coffee so i can say this) and tried to use the free Internet....FAIL apparently you have to be a T-mobile type. 

I asked where I could go and the guy said there is a place next to the record store called Copper Star. 

Copper Star Coffee is cool, the place is cool, the clients are cool, the employees are cool, and I bet the coffee is HOT. I ordered a Coke in the bottle and used the free WIFI. 

I sort of wished I liked Coffee, I would gladly give them my money."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The atmosphere is very trendy, the staff if unheard of friendly and accommodating and the muffins are to die for.  They will make items for you that aren't even on their menu.  I am from MD and make a point of coming here when I visit AZ."}
{"text":"I stopped in here and told the barista that it was my first time here. She helped me select a drink that would be suitable for my tastebuds in addition to that she offered my boyfriend and I a free desert since it was our first time here. The ambiance is nice, it's actually bigger on the inside like a tardis and there are seats outside as well."}
{"text":"The Copper Star Coffee shop has several reviews already and without being too verbose and periphrastic, I will keep my review short.

Coffee ~ very good, full bodied taste without bitterness and has a good aroma.

Coffee Accompaniments ~ good selection of cookies, pastries, tarts.  I asked them to heat my brownie ; -) it was chocolicious X2!

Service ~ very friendly and happy and eager to please

Decor ~ it used to be much more comfy with more couches and big comfy chairs.  I think they are trying to accommodate more people with the use of big wooden tables and hard chairs. It used to be much more comfy with more room to move and set up better to meet with friends.  

All in all, it's a great place for a cup of joe if your in the area.  They have a convenient drive through if you don't have time to stop."}
{"text":"I think they have great coffee and pastries.  There hasn't been a time I visited that I wasn't happy with the results."}
{"text":"I had to update my rating to a full 5-stars for C-Star. Jenny and I have been consistently going there for nearly a year and neither of us has ever had a subpar visit. Seriously, they don't ever have an off day. I usually go weekday mornings -- never a problem. Jenny typically visits in the afternoons -- always treated well. More often than not, we go together on a weekend and lounge in the patio misters or on the big orange couches -- always a positive experience. The coffee is the best in the area (we recommended St Francis look to Copper Star to brew up b/c the reject grounds from Cartel are not cutting it) and the service is always excellent. The baked good and food selections make it just that much better. If this were the RenFaire, I'd be totally HUZZAH for Copper Star."}
{"text":"Huge points for unique atmosphere. This is a great \"local\" place with fresh made pastries, salads and goodies plus good beverages. And despite what others wrote, I had no problems with the wi-fi. This is for all the caffeine addicts who want a cool place to hang and have a coffee, but are completely over Starbucks. I have to throw in another comment about the atmosphere-this is what gives it the edge over the chains. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Coffee. Awesome. Scone. Delicious. Service? Perfect. P

Every coffee shop should have a drive thru for us poor sleep-deprived mamas. It's different in that they don't have a menu posted and they come up to your car to take your order. I decided to try their ice brewed coffee and it is so smooth. No burnt, sour or acidic taste. I asked the barista to add some cream and agave for me, with no other direction and it was perfect - not overly sweet like most places. 

I also ordered a cranberry-pecan scone because baked goods and coffee are meant to be consumed together. Uhm. The scone is bigger than my hand. Not that I have big hands, but still. It is a little on the drier side, but delicious! And as an added bonus, since it's my first visit, they bought my scone for me! Whaaaaat. If that's not amazing customer service, I don't know what is! 

As an added bonus, they have punch cards. Loooove. Will def be back, sleeping baby in tow!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in midtown Phoenix. The coffee is very good mostly (sometimes when the staff turnover is higher it can make for inconsistent coffee). They have the best earl grey iced tea and a decent selection of sweets. The location is charming, it's a reused gas station where the fill up spots are now spots to order at as a drive thru. There are beautiful lush plants growing everywhere, there's a birdbath and outdoor/indoor seating. The atmosphere is very relaxed which makes me feel comfortable to come here first thing in the morning when I run out of coffee at home."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stopped in for a quick caffeine fix and this place is really great. The staff was super friendly, the coffee was good, and the atmosphere was really inviting. Next time I'll have to try the food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop. Their coffee is great, the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I bring my dogs sometimes, and they are totally cool about them being there with me. The drive thru is pretty convenient, too when I'm in a hurry. I'd say it's hard to find a better cup of coffee for a better price in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, gigantic and delicious pastries, and very welcoming atmosphere. Staff members are super nice, and the art exhibits are always a nice plus to the space. Their BLT is one of the best BLTs I ever had."}
{"text":"We came here today for coffee. The place was filled with people. There was a live band playing. The service was wonderful and the coffee was good. No reason to go to a chain coffee shop when if you are close to here."}
{"text":"The coffee here is quite good, and the pastries are pretty yummy. I'm a big fan of the staff here, they're always friendly and willing to banter, and they're exceedingly welcoming. There are some endearing quirks to the place as well. The occasional jazz band playing there in the mornings and mid afternoons is a nice touch.

As a note: if you're ordering an iced beverage, the choices are medium/large/extra large, which can be a bit confusing at first, especially for those of us who need caffeine to function. You adapt.

My one knock against the place would be to say that the geometry is awkward, at best. No truly clear place for the line to queue. The seating can be tricky if you want to be solo but not sit at the coffee bar. The patio is nice, but it can be trick to find a place to sit. There's street parking to be had, but you might have to park a block or so away (I personally don't mind the walk, but I can understand how it could get annoying in July).

Overall, a solid cafe, and my go-to in this part of Phoenix."}
{"text":"You want good coffee?  You want good service?  You want nice people?  You want convenient location?  You want easy in/out?  You want *free* WiFi?  You want good sandwiches?

You want Copper Star!

End of story!"}
{"text":"I go here because it's in my hood. Only in the event someone wants to meet there etc. The coffee is meh...food is meh...service usually sucks. Unless you do drive thru. Bathrooms are dirty. Flies always in the cake case. Seems like the owner spends more time chatting to regulars and the girls that work for him then caring about his business."}
{"text":"Copper Star is a nice local find. It appears to be a coffee shop converted from an old gas station, and they even have the option of a drive through. The retro gas pump stations are still around, which makes it a charming spot. 

Friendly staff, good coffee, surprisingly enjoyable cookies, and blasted AC (*this is key). They seem to host live bands time to time, so perhaps not the best place to study or have intimate conversations."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little coffee shop with an outdoor seating area some nights they have entertainment they always have great desserts usually made from scratch this is a coffee shop that was once a gas station that has a lot of character at night time they burn a fire outside it also has a nice relaxing fountain outside as well.  Depending on what you order the coffee can be normal to medium to 
 overpriced but isn't that true for all coffee shops lol."}
{"text":"Copper Star Coffee was the perfect venue for Yelpy Office Hours today... we had a great turnout, and a lot of fun!  I also got to see yelpers enjoying all kinds of CS drinks and treats.  (The green tea chiller that Kelly had looked especially refreshing!)

Their soy latte was pretty damn good, and I ended up eating lunch at Copper Star also... who knew that they have fresh sandwiches and salads?  I wanted the egg salad but they were out of it.  Bummer!  I went with the curry chicken salad instead and it was tasty - as long as you like curry.  Not the best I've had, but it was convenient and edible.  

Bill, Natalie, and Mindy took great care of our group... and since I ended up spending over 5 hours at the place, I was able to observe many of the other customers that came in and out as well.  It was a diverse group, and all friendly and cool. Great for people watching and working - the day flew by!

Thanks again to all of you that came out today, and to Copper Star for accommodating us.  See you soon, Copper Star!"}
{"text":"I consider it a personal failing that I haven't reviewed this place yet. The staff is wonderfully friendly, the coffee is great, the loose leaf teas are very well curated to offer a nice variety of caf and decaf options without being overwhelming, and their iced tea selection has a black, herbal and fruited option. Their food menu is the perfect mix of limited and diverse (though I would not say this is a place to go for food), and they have a wide variety of baked goods that they rotate on a regular basis.

On top of that? They have handmade craft-y things if you want to impulse buy a gift and a rotating display of artwork on the walls. They do it all, and they don't mess it up.

This place. Everything about this place. My only concern is that it will one day get too crowded for its cozy floor plan!!

P.S. The bathrooms are always clean. Not regular restaurant clean, but the type of clean that's worth mentioning in a review of the place. And the sink fixture is really pretty!"}
{"text":"I had never been here before,  it's so cool! You drive up and they come our to your car. The person who helped me was so friendly and they were fast, my pastry and coffee came fast.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice small place. There is not much parking space. The baristas where nice and helpful. They had free samples on the counter. I got a Cubana coffee. It was nice and strong."}
{"text":"Copper Star is great if you can find parking. Make sure you don't venture too far into their parking lot in the alley though, because it is hard to turn around and get yourself out of there. 

This place is cozy and always less crammed and busy than their neighbors on Central, but I sense that part of the reason for this is that their stuff just isn't quite up there in consistent quality with said neighbors. Consistency is really important to me when it comes to my beloved caffeinated beverages, and I'd say it's about 60/40 whether or not my espresso tastes a little burninated in my drinks here or my iced tea tastes like it was left steeping a bit too long. 

However, the staff here is genuinely nice and their baked goods are incredible. My old boss used to bring me a rice krispy treat from here regularly and man do I miss those. If you come in here at night, they might toss an extra treat in your bag to clear out their case for the next day!

All-in-all, while this place doesn't serve the best latte in Phoenix, the ambience is there. To me, Copper Star is less of a morning coffee rush than it is a relaxing place to stop after work and unwind with a nice drink. Highly recommend the iced earl grey when you can get it!"}
{"text":"Great cool little coffee shop.  I had the soy chai latte and the everything breakfast bagel sandwich.  The latte was excellent - great taste, perfect amount of chai spice, and good mixture of soy.   The sandwich was great - fluffy bagel, great taste (didn't need hot sauce) and now overt greasy.  

Service was excellent.  Real people with a smiling face is one of my favorite things to accompany my coffee.  

Cool place to hang and grab a quick coffee"}
{"text":"Great selection of drinks and homemade sweets, including the rare and delicious Aztec Cocoa. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. The building and decor in this converted gas station are relaxed and cool. My order was miscommunicated to the barista, but they quickly and happily corrected it. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Whoa!  Lots of reviews on this place makes me realize I've been daft not coming to this place earlier despite it being closer to me than Lux or Willow House ... and ... i enjoyed it much more than either one of those other places. 

The barista (not sure if it was the owner since it was my first visit) was really polite and witty and even made me a Chai Charger to my exact specifications.   

The outdoor seating was simply perfect for a cool January morning and was shaded by the building because somehow the Arizona sun never takes a break from gettin' yo ass, no matter what season it is.  We could enjoy hot coffee (or chai), smoke squares, and chat in a semi-private setting.

The charm of this building is what originally attracted me to the place, but the great drinks and setting is what will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"There is a reason this coffee shop has a high rating. It has a cool vibe, great (local) art for sale on the walls, very genuinely friendly service, Lavender Mochas to die for AND I received a free pastry for it being my first visit. I had the strawberry mango muffin... yum! Bravo Copper Star!!!"}
{"text":"I like to call Copper Star my home office away from my home office or even my main office from time to time. The connection is always solid and the staff is super friendly. I especially like setting up shop here on rainy days. I get my large van-latte, plug in, connect and bang out a full day's work and it doesn't even feel like work at all. It's a great place to meet up with a friend to play catch up, talk world events or even strategize. The art work is quit funky, too.

Aside from the great coffee, they make some pretty tasty sandwiches and salads. I really like the lemon ginger tuna salad sandwich because it's light and surprisingly filling and no-mayo. I prefer this vinaigrette based salad because really, who wants to bite into a mayonnaise sandwich?

It's also bike and dog friendly and they are really excitied about recycling."}
{"text":"It's 5:57 am, in Phoenix.  when you need coffee,real coffee. Copper Star hits the mark and fills your cup."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great space to get work done or meetup with an old friend. Owner is always friendly and the coffee is not only reasonably priced (thank you!), but also some of the best Phoenix has to offer! Love you Copper Star! Gem in the middle of Phoenix's Melrose District."}
{"text":"Last Saturday I had the pleasure of going to Copper Star.  My friend and I were driving around shopping and needed something to drink.  I had read reviews on this place and so we stopped in for an Ice Tea.  The place has a great, warm, friendly vibe. I could picture myself sitting at the outdoor patio having a coffee and reading a book. We ended up buying some fabulous muffins to wash our ice tea down with.  Very, very nice.  I will definitely return and would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, relaxing atmosphere and the service was outstanding. The menu is limited but soooo good and I cannot imagine finding something you would like,especially the sweets!"}
{"text":"I was having a client meeting in Phoenix and searched Yelp for a coffee shop to meet.  I was excited to support a locally owned establishment (even though I am a Starbucks shareholder!)   I arrived  and a very nice gentleman waited on me.  The tea selection was really great.  I found a table, and had to wipe it off myself from the crumbs that were left from the previous customer.  When my client arrived, I asked her what she wanted to drink and she only wanted water, I waited while the young gal (now the only one working) made a coffee for someone and when she waited on me, I asked for a water, she seemed irritated and she filled a cup of water from the faucet and was handing it to me when I had to ask for ice.  She was clearly irritated that I asked for ice in the water.   My client noticed that too and felt bad.  The atmosphere was nice, the music was at a nice moderate level where you could conduct business, read a book or concentrate on your computer.  I might give it another visit if I am in that part of town again, to see if the young gal has gotten a clue that that client is the one that makes her paycheck, but I won't make a special trip."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOMMEEEEE- best looking and nicest baristas in town. Also the owner is a stud and a genuinely nice guy. Great coffee, great prices, great location."}
{"text":"I requested a peanut butter mocha lightly sweet and it turned out awesome! Made my day and all the baked treats looked amazing! Drinks were made quickly and service was so pleasant. Have to stop in!! Thanks copper star!"}
{"text":"I've been back to Copper Star many more times than I can count, now that I am bumming on my friend's couch (This is right up the street from her place.)
I really love the open and friendly atmosphere and I feel like the layout of the furniture really lends itself for people to interact and chat. They have a good internet connection, and I love me some free wifi. I can camp out and do homework for a couple hours and not feel like I am bothering anyone. The staff is friendly but it's a little awkward to see them canoodling with their significant others on the patio, and then come inside and start serving.. I don't watch too carefully but I am assuming (hoping) there is a quick trip to the (still lovely) washroom between.

I've had a few pastries, the blueberry muffins are good, but pretty standard, and I'm fairly certain from a mix,  but the red velvet cupcakes are fresh and tasty. Coffee is again, good, but not great, but this is definitely a great place to hangout, grab a snack, chit chat, enjoy the ambiance, and use the toilet."}
{"text":"Decent coffee for the price. I don't like ice in my drinks and when I order anything I say \"cold pour\". Instead of asking what that means they just ignore it. Meaning I drink an eighth of my drink and then throw it out when the ice melts and it gets watered down."}
{"text":"Decided to hit the drive through before work and grab and cold chai latte. The girl that helped me was really nice and gave me 2 punches on my card since it was my first time. The drink is also super tasty. I'll be stopping again for some treats in the near future!"}
{"text":"Recently visited Copper Star and I absolutely loved it! Let me start by saying they have the most beautiful selection of teas and the aromas alone of each one are divine! Michelle helped me out, she informed me about the rotating artists that showcase their work there and just gave me a little history about the place. It looks like a great place to study, meet up with friends, or just enjoy a good bite with good tea/coffee by yourself any night of the week. They usually close around 9/10 which is quite convenient. For dinner,I decided on the hummus plate and I loved the variety of veggies that it comes with.  :) I actually went to the drive thru the next day tho and got to try their espresso, OMG soooo good. Got a double shot with an ounce or 2 of steamed milk (basically a flat white but some shops don't offer that) and it easily went up on my top 3 list. BARISTA in Portland has my heart forever on flat whites! Anyways, thanks Michelle for a wonderful time and thanks to the young lady who made my tasty drink in the morning!"}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio area. Try the Blackberry Peach Muffin and Lavender Mocha."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great staff. They were attentive and provided great insight on product. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee/tea joint. They have free wifi with tables and couches and is fun to chill out in. Parking is the only downside side for this place so you will have to park on the street which really is not all that bad. I have not tried the baked goods yet and will have too soon. Other reviews say the baked goods are really good."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to update this due to the new crowd that's in and out of this place. Man, what happened?!?! This place was really cool but now it's FULL of a weird crowd of old hipsters. weird. Now I feel underdressed when i go in here. Though the live music is still cool, it's impossible to sit down because you're squished in like sardines. We had to take the kids outside to sit down last time. They should have the band play outside rather than right next to the counter. It's all arranged very awkwardly. The drinks are just drinks. They're good, but just normal coffee shop drinks. All in all, I'm no longer impressed. Super bummer.. such a cool lookin spot."}
{"text":"I decided to come here on a Saturday night because my bf and I had to do some work (I know, lame.)  The place was really hard to find as they have a small sign that doesn't really light up that much.  You have to understand.  I am from Las Vegas - bright lights on building galore so I was looking for something like that to jump at me, but luckily, the bf found it and we just parked on the curb. I bet that during the morning, it would be really hard to find parking.  

So facing 7th Ave is the side of the building - but you think it's the front.  It's like an old gas pump area and you think, \"Huh..this looks weird\".  I get in and the place is completely unexpected - it was extremely inviting and the employees are super sweet.  I ordered an almond milk chai tea and honestly, it was not good.  I felt really bad, but I told them with my most sweetest voice possible, \"I don't mean to be a prick, but I don't like this.  Can I have something else?\"  The reaction was awesome!  They were so apologetic and was definitely willing to make me something else. The barista tells me that the almond milk is unsweetened so I had to settle for non-fat.  The problem is, I'm paleo so I kinda want the almond milk, but I realize that unsweetened is not so good.  However, the non-fat iced vanilla latte was good.  I didn't drink it all, but it was good.

So we strolled in around 9pm and the atmosphere was so relaxing.  Maybe it was the fact that there was not a $hit ton of people in the place, but I stayed there ten minutes before closing time.  If they didn't close, I probably could of stayed there longer.  So ambiance and service totally give it a 5, the limited coffee options, a 3."}
{"text":"This is really a great place! Good coffee, reliable Wi-Fi and pastries galore! The staff is super friendly. Can't wait for it to be nice enough to enjoy working from there with the big roll-up door open!"}
{"text":"Copper Star is totally the type of place I would like, despite the fact that I'd much rather meet someone for an adult beverage than a coffee.  The times that I do go to coffee shops is when I want to buckle down and get some work done for my graduate classes or lesson plan for work.  For very obvious reasons, the free WIFI is KEY when I want to spend hours at a coffee shop getting work done.

I've been to Copper Star a few times, and noticed that their Internet is very slow.  This past Saturday, however, it was beyond frustrating.  I asked the girl working the counter and she replied \"Our Internet is sucky.\"  Needless to say, a pretty pathetic and frustrating response.  I had already ordered a tea and breakfast sandwich (nothing special there) so I had to stick around to finish those up.  The Internet (after a half hour) starting working but went in and out.  

Coffee shops without consistently working WIFI are useless to me, and despite how adorable the actual spot is, I don't see myself returning here again.  If you need reliable Internet, I don't think you should, either (unless they fix the problem)."}
{"text":"Two stars based on the place. I had a chai, it was good, however: the barista added the ice over the ice machine, I saw the liquid drip into the machine. There were dirty tables and trash all around the building. That's no bueno!!! Please fix that!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Copper  Star. I have only ordered tea and a cupcake from here. The tea is good, but occassionally has a slight coffee taste. It comes in a huge cup and I don't know if this has changed or not, but you can go back and get a free refill on the same day which is great. The cup cake was very yummy. 
Though the last time I was at Copper Star I did find the two gals working to be kind of rude, which was odd considering any other time I have been there the service has always been friendly. 
I do think parking is a major pain. Their parking lot accomdates two to three vehicles after that you will have to park in the neighborhood in front of someone's house.
I really only get to go to Copper Star when I visit my dad as he lives in the area, but if I lived closer I would go more often as it's a pretty laid back place to hang and sip on some coffee or tea."}
{"text":"Love this place! it's a cool little spot, that has a whole lot of character. The Chai is my personal favorite, of which is homemade and will keep you coming back. It can take a little bit to get the drinks out, when they are busy and if you get a hot food item, but otherwise they are really good. Parking can suck, but there is a drive thru lane there. 

This is a killer spot for working, meeting up, or first dates. In any case, if you haven't stopped in- you should seriously consider it."}
{"text":"I'm sitting writing this review from a sofa here at the Copper Star. I must admit, I'm impressed! 

From the quaint \"drive through\" that turned out to be a door you simply pull up to and an employee comes out to take your order from you while you sit in your car.. to the eclectic and hip interior. I was sold even before I sat down to take a sip of one of the most delish  mochas I've had in the states. Strong and rich w/o being too sweet!!! Perfect! This chocolaty masterpiece easily surpasses mochas de la Starbucks. 

Cooper Star is on my \"Visit Again & Again\" list. 

If you are reading this ignore all the other reviews that say less and come visit this place yourself. Simply delightful!!"}
{"text":"Very cool very hip place.  Great for hanging out on the weekend to sip coffee and play on the internet.  The place is small so it feels really cozy.  It looks like it used to be a gas station so it has a funky fresh feel to it.  Coffee is good and they have a small variety of yummy baked goods.  Check it out if you've never been there.  I'm not sure what type of bandwidth they have there but the wi-fi speed is always lightning fast."}
{"text":"don't get me wrong - i love the coffee (the white chocolate peanut butter drink is my fav), the atmosphere, and the food - all around a great coffee shop that i would frequent to do my homework BUT.....





the wi-fi SUCKS. it's SOOOOOOOOO fucking slow. half the time i can't even get on. isn't this the point of coffee shops? i took a test here one night and failed it because their internet was so slow. and they were like 3 other people in there.


 what the eff? sorry, copper star."}
{"text":"Delicious cupcakes... However I was not impressed with the coffee drinks. Mine had too much ice and the espresso was a little bitter tasting, my friend's had too little ice and tasted watered down. Nice atmosphere but felt a little crowded."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee, an awesome old building re-purposed and fabulous decor with local artists featured.  Their treats (pastries) and drinks were on point!  The only feedback that I have is that the people that worked there were not overly bubbly barista friendly like most coffee shops.  I have only been there once, so I understand it could have just been an off day."}
{"text":"I visited this shop on my way to visit North Phoenix Baptist Church from out-of-state (plug: terrific church with fantastic leaders!).  It is a very unique little shop (looks like former gas station) with a drive-thru.  It didn't take too long for me to get my iced mocha and it was pretty good (not the best in Phoenix but definitely quality coffee)!  The service was friendly too.  Apparently, there are two lanes you can pull into to order, I didn't know until someone behind me pulled into the second lane."}
{"text":"I'll throw in my 2 cents on Copper Star Coffee. I stopped in yesterday for the first time with a friend of mine. I had a raspberry Ghirardeli Chocolate mocha and he had a blended toffee drink of some sort. He said it was \"super yumtastic\". I knew his intent was to convey to me his like of said beverage, but I reminded him it wasn't a word and then we continued to enjoy ourselves. 

The interior is very industrial-cool. Brick walls exposed, ceiling exposed, all the electrical wiring in tubes running serpentine along the walls. 

Fresh baked items are made on the premises and if I hadn't just eaten a huge lunch, I would have sampled a brownie. It looked super yumtastic. Dammit, I guess it is a word. Anyway, it will give me a reason to go back.

The converted gas station also has a huge garage door that, on nice days like yesterday, is opened. Even if you're sitting inside, you can enjoy a bit of the outdoors as well."}
{"text":"Return visit for work.  I was training a new hire, and remembered this great little shop. Not a good place to study:/ or have a work conversation. Too much noise between the 90s music and staff... Still great coffee but not a place to concentrate:)."}
{"text":"Centered between my school, office and house, Copper Star Coffee offers a cozy and versatile environment perfect for doing homework, meeting up with a friend, or simply staring out the window and contemplating life.
The variety of hot teas they offer is rather good, as is their hot drip coffee. If you ever get the chance to try their peach blackberry muffin, please do so. It's unlike any muffin I've ever had before.
The only downside is parking. They have a parking lot with two spaces plus one handicap space. If you're driving, you're most likely going to have to park on the street or in the neighboring boutique's parking lot (and I don't think they like it when you do that.)"}
{"text":"I like this place. They had live music on Sunday. I had an iced white mocha and it was really good. I'll definitely be back to try some food."}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly staff, cool venue, dog-friendly. Had an iced coffee and sat on the back porch. Shady and comfortable. Plenty of gluten free options and the blueberry muffin is delicious."}
{"text":"The house Chai is fabulous! Copper Star has absolutely delicious baked goods! Amazing atmosphere and great music. Some of the staff are super friendly but others could improve their customer service. Overall, a trendy and fun place to grab coffee/tea with a friend."}
{"text":"Went around lunch today and got a blended double chocolate mocha. The staff were really nice and the building is really cool, but my coffee was more of a milk shake than any sort of blended coffee - I even asked to make sure it was made with coffee. It had no coffee flavour at all and certainly wasn't \"double chocolate\". I loved all their different seating, the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever been in, but if I'm going to pay nearly $5 for a 16oz drink, I want it to taste amazing. Was also disappointed that they didn't have any real selection in the bakery case - it was all sandwiches, breads, and a tarte (which looked good but was also overpriced). They apparently won some prizes for \"best cupcake\" or something and there were NO cupcakes in the case when I went in."}
{"text":"This place has hands-down become my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix.  The coffee and cupcakes are awesome, the atmosphere is equally as good, and with free wi-fi and comfortable seating this one of my favorite places to do homework or just chill.  The only issue this place has is the parking.  There are literally 2 off-street parking spots, and the rest is park at the curb...lucky me I am one of the fortunate ones living within walking (or biking) distance.  The coolest thing about this place though is Bill the owner, and the rest of his friendly staff.  I've frequented other coffee shops in the area, and don't frequent them anymore specifically because of the pretentious, snobby staff at those establishments.  From the first day I walked in to Copper Star however, Bill was super friendly striking up a conversation and really making me feel welcome.  His staff always seems to be in a good mood, and if they are coffee snobs like me they don't ever show it.  If you haven't been here yet, stop what you are doing and go check it out now!"}
{"text":"Little sweet coffee shop in downtown Phoenix, close to my old school on Central.  Not pretentious just nice comfortable place to cozy into.  They have some baked goods which looked amazing, but I did not partake in, just watching my girlish figure!!"}
{"text":"Love it but the baked goods storage always seems to have a fly in it. Needs coconut milk.  Love the hood and staff though !"}
{"text":"LOVE Copper Star Coffee! I think it's the best coffee shop around. Great coffee, great customer service, great atmosphere. Rotating art work from local artists and a jazz band on Sunday mornings. Also this is not a chain, support your local economy, and buy local!"}
{"text":"These folks routinely cater delicious coffee to my workplace so thought I'd check out their actual location.  Very cute!!  Best study space of any Phoenix coffeehouse I've found to date."}
{"text":"Copperstar would be my go to coffee shop if I lived in the area. My husband and I will still drive 10 miles to come here on occasion, which says something great about the cafe. The drinks are consistent, the service is friendly and the layout of the interior and the patio are pleasant. I prefer going there at night as there are fewer people and the atmosphere is more calm, but even on a busy Saturday afternoon it was enjoyable. The Tuxedo Mocha is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The staff were welcoming and the coffee and pastries were delicious. Copper star is the best coffee shop in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Out of all the five local coffee joints I stopped by during a trip to Phoenix, this one I'd have to say was the best of them.  I drove past them while pursuing breakfast, but decided to stop by on my way back down 7th, to have a cup of coffee and figure out what to do with the rest of my day.

There isn't a ton of parking, but there is plenty of places to park on the street.  It's a small, cozy, repurposed gas station as everyone else has pointed out, and the interior is simple, yet relaxing feeling.  Parents with their kids sit outside of this kind of place.  Older people relax with a cup of coffee with their dog on a leash at this kind of place.  Younger hipsters hang out inside on their mobile devices at this kind of place.  The garage door was open, so a cool morning in Arizona could be enjoyed by everyone.  The couches inside were precariously cushy as they engulf you when you sit down.

The cookie I ordered as a dessert to breakfast was still warm when it was served to me.  The chocolate chips were gooey and soft, and it was practically right out of a commercial, with a slow camera pan on my hands as I ripped a chunk off with a rivulet of milky chocolate stretching away.  The coffee was not burnt-tasting or overly bitter, and was probably the best I had on my trip.

And everyone who worked there was polite and friendly.  Several of them took the time to address my questions about the area, and if they had any suggestions of anything to do, whether it was in the city or out in Surprise where I was headed.

The experience as a whole was easily worth five stars.  Convenient location, free parking, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and quality products.  Easily a repeat trip next time I'm out in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this place!  When we lived in the neighborhood we were regulars. Located in the Historic Melrose Neighborhood, Copper Star opened around 2006 when the neighborhood was barely gentrifying.  Businesses were slowly beginning to open and the 7th Ave corridor between Indian School and Camelback was changing.  Now it is a thriving neighborhood.   Owner Bill Sandweg, who brought a range of experience with him such as, TGI Friday's Pizza Uno, Oregano's, & Starbucks, opened a coffee shop in an old Service station.  He found local coffee roasters, got quality teas and slowly built his business with changes and additions every year, making what it is today. I just spoke with Bill a couple days ago who said 2014 was a terrific year for Copper Star, their best. That is thanks to the growing loyal customers as well as Copper Stars success. As businesses began to open Bill joined and his board members help grow small business association for that neighborhood. He is a committee member on the HTJ (Hotter Than July) Chili cook-off & salsa fest. During the Melrose Street Fair you can always stop in for a Iced Coffee or Iced Tea.  Basically Bill is just an all-around good guy. He cares about the neighborhood and the quality of his business.  He has hired a lot of young folks as baristas.  I am sure he has help put a few through college while working there.  I have never had a bad cup of coffee there. At one point they had punch cards you could redeem for a free drink. There were so many people named Mark in the rolodex box, I had Bill change my name to Zeus so they could find my card with less hassle.
This is a people, pet, and neighborhood friendly place.  They do have a unique drive-thru, however, I never use the drive through.   I hold a firm opinion that if you intend to visit any coffee shop you should step inside the business. Most quality coffee shops are more than just coffee, they each hold a unique atmosphere or experience. Take time out of your busy day, step inside, you'll get the entire coffee making experience. 
Beyond the coffee they have breakfast sandwiches and pastries or light food menu. They have art installations and on some occasions live music. If you attend First Fridays on Melrose, you can stop in for a drink.
Kudos to Copper Star for creating a successful local small business that everyone can enjoy and feel welcome."}
{"text":"the best coffee in maricopa county.

there might be a place in SF that i like better...  but the commute's a bitch."}
{"text":"Cute and affordable. Finally an alternative that I actually want to go to!
Every time I try to break away from the corporate coffee chains, I get burned because their lattes taste like dirt, or they act like they've never heard of soy milk.  Come on people!  

That's what I loved about this place, the staff actually knew what they were doing, and the menu included all the necessities, plus a few of their own creations!  Try the mint mocha...uh, YUM!  They make a great soy vanilla latte too."}
{"text":"Copper Star Coffee is super-adorable with a nice, mellow atmosphere and quiet ambience. I don't normally drink coffee so they served me up an enormous glass of iced green tea and a huge cupcake from the case. The cupcake tasted a little boxy but the iced tea was light and refreshing, and their small advertising section with flyers for local bands and other extracurricular activities just might point you in the direction of an excellent show or an interesting new hobby... it did for me. :)"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop made from an old gas station. Very old school, vintage appeal. Has a drive through and makes some tasty coffee! They usually have some entertainment during the weekend and are pretty quick. Great patio.

If you are hitting the Melrose district for some vintage shop exploration, start here. It sets an awesome tone for the neighborhood and coffee is great before walking to 7 or 8 stores."}
{"text":"Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans?

Their coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!) 

Despite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.

All in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I can't recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best."}
{"text":"This little Coffee shop is cool as hell! Its in an old gas station and has tons of character! 

During nice weather they roll up their garage doors and let the inside and outside become one! 

The service is always fast and friendly! The drinks and pastries always hit the spot! 

I always make it a point to hit this place up when I am doing my antiquing in the Melrose district!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place and totally laid back.  I didn't think the sandwhich I had broke and world taste records, but it was a fun and reasonably quiet place to hang out for a while, read, and eaves drop on fathers and sons talking about their week and teachers planning their science curriculum... not that I love eaves dropping."}
{"text":"A little bit too sweet for me and the drinks always not consistent. Every time I went there, drinks always seem different. However, the pastries are great. Location is the best for pet owner because it is next to wag n wash."}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure--my hubby worked here when it was a Texaco station way back \"in the day.\" Not that that has anything to do with Coffee Star's current life, but you know what they say...

That said, I have to confess: I've never actually had coffee here. You see, I'm a Trader Joe's gal. I buy my Trader Joe's roast [well, actually Ken buys it, I don't do grocery shopping any more], bring it home, set up the timed Mr. Coffee [well, actually Ken does that for me too--don't all you chicks out there wish you had MY husband???] and it turns on at 6 am. By the time I'm done with my health walk, it's brewed and waiting for me.

So you all are no doubt wondering just why is this crazy NDN woman reviewing a coffee shop where she's never had the coffee? Because, amigos...it's because Coffee Star is one of my favorite lunch spots. It's in the Melrose District, also one of my faves [I have a biggg article coming out in Valley Guide Quarterly to prove it!], their sandwiches are OK [not 100 percent, more like 80 percent but that's ok], the building is just the coolest old gas station-cum-coffee shop EVER and did this, kemosabes...

THEY HAVE REAL COKE!! That's right, caballeros, they have Mexican Coca-Cola, the old recipe with real sugar instead of the corn syrup that Coke so-calls sweetens their colas with. That along is worth driving over for...

And it's a great spot to hang and watch the world go by. One of these days I'll try out the wi-fi and try to resolve that issue...."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere coffee shop in the Melrose area. A bit close quarters, probably because of the popularity, but an otherwise great spot to hang out and meet some new faces."}
{"text":"The owner was really nice ... he learned customer service from his time at Oreganos ... He is a good guy!  Treats his customers with mad respect ...  Although it's way outside my neighborhood ... I maybe occasionally be passing Lux and Drip to get here ... but this place is nice ... with zero pretentiousness.

The even play music that is inclusive not \"exclusive\" ... kinda a rarity for coffee shops IMHO ..."}
{"text":"Realistically, the only reason why we stopped by Copper Star Coffee was because our primary destination, Tres Leches Café, ended up being unexpectedly closed for the day.

Copper Star currently operates out of an old building that was once a gas station. Business building conversions are, from what I've read, a written legal requirement for true hipster credibility. The place has a bit of charm, I'll admit.

I ordered an iced mocha tuxedo and my girlfriend ordered an iced cubano. Both were good for what they were. Your fairly straightforward anti-corporate coffee, I guess. Maybe if there already weren't so many local coffee shops, I'd be a bit more enthusiastic. Since it was National Cookie Day, we used it as an excuse to order both a gingerbread and chocolate chip cookie. Both were decent. 

While I would never go out of my way to come here, I'm sure it's a great little hang-out spot for people who live in the area."}
{"text":"It's been some time before I last came here. I was showing up pretty frequently last year: coffee's good and so are the pastries, but their wifi really sucked, which I needed to get homework done.

Came here again for the first time in nearly a year and some things have changed. Their wifi connection seems to have improved and their food portions have grown twice in size. I ordered a hummus plate, which was absolutely massive. I mean, that thing could have easily fed two or three people. I felt bad throwing it away. The coffee's still good.

My main issue comes from the music, though. I felt like I was shopping in Forever 21 or H&M, not trying to study for a class. How am I supposed to take reading notes when Jay Z and B.o.B.  are blasting above my head? I could only take it for so long before leaving. 

Sorry, Copper Star, maybe we'll have better luck in another year."}
{"text":"So I'm actually hanging in copper star as I write, I have a tasty 20 ounce iced latte in one hand, and a wheat bagel breakfast sandwich in the other, and I am happy. Everything is tasty, the person at the register is so welcoming and up beat every time with every guest that walks in. The espresso is pumping out perfectly, sweet with a nutty finish. Awesome place! Would be my go to coffee shop if it wasn't a bit of a drive. 

If you have never been, you're only hurting yourself!"}
{"text":"So I don't usually work in Phoenix, but today I had to do some work up on Indian School Rd. So of course I open up Yelp, go to the breakfast and brunch tab and see what's up. CSC comes up with tons of reviews so of course I have to check it out. Just ordered a chocolate chip muffin and a caramel latte. Good lord this muffin is delish!!! Crisp on top, full of chocolate chips and so moist in the middle.  

Now I wasn't expecting anything other than the normal caramel latte, but the first sip I knew it was going to be in the top 10 lattes I've ever had.   

Very cool atmosphere with awesome paintings and comfortable seats.  If I ever come back this way I will definitely come back to CSC!!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a solid 10/10. From the moment I saw it as I was turning into the parking lot, to the moment I left the adorable patio, I was in LOVE with it. I was mesmerized as soon as I walked through the front doors because of all the character they were able to put into a small coffee shop and how everything was so inviting and cozy! When I calmed myself and gathered all the joy I had just acquired, I was welcomed in with a big smile from one of the employees and then (probably based off of the astonished look on my face) I was asked if this was my first time in. I then said yes, and they told me that since it was my first time in, I get a FREE pastry(!!!). I was on cloud nine by that point. Copper Star is a very sweet little hole in the wall coffee shop that has earned my love and a new loyal customer. Their prices are reasonable, and the tea is fantastic. They also have free WiFi, so as a college student, that is an absolute make or break for me when it comes to coffee shops. I highly recommend Copper Star to any and everyone who is looking for a quality coffee shop. 

P.S. They have a drive through for all of you that are on the go, but still need a good pick me up!"}
{"text":"Great little spot where a classmate and I go to after classes for coffee and dessert. Atmosphere is calm and pleasant while the baristas are very nice and laid back."}
{"text":"I like my coffee. I ordered a simple drip. Yummy. What I didn't like: the smell. The place smelt. Not horrible, but not pleasant either. Not like roasted coffee or something. My friend had to leave. He won't go back. We sat outside and drank our yummy coffees."}
{"text":"Much respect to Copper Star Coffee.

I am almost always in my p.j.s when I am driving my sweet ,second-grade scholars to school, and I am always jonesing for some good powerful cafe.  But I can't really get out of the car.  I like the cofee brought out to me presto! by some of the most laid-back, friendly people.  Drive through coffee is so American.   

Any a sort of bagel/breakfast sandwich situation will cost you, about 15 minutes of your life.  Good and hearty.

The car hops are so wonderful.  They make procuring coffee (the most daunting task in my pre-coffee morning ritual) sort of pleasant.

I don't know anything about the Wi-Fi or the pastries, though."}
{"text":"Copper Star is where I go to buy drip coffee to make at home. And where I meet up for coffee on weekends and evenings with friends. When you can find parking (though I prefer walking or biking), the atmosphere there is so relaxed you can't help but sit and unwind for a few.

Their non-coffee items are just as delicious, from the italian sodas (with choice of regular or heavy cream) to the delicious desserts and baked goods (which usually even have a vegan option), keep me coming back. 

Parking is limited, and I've never been through the drive though as it looks awkward, but this is still a place you don't want to miss out on."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, all I've ever had here is tea. But I love the joint. 

It's close to home and beats Starbucks for hanging out and using the wifi. It's less expensive as well. The decor is so much better as well. 

I always prefer to support local small businesses instead of the bigger chains and this one is a no brainer."}
{"text":"We have recently had two morning events catered by Copper Star. The quiche is divine and seriously... Fruity Pebble Rice Krispy Treats? Are you kidding me? I can hardly stand it!"}
{"text":"Love this little gem! I'm new to Phoenix and stumbled across this place, I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and the drink menu. The staff is all very friendly and it's an excellent place to study."}
{"text":"Sip your cup-o-joe in the former mechanic's bay of this historic gas station turned hip coffee house by my gradeschool friend, Bill Sandweg. Bill and his wife bring their years of restaurant management and service experience to this delightful addition to the 7th Avenue neighborhood. The pastries are home made.

You've no excuse to escape your work either. Free wi-fi is just a couple of clicks away. The close quarters of the former garage make for easy conversation with strangers, now new acquaintances about politics, Ev Mecham or even your most recent Yelp review.

Take advantage of the drive-thru, Starbucks-style as you drive past the antique gas pumps out front. All told, it's a great stop, and you can support another wonderful local business.

Four stars 'cause they close at 9pm (as of the writing of this review). I wanna hang out Tempe-Coffee-Plantation style like in my ASU days.

Thanks, Bill."}
{"text":"I love Copper Star. All of their drinks are pretty great. Staff has always been friendly. It's also a good place to go get work done. It's not as busy as some of the other independent coffee shops, so you can usually find a place to sit. My favorite thing to eat is the chicken salad pita. So good. Most of the other food I've found to be just decent."}
{"text":"Gluten- Free peanut butter oat ball cookie things. Not sure what they are officially titled, but they happily entered my belly. 

Nice sturdy tables for getting work done... internet password posted right up on a wood sign spray painted."}
{"text":"My experience didn't seem to align with the other reviews, odd. Ordered a huge green iced tea - impressive in size but completely flavorless. Two choc chip scones - completely dry, stale, crumbled like sawdust (threw away). $13 wasted. :-/

Not much more to say, other than cute decor, but no desire to return."}
{"text":"This place is definitely my favorite coffee shop in town.

I don't subscribe to belief that cool coffee shops have to be dark, moody places. Copper Star is bright, open and airy. The renovation of the old gas station was pulled off masterfully by updating the building while still keeping the old service station feel.

They serve pastries, sandwiches, smoothies, sodas and... oh yeah, coffee drinks.

The owner, Bill, is one of the friendliest guys you'll ever meet. 

The free WiFi makes it a great place to work and hang out."}
{"text":"If youre driving down 7th Ave you can't help but catch the awesome sign belonging to Copper Star. If that's not enough once you've seen that it's in an old gas station you have to stop. Drive thru Lanes make it quick and easy if you're in a rush. I go inside because I love the relaxed feel of it all. Cozy bright couches, and so many flavors of coffee and tasty treats. Do yourself a favor and check out their breakfast bagel.Yummy! If your cruising looking for something new this place is definitely worth your stop."}
{"text":"I was passing through Phoenix and happened into this coffee shop. I was totally tired and feeling sick, and really needed a good cup of tea. I ordered a large earl gray, and the super friendly guy behind the counter let me know that the kind of earl gray they offer is his favorite, and I was going to love it. He was totally right - it was delicious, and so was the house-made lemon cookie I had (which was on the house!) that a super friendly gal gave me with my tea. She also complimented my shirt, so needless to say if I could give this place 6 stars I would. 

It's always a good feeling to be a patron at a locally owned spot, and I know if I was a Phoenix local I'd be a regular. Thanks for the tea and hospitality, Copper Star! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this placr for sunday after lunch coffee. They had jazz musicians on, nice surprise. Good vibe place."}
{"text":"Don't know what took me so long except I don't drink coffee! But this place is great! Great atmosphere. The hummus plate was amazing and plenty to share. The prices are great. Breakfast bagel was simple and cheap! I almost think this place could turn me into a coffee drinker!!"}
{"text":"First off don't come if you're in a hurry, this is not Starbucks. Let these great people take their time and craft you a great drink. I had the Cubano which was delicious, a super smooth latte, and my girlfriend had the tuxedo mocha with extra espresso (not that she needs it). 

Used the drive through, a little confusing at first but the staff come to your car, take your order, and then deliver your drinks. Very friendly and personal. 

Definitely will be back here. Also they feature a great punch card where 10 drinks gets you a free one. Gave us 4 punches on our first visit!"}
{"text":"A great little coffeehouse cafe. Great coffee drinks, superb muffins, tasty sandwiches and wonderful atmosphere. I will make this a regular place to stop an relax. It is friendly, has wifi, and well worth the drive to get there!"}
{"text":"A great little gem in the heart of Melrose District. The service is friendly and quick to offer a suggestion on a delicious drink or special treat. They give you a free dessert on your first visit in and have a great variety of pastries and breakfast nosh to please just about anyone. Small but adorable and dog friendly patio is a great place to relax and people watch. This place will quickly become your favorite coffeehouse in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I love this place, when classes are in session, I'm here like 3-4 times a week. They have delicious pastries and drinks. Plus its by all the sweet vintage shops, a great way to kill a few hours."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here all the time and everything is great. You can tell the proprietors are really passionate about what they're doing here."}
{"text":"Very nice little coffee shop! I ordered an iced coffee with a shot of espresso. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't need any cream because it was delicious as is!"}
{"text":"So this place is nice I got the Cubano coffee, the only down side was how clean it was they should look at little details like cleaning the glass tables often and the outdoor trash"}
{"text":"It's an old gas station turned into a coffee shop. They have comfy sofas, good coffee, pastries, and the day that I went, vegetarian chili! It's a relaxed atmosphere, and the baristas are friendly. They also have very nice bathrooms that are modern and clean."}
{"text":"How cute is this place?  I've enjoyed my coffee here and really like their muffins...they are huge so I either share or save some for later.  It's a little out of the way for me in the morning, so I don't get over here as often as I might like."}
{"text":"A good friend took me here once. Been coming regularly since.  Gotta support the small local businesses folks! Cozy place, all the staff is very friendly to all. Try the humus plate on lettuce rather than with the bread, wholesome mix! Like the Cubano, mocha, lavender mocha or white mocha... all good!"}
{"text":"Copper Star is my go-to coffee joint. Their coffee is great, their iced tea is great, and their sweet treats are great.

The GIANT rice crispy treat is gooey and buttery and delicious - just like it should be.

Nice counter staff & baristas. The owner is super nice too.

Can't beat the location and the price - and the free Wi-Fi. 

Also the band that plays on Sunday mornings is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hot vanilla chai tea latte. I am a chai addict so if they have it, get a chai cupcake too!! 

They also have live music some nights.

Only downside- parking is a pain in the butt."}
{"text":"I love the sense of community that I feel at copperstar coffee. I feel that is due largely in part to the influence of the manager, who is a great guy. The only thing that downs this place a star for me is inconsistency in product. Otherwise... I highly recommend copperstar to anyone! It's got a unique vibe that you won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm so used to the fancy old Starbucks drive thru, that I almost forgot how it all started. Copper Star Coffee has such an adorable drive thru, brings me back to the \"old days\" that I was obviously not alive for, but have seen on TVs. 

It's a worn down, almost dinky little drive thru path, where you stop in front of a door that looks like the entrance to an underground society. A pretty, blonde, lovely lady then comes out to take your order on a notepad. I felt super American, and I loved it!!! 

I ordered an iced coffee, with almond milk, largest size they have. She went back into the store and came out within no time with my drink! The iced coffee was great, perfect acidity and lots of ice."}
{"text":"We saw that this place had great reviews and was close to where we live. This place is an old gas station and is really cool. The food and drinks are fantastic and all homemade. They have free drink cards which is great so you get stamps every time you go. Everything is amazing and I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"-Weird smell when you first walk in...what is that? Rotten wood?

-SERVICE: friendly, helpful, and eager to please.

-COFFEE: Pretty good! Decent prices (in line with any other coffee place).

-AMBIENCE: Looks hip & comfy, but I didn't hang around.

-PARKING: convenient.

-I would come back for sure if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Favorite coffeeshop in Phoenix. Great music, good friendly crowd, awesome staff. Love their pastries and lattes & drip coffee"}
{"text":"Can I just start by saying how much love I have for our local coffee shops?  You just can't beat the personal attention and genuine care these places give.  You all know I love me some Giant on my Monday mornings (close to work! great vibe! good music!  STELLAR coffee!) and I gotta get down on Jobot on my way in to my second job.  Songbird's been frickin' killin' it with a PERFECT, CONSISTENT spicy chai (make it dirty) and then there's my home coffee shop: Copper Star.  

Ooooooooooh, Copper Star, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways. Their drinks are great.  They showcase local art.  The music is good.  Their baristas are genuinely nice people.  Seriously.  I might hug one of them next time I go in.  But it's the FOOD that prompted this post.  Today I discovered their vegan, gluten-free, peanut-butter oatmeal cookies.  I know there are people out there that imagine that vegan and gluten free can't possibly be good, but I honest-to-god believe that the 3 (maybe 3? Maybe 20?) minutes I spent enjoying that cookie may have been some of the best minutes of my life.  I can't really pin down how long it was, because I'm pretty sure that cookie helped me transcend space and time.  SO. Good.

I went back later for the vegan rosemary green chile potato soup.  O.M.G.

 Copper Star.   CenPho.  Happy happy happiness.

P.S.  The patio's great too!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly hipster coffee shop. I wish they use better almond milk though.. Silk brand is a nono for me"}
{"text":"Well this is quite the hidden gem! Learned about it thru an email sent from Phoenix New Times. The chai is amazing, Cubano is amazing, and our pastries were amazing. A unique vibe with good music selection and even better volume. It's easy to talk or concentrate. Just a good ambiance overall. Plenty of seating including couches, tables bar stools and a small patio space. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"What a fab coffee place!! I love the design and style, the patio is cute and cozy, and OMG, THE COFFEE IS ACTUALLY GOOD. 1 free refill on iced coffee, and I assume regular coffee, equals A WIN!!!  Times NINE.  can't wait to head back to Copper Star. 
 :)"}
{"text":"Simple menu for coffee and delish muffins (and all sort of bakery goodies). The decor is pretty cool (antique and sinister touch) with full if characteristics. It's not a fancy coffee spot but I would most definitely want to visit more as a local citizen...it has its uniqueness and charms. At the moment, the outdoor patio is just a perfect spot. Loved coffee time with friends...I am proud to be a local here."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a study session and a cup of coffee. Delicious and quick. Sometimes acoustic music at night- beautiful. Always a pleasure to come back."}
{"text":"When I first try a new coffeehouse, the true taste test for me is an Americano. For the hubby, it's a vanilla latte with whole milk. 

Not sure what beans they are using, but my Americano was excellent. Definitely a drink that I would order here again. I did make the embarrassing mistake of ordering a \"tall\" rather than saying 12 ounce. The person taking my order starting pulling a cup out of the stack that seemed to be taller than the Empire State Building, while saying \"this or do you mean this?\" without missing a beat and also pulling the 12 ounce size cup. 

At first I sat inside on one of the orange couches, but as the a/c seemed to blow cold air directly on me, I made the move outside to the patio. 

Cute place. Great coffee."}
{"text":"This place is so nice and homey. Great local place to hang out and have strong hot coffee."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Copper Star. Great service and even better coffee and breakfast bagels are life! When you go in, be sure to ask for Annalia. first of all, that's the coolest name I've ever heard! And she is so sweet and hipster lol. She could definitely be the poster girl for Copper Star Coffee! Anyways I had the green Tea Chiller with Mantra. Very good! Easy to miss this place as its small and on 7th Ave with everything else, but believe me. It's worth the U-Turn to get to this place!"}
{"text":"really cool inside and out,  great lavender lattes,  so hard to find anywhere else. food is made fresh and excellent,  try the chicken curry salad. staff great.  the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is seating can be limited."}
{"text":"I just moved to this walkable neighborhood, and am attempting to get off my lazy butt and walk around more. Copper Star is only 5 minutes away from me so I walked on over today. 

As a former Slavebux employee, I loved the nice, laid-back vibe. It's small but has a nice variety of seating and a little patio. I also loved the variety of people I saw- the place is very accepting of PDA by same sex couples, for example. Definitely a hipster vibe without being too overly pretentious.

I tried a Cubano, which I hadn't had before. Definitely worth a try- it's espresso pulled with cinnamon and raw sugar, condensed milk, and steamed milk. 

I see some reviews about the poor wifi. I dunno if that is still a problem but I have to say when the wifi went out at the 'bux there was really nothing we as the employees could do except call the cable company- yet me and the other baristas got bitched at nonstop. So I know it sucks but have some patience.

At any rate, I will be back just because it is a perfect walking distance destination for my study/coffee sessions."}
{"text":"I really like here!! I came here for the first time for a one-on-one meeting. Parking is a lil sketch, but the staff will help you figure it out. Also the macaroons are worth the stress. Like, SO worth it.

I'm really a fan but I docked one star for irresponsible waste bins. I took a peak in the can and nearly everything inside was recyclable.

D: WHYY"}
{"text":"This is the closest coffee shop to my house. It's  super cool that it's a retro gas station where you can actually pull up to the pump to get your cup. Not only with tasty beverages they also offer yummy treats, gluten free and vegan options as well. Copper star coffee is a must try if you are in the Melrose district."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I have to admit, i haven't tried the cupcakes.  I have been there many times for a scone and coffee though and the service is impeccable.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the atmosphere, well, the chairs and tables.  I prefer something a little more comfortable and plush, but if you are into industrialish decor, this is for you."}
{"text":"Cute patio, good hummus plate, nice place to go and sit for a while. I didn't try any drinks when I was here but I would come back. The only thing I didn't like was how dark/shadowy it was inside during the day and it looked a bit dusty. Still a cute coffee shop though with kind staff."}
{"text":"Cool old gas station converted to a coffee shop. Very reasonable prices all around. Tropical smoothie 
Is yummy. Big Blueberry muffin wasn't bad, could have had bolder flavor. Big comfy orange leather couches. Cool spot for sure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Arizona! They are consistent with making my coffee perfect and are consistently friendly! Also, they're always sweet to my dog. Hands down, favorite coffee shop!"}
{"text":"LOVE this coffee house. 

Excellent service from down-to-earth and honest-to-goodness staff, a drive through service for those mornings on the go, appropriate pricing, fresh baked goods, and delicious coffee (according to my coffee guzzling fiance). 

My only complaint - and it is a small one - is their chai. Sigh....some love it, so it may be just your cup of tea (teeheehee), but I like my chai with a bit more spice. But, as I write that I just realized if I were to ask the staff, they could probably just add in a little extra spice. Because, yes, they are that nice."}
{"text":"simple, beautuful space inside with delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"My morning stop! The coffee is great, the staff is friendly, the service is quick, and the prices are fair.what more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"Cool place with lots of charm, this ain't no chain coffee house.

I just had an iced coffee which was very good and the red cupcake.  

-----I'm gonna get kicked in the nads and/or have several drinks thrown on me at the next Yelp event for sure for this next comment.--- 

The cupcake was just average, and the frosting was even a bit grainy. 

I'm gonna go buy a \"cup\" now so it doesn't hurt when I get kicked in the nads by everyone who loves their cupcakes."}
{"text":"This adorable gas station turned coffee shop is exactly what I was looking for Thanksgiving day. No, I'm not the jerk who wants employees to be away from their loved ones to make me coffee, but a person desperately needing a jolt of caffeine before our Friendsgiving celebration. 

A small walk from my hotel brought me to this little oasis with a great coffee and food selection. Turns out the whole family works from 7-11 every Thanksgiving because the husband, \"Needs his fix.\" Of course I understand and am thankful for his addiction too!

Everyone was very friendly, Christmas music was playing and regulars stopped in for coffee and to pick up pre made Thanksgiving pies. The whole atmosphere made me happy and grateful. 

Oh, and the lavender latte made with house made lavender syrup, awesome!

Stop in, you'll not regret it!"}
{"text":"Love this place.... Excellent coffee! My go to when in the area, everyone is so friendly!"}
{"text":"it has, that draw. a staple in Phoenix, Copper Star Coffee. Setting a high standard for quality in coffee and baking this place has built a great reputation.  William T. describes the place as \"Very old school\"  I agree, This place keeps its simple and relaxing.  

Off 7th Ave, its a cool joint, from the outside its noticeably an old gas station and once your inside you know your in a serious coffee house. 

Big time fan (3,1/2stars)  Copper Star Coffee is another pit stop that provides this city with its heartbeat.  These little stop shops gives us a little time in society to see or neighbors up close.  Thank you, you small businesses like Copper Star that keep our city one step ahead of our corporate friends such as one that also has a star in their name  

4220 N 7th Ave is just North of the Indian school 7th Ave. I lived near hereand what a find."}
{"text":"I moved  to melrose recently and this place is the best. I don't love their coffee because they don't do cold brew but I don't care because everyone here is full of heart and good energy. I came every day when I was IN training for a new job and having a slew of health problems and the people made my day over and over again. For 10 minutes I forgot about life stress. It was like therapy coming in here. Thank you so much for your awesome atmosphere. Also, the banana bread is really tasty!"}
{"text":"Overrated, trying too hard and wifi too slow to use. Copper Star is like if Lux and Long John Silver's (what's with the front-lit, cartoony menus on the wall?) had a baby. 

At least they serve Oregon Chai."}
{"text":"Copper Star is a old gas station converted into a coffee house.  You sit inside, out front, or just take the drive through and wait for a gas attendant oops I mean a barista to take your order at the pump! The coffee and egg sandwiches are good but if you try anything take a bite out of the cupcakes made in house! They are award winning!"}
{"text":"Copper Star hits all the marks. The baristas are all awesome people and although I only order iced mochas, they are consistently delicious which is more than I can say for other coffee places (coughstarbuckscough). Copper Star has a great shaded patio, and a drive thru window. One of my favorite spots in phoenix."}
{"text":"Lost a star for making me feel dumb when I walked in the door at the front of the establishment facing the street...that turns out to be the door to the kitchen. No sign saying \"Please enter around the side\" or anything like that. 

Coconut latte was yummy. The interior was quiet, no techno Christmas music like you might be bombarded with at Lux. 

I could see hanging here if I lived around the corner, but I don't, and there are too many good coffee places between me and CSC (Lola, Lux, Drip...) for me to make a trip here unless I'm already in the area.

Plus, the aforementioned stupid \"back\" door...I might boycott just for that."}
{"text":"I've always backed out of coming here due to their inconvenient parking situation, but was finally determined what made Copper Star a star coffee shop making it one of the Top 10 Coffee Shops in Phoenix!

I love how charming the cafe was, totally retro and it being an old gas station with a functioning drive thru. Taking a peek at the menu, they serve coffee and tea, pastries as well as food items. The gal who took my order was absolutely sweet and gave me recommendations, although I had my eyes set on the Lavender Mocha, she suggested it with white chocolate and so it was. I also wanted a bite to eat and settled for the Blueberry tart, which she so kindly gave it to me on the house for being a first timer. If that isn't hospitality, I don't know what is!

My Lavender Mocha was delicious iced, good lavender flavor without being too soapy and perfectly sweet with a good caffeine buzz. The white chocolate recommendation was great! The Blueberry tart was amazing, one of the best fruit tarts I've had in a while. The crust was so buttery and crumbly with the blueberry compote naturally sweet and a perfect proportion with the crust.

The atmosphere is great for studying and working, as there are tons of seating ranging from bar, table and sofa. Outlets available along the wall for those using their laptops. Huge windows, garage doors, really let in the natural light and let you admire the outdoors in the AC filled cafe. 

Loved the service here, the environment and quality of coffee and pastries. Two thumbs up and definitely going to be back to try more of their awesome and yummy looking pastries and drinks! Only docking a star, maybe 1/2 a star, for the large amounts of flies in the shop and the fact I got bit by two mosquitos sitting in the back corner of the cafe. NBD."}
{"text":"Amazing white lavender mocha. Amazing coffee. Amazing blended caramel coffee. Everything is incredible. Including the staff. So nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is eclectic and amazing! I was running late to a workshop in Central Phoenix and the traffic was so bad that I thought, \"What the heck?\" The sign stated there was a drive-thru so I decided to check it out. 

It technically isn't a drive-thru, as peeps come out to take your order right at your car. I was behind another car for only a few minutes and a handsome man, named Bill, asked if I had been helped. I told him no and that I had never been there. He said he would buy me a muffin for my first visit. I politely declined as I have gluten allergies. He told me they had a gluten free muffin and he would get me one. He started to tell me what kind of berry, but he had me at \"gluten free.\" 

He went inside, got my coffee and muffin. I paid, and waived as I drove away, thinking to myself that I will most definitely be back to the Cooper Star and I will tell ALL of my friends! 

Great service! You put the Star in Cooper Star!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Well priced, nice ambience and I love having a berry muffin with my coffee! So good!"}
{"text":"Lovely little local cafe with nice atmosphere, good cafe, drive through window, and a nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"I was having a bad day a few days ago.  I was driving around from bar to bar (before you jump to conclusions, I had to drop promo kits off at bars for my job) and it was hot, and some of the bars were exceptionally hard to find. Did I mention it was swelteringly hot?

So when I saw the heraled Copper Star Coffee come into my view, I thought- what the hell- I'll give it a whirl.  I went in and instantly started to feel better.  It's so cool in there.  And the chairs are so plush and inviting.  

I got a caramel iced coffee and a chocolate cupcake with sprinkles.  It was just what I needed. I was probably about 5 minutes away from road rage when Copper Star saved me.  Thank you Copper Star.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Copper Star is a great independent coffee house which you should support with your hard earned cash.  Now.  Quick, while I'm still sitting here in Copper Star using the free wireless and debating buying one of their T-Shirts.

I find the atmosphere to my liking.  It has sort of a post-industrial-masculine-unpretentious sort of thing going on.  The neighborhood seems to be waning sketchy waxing to hip trendy.

My very good iced coffee is almost gone and they just cleared my plate from the cupcake I recently finished.

I'll be back.  Gabi is having Yelp office hours here.  I might make that one."}
{"text":"This spot is calm and inviting, hip and moder, and lacking the pretension that can so often ruin a coffee shop. The coffee is fantastic and it's a good spot to spend a couple of hours on a rainy day, as my girlfriend and I did recently. This little stretch of 7th Ave. has become quite the hip little haven for Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE coffee shop!! I get the iced Cubano and I mean it's PERFECT every single time plus, it's super great that I can drive thru and get it and not have to go in because it is usually busy and parking is difficult. Anyway love this place!"}
{"text":"I believe the barista's name was Alicia..the one with the Donnie Darko bunny tattoo. She was very friendly, talkative, warm, and welcoming. The pastries were really good..we had a chocolate cookie, red velvet cupcake, and a rice crispy treat. The iced green tea is a good size and it's really tasty. You also get free refills all day on tea. Their coffee is really good and you get one free refill and any refills after that are only 50 cents. Their hummus tray was the best one I've ever had! It was better than Pita Jungle or any of those places..it's also not over priced. I highly recommend the hummus tray and the iced green tea! Yum! I also love that this place is an old renovated gas station. They have a cute drive thru as well if you're in a hurry. One last thing is that they have misters on their patio to keep it cool..gets got here in phx! I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"perfect place to sit and enjoy some delicious coffee in a relaxing environment with friendly staff and vegan items available, as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! The coffee is awesome, the cappuccino's are outrageously good, and the baked goods are off the chain. I go here with my dad probably every other week. I'd go more if it wasn't about 25 minutes away from my house. Right now I can't have caffeine, but they have great cocoa, and berry smoothies. I could sit there all day and eat anything that they baked. Scones, and muffins, cookies and cake, oh my!

If you haven't been yet try it."}
{"text":"All the staff are awesome! Great baked goods, music on patio. The owner is so nice and I hear he's a great boss! Love Adrian , Cameron and the new girl from Alaska :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and they left me with a super great first impression. They recommended the Cubano for me and it's amazing! I also got the mango blueberry muffin which I really enjoyed. The service was excellent as well. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Small coffee shop. 

I only gave it 3 stars because I went here to get free WiFi because my condo's internet went out, to discover the WiFi here was in and out. I even told the employee there that the internet was down and he tried to reset the wireless, but still the WiFi did not work. 

I got a chai latte here. It was good, but I was disappointed that it was my first time there and I wasn't offered a punch card, the \"special offer\" on Yelp. However, the customer after me got one, which kind of ticked me off. 

There isn't much parking, so you have to find parking on the streets. 

Overall, probably wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"I am ashamed to say I have never set foot in this place.  It's on the short drive from my house downtown to my parents' joint in North Central, so my lazy ass pulls up once a week in a bathrobe or some shit and orders a few hot ones from the nice girl at the gas pump.  And she never laughs at me for being underdressed for Copper Star.  And I am consistently satisfied by the barristery degree of yum.

One day when I am not wearing Bullwinkle slippers I shall enter the premises and likely realize it deserves a fifth Copper star."}
{"text":"I visited 4/5 mornings while on a recent trip to Phoenix--I need my espresso, and even very good diner coffee doesn't cut it.  I was thrilled to find Copper Star on yelp, and even happier when we pulled up.  The place just feels laid back and comfortable.  I wish I'd had a chance to relax on the shady patio--maybe next time.

The espresso (doppio, black) was very good--not burned like Starbucks, and fairly fruity.  I also had a couple of almond milk cappuccinos, which were also perfectly made.  

For the first 2 days I stopped in, the most amazing cake was sitting on the baked goods case.  I met the woman (maybe the owner?  not sure) who does all of the baking, and she shared that she uses old-fashioned recipes.  It was very early and not cake hour for me, so I resisted, but wow. 

Everyone was very friendly and laid back.

Can't wait to visit again the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"In all honesty, this place is everything a coffee shop should be: comfortable, friendly, delicious drinks, an artsy hole-in-the-wall vibe...etc. It has become my go-to coffee shop for so many reasons. Whenever I'm too lazy/late to make coffee at home, I leave it up to the staff at CS to start my day off right. OR If I know that my own coffee pot won't do the trick on any given day, this is where I go. The staff is unbelievably friendly, the coffee is made to the T, and their baked goods are always deliciously satisfying (not to mention, vegan-friendly if you're into that). Copper Star pays close attention to the quality of service and goods they provide, which is hard to ignore. There's more than one reason why I keep coming back here, and when you give this place a shot you'll see why.

Overall, Copper Star owns the coffee biz West of Central. There's no reason to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to let a business' really cool atmosphere or architecture influence my impression of the place more than its food or drinks (would I like the donuts at one of those stands with a huge donut shape on top more than any other donuts?), but I might have to make an exception for Copper Star. We stopped by earlier this week for Yelp office hours (thanks again, Gabi, for organizing) and got an iced latte. It was good, but what really impressed me about this place is that it's in an old converted gas station! I just think that is so fun and cool, and it adds so much to the place's charm. I didn't get to try any of the pastries or sandwiches, and I'd love to come back to try the peach latte that Sofia L raves about, for now, I'll just say that this is a local business with good espresso and friendly staff that's in an old gas station - how cool is that?!"}
{"text":"Copper Star used to almost be in my backyard with I lived next to 7th Ave. The coffee and pastries were always great, and the atmosphere felt like it was authentic without trying to emulate what a coffee shop should be. The seating inside was very comfortable and conducive to a social setting."}
{"text":"This is my go to coffee shop! I will wake up early or drive a little further just so I can grab a latte from Copper Star. Forget burnt Sbux or waiting in line forever at Dutch. The staff at Copper Star is so friendly, the vibe is right, and the coffee is just the way I like it. 

I highly recommend this coffee shop. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Can you say: cranberry scone with a 32 oz iced coffee (camel syrup, English toffee syrup, & carmel syrup)!?! That's my everyday.. I had a friend order that & they said: hey that's like that lady's coffee. When she told them it was, they were like OMGoodness. I got her addicted too!!  
The Morning Glory muffins are my 2nd fav. There is the breakfast bagel, BLT, coconut cookie, oh & something like a Reece's PC, but Waaaay better. Oooooo sugar coma!!!  I've had other things, but those mentioned above are my favorites! If you're into smoothies, this isn't the place. Sara is the BEST baker!!! Keep it local peeps!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and the employees are pretty friendly.  The vibe is laidback and neighborhoody, making you want to hang out there forever.  They make an excellent Iced Chai Tea Latte and the giant cupcake that I had was delicious as well.

I only wish I lived within walking distance of Copper Star so that I wouldn't have to worry about parking, which can be a bit tricky at times.

Definitely check out the cool bathrooms (I'm guessing the men's is as nice as the women's) before you leave."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place - it's an old gas station remodeled into a hipster-ish coffee shop. There is a great variety of drinks, and different kinds of teas to choose from (which can be made both hot and iced), and plenty of seating both inside and outside. The walls are decorated with various art for sale and the entire place has a very \"urban-hip\" feel to it. The outside also has a nice small patio nestled between some trees and bushes, making it inviting to sit in. They also have a small variety of fresh pastries to choose from. Employees have been friendly the times I've been here as well. Only negative I'd have is that they do not really seem to have any dedicated parking - just one or two spots and handicap spots, so you have to look on the street."}
{"text":"We love Copper Star! We live in the neighborhood and walk over almost every weekend. The drinks are delicious and the breakfast bagels are great too. We love the ambiance and the staff is great. Couldn't ask for a better coffee shop in our hood."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of revisiting Copper Star Coffee again this week and it was just as good as ever. 
I would recommend that you give them a try!!
Their Americano's are great!!"}
{"text":"\"Is this your first time here?\" she asked in her cute, lilac-haired voice. \"Yes it is\" was my reply. \"Let me buy you a pastry!\" she declared as I glared at all of her sweetness, from top to bottom. She had gooey, sticky, and no doubt very, very sweet things to offer and it was all made right behind the counter in her open kitchen. Pointing to the high-rise layer cake on display I asked her \"is that real?\". \"Heck yeah it is, it's a peach cake.\". I didn't want to be an obvious glutton so I opted for the banana and walnut bread and ordered a blended coffee- both of which I was very satisfied with. Will I always stop by when I'm on 7th ave from now on? Heck yeah."}
{"text":"Used to be an old gas station. Creatively decorated, warm, chill spot. Very good coffee & exceptional danishes & baked goods.  Very friendly staff. Nice break from weird hipsters at other coffee shops.  Has better community vibe."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! I sat in the patio area and it was a lovely 75 degrees today. The foliage was nice and shady. I enjoyed a green tea chiller that tasted more like a lavender chiller, but it was still pretty tasty. Also had a big ole crazy lavender cupcake for breakfast that had a colorful array of toasted coconut flakes infused with herbs and curry flavors. Definitely did not expect an explosion of flavors in my breakfast of champions. The BLT sandwich my bf had was a bit mediocre though, but it is after all a coffee shop. This is the Phoenix sister of Brasil's in Houston. Will definitely recommend to anyone who wants a local vibe."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today inbetween visiting my patients for work, just needed some hot tea. I noticed on the menu that there was a Hummus Bagel. I asked the guy if it was vegan friendly and he said that it was. I came back later in the day for lunch, which was out of my way mind you, to order the \"vegan friendly\" bagel and the guy told me that he is \"pretty sure\" the bagels contain eggs. I told him that I was told the exact opposite this morning. He said, \"yeah I don't know we get it from the bakery.\" Okay, thanks! Seriously! Why are two different employees giving me two different answers. Get it together, food allergies are not something to be taken lightly. I will not return."}
{"text":"When I'm schlepping a car full of wee people around Phoenix to preschool and play-dates, Copper Star Coffee is the fuel that get me through. I patron their awesome car-hop service several times a week.  The staff is always friendly, and the service is speedy.  And of course, the coffee is absolutely delicious.

I like to order flavored iced coffees. They never over-sweeten--the taste of the coffee always comes through. I've also enjoyed their chai, and my mother-in-law enjoys their drip coffee. 

When I am free from baby-shackles, I love to sit inside with my laptop for some uninterrupted work time. The atmosphere inside is lovely with great music and natural light pouring in from the windows. 

Copper Star is the best place for keeping one's coffee-cash local!"}
{"text":"This little gas station converted to coffee shop is a great gem.  The owner is amazing and all the employees are very helpful and friendly. The coffee is probably one of the bests that I have had in Arizona. The food is all freshly made with the best ingredients. Although I have only tried their muffins, which a ginormous and most delicious I have ever had, I plan to go back and try more on the menu. Maybe next time I'll do a breakfast sandwich.  Thanks to my coworker to introducing me to this fabulous coffee shop."}
{"text":"The only issue i have with this place is parking when it's busy, but really, that's not even that bad!
The coffee is yum, the pastries delicious, and when i need some brain food after studying their hummus plate always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I am vacillating between 3 and 4 stars. 
I liked the overall feel of the coffee shop. The barista was very personable and the flavor of my vanilla latte was smooth.
The actual physical space was interesting with enough room for a few groups or couples to sit and enjoy their coffee. They have two couches that would allow five or six people to enjoy a relaxing coffee meeting.
The outside area has a number of tables and some trees and shrubs but it could definitely use a broom and a clean up.
Overall, this is a good local coffee shop."}
{"text":"Copper Star is a converted old school gas station in the middle of the Melrose District serving up delicious coffee for over ten years. The staff is friendly and they have vegan options for their baked goods. While Copper Star has a great reputation, it is also a place you have to try more than once for it to grow on you. 
This tiny café is a great spot to catch up or meet with a group, and the Yarn-Knitting Club may still meet there on Wednesday evenings. 
The first time I came, I tried their Lavender Mocha and it just wasn't that great. The mocha overpowered the lavender, and when I did taste the lavender it tasted harsh. I spoke with a barista afterward and they agreed that that is a tough mix to get right, but to give CS a second chance.
With that in mind, I bravely came back and I ordered an iced Raspberry Mocha latte instead, and I was sold. Every morning, well, most mornings, I drive up to the dinky drive thru to get my Raspberry Mocha on the way to work, and even though it's rich in mocha, it's a damn strong brew, and it's all I need to get my day started."}
{"text":"Great service, yummy baked goods, and pretty good coffee. Would love to see them use cartel or press beans!"}
{"text":"Love the variety of coffee flavors and the atmosphere. The pastries are not too sweet  and pair perfect with the coffee. It's a laid back coffee shop for those of us that want to escape your basic Starbucks. I'm usually a die-hard Dutch Bros fan but every once in a while we all need some quiet lol."}
{"text":"A local favorite of mine. Copper Star has a chill atmosphere, artsy appealing aesthetic, friendly staff and delicious treats on their menu. From their sweet cupcakes, muffins and iced coffee to their hummus and tea, I can generally find something that is worth it each time. It's a great place to meet friends or sit and work on your laptop. If you're on a hunt for great vintage pieces in the Melrose District this is great place to stop for a break."}
{"text":"This is a nice coffee shop in an area that is seemingly transforming (if not already) into Phoenix' gayborhood main commercial strip. The pastries are okay, but the drinks are really good. It's a bit quieter than corporate coffee chains and it's significantly more neighborly feeling. It is a converted, retro gas station, complete with a garage door. On nice days they open the door to let in fresh air and breezes."}
{"text":"After popping my head into Lux and finding the only available seat in the bathroom, I decided to branch out and try a new coffee adventure. I'm glad I did. Copper Star has a unique coffee menu, funky interior design, a chill outdoor seating area, friendly staff and a open comfortable space for customers to work away on laptops inside with outlets. Apparently that wasn't enough.

So Copper Star brought in a string quartet. On a Monday night.

Seriously Copper Star? You're just going to step up and raise the bar like that on every coffee house in Phoenix? Bringing in a string quartet is an independent coffee house declaration of war. Copper Star is throwing down the homespun, hand-knitted fair trade alpaca gauntlet to every other bean brewer in Phoenix. 

I'm impressed. I'll be back. Also, try the Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"Oregon chai. Spicy Oregon chai. That's all I care about. And Copper Star has it. They also have a nice atmosphere, cool patio with great misters, friendly staff and a big, plush couch.

Sorry, I can't help coffee drinkers with this review.  But if you like chai, they'll make it however you want it--even blended though it's not on the menu.

Now they just need to open up shop in Old Town and I'm set.

Bonus--it's right next to a very cool record store.  That sells real records!"}
{"text":"The place is converted from an old gas station so many of the decor inside reflects that. Stopped by here on the weekend to grab a latte which had good flavor, but I would not go out of my way to get one here. 

Didn't really see anything on the food menu that would bring me back just to try it out.

If I was ever in the area and craving a latte, I would definitely return"}
{"text":"I haven't had any baked goods, but the drinks are awesome and the decor is really fun.  They have a frequent buyer program!"}
{"text":"Fun little spot nestled among some of my favorite shops along 7th Avenue in downtown Phoenix.  The Gridbikes station nearby makes for the perfect Sunday cruise location. Live music at times, solid coffee.  Try the Cubano!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood coffee shop. I initially started coming because of the drive-thru - I'm not one for motor skills before my morning java. The staff is super friendly and perky. Whether they are brewing it up or are just morning people, I'll have what they are having!"}
{"text":"Copper Star is a star baby. The cutest filling station (yes I said filling station, cuz that's how old this place is) turned coffee house in the oh so trendy hood along 7th Ave. I LOVE THIS PLACE. The owners are a wonderful couple (who frequent my FEZ, thank u very much) and the staff is perky and aromatic. Oh, and so is the coffee. I haven't tried any of the bakery items, but the lattes and coffee are right on the mark sistah. The decor is rec room chic. Lots of sunlight and art dotting the walls. Break the Starbuck's habit people. Support local entrepenuers (ok, I totally don't know how to spell that)...Hey, how about a spell check from the yelp people...sup with that? Anyhoo, tip, trip and sip your way to Copper Star. You'll be glad u did. And so will I."}
{"text":"Coffee delicious, pastries delightful, ambiance just what you expect in the neighborhood it's in. Place is wonderful, set in once a gas service station, now a coffee full of everything you can ask for, political conversations, to the beginnings of ones novel. Place is definitely one to make the trip for, and enjoy the beautiful hidden gems downtown Phoenix has to offer. #cafehunters"}
{"text":"Way friendly staff. Great espresso and they always have super good treats in the glass that you have to consider ordering one. Love picking up a coffee and hanging out before picking up dog food next door."}
{"text":"Nice local place, haven't had their coffee yet but their teas are very tasty, had the ice Thai tea and a chocolate cupcake which tasted home baked instead of a package dessert which is good. They also have a drive thru which is very rare in local coffee places. The place is a refurbished gas station which has a nice charming feel to it.

Hope to come back more to try all the drinks on the menu."}
{"text":"Interesting little coffee shop converted from an old gas station.  I enjoyed the small shaded outdoor seating that is dog friendly.  Muffins, pastries and coffee are good.  Staff were courteous but nothing really stood out about it.  It's not going to be a place I'll ever go out of my way to go to."}
{"text":"If you want good coffee without the corporate coffee environment,  then Copper Star Coffee is for you.  Take a seat with some friends and relax on the couch, converse over coffee and the best homemade cupcakes that will ever grace your lips.  This place is top notch, the decor is artsy,  the owner is friendly and his employees are cool.  GO!  ENJOY!  Kick your feet up!  Check out the awesome bathrooms too. FREE WI-FI."}
{"text":"Cubano and lemon poppyseed muffin awesome.
The repurposing of building and decor too cool.  
The service was on point and some hip customers as well.
Woohoo!"}
{"text":"As far as locally owned coffee shops are concerned, Copper Star is definitely tops. For one, it's an old gas station cutely repurposed as a coffee shops. The decor is hip with local art covering the walls. It's quiet-most of the time there are people there hanging out on their laptops. (Which begs the question-Do coffee shops pay people to hang out on their laptops? Even the grocery store Starbucks has people hanging out!)
Being someone who drinks coffee all the time, I usually opt for nothing too fancy-an iced coffee will do, thank you very much. Oh and can you add some almond milk and vanilla? The coffee here is generally quite good, however sometimes inconsistent. It might not be the coffee though-sometimes the drink just tastes like the syrup is sitting at the bottom. For that reason, I have to knock off a star. :( I still love you Copper Star! Oh and I hardly ever do take advantage of the baked goods but they're always tasty. Get the S'mores brownie if they ever have it and share it with someone so you don't go into a sugar coma."}
{"text":"LOVE Copper Star. Great coffee, great service. The staff and owner are very friendly, and you feel comfortable there. I haven't had any of their pastries or sandwiches, but will.. eventually. I also love that I can walk from my house, and am able to support a LOCAL small business. Also love the patio area, which is also pet friendly, and the drive thru...for the days I don't feel like walking...or being seen."}
{"text":"Fantastic cafe! Took my girlfriend here and is now her new favorite cafe. The place has a few pieces of art that are around that give the place a better looking atmosphere. Food was amazing and healthy. I ordered the chicken curry and she ordered the humus plate. The drinks we ordered were delicious. The customer service was good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee spot in Phoenix. I may be biased because its the closest one to my house, but nonetheless, the services is awesome and so is the coffee!"}
{"text":"So I wanted to give this place a 4 based on the coffee's flavor alone, but I just couldn't. I went here this morning with the BF because I had a phoenix Voice deal for 10$. The place is cute, but others are right when they say there is a weird smell. We each got a latte and a chocolate croissant. The baristas were friendly enough and cute, but they messed up our deal.... our bill came out to 15$ even, and we had the deal for 10$. They charged us 5.95 because the 'tax wasn't included.' Well, the deal is for 10$ in products and we exceeded that, therefore paying the tax within the 5$. I thought that was lame, but I digress, the coffee was good, I liked the milky flavor and I liked that their sizes were a bit more generous than other places for the same price. The coffee was not too acidic and had a strong enough flavor. The croissant, however, was not good at all. It says on their wall they won for best cupcake in phoenix last year.... well I hope it was much better than this, because this was a poor excuse for a croissant. It was not flaky at all, it had more of a donut consistency and the chocolate had a waxy texture. Not good. I would probably go back for coffee.... that's all."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Copper Star coffee and have been visiting them for my caffeine pick-me-up regularly since they opened. I like everything about the place from their smooth rich brew to their tasty freshly baked pastries and salads and the friendly drive-up service. They also, in my opinion, have the best bagels in town. Keep up the great work Copper Star!!"}
{"text":"Owner is superb!  Some of the staff have outstanding personalities while some couldn't even crack a smile.  Food menu needs a few more choices......warning items are pricey"}
{"text":"It gets the job done. The baristas are always friendly and their bathrooms are pretty. The muffins are so-so."}
{"text":"Very load, coffee is great, small place, very trendy and they gave me a free pastry on my first visit which was really nice. Free wifi! Parking was okay. It's a lively place!"}
{"text":"I'm waiting here at Copper Star as my car gets an oil change. The free wifi is a nice perk since I'm supposed to be working right now, but it doesn't make up for the bland toffee coffee ice blended ($4.25 for 16 oz) and greasy crumbly red velvet cupcake ($2.50). 

It's a cute shop though and I'm all about supporting local businesses so I'll give them another shot next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Sometimes, I wish I were a coffee drinker.  I'm not.  I'll have what I call a \"bitch coffee drink\" a couple times a year, but that's it. 
Copper Star is right across the street from my house and I just ventured there for the first time with Nathan S today.
I like the simple menu for drinks.  There are a few different categories and not a million different variations, which I think is cool.  If only other places would \"K.I.S.S.\"
I had the toffee coffee drink, and it was pretty good.  Not great.  Good.  I also had an apple croissant.  BARELY tasted the apples.  The croissant itself was light, buttery and flaky.  But, where were the apples?????????????
I love the atmosphere here.
I am seriously thinking of becoming a coffee drinker.  That's a key product here and MAYBE the stars would go up if I could taste the quality of the coffee."}
{"text":"I've only ever gone through the drive through but it's a pretty cool set up. The staff is always super friendly and I can just tell them what kind of taste I'm going for and they whip up something that's super yummy. One of these days I'm gonna have to go in and try out some of the baked goods."}
{"text":"In town for business and was looking for a coffee shop to do some reading and relax a bit. This one did not disappoint - really friendly staff and a great americano. Then, unexpectedly, a blues band set up and began to play. Super relaxed and easy going vibe and a great place to work or hang out."}
{"text":"Best Cubano coffee in town! I enjoy it hot or cold, either way it's absolutely amazing. The service is good and the vibe is inviting. If you haven't tried the pastries, I recommend the homemade pecan pie. Amazing!"}
{"text":"1: Best Cappuccino in some time. Great source, great roast;
2) While I'd rather eat a piece of raw broccoli, barista Caolan said \"first time customers get a free pastry\". Told him to pick whatever item customers feel puts them on the map, but nite there's *maybe* two bites of the caramel/chocolate muffin he forced upon me.
 
Curse you and your inevitable goodness, Caolan. A Journey most worthy on so many levels -"}
{"text":"I have stopped into Copper Star on previous occasions, during street festivals, but today was the first time I came to sit and study. Man, am I a fan of this place. I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it. Employees were nice, free wi-fi (internet key is needed but on a sign in the shop), and I enjoyed my small, mint mocha with a chocolate chip cookie (both just under $7). I was definitely eyeing the cupcakes in the bakery window but my tummy only had enough room for a cookie (which was soooo good if I might say). They are open until 9pm on Sundays which is pretty cool. I have yet to use their drive through for coffee, but they are open pretty early which is nice competition to SBUX. There is also outdoor seating which will be so nice when it starts to cool off....you can give your dog a bath at Wag-n-Wash next door and then sit outside with them while you enjoy some local coffee."}
{"text":"I was running low, so I tried to stop for gas until I realized it was a coffee shop!  Unbelievable!

BUT

I was very impressed with everything about this place...the presentation, the coffee, the coffee cake!
I had the coffee cake and iced Cubano coffee beverage.  It was delicious and CSC was very efficient at the drive-thru."}
{"text":"The decor is great, along with the atmosphere but their iced Chai is lacking. I requested a large iced Chai with two espresso shots. I watched as the girl preparing it over filled it and didn't leave enough room for the ice and proceeded to dump the milk and espresso out to make room for the ice. She also added the chai syrup after the ice. The end result was weak and not properly mixed. I would've asked for a new, properly made $6 doller dirty chai, but it was 10:30am on a Saturday, and busy."}
{"text":"I was totally impressed by this place. It's not one of those huge coffee shops that everyone knows about, but I'm ok with that. I loved the comfortable feel of the space, the local art, and if I were rating just on baristas, I would ask for a sixth star to be added to my review. 

When deciding what to order, I asked several questions,  and the barista asked if I'd been in before. I mentioned it was my first time, and she said my HUGE lemon scone was on the house then. Free pastries may be the way to my heart, but even if it wasn't free I would've still loved my visit here. Definitely get the lemon scone (perfectly not too sweet). They make all their baked goods in house, and the variety is impressive. 

I also tried the cubano which is a drink made with espresso shots pulled with sugar and has condensed milk added to it. I've never had anything like it, and I kinda want to go back now just for another one. Warning: combining pastries and the cubano might be too much sugar for those without a big sweet tooth. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Copper Star Coffee could easily be confused as a gas station from the road. The building still has gas pumps and looks super cool from the outside. 

I really liked the jasmine pearls tea I ordered from here, although they give you the hugest cup ever! 32 ounces of tea for 2 dollars. That's a lot of tea!

The atmosphere is really cute inside too. Lots of paintings and comfy couches. I'd definitely check out this place again the next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I had to check it out.  Unfortunately, I think I'm going to have to go again.  Not that it's bad that I'm going again mind you, it's just that I didn't really get to see it tonight.  Ok, I saw it....  (Talking in circles, Kristin - get it together....)

We walked up.  There was a crowd.  They all seemed to be looking one direction.  And then, before we'd finished crossing the street I knew that we were about to enter.... 

The Poetry Reading zone!

Don't get me wrong, I love a little poetry reading now and then.  But they'd kinda taken over the place.  I wanted to see the Star in its natural environment.  Instead we walked in mid performance (about a donut without a hole and its chance for better in the next life - from what I overheard) and practically tip-toed over to the counter.  As we couldn't speak up, the barrista didn't hear us approach (She was making some sort of baked good with her hands all up in it).  Finally, when folks clapped, she walked over and whispered to us so we didn't interrupt the performance.  

Yea, she was nice, the Chai was good, and the brownie was rockin. And the place was just as beautiful as the pictures I'd seen. I SO love the bathroom sink!  But I still feel like I haven't BEEN there.  I've been to the Copper Star Poetry Hour - but not to the Copper Star.  

Oh darn.  Forced to re-visit a cool coffee place.  So tragic.  

Maybe I should write a poem about it...."}
{"text":"To be succinct:

$2.50 for my iced Americano - just like the menu said it would be. Of course, I had to ask where the menu was - amusing. My Americano was spot-on. I barely had to add any milk or sugar.

Such a small space with hardly any parking whatsoever. Inside, very little options when sitting. No, I don't want to sit on a wooden chair for over 2 hours, thanks. Wish this place had more plush seats. 

Decor is cool and relaxing. Really liked the layout and I found the bathroom to be even cool. Go fig. Service was prompt and friendly. 

I'd go back, yes. But only to grab and run - maybe even do the drive-thru thing. Doubt I could find an open seat inside (or a parking spot outside), so why bother?"}
{"text":"Thumbs up to Copper Star. My friendly neighborhood coffee shop is a haven in an urban jungle. It's great to know that there are local coffee joints in Phoenix and CS is one the best. The converted gas station is a great place to hang out, get some coffee, and use the free wi-fi (woo-hoo!). The staff is friendly, the decor hip and the cupcakes tasty! Do yourself a favor and visit Copper Star."}
{"text":"They have good coffee, but their customer service is questionable. Some of the employee's have been great, but a handful have put an off attitude and energy every time we have gone (just a few times) which takes away from the rest of the greatness that is Copper Star."}
{"text":"Love love love!! This place is great! The drinks are yummy and the service is super!!

Last time I got an iced chai that was a little too spicy for my taste and this time I went the guy said he'd make it sweeter and if I didn't like it I wouldn't pay for it and he'd get me something else. I did like it and he gave me a coupon because I didn't like it last time.

Really generous, truly a servant.

Plus this place has such a great charm! Clean,"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Everyone is friendly and the coffee is so good.  They have good frozen coffee drinks and pretty decent food for a coffee shop.  Good urban environment also. They also have a punch card."}
{"text":"What a great place! My sister in law and I stopped in for a coffee date and we weren't disappointed! They gave us a free pastry of our choice for being first time customers. We both chose their house made cinnamon rolls and they were absolutely delicious. Not to mention, their coffee is amazing! Ready to go back. Excellent customer service as well!"}
{"text":"Very cute place, nice working atmosphere, no loud music (unlike many coffee places in the Valley). Chai is very sweet (be warned), but the rest of the atmosphere and delicious treats make up for it."}
{"text":"Luv Copper Star! Customer service is awesome! Their BLT is the best ever!! Luv the smoothies n muffins!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have excellent coffee and we come a few times a week usually. The last couple time though I've seen this employee or owner of the wag and wash across the street come in wearing sandals, walks right behind the line and makes him self a drink, grab a cookie... doesn't even think to wash his hand. It really just doesn't seem appropriate. I don't know what you were doing over there... touching animals, dog food, etc. I'm sorry but it just doesn't look right as a good service worker to see that and for that guy to think it's okay. If it weren't for that hands down 5 star review"}
{"text":"Copper Star Coffee -  A lucky stumble off of Seventh Ave. The coffee is excellent and the ambiance inviting. The menu offers a variety of beverage and food options, yet is not overwhelming. Either a scone, cupcake or sandwich (which are all homemade by the way) compliment a latte wonderfully. The combo of the coffee, food, comfy couches, stacks of magazines and free WiFi, makes Copper Star better than my own living room!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh! I agree with many of you yelpers about the Copper Star Coffee Shop! Its a charming little spot! I didn't realize it was an old gas station! That explain the odd shape on the inside! Pretty cool! I will say thay have some fab desserts in this spot to for a coffee shop! My friend of mine goes there often to use the free Wi-Fi! I think that is what draws most of their customers. And the staff is pretty accomodating! 

I have a special connection to this place, because I actually recorded my first Youtube.com video there! Well I should say my girlfriend did! It was an impromptu moment! I was held under duress! LOL! 

Anyhow! The teas, coffees and desserts are great! And also check out the little postcard/card stand they have as well. There are some really unique and different cards that I think you will like!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful and friendly place. The coffee is great and the pastries are amazing. Staff is super friendly and the outside patio on the weekends is a slight click below the Westminster Dog Show."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to enjoy a cup of joe. Friendly staff, good coffee and good food. My favorite meal is the chicken salad wrap and I cannot get enough of the lavender mocha. 
Patio is dog friendly. I can bring my pups,  listen to a great band and get work done."}
{"text":"Nice lil spot here...
Have walked past it many many times but never went in.
I don't drink coffee,have an interwebs connection at home,and really have no reason to go...
Until a friend checked in today so I walked over to socialize.It's comfy and cozy both inside and out.
I never know what to order on the rare occasion I do find myself in a coffee place like this,but I do know it'll be expensive.
So I ask about iced teas.The lady behind the counter who was uber friendly and nice recommeneded a few different things and I went with some herbal thingamajig.
Got a BIG cup full of light goodness.I was expecting to hear something like 5 bux,but it was only 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
would I go back?I might rabbit,I might.
Except some of of the denizens were of the hipster faux hippie persuasion,and well,I didn't care all too much for the great unwashed the first time around and I would prefer my tea hippieless here in the new millenium.
If my friend checks in again,I'd follow him over.
Just wouldn't go on my own."}
{"text":"Wow! Such a cute location! We weren't sure upon driving up but super quaint inside. Another plus - we happened to come on their 11th anniversary and the drinks were on the house! We will be returning on our next trip out here!"}
{"text":"LOVE the raspberry white mocha! They also have a peanut butter white mocha I've been meaning to try. 
Always have good music playing & a variety of delicious fresh baked cupcakes & other goodies!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for a local coffee shop so I can get away from the chains.  This gem in is the Melrose District in an old gas station.  Very funky and eclectic.  The usual coffee house fare but added extras like lavender syrup, lavender mochas and tuxedo mochas.  The staff is always very friendly whenever we go there and more than happy to explain the beverages.  There is an old gas pump out front which adds to the charm and there us some outdoor seating and a small fire pit for no burn days.  Inside the old garage beams and lifts are exposed, there is an opening door for nice weather and exposed block.  The comfy orange couches are great and I love the coffee cup cut out on the chairs.  There is also a lot of very interesting local art displayed for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"this place is such a find!!!!
i'm here from los angeles and we drove past it, and the outside looked so cute!! it looks like they turned an abandoned gas station into a coffee shop! 
THEN we went inside which was even CUTER!!! the decor is so nostalgic and rustic, and it just makes me feel at home! i got a chai and a rice crispy treat, both were fantastic!!! 100% recommend!!!"}
{"text":"my favorite downtown coffee place.  The servers are fantastic and there is a big big big selection of teas some that i dont get at other places.  The food is super tasty and fresh and has a lot of good people watching seats. hooray for local owned shops!"}
{"text":"I really like this coffee shop.  Pros:  Natural light (practically sunny inside), super clean (even the bathroom), decent coffee, open and airy, couches, clever design (converted gas station).  Cons:  Located 3 blocks from my ex-boyfriend's house.  Since I live on the other side of town, I cannot come here ever again.  If I run into him, he will think that I am stalking him.  I'm not taking this well (the loss of Copper Star)."}
{"text":"This is my husband's absolute favorite place to get coffee.  It is also a great place to chill and/or get some work done.  I wish there were more."}
{"text":"This is my go-to coffee spot in Phoenix. Coffee and other drinks are good, food is good, pastries are dangerously large and good. I am not sure if they make them in house, but they are exceptional and they go FAST. There are vegan and GF options as well. I love that there is plenty of seating and places to plug in and the wifi is free and you don't have to dance with a barista and prove your worth for the PW - it's written on the wall! My one and only complaint is that whenever I leave here after having spent any more than ten minutes in the building, I smell kinda bad. My clothes and bags,etc. soak up the unique smell of the place, which is a mixture of coffee and something else. Some ventilation might help?? Not sure. It's a dumb thing to complain about considering coffee shops smell like coffee. There are times that I avoid going here because I have somewhere to go after and I don't want to carry that scent with me all day. I would suggest a scone or muffin for sweets, a hummus bagel for eats and a good old fashioned latte for a buzz."}
{"text":"Amazing hummus plate, and a decent cup of coffee. Don't go there expecting to get any particular brew method or even a single origin coffee. It's a simple place to grab a cup of coffee and a full sized snack."}
{"text":"People are always really cool here and their flavors on both their coffee and teas are bold, which I love! The vibe is awesome, and I love their outside seating area and that they support local artists and at times have local bands play there. Their desserts are hot or miss. Some are really bomb! Others are just ok. But overall their vibe and drinks are great."}
