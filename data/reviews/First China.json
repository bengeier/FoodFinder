{"text":"im from Pa where we have excellent Chinese. I've walked into this place and it's very clean. The staff is very friendly and the food is very good. We eat here every Friday since that's our eat out day."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and chose First China based on other Yelp reviews. We've eaten their Sweet & Sour chicken, Lemon Chicken, General Tsao Chicken, Fried Rice, Fried Wontons, Chicken Mai Fun and Fried Dumplings. 

The Lemon Chicken was perfect-  the batter on the chicken breast was light & crispy, not greasy, which means the oil in the fryer is at the correct temperature. (If it's not hot enough, then the batter absorbs a lot of grease.) The homemade lemon sauce was delicious. The Sweet & Sour chicken had a light, puffy batter, also not greasy, and it came with the typical pink sweet & sour sauce on the side. The Chicken Mai Fun had a lot of flavor, sort of garlicky, with a lot of chicken pieces. The sauce on the General Tsao Chicken was sweet & quite spicy! The batter coating the chicken was nice & light.

The reasons I gave 4 stars instead of 5 - the Fried Rice was very bland. The Fried Pork Wontons were ok dipped in the sauce from the fried dumplings, but otherwise would have been bland & dry. We come from the Midwest where all the Chinese food places also have Cream Cheese filled Wontons. No such luck here, but I don't blame the restaurant, as it is probably a regional thing. My husband ate the Fried Dumplings & thought they were ok, but not exceptional. On the one occasion that we ordered takeout instead of eating at the restaurant, they forgot to put one of the items in the bag. We should have double checked before we left. When we got home the phone was ringing & it was the restaurant calling to let us know, which I appreciated, but I still had to make the 10 minute drive back to the restaurant & then another 10 minutes back home again.  

The big bonus-  this restaurant has Cheerwine as one of the selections in their soda fountain. Being new here it was my first experience tasting black cherry goodness of \"the nectar of North Carolina.\" I was hooked after the first sip!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars only because the food has been decent in the past. Tonight's meal was a horrid mass of glutinous battered chicken parts masquerading as Sesame Chicken that literally should not be eaten by man nor beast."}
{"text":"Ok. Where do I begin? 
We decided to order for dinner on Sunday night 11/8 while we were shopping in the area. We went in and there was one tall guy cooking on the grill. He just looked at us without greeting. Then he looked over and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered. He was rude and short with us then just turned and walked away after he gave us the change. I asked how long. 15 min. We walked to the Harris Teeter for a couple things.

Got back. Order was ready. He handed me the bag and I said \"thank you\" and he responded with \"yea,\" turned around and walked away. I understand that there might be a language barrier but rudeness is rudeness no matter what language you speak. 

I went to my car, which was parked right in front, then I saw something very strange. I could see, through the window, into the back of the kitchen, a man. A man squatting, under a table, behind a bucket, aggressively eating what looked like a bowl of rice with chopsticks. This might sound crazy. And it was. So I recorded it. 

It gets worse. We got home and when my daughter lifted the bag a brown liquid was dripping from it. I took the bag then the entire bottom of the bag gave out and our entire order was on the floor of my not so inexpensive car which had just been detailed about a week ago. Then we noticed the smell. A smell of rancid garlic sauce. The smell hit us like a ton of bricks. I brought everything inside and opened my moo shy pork and my entire house filled with that terrible smell. Some had dripped on my jeans and boots. We had to immediately change our clothes. We could not eat any of that food. $27 down the drain but it was not worth it to me to go back into that \"restaurant.\" So we ordered a pizza and threw that shit out. 

So if I could give zero stars I would. This was an irritating experience for me. So annoying. I just wanted to go home and watch The Walking Dead but instead had to deal with cleaning all this shit up then wait for a pizza. 

I've only been there a few times before and though it's not the greatest Chinese take out, the young women that works there was always friendly and the food was edible. After this experience I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is always hot and fresh. The Good Customer Service here is a great addition to fast carry out."}
{"text":"This is the best chinese food in the indian trail area. It took forever to find a decent spot and I'm happy to have this place. If you're looking for warm, friendly service...this is not the place. But, the food is consistently good so just stick with takeout and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"This spot is my go-to place for good Chinese good. I found them better than Li's Chinese Cafe in Indian Trail. I've had friends come with me here and they always want to go back. Nice staff, quick, I've called ahead and picked up my order to go which is a great convenience. My only quip is they don't always put fortune cookies in the bag with my order and I wish they did!"}
{"text":"Went to First China this past Friday evening. The line was extremely long and I waited approximately 10 minutes to just place my order. Then I waited for another 10 minutes to receive my food. There were approximately 4 people working in the back and one girl in the front juggling between phone orders, walk in orders, and pick ups. I would suggest maybe another person working in the front to help move things along. 

Now to the food itself. I thought the rice was a little on the dry side and wasn't easy to eat with chopsticks. Secondly, the sesame chicken itself wasn't all that impressive. The breading was good and fried properly. However, the sauce that the chicken was in was bland and kind of flavorless as it offered no kick or tang. The eggroll was good and crispy. 

This Chinese place is ok and I will be coming back and keeping this as one of my options as this is one of the Closest Chinese places to me."}
{"text":"I don't like leaving bad reviews, but I found a hair in my food. That's just gross."}
{"text":"It's not good at all. Nothing tastes homemade, nothing is fresh. It's heat and eat, not original or tasty at all."}
{"text":"No clue why Chinese food in the south all tastes so ... weird. It all has this strange flavor I can't figure out. Why does something simple like garlic broccoli come in this goopy sweet sauce? It's supposed to be spicy. How much sugar do they put in that goop? I

So this place was the same I've experience all over Charlotte. Not great - but then again I'm used to eating at Asian restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. Maybe southerners like this junk."}
{"text":"I am very pleased by this place and typically order out from here at least once a week. Great sesame chicken, and they even cook it extra crispy for me."}
{"text":"It's not great. If you're really hungry, it will do. Bland and flavorless. I love Chinese food and this place is really close to me but I would rather drive an extra 10 minutes to eat at a better place."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years and they have never disappointed me. The food is great and very tasty. I especially love the General Tso chicken and chicken wings. I can truly say that I've got a First China weakness."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by this place. Very good Chinese food place in such a rural area. Love it!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here since the week they opened. I like it as good and better than the other Chinese fast food restaurants nearby on 74 and at Indian Trail. I like Hunan Chicken and shrimp chow mein.sometimes I get the diet plate with sauce on the side with chicken and vegetables. It is also very good and a way to cut our sodium. I am real picky about my egg rolls and at a lot of the fast food restaurants I don't like them. I am ok  with theirs enough to eat them but there are a few places I like the egg rolls  better. Even with that one item I give them 5 stars because the entrees always please us."}
{"text":"Not bad at all!

I tried this place a few years back, obviously I didn't care for it that much considering it took me years to come back. My parents live near by, so leaving their house this afternoon, not having eaten all day we decided to give it a shot. 

On the recommendation of another review I decided  to try the staple sesame chicken. My wife had egg drop soup & egg rolls. 

Everything was good......not GREAT, but good for what it is. It is all about expectations....this is a generic \"fast food\" Chinese takeout. That is all.

Nothing more, nothing less. I will however remember to come back sooner knowing it is a solid option."}
{"text":"We love this place! Best local Chinese food in or near Indian trail area."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood restaurant with decent prices. The food is good but nothing great. As options are limited on this side of town, it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"They won me over with their awesome sesame chicken, egg rolls & rice. I don't even like egg rolls but they opened my taste buds again for them. Yum! My Husband got the general tsos chicken, he also very much enjoyed his meal. Lo mein, also pretty amazing."}
{"text":"I like them but just  noticed their rating was 90.5.  Why?  Now I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Good food. Mongolian Beef is different than most Chinese restaurants as it's missing the crispy noodles but it's still good."}
{"text":"This is my fav Chinese place. I always get sweet and sour chicken and vegetable fried rice. Every time I get it, it is hot, tastes great. I also get the egg rolls and those are always good too. We usually call in our order and pick it up, it's always done quick."}
{"text":"Just what u expect from a Chinese restaurant. Food is best around for quick Chinese but their timing of orders is horrible. For pick ups, they always say \"10 mins\" and when u get there u are still waiting ....every time!"}
