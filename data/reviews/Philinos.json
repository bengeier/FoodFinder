{"text":"I am a regular visitor to Montreal, and over the years I've been to Philinos at least a dozen times, on visits ranging from dates with my Greek Montrealer better half, to an after-work dinner with ten hungry colleagues on a business trip, to a special-occasion family lunch for  30. And I've never had anything less than an excellent meal. 

The best way to eat at Philinos is to order a bunch of hot and cold pikilia (appetizers) for the table, and one main course to share. My favourite dishes (confirmed on a visit with friends earlier this week): grilled octopus (tender, not at all tough or greasy, lightly charred), fried zucchini and eggplant, and the most amazing lamb chops (served by the pound). And of course the loukoumades - best described as Greek timbits, balls of dough lightly fried and dipped in honey. They are light, fluffy, sweet but not overly so, and always made to order.

I can't say whether Philinos is the best Greek restaurant in Montreal, because I never get around to trying the rest. But it's certainly the best Greek restaurant I've been to in North America. Toronto's famed Greektown, where I have been pretty much everywhere, doesn't have anything that even comes close."}
{"text":"I come here, or try too, every time I am in Montreal. Amazing Greek food and I like the ambiance. If you're a couple, it's nice to sit up at the bar! I like to start with tzaziki & saganaki as an appetizer. For the main course I like to get the meat platter which is a mix of different Greek meats so that you have a little bit of everything. The honey balls for dessert is a must as well!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Greek restaurants in Montreal. I enjoy it both for its good food and lively evening atmosphere. This is a great place to go out with a group of friends for a fun night. The menu lends itself to ordering many items for the table and sharing them amoung everyone. Some of my fav's are:

- fried octopus (the house specialty)
- calamari
- Saganaki (served flaming at your table)
- fleshly made Spanakopitakia
- Kolokithia Tiganita - lightly fried zucchini & eggplant
- Greek salad of course
- Jumbo Shrimp
- grilled rack of lamb
- and for dessert Loukoumades -  deep fried dough balls served warm and drizzled with honey"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an authentic greek restaurant like this in a long time. I really enjoyed my meal from beginning to end! I started off with the fried zucchini/eggplant and had the lamb chops as the main course. Cooked and seasoned to perfection! 
I would definitely recommend this cute trendy place! :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced, good food but not great. Heard a lot of great things about this restaurant however my wife, kids and myself were disappointed. Not worth the incredible high price they charged us."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. Take the meat or seafood platters and share. Salads are delicious as well."}
{"text":"VERY GOOD! Recommended to me by several people when discussing where to eat good Greek in Montreal. Philinos is a smallish restaurant, not cramped, but not grand either. There's some typical decor paying homage to Greece but overall the place is pretty charming and comfortable. The atmosphere lends itself more to casual than anything formal. There's a small patio that is covered by vines and leaves that, when makes for a great place to plant yourself and hang out with food and wine. It's the kind of setting that you could easily picture loud conversations and a lot of laughing.

The staff was friendly and attentive, two things I really appreciate. Delivery of the food was well timed, we never sat long without another plate showing up, we were given ample time to get into to it before another plate arrived but we never felt rushed in anyway. 

Recommended (and mentioned in reviews often) was the grilled octopus ... quite possibly the best I've ever had. Excellent consistency and flavor and cooked perfectly.  
The rest of the food was good to very good and all pretty standard Greek plates but above standard in quality. They also have a nice selection of Greek wine, which should be added to the recommendations. I found it reasonably priced, it didn't break the bank  and I had a really nice experience."}
{"text":"I thought I couldn't go wrong with this 4 1/2 stars rated greek restaurant but for once I was disappointed to follow the reviews.

We arrived in an empty restaurant with all the staff chatting at tables and wondering why in the world anyone would walk in... After all, it's only a restaurant right?!

We ordered the vegeterian mezzes, despite the fact that we thought it was quite expensive (52$) hoping it would at least be good. Oh woe is me...
We received badly re-heated mussaka, two spanakopitakia and two tyropitakia that had invisible flakes of feta in them, four dolmadakia that were simply wondering were they were and some grilled vegetables that had been taken too quickly from the freezer to the grill and to the plate... 

All that for 52$... I think next time I will cook my own greek food, it will be less expensive and I'm sure it won't be worst.

PS: Two stars just because despite all that, our waiter was great!"}
{"text":"Recently went to this great Greek resto nestled in the heart of the Mile End and really enjoyed their food.  The resto ambiance itself is classy with it's eye catching bar stretching from end to end. Service was super-friendly and they have a DJ spinning great tunes on Friday nights! The food was really great starting from their entree of fried zucchini and eggplant with a side of their home made tzatziki to their souvlaki dishes..all were super tasty! I recommend leaving room for their awesome cheesecake baklava dessert!  Yummy!  Would definately recommend for family events or birthday parties or night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Hummmm, je n'avais jamais manger de Grec de ma vie, mais sa, hum, que de sensations pour les papilles gustatives. Le poulet, le porc et l'agneau étaient tous tendre et savoureux. Ah, la saucisse, la saucisse, savoureuse et elle avait un petit goût qui nous agace le palet et qu'on veut encore et encore. Les portions sont généreuses et le service rapide. L'ambiance est décontracté et parfait pour les groupes. Le rapport qualité prix est acceptable vue la quantité et la qualité des plats."}
{"text":"I have probably walked up and down Parc Avenue and never noticed this restaurant. I ate here recently with my good friend and was extremely surprised with what I experienced.

I had a lychee martini (it was SOOOO strong - but this is obviously just me - I never drink!) but the waiter was so kind and offered to cut it down with more juice and split it into two drinks for us. 

The service was amazing and the food was really delectable! As well, you will never be disappointed with the size of the platters. Next time I am definitely trying out the Saganaki (as it was pretty entertaining to watch the waiters try to not set the restaurant and patrons on fire! - J/K!)"}
{"text":"I went last week with a group of friends and had a wonderful meal. Everything about this experience deserves five stars: the food, the service, the atmosphere. 

I wrote a detailed review of this experience: http://www.forgetthebox.net/mag/philinos.php"}
{"text":"A wonderful 5 Star Montreal Greek restaurant dining experience! From soup, salad, main course, wine, dessert and after dinner drink Philinos was an absolute dining delight with hospitality and service to match. My son and I started with two Pils Hellas Greek beers which were excellent followed by grilled octopus, lentil soup and a village Greek salad, both soup and salad where very good. The grilled octopus was beyond belief in both flavor and tenderness this is one item you do not, under any circumstance, want to miss! We both ordered lamb chops medium rare with Greek potatoes and fresh vegetable medley. The lamb was cooked perfectly, so juicy, tender with a perfect char coating from the broiler. Even the fresh vegetable where cook to perfection slightly al dente just the way I prefer. This sumptuous meal was accompanied by a bottle of Greek red wine Feast Semeli, it too was excellent as it was on the lighter side and didn't masked the delicate flavor of the lamb. Our dessert was Karidopita, a walnut cake with simple syrup which was not to sweet and delicious, a real stand out. The meal was finished with two glasses of Mastiha, an after dinner liqueur made from the resin of the Mastic trees of Greece this is another don't miss as well. 
Philinos is not inexpensive but that won't matter after you have begun and ultimately finished your Greek culinary dining adventure there."}
{"text":"We've been going to Philinos since it opened many years ago. With the kids, with family and friends, for occasions, with the gang from work, or just 2 of us for a nice dinner and wine. The food has been delicious since day 1. The staff is always friendly and there when needed. Most recently we went for lunch, 4 of us. We ordered a lunch mixed grill plate, some octopus, grilled vegetables and a salad. Oh, forgot about the tZatziki..mmmm. Everything was delicious, the octopus tender tasty and plenty on the plate. The veggies nicely grilled, and not a bad piece of meat in the mixed grill. The tzatziki was prepared old school, like my grandma use to make, thick with the right amount of garlic and herbs.
Bravo to this outstanding restaurant for maintaining such a high quality throughout all theses years."}
