{"text":"It's Food Truck Thursday again!!! 

I know what you're thinking. \"Grumpy! How many food trucks can you eat from?\" Well folks, how many food trucks are there? 

I wanted to try something a little different today so I stopped at the Hungry Street Grille. Looking at their menu the chicken tender's basket sounded like it would be a nice change. I've never tried Chef Greg's food so this should be interesting. 
The truck was clean and the sign was legible. Two good starts. The guy in the window, sorry I did not ask his name, was friendly. I just wanted a can of Coke but they don't have that. They have big glass bottles of Coca-Cola!!! BONUS!! I'm letting you know that Coke tastes great from a glass bottle. 

Now onto the food. Three plump chicken pieces. All a good size and cooked with excellence. The outside batter is tasty and crispy while the inside was juicy. This is the way they are supposed to be cooked. I did not realize that fries came with the basket. Shoestring fries that were nice and crisp as well. I really hate limp fries. These were great. And two sauces come with it. BBQ and buffalo chicken sauce. Eh. The BBQ tasted like a KC Masterpiece and the buffalo tasted like Franks. Now I like both and was not expecting homemade sauces so a nice addition. Better than ketchup for sure. 

A filling meal for 10 bucks. So would I recommend Hungry Street Grille? You betcha. My overall experience was good.

Thanks Greg for cooking up lunch. See you down Hungry Street again!"}
{"text":"Hungry Street Grille offers casual American/Southwestern style eats at an affordable price. I've had the breakfast chimichanga and some breakfast burritos here. The breakfast chimichanga was amazing. It was nicely fried, with a hearty portion of ingredients, smothered in country gravy and cheese. Each bite had a great interplay of flavors and textures. The breakfast burritos are more one-note for me. Although they were a very sizable portion, they were more bland, and the salsa they came with tasted more like a spicy tomato sauce.

Service is very cheerful and friendly. Overall, I'd definitely like to try another breakfast chimichanga, or maybe some of their pulled pork dishes."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this food truck last Thursday for lunch. She picked the food up and brought it back for both of us so I did not get to interact with the staff. I was so excited when I discovered that this food truck had healthy menu items available.  We both ordered the Seared Lemon Pepper Salmon, grilled asparagus, cherry tomato, mixed greens, balsamic glaze, & extra virgin olive oil for $8 per meal. The salmon also came with a lemon slice. The food was fresh and tasty and properly seasoned. I will definitely be a returning customer."}
