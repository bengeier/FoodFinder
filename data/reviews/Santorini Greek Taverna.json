{"text":"The octopus appetizer was phenomenal. After that it was down hill. My lamb chops were over cooked and my friend's steak was shoe leather with ice cold onions on top."}
{"text":"We live down the street and decided to give Satorinis a try. Without a doubt, my wife and I had one of the best meals we've had in a long time in both food and service. I've had octopus at various restaurants around the country and I am comfortable to say that Santorini's octopus is some of the best I've ever had. We also had the sausage appetizer and the grilled lamb chops. Both were excellent dishes. The waiter also recommended an excellent bottle of wine that paired well with our meal. I'm definitely looking forward to my next trip. A great addition to the Warehouse District."}
{"text":"Great restaurant even allowed our dog to dine on the patio and gave him some pork. Our waiter Michael was so informative and so attentive. Great food!!! Great patio!!! Great service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dear God, thank you for Santorini and their kleftiko.  This is my all-time favourite place to go in Calgary. When friends are visiting, I take them here. When it's time for a special occasion, I want to go here. When I get hungry, I want to go here.  The kleftiko, or roast lamb, was divine ... the meat practically melting in my mouth.  I love the assortment of appetizers, from as simple as pita and hummus to Greek staples like saganaki and spanakopita.  My best friend, who gets to dine on the most amazing Greek cuisine at Mino's in Kamloops, B.C., came to visit and had the moussaka. She said it was the best moussaka she'd ever had.  Complement your dinner with a Boutari off the wine list.  Service is typically excellent, the atmosphere is wonderfully Greek and there's belly dancing on Saturday nights.  You won't regret a trip to Santorini."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant gets such good reviews, but maybe it's a reflection of the lack of choice in Greek food in Calgary.  After dining here several times and trying most of what's offered on the menu, I've never been particularly impressed.  The souvlaki is always OK, the lamb fish dishes are quite good, but the sides are nothing special.  The rice, lemon roasted potatoes and vegetables are on par with what you get from the local greek fast food chain, and at $25-37 per entree, I expect better.  For a seemingly family run restaurant, I was also disappointed with the lack of flexibility they offer to their guests.  My boss, who was treating a group of 20+ people to dinner there, was offered potatoes, rice and green beans as the only vegetarian option.    On the pus side, the service is quite good.  Food is always brought out fairly fast, despite the fact that I'm always there as part of a large group.  We never feel like we're being rushed out, even though we notice on our way out that the other customers left long before us."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner last week after hearing some rave reviews from friends. Maybe I was there on a \"off\" night... but my experience was less than stellar. We had ordered calamari and the fried cheese(saganaki) as appetizers. The saganaki was quite good and the calamari was nice and crisp. Only problem with the calamari was that they didn't remove the cartilage properly and I was left to spit out cartilage bits. Not very pleasant to say the least!  For an entree, I had the kleftiko (roast lamb). The lamb was great; it was fall-off-the-bone tender, juicy and flavourful. However, the sides were a COMPLETE miss. The rice pilaf was mushy as were the string beans. The string beans also came with a weird tangy sauce that certainly didn't enhance their mushy texture. The lemon roasted potatoes were ok... nothing to write home about.  I don't plan on going out of my way to go back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Great food and service  I made a short notice reservation for 18 on a Friday night and Maria worked her magic and got us in. The food was fantastic, the atmosphere pleasant and the service was terrific. Maria et al were fabulous, we had a great time. I love Greek food and will return when I'm in Calgary again."}
{"text":"Santorini's quality & service has really declined over the past few years, Though they've never been a \"fancy\" restaurant, their staff always treated you as if it was. Not this time around.   We entered the restaurant after making a reservation hours earlier for a birthday dinner/date night. There were three tables occupied - one of which was a loud, extended family - which for some reason we were seated immediately next to. There was a wailing infant on a chair less than two feet away from us, and we were close enough to the family that we could have easily joined into their conversation had we wanted to. This was not the intimate date night we had planned for, so I asked if we could move to the two-top just behind us. The host who sat us said no, because if they had a party of six come in that evening, they'd need to join the two top with the adjacent four-top. I can see the logic in that, but considering the restaurant was almost empty & that we had gone to the effort to reserve a table where this potential six-top had not, good customer service would dictate that it would be worth accommodating our reasonable request. He again said we could not move. Then, after reluctantly taking our assigned spots, our server came back with water and she said we could move. Which was appreciated, but the effort it took to get to that conclusion seemed unnecessary.  Our server, while accommodating enough, hardly spoke, no specials or anything were mentioned. Her appearance was disheveled, with a wrinkled and untucked shirt. There was no wine service, the white was left on the table without an ice bucket. We ordered the saganaki and were confused when she brought it out to us already sizzling. I guess they don't do the flambé at the table anymore? The meal was alright. \"Veggies\" on the side consisted of what I'm assuming were frozen green beans with the odd chunk of carrot.   For the price point, and what we had hoped would be a nice, intimate dinner, it was all pretty disappointing. Santorini used to be an absolute gem - I'd always bring my friends or family from out of town here. But after this experience I don't think we'll be back for a while."}
{"text":"Went there the other night after work, with two associates. We all had the suckling pig and it was absolutely amazing!! On top of the great food, the service was great and the suggested wine totally suited the meal. Everyone had a great time due to the great ambience and service. It was a great find! I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! Everything was amazing. We started with the roasted eggplant spread appetizer that was outstanding and served with fresh warm pita. The salad I ordered was so fresh and light and the chicken was grilled to perfection. I highly recommend going here! Me and my friend both said it was one of the best meals we both have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Food was pretty tasty, but service was incredibly slow. Was one of only three parties there for lunch and took more than 30 minutes to get our food. Friends at the table shared they've had a similar experience on previous visits. So, don't visit this place if you're on a time restriction."}
{"text":"The salmon, moussaka,  solvaki - really everything is very very tasty. You must try the creme caramel!"}
{"text":"From Greek wine, grilled octopus, lamb and a walnut honey cake! This place was amazing! The octopus was one of the best things we have ever eaten. Staff was wonderful, great music and we ended it all with the manager Kristos and a send off shot of ouzo!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Greek authenticity at its best! I'm just disappointed that I've lived in Calgary for so long and just discovered this place. It puts other Greek restaurants to shame. The baklava is the way it should be, smothered in syrup and honey. My husband is Greek and was extremely happy with his food. The staff is all Greek, from Cyprus I believe. Go here if you want Greek authentic food."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  The fresh, tasty dips (especially the Spicy Feta) were our favorite part.  Great service and a nice atmosphere.  We will absolutely be back here."}
{"text":"I've been here once and I have to say I cannot wait to go back!!! We went for my father's 50th birthday and the food was out of this world. The calamari.... oh my god the calamari, TRY THE CALAMARI, you won't be disappointed. It's unbreaded so you don't get that soggy taste and it was cooked perfectly. My mum and I split one of the seafood platters and there wasn't any leftovers. Soooo good! The wine is also excellent, but that goes without saying ;) Everytime we pass the restaurant we agree that we definitely need to have dinner there again SOON! It wasn't super busy but I don't think a reservation would be a bad idea. Like I said... it's the best greek in the city! 5 stars across the board!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted to indulge in some Greek for her birthday celebrations, and thought Santorini was the perfect spot. Eight of us piled into the quaint restaurant, which was cutely covered in Greek décor.  There were definitely a lot of options and being that our party had different tastes, everyone got to order something they were going to enjoy. I went with the saganaki to start (fried cheese is a must!), and the prawns & scallops as my main (served on rice palif with roasted potatoes and veggies). Other dishes that graced our table included the grilled sausage, seafood platters and skewers with a variety of different meats (chicken, lamb, and beef).  Considering our party size, our food still came out relatively quickly. They are definitely not shy on portion size here and even though we tried to eat as much as well could, I think most of us ended up having to take food home. Although my dish was a big heavy on the lemon flavouring, I still really liked it. The prawns were charred nicely from being grilled and pan fried scallops were crisp and juicy - perfection!  As always, you always make room for dessert even if you have to share! We ordered a few kreme karamele and tortes, and a few people had the drip coffees (very strong and served espresso style). The kreme was awesome - a light custard infused with intense caramel flavour, made me wish I had started with dessert!  Food was great, and we never felt like we were being rushed out even with our larger dining group. I'd recommend checking Santorini out if you're ever craving some Greek."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for lunch last week.  One had been here before and recommended it to us as authentic Greek with a twist.  She is Greek so we trusted her.   One was vegetarian and had no problem finding dishes to eat.  She had the domathes which were filled with rice with a light lemon sauce.  She liked it.   Two had the lamb kebabs which came with fries.  They enjoyed them.   I had the moussaka which came in its own crock with a nicely browned bechamel on top with crusty cheese around the rim.  It was nicely seasoned and I enjoyed it.   We shared an appetizer of sautéed vegetables with artichokes and mushrooms. It had a delicate lemon  sauce.  We all liked it.   Service was good and prompt.  We will be back to try it again."}
{"text":"So glad that there is FINALLY a new Greek restaurant in downtown Cleveland! We went here for dinner last night and had a wonderful experience. The service was fast and our waiter was unbelievably attentive and accommodating.   We ordered the calamari and the eggplant dip for appetizers and both were AMAZING! The calamari was a larger portion than we expected and came with some sort of aioli dip that I could have eaten over and over again. We then ordered the shrimp appetizer and the scallop appetizer for our meals because we weren't as hungry after eating everything else.   I officially love this place and will be going back often."}
{"text":"I finally went here and loved it! We had the flaming cheese as an appetizer which was very good and I had a chicken dish with orzo that was also delicious. I practically licked the plate!"}
{"text":"Excellent food Friendly Fast Very happy Will come back soon I highly recommend it! Had a souvlaki and a salad Delicious"}
{"text":"I know there are many glowing reviews, but 7 of us dined there on June 20 and our food was very poorly prepared.  The service was good, Tyrone kept apologising when he returned with items sent back.  The only dish prepared properly was the Lavraki.  All the other items were either under-cooked or  over-cooked.  This restaurant  is way over priced for the quality of the food.  A good indication of the popularity is that on a Saturday night the place was virtually empty.  FYI, the photos bear no resemblance no what is served."}
{"text":"Just okay.  Went here for dinner recently with a few friends.  Their happy hour had good prices and a small selection of appetizers.  The dirty martinis I ordered (two in total) were very different in flavor, even though I ordered the same exact drink.  I enjoyed their small appetizers, especially the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves).  For our meal we shared several items...saganaki (flaming cheese), a spinach pie and a gyro platter.  The saganaki was served in a traditional hot dish and was flamed table-side.  Although the lemony flavor was okay it was super salty (even more than normal).  When the spinach pie was served it looked more like a stuffed burrito than what I'd normally expect...in a roll form.  The dipping sauce was decent with a hint of dill.  The gyro platter was also just passable...meat was on the dry side but flavor was alright.  The pita was cut into such small triangles that it was hard to build a reasonable mouthful of all the ingredients on the platter.  I love Greek food (grew up on it actually), and this place just missed the mark for me.  My quest continues!!!"}
{"text":"What a cute place! Romantic and classy, old school Greece! Food is all home made and just amazing, quantities are great (a lot, but perfect), atmosphere is warm, and service is fantastic. Friendly owners and staff! Great place to have a date or birthday dinner. I have been here many times and will be going many more!"}
{"text":"The service is impeccable! Christos was quite attentive & informative. The food was plentiful and delicious. Specials were swordfish steak with lentils and were so good!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Atmosphere, Great Service and a must try.. I'm glad to see a Greek cuisine restaurant downtown and NOT another Bar or Sushi place..."}
{"text":"Food is really quite good they everything really well there. Worth trying the waiters are supper friendly.  They will go over and beyond to make you happy.  Great experience at the end.  Service was excellent.   Busy place better to have reservation."}
{"text":"Santorini was fabulous. Starting with a feta saganki encrusted with sesame and topped with hot figs. Then, we were treated to perfecrly cooked lamb chops, moist, tender and perfectly seasoned, with green beans and roasted potatoes.  Also, the Moussaka was served in its own crock and was hot and hearty and delicious. Bread came with olives, hummus and yogurt butter. Melissa provided excellent service. She was knowledgeable of the new menu and very attentive. The restaurant has been beautifully decorated in a modern taverna style, with blues and whites, stonework and even a Greek fishing boat, named aptly after the owners parents. A whole wall reveals pictures of the island of Santorini with the classic white washed buildings and blue domes. Lovely. Owners and brothers Gus and Tommy were on hand making everyone feel welcome. Cousin Alex, too!  Chef Cosmo made his rounds at the tables and revealed the full menu would be available as soon as next week, and it looks marvelous. We learned he has quite an extensive culinary history, in Greece and NYC. Lastly, we enjoyed the pastry chefs rolled baklava- flaky, crunchy, sweet , and also had a shredded phylo dough crust topped with chocolate pudding, whipped cream and pistachios- light and tasty. A sweet ending  to Santorini's first day on W. 9th Street. And we're glad they're here. Thanks Gus for all your hard work."}
{"text":"Some of the best Greek food we have ever had outside of Greece. We had the combination platter. The platter consists of Moussaka, lamb and chicken souvlaki, crispy kalamari, dolmathes and spanakopita.  All were outstanding. The service was very friendly. We go back for sure."}
{"text":"Outstanding Greek food! Probably the best Greek food in Cleveland. The atmosphere, service, and staff are wonderful. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Modern Greek cuisine...welcome to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Really, really nice people. Stayed open a little longer on Greek Easter to let us enjoy their cuisine. And they did that before they found out we came from Wisconsin. (The latter got us an ouzo on the house. Thanks Cory - you rock!!!!)  Food was authentic and absolutely outstanding. Lamb was fork tender and flavorful.  Snapper was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Three dips and warm pita to start.   Great wine list with many retsinas.  (Trust me, try one, with the food).   The green bean and greens sides were both unbelievable.   Our server, Cory, was so nice and helpful and made the whole experience a pleasure.   Lucky you, Cleveland. Can't wait to come back with a group!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my Santorini experience prior to a Yelp Event held at Santorini.  I was super excited to visit Santorini Greek Taverna as it has been bookmarked for months.  I love Greek wine and Greek seasonings so I was looking forward to checking this place out.   Das Mann and I decided to hit up SGT before the Yelp Event was to kick off.  We were hungry and wanted to sample some of the food and drinks ahead of time.  STG was pretty empty upon arrival and we snagged some Rock-Star parking out front on the street.  We sidled up to the bar and were promptly waited upon by a lovely bartendress.  She made appropriate wine recommendations and were were very happy with the bottle of white she suggested.  Happy Hour was still going on so we ordered the Gyro and Calamari.  Both dishes were served quickly and I was surprised at the ample portions.  I'm not a huge Gyro fan but I have to say the meat was tender, not chewy, and the seasoning was to die for.  The calamari was not chewy but a bit lacking on flavor for my tastes.  I did enjoy that some of the calamari were the portion with the legs.  I prefer the crispy legs to the calamari rounds.  Das Mann liked the food so much he ordered the Fried Eggplant and Zucchini chips.  I'm not a huge fried food fan and I wasn't too sure about this selection.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The chips weren't too greasy and the flavor profile was spot on.    We enjoyed some baklava at the end of the evening; another huge portion and with a scoop of delicious pistachio ice cream.  If I had one complaint it would be the coffee.  It was clearly Folgers coffee by the smell and taste (I'm a snob).  I ordered a Greek coffee and was disappointed by the clearness of the coffee and the flavor was all wrong.  Santorini, fix your coffee and I'll bump you to 5 stars.  I would definitely recommend STG for your Greek food fix."}
{"text":"Gyro plate was great!  Spicy hummus was tasty. The yiouvetsi spanaki was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food and wonderful selection. The mile high moussaka, perfect saganaki, and finishing up with a warm custard tart,. It was a great date night and we're coming back."}
{"text":"Best Greek salad I've ever had and authentic! Very good eggplant dip and hummus. Pita bread count have been better, wasn't bad but wasn't a little too toasted for my taste as I prefer it to be warm and soft.   Shrimp and scallops dish was good. The potatoes were cooked perfectly. Very friendly staff and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"When trying true greek for the first time i was pushed to come here, i need to thank that person with another dinner from this place! The Saganaki (sp?) was incredible, the flavor explosion in my mouth was so welcomed.  I also tried the seafood stew which was out of this world.  The inside has the beautiful \"blue\" feel that i would expect in a greek restaurant, makes me feel like im looking over santorini. Ahhhh. SO relaxing and inviting. romantic and casual at the same time. Open and spacious inside, with a well stocked bar. Friendly servers.  The price was a little higher than your typical restaurant but totally worth every single penny.  The portions are large enough to share, so that cuts the cost aspect in my head.  the food is about as authentic as you can get without a passport so enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The spreads and cocktails are absolutely fantastic! It's about time the Warehouse District got a good place for brunch as well. Yummy brunch specials, bloody marys and oh-so-good mimosas (you can't help but order more than one).   If you like greek flavors, you need to check this place out! The service is fantastic, prices are reasonable for a nice dinner out and the food is super tasty. I recommend the chicken skewers, hummus spread (or any of the spreads really) or the salmon!"}
{"text":"Best overall greek food in Calgary.   My favorites are the Melitzanosalata (baba ganoush), Tastsiki, hommus, horiatiki (greek salad), avgolemono soup, moussaka and pastichio. The main dishes come with some delicious lemon potatoes and green beans in a tomato sauce. So. friggin. good.  Dessert is great too, my favorite is the Bougatsa.   Rolando is a great server, I would ask to sit in his section.  They also sometimes have belly dancers which I would guess you can request for a special event for some added flair if desired."}
{"text":"Tried it on a whim and it was pretty good for downtown Cleveland.   Avgolemono was legit, souvlaki was huge portion and just awesome.  A favorite when I hit Cleveland.   Worth a try..."}
{"text":"For many years the only 'Greek' food that you could find in the Cleveland area comprised of Gyros at late night diners.  Finally there is a viable option that brings authentic Greek cusine to Northeast Ohio, a classy establishment that serves a variety of seafood and classical Greek dishes.  If you like the flaming spectacle of Saganaki served tableside, you got it! If you'd prefer to end your meal with a nice shot of Ouzo, that is a welcome invitation here as well. Expect to pay between $20-30 per person, but if you like quality and generous portions, then you truly get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Very overpriced place. Small soulvaki plate was    of $24 freaking price. The rice portion was so small and beans and carrots on the side was so mush like it was taken out  from the canned container. It is an awful overpriced place. People don't go and waste money over there. I would advice Clypsos Greek restaurant instead!!! Hated Santorini!! No one should ever go there"}
{"text":"This is a big deal.   I could probably answer a 100 questions before I could answer, \"what's your favourite restaurant?\"  Drumroll pleae, it's with great excitement that I yelp that THIS right here, Santorini, is hands down my favourite restaurant in yyc.   It all started a few years ago, being new to Greek food, I dove right in and tried \"moussaka\" - also known as the Greek national dish. It was so unbelievably good!! It's a vegetarian dish - and as meat lover I fell in love with this dish. So much so I tried making it at home - not the same. It is such a hearty serving. And just overall delicious. The potatoes - mmmm. Who would have thought a simple item such as potatoes could be so perfected? Really, you could order any main course and be delighted.  The food is so delicious and the service is always consistently great.   I love the feel of this restaurant. You can tell its family owned and operated. They have this simple charm - but also extremely proud of the food and service they deliver.   A perfect restaurant for winter or summer, date or family, small or large group.   On the note of a large groups, Santorini is extremely accommodating of a large group. Just make reservations. They have a set menu at a VERY reasonable price with a TON of delicious food and many options - and lots of food. With so many picky eaters in a big group (25+) everyone was very happy.   Must haves: moussaka, the lamb (drool), and this fried cheese appetiser (double drool) yes, fried cheese."}
{"text":"The diversity of downtown eats never ceases to amaze me and I was thrilled to learn of a hot new Greek restaurant. Being a new spot, I came in with zero expectations and was pleasantly surprised! The interior is all white and chic with subtle blue shining lights for a pop of color. I was a little leery that their menu was not posted, so I went ahead and added photos of it for fellow Yelpers wondering whether they should give it a try or not.   They deliver bread with Greek yogurt balls and humus to your table that is all homemade and fresh. We ordered the tzasiki  spread served with the most soft and delicious pita I think I've ever had. It was like eating a cloud with the addicting spread, which was creamy and refreshing with a hint of cucumber. The way they present the food is too cute! The tzasiki was my favorite item we ordered by bar, followed by the pan fried feta cheese dish (yum!) and the first salad listed on the menu which was good but nothing special.   Everything was just so fresh and tasty while being displayed so creatively. I will be going back soon!! Perfect place to snack and share small plates. Not too sure about the entrees, but I'm sure they are nothing short of quality. Opa!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very open, comfortable, clean...good blend of casual and quality. Octopus was fantastic! Tender, flavorful, great presentation. So good we ordered a second and will order it every time I go. As others have mentioned, Alex is a great host! I hope this place does well, its nice to have a real Greek restaurant in town.  We also tried the feta saganaki which was encrusted in black and white sesame seeds, served with a fig \"chutney\". This was amazing too!  They don't light this one on fire (they offer that one too), and feta is not the norm for saganaki, but, its a wonderful creative spin.  The small Greek salad was somewhat underwhelming and very small, but, everything else was great and all of the other plates we saw coming out looked fantastic. Will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"I went to Santorini for dinner on a weekday with my girlfriend, excited to find try this place as I am generally very big on Greek/Mediterranean cuisine. The restaurant was relatively empty, potentially owing to the weekday, but nonetheless the waitstaff was fully attentive and exceptionally friendly. Before the meal, we were served olives, bread and cheese which I thought was a good way to wet the palette before the main courses.  I tried the Spanakopita, and the chicken kebab, both of which were delicious. The kebabs were well seasoned and cooked to tenderness and came with a Greek salad, which although not for me (given its saltiness), fit well with the meal. My only reservation were the prices; they were unexpectedly along the lines of what I might expect to pay at some of the more upscale restaurants in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party here, and it went better than expected. On arrival, they put out complementary bread and spreads for you to enjoy. They also did some showmanship and lit some amazing cheese on fire that we also shared at the table. All the dishes were well-made, the service was great and best of all the ambience was spectacular. We will be back again for sure! Try to carpool, if there are no meters you will have to pay 6 to 7 dollars to park right next door."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Calgary. I have been there multiple times, and prefer to go here again when I wish to eat Greek food. Wouldn't suggest a 'Platter for 2' because it gives you too much meat and less carbs (like Pita or Bread). The servers are very friendly and welcoming. Ambience is just like a legacy European (Greek) restaurant. You will find the restaurant quite busy on prime days, so would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Santorini has so many memories for my partner and I and when this place opened up in Cleveland we were so excited. The food was amazing and just like it was when we were in Greece. The staff was super friendly and knew their foods."}
{"text":"Super great place. Me and my wife go here for all our special occasions. Love the Tavern platter."}
{"text":"Friendliest and most accommodating staff around! My 2 year old daughter does very well here. Food is exceptional and the secret is out. Make sure to make a reservation.  Stin ygeiá sas!"}
{"text":"I am in Cleveland on business and was looking for a nearby restaurant. I was reading the local newspaper (\"The Plain Dealer\"), and they had an article about Cleveland restaurants. The only place within walking distance to me was Santorini Greek Taverna. However, it wasn't on either of the two lists provided to me by the hotel of nearby restaurants. I decided to give it a try ... and I am SO glad I did. Great service and the waiter gave terrific, personal suggestions: grilled octopus appetizer, avgolemono soup and lamb chops - all seasoned and cooked beautifully. A local foodie friend of mine who texted me during dinner said that she had never heard of it, so I asked the waiter how long they'd been open - just a year. More people need to know about this place!"}
{"text":"I had a late dinner with hubby. We ordered the seafood platter for two, which was presented on two plates: the seafood (grilled calamari, shrimp on top of scallops, one salmon and halibut steak) on one, and the sides(green beans, carrots, roasted potatoes and rice). The calamari was absolutely amazing--it was tender and cut like butter.  Melt-in-your-mouth good!! The shrimp and scallops also delicious.  Unfortunately, the salmon and halibut was overcooked (but after eating the halibut at River Cafe, that's a tough act to follow).   There was a little too much lemon juice added to the cooked veggies..."}
{"text":"Family owned, charming destination. Great service & excellent food. Hummus & pita ( pita was fresh, warm & more like naan bread) Yum! Dolmades: vine leaves stuffed with meat, rice & seasoned to perfection. Spanokopita: Phyllo pastry containing cheese & spinach filling. Greek meatballs: delicious. Salad: fresh & crisp (ample serving) I don't remember the name of the dessert but I will never forget the way it tasted!  Ladies room is spotlessly clean. Bonus! Highly recommended for: cleanliness, prompt service & yummy food!"}
{"text":"It's no secret that Greek food is one of my favourite types of food. Having discovered the food of the gods while traipsing around Greece one summer, I have a pretty good idea of what is authentic, and what is not.  At Santorini's you can expect to be eating the same kind of Greek food you might eat if you were on a Greek island. As you enter the whitewashed restaurant you'll get the feeling that you're in Greece. Memorabilia and knick knacks from Greece dot the walls. The surroundings are simple, but comfortable.  Feel confident ordering such favourites as moussaka, saganaki (flaming cheese!), lamb dishes and souvlaki. The menu offers a lot of choices - Greek salad, tzatziki with warm buttered pita, Greek meatballs, vine leaves...  This is a family-run restaurant that has all of the charm and friendly service you might experience on a small Greek island. Ask for a shot of ouzo to get your evening started!"}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful meal, nice ambience. We had the gyro platter and pork souvlaki. We would recommend them and definitely try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you greeted with a faint scent of black licorice, which I found odd but it was tolerable. As we approached the hostess stand we (my boyfriend and I) were told that they had no tables available for walk ins (there was a completely empty room of tables). So if you go on a busy night I would call ahead because otherwise you will be stuck sitting at the bar. The music was a mix of Greek music, it was great but they must have been using the free version of Pandora, because there were advertisements (which I find to be very cheap).   We were greeted by a very friendly bartender and were handed the menus. Both of us went with the intention of ordering the gyro sandwiches. However the only gyro option on the dinner menu was the platter. So both of us ordered one. Our food came out in about 10 minutes (maybe even less). It was a huge amount of lamb, fries, and a greek salad. All of it was delicious! Next time we would split that with an appetizer.   All in all I was very satisfied with my experience. I was disappointed that if you eat at the bar you don't get the starter bread, that didn't make sense to me...Other than that I will be back! They also have a brunch menu so I'm excited to try that one of these days!"}
{"text":"Background highlights: was in town for business; have traveled and eaten throughout multiple Greek islands; big fan of Greek food Went with a co-worker on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm... sat at the bar and ordered various Happy Hour food specials for only $5 each.   Review..... Food: Generally, All dishes were served in/around a metal ice scooper that sat atop of a med-sized white plate. Presentation was nice and simple.  While the food was not cold, it wasn't hot either... could've been warmer (was probably served a few minutes too long after having been cooked)  Lamb Gyro - \"make your own mini gryo's\" served with plenty of meat that had a good amount of lamb flavor... was not overpowering, not overly cooked, not too thin...    would definitely order this again.  Zucchini Chips - fried lightly-battered thin-sliced Zucchini chips. decent balance between amount of batter and Zucchini, though I would've preferred that the Zucchini was sliced a tad bit thicker for more bite and/or that a paper towel/napkin should've been placed underneath the chips to help absorb the oil... without it, each chip was a slight bit too oily.  But overall, tasted great with lightly salted seasoning and tsatziki dipping sauce.   Mussels: good amount of mussels for only $5. sauce was light overall (lightly salted, hint of sweet, garlic, and lemon)... was able to really taste the mussels, which seemed fresh and not overly cooked. would definitely order again.  Fried Calamari: Was good overall, but a tad bit overly fried (like, by 1 minute or so)... the pieces were slightly hard/chewy as the squid meat was not delicate enough to the bite. was served with a lemon wedge and a lemon aioli dipping sauce .  Drink: initially couldn't make up my mind on which beer to order... the bartender was nice enough to allow me to sample a few... ended up with the Great Lakes Brewing Co. Lager... paired nicely with the lamb gyro.  Service: was slow initially, but great once tended to for the remaining experience...  bartender was very friendly.  Overall, had a great dining experience... food was great, portion was good (was full afterward), price was really great (overall bill of $33 for two ppl).  I was surprised that the restaurant was essentially empty, though to be fair, many restaurants in my 3/4 mile walk to there seemed empty as well (was surprised, considering it was a Thursday evening... more empty compared to other major cities I've traveled).  I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Hot and new!! I was here on 4/10/15. The food is OUTSTANDING- not your typical Greek \"diner\" style food.   Food: The ouzo BBQ sauce was to die for, skirt steak cooked perfectly  Horiatiki Salata - heirloom tomatoes were delicious  Seafood and Orzo - fresh seafood and the sauce was amazing  Service: 5 Star service!! So polite, friendly and prompt   Atmosphere- clean and classy :) bar has blue under lighting and there are modern light fixtures, wood floor."}
{"text":"We just went there for dinner and were happy with the meal and blown away by the service! I forgot her name but her number was 0025! She was spectacular! We ripped her well and she deserved every penny.   The octopus appetizer was gobbled down by my son and the rest of the breads and such were quickly devoured. I did not like my fires and that is my ONLY complaint!   Thanks again to the service team!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Every time I have guests in town this is my go to entertainment place. It's a great atmosphere and the food is always good I seem to eat way too much every time I go."}
{"text":"I have not been here in over two decades, and I'm still satisfied as I was before I moved away from Calgary.  Atmosphere:  It has the traditional Greek restaurant decor as you would expect anywhere in Canada.  Clean, comfortable, and pleasant.  The dining area is not a large, rectangular room, but is divided into two levels, and sectioned off.  The music in the background was loud enough for people to hear, in case there are awkward silences at the table, but not so loud which you can not hear your other companions at the table.  Food:  I had the lamb souvlaki.  The seasonings were great.  The lamb was a little too cooked for my taste, but it was not dry, so it was still very good.  A sauce is provided, of course, for your meat.  I did not need it, but was happily using it for my pita at the table.  The vegetables were seasoned very well, no need to add extra salt or pepper onto them for extra flavour.    Service:  Our server was very attentive, checked on us to refill our water glasses, and to ask if we needed anything throughout the meal.  The wait from the time we ordered to the time we had received our food was less than 20 minutes.    This place is still great, after not coming in here in over 20 years.  Did not disappoint in any way.  Hopefully my next visit to this establishment will not be as long of a wait in between."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here - delicious! The tzatziki is fantastic and fresh.  The biftek is incredible."}
{"text":"I wanted to thank everyone at Santorini.  I had a small wedding dinner with 16 of my family members and ordered A LOT of food.  Our waiter and other staff members ensured we were taken care of from the moment we sat down.  The food was amazing, and freshly prepared.  Finally...a truly authentic yet modern Greek restaurant!  Well done!"}
{"text":"Plenty of food selections.  With the $39 dinner combo,  you could have a dip of all most famous Greek signature dishes. Not to mention they are all well prepared and presented by passionate and friendly staff.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Meh. I'd like to give it 2.5 stars but that wasn't an option. The service was awful. It took our server  15 minutes to come to our table, the hostess was really nice and kept coming by to talk to us. When she got there she took our orders (we had plenty of time to look at the menu) without ever asking if we wanted drinks.  When I asked her what kind of beer they had she had no idea. She said a few brand names, but when I'd ask what kind of beer it was she (ie IPA, Porter, Lager) she had no idea. I didn't get a beer,  my girlfriend ordered a Fat Tire (I'm glad I didn't,  when the bill came her 16oz draft beer was $7). I wouldn't blame the restaurant for the bad service but it appeared that she was the only one working, which is their fault. I just got a Gyro with no onion. Of course it came out with onion and I had to send it back. It was OK,  kind of small. I'd say better than a place that's just heating up frozen Gyro meat but not even close to what you'd get at The West side Market (if you're from Cleveland you know). I live very close to this restaurant and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really amazing in house made Pita, great flavor on their dry rub wings, and beautifully updated Greek style upholstery.  Count me in.  It's one of the first upscale authentic Greek places I've been to, and it does a great job.  Fresh flavors and a cool atmosphere.  Now if only the staff were sports fans, I asked them to put on the Cavs game like 5 times before they figured it out, but they were busy and it was loud in there, so nothing too offensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Greek food I've ever eaten. We are visiting  from Southern California and our lovely Canadian friends brought us here. We loved it. The food was front and center and clearly prepared with care. Oh yes, we WILL be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for what we hoped was a quick bite, but unfortunately the service was very slow. It was twenty minutes before we saw a waiter. It wasn't busy at all, but they seemed under staffed.  The food came out in a reasonable time. I had the Pantzaria salad. It tasted very good, but it was missing the quail egg that it was supposed to have. I mentioned this to the waiter, and he said he'd ask the cook about it, but didn't bring it up again and didn't offer to discount my meal or anything for the mistake. Over all, the food was good but is kind of overpriced (my salad, without any meat, was $12. I feel like 8-10 would be more reasonable, especially considering no quail egg was given!)  Drinks were priced at what you'd expect for this area. I had a martini ($10), it was overshaken but not undrinkable. Getting a little nitpicky here---I didn't specify shaken or stirred, but I think the general consensus is stirred, so I wasn't expecting this issue...I recommend you specify!"}
{"text":"So this was my first & last visit to this restaurant.   It's an also-ran Greek Restaurant. It's the kind that \"used to be good\" but now it's a shadow of what it was.  The meal started with a pretty decent Greek Salad. It wasn't the type of Greek Salad that I normally eat but the dressing was good.   The main was a normal Chicken Souvlaki dinner. The issue was cold green beans that were well past their prime. It came with literally 3 potato wedges, cold white rice (butter wouldn't melt on the rice) & a small chicken skewer! All of this delight for a mere $27.00 for the main. Very disappointing for any restaurant that calls itself legit!   Do yourself a favour...go to ANY other Greek Restaurant!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Santorini. When I was planning my birthday, I knew that most restaurants would be full due to Christmas parties. I remembered attending a birthday dinner here a few years ago, and I figured it would be perfect since I've been meaning to come back since! Reservations went smoothly and they were very accommodating.  The 8 of us were seated near the front door - I expected us to be at the back like last time, but it wasn't a big deal. Our waiter was polite, but quiet - nothing stood out for me as far as exceptional service goes, but we had what we needed and that was fine. We started with drinks - I didn't realize that the only wine by the glass was their house wine - but it ended up being fine. They don't have a huge cocktail menu so that's something to keep in mind. We also ordered some Saganaki, Spanikopita, Meatballs, and Calamari to start.   Everything came out super quickly! The cheese was a HUGE hit...it was delicious...but REALLY lemony. I didn't mind, but I found a lot of the dishes to have just a tad too much lemon. Josh and I decided to share the Seafood Platter. It was huge! The shrimp was delicious and the fish was seasoned perfectly, however it was slightly overcooked. A little disappointing, but still tasted good nonetheless. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food, and our sides/salad were very tasty.   For dessert, we opted for the Creme Caramel and the Baklava, which was HUGE! I wasn't a huge fan of the Creme Caramel, as I don't really enjoy pudding, but the Baklava was delicious. I wished it was a bit crispier but otherwise no complaints.  Our service wasn't amazing, but the food was quite good and it was a lovely evening. It would have been nice for them to acknowledge the birthday (some restaurants will put a candle on the dessert or something - minor but it adds a nice touch) and for the waiter to be a little more personable, but it didn't take away from our good experience. I'll likely be back in the future, at least for the delicious Saganaki!"}
{"text":"My benchmark for local Greek excellence is Taki's, and this place comes mighty close. The service on my visit was excellent and all six people in our group enjoyed their meals. Santorini is nice with its high ceilings, festive Mediterranean colors and modern touches. I'll be back whenever I want great Greek downtown."}
{"text":"Went for dinner a few Mondays ago, place was dead but the bar picked up a little by the time we left.  Waiter was knowledgeable and helpful.  Food was great, gyro platter is HUGE even when split between 2 people.  Drinks were pretty good as well.  Seems pricey for what it is, bill for 4 people was 136 and each person only had 1 drink.  I do hope it lasts though."}
{"text":"Had their roasted lamb dinner tonight and it was superb. Generous portion sizes and the lamb was delicious and really tender. Lemon potatoes were also great.  Look forward to eating here more. : ) New to the city and it was a treat."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Great service, Good selection. Clean, lots of parking. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Greek!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING! This is the BEST Mediterranean food I have had. We were a party of 8 and had great service. We ordered dips initially, I don't remember the names of what we ordered but the one with the burnt feta ( which was done in front of us- the server lit the dish on fire in front of us ) was out of this world. We ordered the trio sampler which was also good. We ordered the third veggie dish from the entrees which was again, awesome. Portion sizes are big, so be ready to take food home. We were so full we could not order desserts. Bill was only ~$25 per person ( including gratuity )- so pretty economical too! Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I should have taken a pic of our octopus and other plates but they were gone too fast. A true gem!!"}
{"text":"They aren't ready yet.  First, the website has no menu. When I arrived, I asked for a wine list.  The very friendly bartender Dylan told me they did not have many of the wines on the list.  After ordering a drink, I asked for the saganaki, only to be told they didn't have that either.  Admittedly, the place has been open just one week.  But they aren't ready to be open yet."}
{"text":"Well, we were so curious to try the food (my husband lived in Greece for a summer and has never seen tyrokafteri on a menu in the States) we returned. Thankfully we were not disappointed!   Our server was friendly and attentive. Moreover, the food was fantastic!! I probably wouldn't return on a weekday for lunch and I'd be skeptical about the dinner rush but overall we would definitely return as the food was great & definitely authentic!"}
{"text":"I just ate the best Greek lunch meal I've ever had.  Succulent chicken souvlaki, flavorful and fluffy rice pilaf and super fresh salad filled my belly and I don't care that I'll smell for hours. Two friends shared the Taverna lunch special and they let me sample the pita bread, which was hot and also very fresh, with the amazing hummus.  The prices are reasonable for this quality food.    The restaurant is cozy and cute.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST Greek food in Cleveland. My boyfriend and I are both Greek and love eating authentic Greek food. The lamb shank, grape leaves and musaka are amazing."}
{"text":"This place serves the best Greek food in Calgary and is decorated like a restaurant you would find in Fira.   Just try the lamb chops.  Until I find a better Greek joint in town, this restaurant is a five-star in my book."}
{"text":"Went with 3 others after CIFF. Classy atmosphere, yet casual...very comfortable. Nice decor. And our server, Cori, was excellent. Very attentive, and was extrememly helpful when it came to wine and food suggestions.  Would be a great place for a date or a group: family and friends.  There was a musician who sang and played a keyboard- such a nice addition to an already pleasant experience.  As for the food, the 3 dip appetizer was delicious. A good way to start the meal. Suggestion: mix the 3 together ( hummus, eggplant, and spicy feta) for a happy bite.  The octopus was a little tough for my liking, but the others, whom I was with, really enjoyed it.  I ordered the mussels... The broth was light and I appreciated the scallions and tomatoes with each bite of mussel.   My companions orderd the lamb chop...medium rare...and neither left one bite to take home. I tasted the mashed parsnips that came with the lamb and could have eaten an entire plate as a meal.  I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I dropped in for some to-go lunch and we were all left very happy by the decision. First off, we ordered at the bar and none of our meals took long to prepare at all, which is always a plus for a workday lunch. Personally, I got an order of the hummus and a Greek Burger, both of which were absolutely excellent. Their feta tastes to fresh and the hummus is some of the best I've ever had. You can tell they use quality ingredients (which accounts for the slightly higher price point) and know how to prepare things just right.   They also take great pains to make sure your food is still delicious when you get back to the office. My one co-worker ordered a caesar salad (he loved it) and they were detailed enough to separate the chicken from the salad, so the lettuce wasn't soggy. Not many places do that.   Aside from the amazing food, the atmosphere in the restaurant is pretty laid back and trendy. I definitely see myself dropping in again and again. I highly recommend everyone else do the same. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Meh, it's alright.  The location where this restaurant sits is in the old Brgr9 location. It's a pretty and fancy looking restaurant. There's really no wait, and I usually don't have a prob seating a group of people. Last time I went, we were able to get a table of 8-however, no one else was eating in the restaurant that night at 8pm...   I've been here multiple times with friends- and have tried the lamb dish (overpriced and salty), and the gyro plate (I've had better gyros, and although the plate is gigantic, it's just ok). The appetizers are pretty decent- with a small thumbs up to the octopus and the zucchini and eggplant chips. I thought their hummus and baba ghanoush was just okay tho- nothing great.  We also tried to use the check in offer, but our waiter wouldn't let us. Stated that we either had to pay as a whole group (aka one bill), and use the check in offer, but couldn't do it on separate bills, even though we all had Yelp check ins on our phone. Puhleaaaaase. Really? Meh.  It's alright. For downtown, there's not many diverse options, so feel free to check it out-but I thought it was very meh."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We walked in and there were only two other tables dinning in . The atmosphere inside was really pretty. We started with an appetizer. We got hummus. The hummus and the pita bread came in a really nice board and cup. The pita bread was really good and so was the hummus. Then i ordered the Prasini salad with added chicken and my partner ordered the greek salad with the added chicken. The Prasini salad was disappointing because it was basically shredded lettuce. I took back the order.The greek salad however was delicious. Overall food was okay but it is highly priced. The greek salad with added chicken came to $20."}
{"text":"Was really craving Greek food and it kinda fell short. It was7pm on a Saturday night and it was EMPTY.  The bread basket and spreads were yummy. The saganaki was good. The gyro platter was huge almost to the point of being unappetizing. There were no \"fixings\" with the player.  A mountain of meat, tiny thimble of tzatziki sauce, no shredded lettuce or tomatoes.  The lamb shank with orzo was gross and flavorless. At $25, I was kinda angry. Greek Village in Lakewood which I've only done takeout is light years closer to good Greek food like you'd get at a church festival."}
{"text":"Took my Greek mother here for Mother's Day and the food was AMAZING!! The food, service and atmosphere exceeded our expectations! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our third visit. Food was good but they e stopped making a couple of the menu items. Service was very rushed. We ordered appetizers which we were in the middle of when our dinners arrived. Restaurant was empty to there was no reason to be so rushed. Not as enthralled as I have been before."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times (actually many more if you count the times it has been under different names / ownership!) and like it... meh.  Food- ok.  Service- friendly- but meh. Bar staff- slow.  Drinks- watery and again, meh.    Why the 3 stars?  The place is gorgeous!  It is in a great location!  And they have my favorite teramislota dip that I can't find at a lot of places.  (Although I think they use tobiko instead or red, since the salt level seems off).  I still love it!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a Friday. I let the waitress know that I hadn't been there and asked for her recommendation. She recommended the chicken dish, but I decide to stick with what I knew and ordered the gyro. After a few minutes, they did bring out some bread with a olives and a couple different spreads. My food didn't take long to come out, and when it did, it was a large plate of gyro meat, fries, cut pieces of pita bread and a ramekin of cucumber sauce and salad. It was a huge platter, and I only ate half of it. It was different than what I was used to, since I didn't expect to have to make it myself. At first, I thought that it was a huge value, as I thought I was ordering the gyro sandwich at $10, but once the bill came, it was actually the $18 gyro platter meal. I wish that the waitress would have asked whether I wanted the sandwich or the platter which seems more suitable for a dinner not a lunch. It was tasty, but I don't think the value is quite there, and the waitress should have clarified which gyro dish I wanted if there are multiple options instead of assuming that I would want the most expensive and least popular item. Typically when you order a gyro, it's already rolled for you in a large pita bread... You don't expect cut up slices and to make it yourself. Their gyros are going to have a hard time competing against the value that Steve's Gyros offers right across the bridge at West Side Market. Maybe some of their other menu options are worth it, and I may consider returning back to try other items if one of my friends want to check it out."}
{"text":"Greek food at its best at Santorini!    We opted for the $36 / person dinner that encompasses 3 courses, served family-style.  The dishes were:  - warm triangle pita bread with hummus and tzatziki thrown in! - so delicious but don't fill up on bread as there's more to come! - saganaki - fried cheese with ouzo - interesting fried cheese in a skillet with a half lemon - greek meatballs - served hot and yet so soft and delicate with tzatziki sauce - greek salad - a great big bowl of chopped up tomato, cucumber, red onions, olives, green pepper and lots of good quality olive oil and seasoning  - spanokopita - or spinach pie - hot from the oven and so tasty! - calamari with tzatziki sauce - very tender squid rings and tentacles; the batter is very light. - arni kleftiko - roasted lamb with roated potatoes with lemon wedges - deliciously cooked and tender.  I had mentioned it was my birthday and was treated to a free dessert of baklava with a single green and white candle.  That was a nice treat!  Service was the best as the food came out in timed intervals.  The servers were attentive.  Parking is at the rear of the restaurant; you can enter just after Crystal Auto Glass if you're going north on Centre Street and go to the back to park.  There is also a back entrance to the restaurant.  I'd definitely come back to Santorini!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and it was fantastic!! We sat on the patio it was gorgeous day and our server, Matt, couldn't have been better. I don't know much about Greek food but he recommended an awesome seafood dish.. I really love this place I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful unexpected surprises ! We have never been here before and loved the meal! Highly recommend everything on the menu!  Beautiful venue and terrific service!"}
{"text":"My friends and I liked this place! There were many things interesting and unique, and purportedly Greek. It's greek to me! IDK what Greek food is like. These foods are good! Get out there and try it. We went for happy hour and the prices were very good and we enjoyed ourselves. The place is pretty."}
{"text":"This place used to be Burger 9 on West 9th street in downtown CLE.  Organized a birthday dinner for about 18 people here. There wasn't a private party room, but they finagled a few long dinner tables to accommodate. This place was empty on a Wednesday evening, not that it really matters.   Servers were very attentive. To start, indulge in a few types of fresh breads with olive spreads (yum). I got the lamb chops which were very tender and moist. They flavor town on this bad boy. However the price was a little steep for what it was worth I think.  Bathrooms were clean. Parking free at the street meters after 6:30 pm.  Overall, food was great but I think for them to stay in business probably should lower their costs a little."}
