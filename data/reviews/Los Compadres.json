{"text":"Disappointing ! Disappointing! Blah !  Read a few good reviews and decided to try since we were in the area.  Wait staff was plentiful to take order but scarce after food was delivered.  Had to get up from table to ask for refills on beverages and chips.  Food was very bland and small portions. Nothing compared to like the big city (Indianapolis).  Restaurants like this shouldn't last wrong with bad customer service!"}
{"text":"Love this place the Chile relleno is very good, the burrito enchilada style is amazing and I really don't like texmex style food. One of my new fav places. Plus the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Los Compadres is the best Mexican restaurant in Madison. I almost always get the Fajitas Juarez with steak. Margaritas are nothin' fancy, but predictably tasty. No shortage of chips and salsa. Good, speedy service. Reasonably priced. Always a winner."}
{"text":"Fajitas ...... wonderful! Service.....outstanding! We recently visited dear friends in Madison wh  o treated us to dinner at Los Compadres and I do mean TREAT.  We live in New Mexico where great Mexican food is the norm not the exception. Los Compadres has outstanding food. The selection is good. The food served steaming hot by friendly staff. And owners Rosa and Ruben make you feel like family.  Oh yes. Ask for the  dreamy coconut flan. It is sinfully good. And when you go, tell them Princesa sent you."}
{"text":"I see why this place is not busy. Very bland food and just putting the burro on a hot plate does not make it taste better. Wasted that money."}
{"text":"I've never been to their food truck, but their standalone restaurant is DELICIOUS! I am a huge fan of chilaquiles, and theirs are as good as every place I've ever had them when I've traveled to Mexico. The staff are polite, and always offer me water when I wait for my take-out orders. I recommend everyone go here. The tacos are a bit pricey for how much you get, but they're absolutely delicious either way!"}
{"text":"Well not best best Mexican food I've ever  had.  Service was great to start until food arrived then everyone disappeared.  At the time we were here on a sat night it should have been packed.  I was so looking fwd to Mexican and I was disappointed"}
{"text":"Literally the worst Mexican food I've had and the drinks aren't any better, unless you like a little gasoline in your margarita. The server paid no attention while we placed our order, or when we tried to voice our complaints. To be honest I'm surprised our orders even made it to the table. If you're looking for authentic Mexican, try venturing a few blocks East."}
{"text":"My dad has been going to Los compadres for 40 years and I've know their great Mexican food my whole life. Nothing beats their cheese crisp it's better than anywhere else by far! Also their green chilli burro with red sauce on top.. Delicious. Extremely nice family runs this place and has been for years you should definitely check it out it's the best Mexican food in a city loaded with great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant through GrubHub.  Was notified by text that food was delivered.  Called restaurant, and whoever answered the phone was vile and extremely vulgar and rude and refused to acknowledged that I had an order in the first place.  She hung up on me!! My bank debit card was still charged.  Have filed a dispute with Better Business Bureau of Arizona.  Want an apology from business and my money back.  This is \"Theft of Services\" and a criminal liability.  May I also add that I am a disabled senior on a fixed income and have to order in food at times to eat.  My friends at AARP will be notified and any other relevant human services that help the senior and disabled.  UPDATE:  Have discovered that my complaint with BBB has disappeared.  So much for \"trust\" better business bureau.  I wonder whose pockets and palms got greased. And this place got a Best in Phoenix from New Times? Really??"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I used to come here a lot and the food was good.  Must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered. 5 small strips of steak for fajitas is SAD.  Maybe I ordered from the seniors menu.  Oh well it looks like I will be stopping by taco bell to fill up. My opinion save yourself the trouble and eat at Taco Bell, at least the value for your money is better."}
{"text":"This is very good Mexican food that is priced very reasonably. The chips and salsa are very good and their chicken burro is always amazing!"}
{"text":"This food truck-cum-restaurant is a nice addition to the local scene. The bright, multi-colored space has about 10 tables, with what is best described as cheap but cheerful decor. The service was good, and the food was too. The menu includes mostly expected items such as tacos, burritos and the like...we opted for the enchilada and the chicken mole. A bowl of homemade tortilla chips arrived first, quite thick and substantial, with a good crunch but not much curvature to help scoop up the delicious salsas. Of the smooth red and green salsas provided, the green in particular stood out (in a good way) for its limey, herbed slight creaminess, almost like they mixed a tomatillo salsa and a runny guacamole. As it happens, we also ordered guacamole, and this was a generous chunky version with enough for us to apply to chicken mains after eating all the appy chips. The enchilada were pretty much what you'd expect, it's hard to go wrong with all cheese and refried beans. It is nice that they give you the choice of green or red (hotter) chili sauce, though half and half was not an option (we asked). The chicken mole was a sizeable roasted quarter chicken slathered with lots of homemade mole. The mole was delicious, thick and flavorful with a distinctive sesame bent. Way better than the bottled stuff we try to use at home. It is simply served with tortillas so you pull the meat off the bone and make your own wrap. You can also throw in some of the seasoned rice that's on the plate, but it's so tasty on its own that it's almost a shame to mask it. This restaurant is licensed, and everything washed down nicely with a couple of Dos Equis lagers. We finished with churros, and were presented with a confectionary quandary: chocolate or cajeta for dipping? Being fans of all things caprine, we took the road less travelled and got the cajeta, a goat's milk caramel with a real punch. We enjoyed the (one large) churro itself a little less...it was a bit too hard and dry on the outside, and just a tad undercooked on the inside. Maybe the oil temp was too high that day. All told though, this was only a small mar on an otherwise great meal."}
{"text":"Charming little Mexican joint on the SW corner of 17th Ave and 14th St SW.  The guacamole alone will make it worth your visit."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! I have been coming here for years and it just gets better. Had #12 with enchiladas smothered in their delicious green sauce. Nothing better! The chips and salsa are the best in town, bar none. If you love good Mexican food like I do, drop everything and head to Los Compadres!"}
{"text":"First off, I can't believe this got two 5-Star reviews. The restaurant is practically in the back yard of some motel. Next, the ambiance reminds one of living in a motel. The food, admittedly is decent. Being from the south I am biased when it comes to Mexican food, but then again it's hard to mess up something as simple as fajitas. The service also left something to be desired (the waitress took two smoke breaks on the back patio during our half hour dinner, leaving a girl who usually buses tables to try and cover for her.)  In conclusion, if you've just got to have Mexican food, this place will serve you Mexican food. But if you are trying to decide between Mexican and any other food category... .I'd go with the other."}
{"text":"this is the worst place i have ever eaten at. it was like walking in to a old folks home. the only thing that had flavor was my beer and they could not do that right. wast of my money and wast of my time. you are a mexican restaurant why the hell do u have a guy on the piano playing the girl from ipanema?"}
{"text":"This place is gross and run down. The inside is tacky and the outside is scary with homeless wandering around. Save your money and go to any other restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tasty, reliable fare at this super clean restaurant. David, the owner, is friendly and approachable. Love the green chili and also the homemade salsa. Salads are a hit also. Nice touch is the occasional piano playing at lunchtime and jazzy sic some nights. Catering is also yummy and super easy."}
{"text":"Just had the worst Mexican food ever!!!  The enchilada sauce tasted like it came from a can.  The tamale was like the one you use to get at the 5 and dime in a wrapper.  They charge for everything!!  Don't ever go there!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! I had noticed the owners are very friendly and go out of their way for their customers. Everytime I go there, they are busy.  I don't know what the other low-raters are talking about... I have not experienced anything but great service and food and I am picky!"}
{"text":"Been going to this location for as long as I can remember! During our recent dinner here for Mother's Day we had excellent service and a great meal! They were able to get a party of 8 seated right away and were attentive to the needs to both the children and adults! The busboy Tyler was at our table serval times dropping off chips and salsa and we never had to ask for a refill! Erin was a great and attentive waitress as well! The food was good and reasonably priced! If you're in the area, this small family owned place is where to go for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating this food, but then I lived outside AZ, and outside the country for 20 years and had all kinds of Mexican food.  When I returned to Los Compadres it was like coming home.  True, it's not typical plate lunches or new-age fusion, but there is truly no better tasting food in the world than their guacamole cheese crisp or their shredded chicken mini-chimi with fresh guac and sour cream (no runny sauce).  Yes the chunky salsa is mild but the other salsa is great and there's plenty of it.  I go through several bowls in one meal!  Don't go in with expectations of something like Chipotle or On the Border - try a few unique things like the soft taco that comes with cheese melted on the outer shell or even their bean burro (not burrito) all by itself is amazing - melts in your mouth.  Some great food here if you ask around and know what to order.  There's a reason people love this place and keep returning after 40-50 years!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you are missing out!!! Best Mexican food ever!! Especially the chile relleno with verde sauce! Service was excellent, all of us loved our dinner. We're from out of state and this was the right choice for dinner! Plus, a live jazz band that made for a great, entertaining atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Far cry from the 7th ave location.  Hot salsa tasted like pickle juice, enchilada, bean and rice absolutely flavorless, and green Chile burro, nothing like the Original location.  Never again.  One star is for subpar food"}
{"text":"Bland, boring, \"Mexican-esque\" food.   Warning sign #1: all white people dining there. Warning sign #2: salsa that's bland as ketchup Warning sign #3: no hot sauces on the table  The three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials. Yet our plates looked almost indistinguishable from one another. On each was some configuration of flour tortillas, mountains of shredded iceberg lettuce, and a slick of pale refried beans, all topped with  orange cheese.  You can get more flavorful \"Mexican\" food at Del taco. This place is more like Mexican't food. Ulgh. I want my $5.25 back."}
{"text":"This location has revamped their menu.  It's not near as good as it used to be.  The chips & salsa were not tasty like they used to be.  I got the red chili chimi and it was ok. Not sure what my son got but it wasn't what he was expecting.  They have tried to go upscale with their menu - go back to the old tried & true recipes.  Thank goodness for Mi Pueblo just up the street at Metro Center."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Cheese crisp is always perfectly cooked and the chips and salsa are delicious!! The cheese enchiladas are good but quite pricey for two enchiladas, rice and beans. We usually stick to the mini plate at a great price between 3-6pm, mini tostadas are excellent!! Service is always fast and courteous even when it seems like there is only one server. The \"busboys\" are always attentive and super nice and accommodating. Did I say how much I love this place?!! It's kinda tucked behind a Starbucks but well worth the visit. I'm a native Phoenician, Mexican American and a foodie and give this restaurant FIVE STARS!!"}
{"text":"ok. so i've been eating at the location on 7th ave my whole life.  decided to try the northern location.  hmm...upon entry, it looks like it used to be a chinese restaurant.  knowing los compadres isn't exactly upscale, the food is what i expected and i love their beans as i always have.  the salsa is different than the 7th ave location (at least it seemed to be) and i found that a little disappointing.  the service...was less than stupendous. \"are you ready?\"  \"do you know what you want?\"  oh and my favorite...\"do you want your check now or what?\". not, would you like dessert, are you ready for your check, would you like a box or anything like that.  completely rude.  so. i'll eat there again, but i'll get it to GO."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, Love their beans their rice used to be really good but I don't know what did they change the rice recipe, I am Mexican so I can definitely tell you it is not authentic Mexican food but great Mexican American style, I come by at least once a week.  Servers are extremely nice, great atmosphere and the hostess is super friendly and he even recognizes us know.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Egads this place has gone downhill. Food prices have shot up, food is \"meh\" and the service is deplorable. We complained to a guy who I think is the owner and he could not have cared less. It's sad to see how bad this place has become when it was always such a great AZ joint. Maybe the owner will sell to someone that knows what they are doing. If you want okay Mexican food, don't go here -- go next door to El Pollo Loco!!"}
{"text":"My family has been dining and celebrating milestones at Los Compadres since I was a child and I always look froward to coming back. Such a local gem is hard to come by and the food is unmatched!"}
{"text":"Yummmm! I was so very pleased with my lunch experience today. My husband and I stopped here finally this afternoon. I had been bugging him for the longest time. We literally live maybe 15 minutes from here but always drive all the way to Popo's on 59th and bell since we've been going there forever. However service hasn't been that great there the last couple times and we got sick the last time we ate there so I was so happy we finally went to Los Compadres YAY!!!  I ordered the 2 x 10 combo 1 carne asada taco and 1 green corn tamale w/ rice and beans, he ordered the machaca chimi combo w/ guac & sour cream. It was not a dollop of sour cream but nicely smothered all over. There was two beautiful slices of avocado pico de gallo and cabbage in my street style carne asada taco. It was amazingly good. Truthfully I wish I would've gotten two of them instead of the tamale, which was good, but I'm used to my homemade ones. The beans tasted like homemade and the rice was good. Chips and salsa were good. This is a must try and prices are great!"}
{"text":"They have a great guacamole  here . I don't like the regular salsa but do like their hot sauce . Unlimited chips  is great so many places limit to one refill. I had their machaca and eggs .probably one of their better  dishes also live their Mexican pizza  and green corn tamales. Their rice is very bland but they do have good beans. Service is no.ally good"}
{"text":"Food was good, wish it would have all came out together as most of our party was rating without two of us. When waiting for refills for drinks seemed to be a bother to our server. When we had gotten our breakfast burrito, looking what was in it our server rudely went and got a menu to show us what was in, when a simple explanation could have more useful. Barbie was a nice server I just wish we had better service."}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants I visited when I moved to the area.  I was very disappointed.  I think I would more likely call this \"American Mexican\" which was not Mexican at all.  Everything was al carte.  They didn't have \"combo\" plates, which typically include rice and beans. I had to order them \"on the side\".  But when I got home all I got where my tacos, in like a store bought pre-fab shells, and no rice and beans, even though paid for it."}
{"text":"They serve these DELICIOUS tacos outside that are to die for! Highly recommend them guys, they have this green dressing which I assume is avocado? But they accept card and cash since you pay inside the store, their menu is small but they serve quesadillas, tacos and carne asada fries which they were out of the night I went :( but totally delicious tacos"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Mexican Restaurant for decades!  The food is all made from scratch, from Grandma's old family recipes, and the food is sublimely good.  Los Compadres food is a great example of Arizona-Style Sonoran Mexican Food. This is a Family-Owned, friendly restaurant, not a big chain restaurant, where employees often could care less about the food and the service.  This family cares about the food quality and making your visit enjoyable.  Some of my favorites are the \"Three-Way Burro\", which has red chili, green chili and beans with cheese.  I also love their chicken and beef tacos, which have delicious seasoned meat that is succulent and easy to eat, not the tough stringy dry meat that some Mexican restaurants put in their tacos.  On the lighter side, I will get one of their salads, like a taco salad or chicken salad which are really tasty and fresh.  This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"The last two times I have tried to purcahsed food at Los Compradres food truck their Debit Machine does not work. I never carry cash and I never pay with my credit card for food. Maybe it's just not meant to be but I don't know how they expect to do business when a good amount of people rely on their debit card as a form of transaction. Too bad for them."}
{"text":"Don't get this place mixed up with the sister establishment on seventh Ave, which is (for some reason) clearly superior. The food is passable. Not the best salsa. But ok. If you have the choice go to the other one."}
{"text":"It's called Compadres for a reason! The green burro, house ground beef, veggie enchiladas, and salsa were all fantastic. Our server, Mary, was warm, friendly, and knowledgeable. She even chased us out to our car to make sure we got plasticware for our to-go boxes! And the lunch menu was a great price. So glad we stumbled on this gem!"}
{"text":"I absolutely 100% Love this freaking place.  It's not the largest Mercado I've been to nor does it have the widest selection, but what they do have is f*cking fantastic.  I'm kicking myself in the ass for not taking pictures of this south of the boarder culinary wonderland.  The meats and produce are always fresh.  Their selection of marinated meats are absolutely fantastic.  From fajita chicken, to 3 or 4 different cuts of carne asada, to the adobada seasoned pork and beef.  All of their tortillas are made fresh and in house.  In fact you can see them making them daily, and of course they are frying them up as well for chips.  Their salsas are also made fresh and in house as well.   Since I left southern California I've been on this never ending search to find the perfect little Mercado and I'm happy to say after 3 years my search has come to an end.  Besides it being such a far drive for me I've got nothing but good things to say.  Now on to my never ending search for the perfect ceviche."}
{"text":"As always the chicken burro with the green corn sauce is the bomb! My spouse loves, loves, loves the green chili beef burro enchilada style. You can't go wrong with any of the cheese crisps!!! Coldest beer and coldest pint glass I have had in the valley. Thank you David.  Mary, our server, was awesome too!  We live in the neighborhood and have gone here 10+ years."}
{"text":"Family owned Mexican joint close to the office. Friendly service, seated me promptly during lunch rush.  Very pleasant staff.  Nice fresh chips.  The standard salsa they bring is OK for your rice & beans but ask for the good stuff (habanero based) they keep in the back, nice scalp tingling affect! I never order specials - the shredded beef tack and bean tostado were quite tasty and had no unpleasant after-effects!  Here's the Pizzaz factor for me - on WEDNESDAYS during lunch there is a piano player and his musical offering made a pleasant backdrop to snap you out of the mid-week slump!  Just added this to my Lunch date list!"}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me that in the competitive restaurant market that exists in the Phoenix metro area, sub-standard restaurants not only exist, but exist for years and years! Such is the case for Los Compadres. We actually ate there eons ago, and recall it being fairly good. But a lot of years and a lot of Mexican food meals have gone by. Fast forward to the present. We found ourselves traveling down Northern (don't ask why) and noticed it was still there. In a weak (dare I say - nostalgia?) moment, we thought: hey, it's dinnertime - let's go to Los Compadres!  The neighborhood and strip mall have changed...a lot...over the years. Closed & fenced in former restaurant on the corner, lots of empty storefronts. But, there it is - Los Compadres. And the parking lot was pretty full. Good sign, right? (Maybe the cars were there for the dive bar next door.)  We were seated right away, and a nice young man was soon there asking if we'd like anything to drink. Yes, two margaritas please. Chips and salsa followed thereafter - salsa had a good flavor - obviously homemade. The \"hot sauce\" was not so hot, and not very tasty. We're not afraid of spicy food, so we asked the waiter if he had any Cholula sauce (so we could add some zing to the \"hot\" sauce.) He said he had Tabasco or habanera sauce.  Wow - zero to habanera! Nothing in between! Well, bring on the hot stuff!  It came in a bowl (waiter said they don't get much call for it.) We added some to the salsas and they ended up tasting better.  The menu is typical of Sonoran-style Mexican fare.  We ordered: 2 hard shell tacos - 1 machaca beef, 1 carne asada; 1 chicken burro. We like green chili, but only saw 'green chili & corn' as a topping option. When asked about it, the waiter simply said it was green sauce with corn. Thank you - I think I had figured that out already. So, the burro was ordered 'naked', with the idea of using the salsa on top. When the food came, the poor burro looked so lonely. Sure there was some shredded lettuce on the plate, but not even the standard chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese & olive!  One taco arrived; the waiter told us the kitchen mixed up the order & made a flauta instead; they were making the other taco & it should be ready shortly. When it came, it was a soft taco on a flour tortilla. Not worth it to send it back. The burro was stuffed with cheese & very bland chicken.   There were quite a few patrons in the restaurant when we arrived so the place is obviously popular. But I am not sure why. The food was underwhelming, the atmosphere is underwhelming, and the location is dodgy. The staff was friendly, though, I'll give them that.  Definitely will not return - no matter how reminiscent my mood gets!"}
{"text":"We live not too far from Los Compadres, and it is nearly next to the Post Office, so is very convenient for us to get to.  We now come here about twice per month.  Always great, consistent Mexican food.  They have two standard salsas: chunky mild and smoother hot.  I always ask for the Green Habañero salsa and mix three spoonfuls of each together.  They have daily specials with \"mini\" portions which is what we always get... and go away full.  Example:  I always get the mini shredded beef chimi with rice and beans.  My wife gets the bean burro, ala carte.  With tip, we spend no more than $20 so this works very well for us.  Occasionally Dave (the owner) will play the piano.  His wife makes beautiful pottery that is on sale in the lobby."}
{"text":"Came to eat lunch. I've been to the 7th ave location. Loved it. Northern location not so great. The albondiga soup didn't have any taste to it had to add salt and pepper to give it flavor and the corn tortillas were micro waved and hard. The chips were good. Will give it another try another day."}
{"text":"A okay for grandma and grandpa ..bring them on in they will love it..\"real\" Mexican food served old people style.  Service is slow but who are we kidding ?Grandma and grandpa  aren't hurrying anywhere  and they love spending time with you.  So take grandma to lunch and treat her to the cheapie lunch special , she will get to try out her Spanish with words like TA-CO and Enchee-La -Da... it will be a memorable moment for you both .   Wheelchair accessible and close to Beatitudes nursing home ...make plans to visit your grandparents today."}
{"text":"Have been living in Las Vegas for 8 months and it was hard to fine a good Hispanic market, Cardenas is ok la bonita no !! But los compadres wow the service the food the employees look clean and change there gloves after cleaning unlike Cardenas eww  and the amount of food is perfect not too little or too much good carne not the fat . Super happy we decided to stop bye. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Me and my tummy have a very close relationship. The 2 of us are always in adventure mode, especially around my work zone. My friend Brian also has a very close relationship with his tummy as well though isn't adventurous at all.  So when he suggests a place I know that its going to be simple, down home and risk free.   So after a brief conversation the 4 of us were off to Los Compadres. We were sat immediately which lucky for us we planned early since this place fills up really fast. Warm chips and 2 kinds of salsa are put in front of you almost as quickly as you are sat. The thinner spicy salsa was the better of the 2, my tummy agreed. While Brian liked the thinner version his tummy was like, oh hell no!   Now getting down to business we ordered lunch specials and get this they are 4.95 - 6.95, 11a-3p daily! Talk about dine on a dime, Rachael eat your heart out baby! Ordered a C, taco, enchilada, green burrito with rice and beans. No what Brian order has me stumped. You see we were both distracted by one of the other guests, a very lean and handsome Latino.. so I didn't even pay attention to what Brian ordered.. I think it was an enchilada and taco or something.   The food and service here are very fast and friendly. Though Brian said to avoid the bald guy's station that he's not very nice to his guests. Lunch was out in under 10 minutes so we had plenty of time to ogle over the eye candy only 2 tables away.   When the food arrived it was piping hot! The portion sizes were generous and the smell was great! I dug right in.. the green chile burro was pretty darn good.. it almost had a creamy quality to the sauce. So I spilled some of the chile onto my tostada and in a couple of crunches had managed to woof the whole thing down. The taco was eh, crunchy but not very flavorful.  My tummy was purring as we left.. I could tell our tummies were saying good things about us as well as our eyes. What a feast!"}
{"text":"Their chips and salsa are delicious! Love their guacamole too! I don't know why they aren't as busy as they used to be. I still enjoy the food, I think it's not as good as it was in the past (like they changed chefs or owners), but it's still tasty. Some of our faves are chimichangas, green tamales, cheese crisp with machaca and their refried beans. It's good stuff and they deserve more business."}
{"text":"Careful when you order large. Cause while it says large, what it really means is huge. You won't be able to finish it.  I like this place because it's not too fancy and doesn't put on airs.  Simple. Plain. Gets the job done."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero stars I would! NEVER EAT HERE!!!! The food was cold when it got here. I have to microwave it. Then, four bites in, I find BUGS!!! I made sure to get all my money back. Still feeling sick. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"We tried the steak tacos and the pork chili tacos.  There was a lot of meat, which was great.  The pork was dry and required a lot of flavoring.  There were 3 tacos for $10 (seemed small). We were expecting a hard taco, vegetables, and some cheese.   It is challenging to serve, because the meat soaked the tortilla."}
{"text":"I have been to Los Compadres-Northern 3 times for lunch with work colleagues for work related events, birthdays, etc. I tried to give it a few chances....  While their prices are very reasonable, the service is just barely satisfactory, and they clearly are not prepared to serve large parties at lunch. We had 10 people in our party.  Each time we have gone there we have had to wait a really long time to get our food and then settle up with our checks. We got to place at 11:30 and didn't get out of there until almost 2:00 at each visit!!...just a silly wait time, considering there isn't much to their menu or food. The food is just your run of the mill mexican stuff, pretty standard fare. Although, the one nice thing is they have very ladylike (small bite portions, like mini tostadas and tacos) portions at a good price, very manageable. Sorry to say that overall rhere is nothing real extraordinary from this place. :("}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was in a high-chair in the 1980's and threw rice on the floor. I'm not in a high chair anymore, but still throw rice on the floor when I get excited. The machacha burro is the best in the valley, IMO. Cheese crisp with chili strips, YUM! Sasparilla bottle to drink with my meal. Free chips with unlimited refills, served with free salsa (mild and hot). Delicious, just stick with the machacha burro! This is a family owned restaurant that employs neighborhood kids. Support local business, this one is great!"}
{"text":"Went there with my husband and 2 kids. We are of Mexican decent and in there all you see is white people. They look at you weird or you catch them looking at you and pretend they weren't. Now for our waitress, I hate when she serves us. She is so snotty and looks at us bad she seems like she has no patience for Hispanic people because once she turns around to a table with white people she is all smiles. I just feel so uncomfortable at that place that every time my husband wants to go I remember her. I gave it a last chance this weekend and still the same.  She's a white woman with green or blue eyes and red short hair.. just warning you if your Hispanic and you go there. If you are Anglo she will like you. Now for The food. . Its alright but doesn't have the real Mexican food feeling to it. The rest of the people who work there are nice and give you chips and salsa.. which I do like the salsa! Hope that if you go there you don't feel as uncomfortable as I do in there. The weird part for me is that I feel so uncomfortable in a \"Mexican food\"  and I'm Mexican. To be honest I do not recommend it the food is not worth going through what I did. Sorry Los compadres but I gave you many chances."}
{"text":"Never again! Bland, boring, cafeteria style food. The beans tasted stale. The machaca beef in the taco was dry and tasteless. The rice has NO flavor. The only thing that was remotely good was the tortilla around the \"red\" burro which consisted of stew meat and beans. Nothing \"red\" about it. I requested the hot salsa to pour over everything just so it would taste like SOMETHING. Decor and customers are circa 1965. It was at least clean."}
{"text":"All I can say is that my hubby (a.k.a. the man who eats to live not lives to eat) RAVED about how good their enchilada sauce was.  I think we have found our new favorite go-to mex place.  AND, last night was JAZZ NITE...a bit weird ambiance for a Mexican food restaurant but WAY FUN!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I love their chips and salas. The chips are extra thin and very crispy. I get salsa and they ask if I want the hot sauce, yes to both.  This visit I ordered the Breakfast Burro (Chico Bean Burro topped with green chili beef and egg). First, the side was red potatos with grilled veggies (red bell peppers and onions). The potatos were egh and the veggies tasted like they over did it on the oil. After a few bites of the green chili beef with scrambled egg I pushed it aside and attacked the bean burro. The chili was bland and salt/pepper helped but it just wasn't that great. I was craving the bean burro, so either it was good or I was just satisifying a craving.   It was something different but next time I'll stick to the plain bean burro, the beef and chicken tacos are pretty decent (a bit more expensive than I'm used to).  Service was attentive: 1. I felt bad that she was very pregnant and I was making her work. Even though I wasn't demanding I felt bad for her feet. LoL Silly I know. And she kept calling me Hun.."}
{"text":"Won't be long now before reopening after renovation and name changes. I have really missed the great Mexican food and can hardly wait!! My mouth is watering in anticipation"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food - not the gringo version, but the real thing and the best for miles around. Friendly, efficient service. Generous size servings at very reasonable prices. New location is a definite improvement, even if signs are not up to date yet."}
{"text":"Very bad experience... food is ok, service was far below average, had to ask for refills & server got our order wrong twice & spilled the food!   It was a disaster of an experience!   And when I asked for the manager he never came.  The one positive is their chunky salsa!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here at Los Compadres once in awhile since they opened, at least 30+years. Always they are hit or miss. This last time was a miss.. The chips aren't home made and the salsa is ok, the hot sauce doesn't have much flavor, it's just ok. I've had better. I ordered the green chili beef Chimi enchilada style. It was ok, as usual. The beef was dry and some pieces were fatty and I couldn't chew it, had to take it out of my mouth. I would say the best thing here is their green chili burritos. I'm usually disappointed when I come here."}
{"text":"Outstanding and authentic. Many dishes are prepared for those not familiar with truly Mexican fare, but ask for their recommendations and be rewarded. Carne asada and steak ranchero,  for example. And top off with coconut flan to experience bliss."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since it first opened and 20 yrs later, they're as good as ever. The service is always wonderful too. Things I love here are the Mary Lou, mixed burro, shredded beef taco, and green chili beef burro enchilada style. I've been to many Mexican restaurants over the years, but none of them have that awesome unique  flavor that I get here. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Since we moved to Phoenix, we were looking for a great Mexican Food Restaurant when we stopped in here. We love it!  We really like the smaller portion lunch specials which are priced right. The salsa, the enchiladas, the beef tacos, the beans and the rice are all delicious. We'll be back many more times to enjoy Margarita Monday's and Taco Tuesday's."}
{"text":"Pretty nice small place.. The asada tacos are awesome it is actual asada meat not that small diced up meat. Enchalada plate was also pretty good N the food is very flavorful, portion isn't bad, price is fair, service is good. Very nice restaurant.."}
{"text":"I just LOVE the green burros here! They are amazing! My boyfriend loves the carne asada burrito. Their carne asada is pretty yummy.   The service can be hit or miss, but all in all not bad."}
{"text":"Before Cardenas and El Super, there was Los Compadres.  The OG super mercado on the East Side.  After all these years and the competition down each street, it still stays afloat.    Prices are a little higher if you're comparing it to the other two, but there are a few things worthy of coming here.  #1 is their Ranchera meat.  Ever wanted to cook up some good carne asada?  I've learned that the best and easiest way to get this done is by buying it!  Who knows how to marinade better than these guys?!  I've tried every ranchera on the East and I have to say that Los Compadres sells the best I've ever had.  It's $8 per pound, but I'll gladly pay.  They use high quality meat that cooks to be so tender, juicy, and flavorful.    Another secret to this place is their restaurant in the back.  I saw a sign outside of the Taco Y Taco menu right next to the Los Compadres sign.  I was so excited, I thought, \"Taco Y Taco is here too?!\"  I went in all excited and ordered 1 carne asada and 1 al pastor taco ($1.70/taco).  I asked the cashier if the tacos were from Taco Y Taco, but she said they are Los Compadres.  I don't know why they have the menu outside if they aren't from the restaurant...but as I sat down and ate my taco, I realized that the tables were the same style as the tables at Taco Y Taco on Tropicana (who wouldn't recognize the old school look with the rose in the middle).  Coincidence?  Maybe if I spoke Spanish, I would've learned the back story to sign and tables and I'd be able to tell you guys about it.  But I could only speculate that maybe Taco Y Taco started in Los Compadres and worked its way up to what we know now.  But long story short, the tacos were really frickin' good!!  They filled it up so much that I couldn't take a bite without meat dropping.  The meat was juicy and fresh!  It also comes with cilantro, onions, and your choice of red/green salsa.   They also burritos, pupusas, plates, and dessert, ceviche, and more.    I'll definitely be back for tacos and I'm excited to try what else they have on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Madison! Cheese enchiladas yummy! They are closed for remodeling; I can't wait until they reopen!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Los Compadres since they were mentioned in Phoenix Magazine.  I don't know who they talked to, but the food was OK.  I guess my expectations were higher because of Phoenix Magazine.  I had the cheese enchiladas, and there was nothing unique about them.  This is Mexican food for non-Mexicans.  I give three stars because it was not terrible...but, I can open a can of enchilada sauce and make my own.  Sorry."}
{"text":"I agree with the 'Village Inn\" of Mexican food statement. I've been to the Northern location three times since being in Phoenix. Nico practically grew up here: him and his family have been coming for years and he even worked here in high school. I get the whole nostalgic thing.   I've had the taco salad (unseasoned ground beef, yuck), chicken and cheese enchilada (decent, but nothing too fabulous) and the cheese crisp (very good, but could use some mexi seasoning). Chips and salsa are so-so, but again nothing to rave about. Margaritas are also just okay.   What makes the place charming is the service. Nico knows them all and we get top notch service every time. The decor doesn't scream Mexico and I like that.   I know we will continue to visit Los Compadres, especially when Nico's mom is in town, I will just keep trying new dishes until I find my favorite.  I will also try the 7th Ave location as it seems to get better reviews."}
{"text":"Oh Los Compadres, the memories we have.  I have been going here for about 15 years now and I stopped by again today for my faithful number 7.  It is the mini-chimi, cheese enchilada, & beans and of course it was great.  The salsa brings back memories of enjoying this restaurant and the atmosphere is business casual.  I love coming here on the weekend around 11am to get the brunch specials, I would get the Mexican omelet with beans, potatoes, & tortillas and man is that dish good.  The service is usually great, I think I can only recall a few times it was average but never terrible.  The prices are very good and usually spend about $10 a person with a drink.  The owner is almost always there and very nice.  It has become a staple for me my family and even my friends."}
{"text":"When I was a kid, we ate at Los Compadres at least once a week. It's still my favorite Mexican food restaurant ever. Food is ALWAYS delicious, consistent, well priced, and wonderful. The enchilada sauce is outstanding, wonderful tacos, yummy cheese crisps. Combo plate #2 is the best! Kids' plates are perfect kid-sized portions. Although I now live in Tucson, every time I'm in Phoenix I make sure I get my \"Los\" fix. We've even shipped dinners to my brother in DC. It's not fancy but it IS wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food was alright. We were craving Mexican and ordered delivery from Grub Hub. The food was not overly flavorful, but we did enjoy their Mexican pizza. It would be even better with some sour cream. Not sure if we will order from here again, but  it met our last minute craving. Just remember to order salsa with your order."}
{"text":"My name is Fred Ginnetti, and my wife and I experienced this restaurant for the first time tonight, and it was absolutely phenomenal the fajita, one of the best I've eaten in town. Jerri was our server so if you go there make sure you tell her that I thoroughly enjoyed her service and personality. And Dave provided piano entertainment and it was wonderful jazz so anyone that likes jazz definitely would enjoy it. Thanks again, and I will be back"}
{"text":"I've been in Phoenix for 26 years and have never eaten at Los Compadres. How did that happen? You can thank the new Starbucks on northern and 25th Ave for putting me in your area whereas I usually am never in the area around dinner time.  I decided to give Compadres a try and am glad I did! I ordered food for my whole family to go, (a risky idea since they are all quite picky). Shredded beef enchiladas great. Chicken Burros good. Special order on a plain burro done just right. Service fast. Lady that took my order so friendly I was surprised since friendly customer service tends to be a thing of the past these days. Perhaps she is an owner? Another thing, our order was correct. Seems like a normal thing. But you'd be surprised how often we order food to go from places that forget something or do a special order by not doing the special order. It happens all the time! If I had a tortilla for the number of times I've ordered a burrito with no onion and no sauce and no garnish only to get home and find all of that ignored, I'd have 300 tortillas possibly. I could start my own restaurant with that many tortillas. Anyway, food tasted great, not bland at all, friendly fast service. We'll be back to dine in and try the margaritas! Dang I need one right now!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. We always stop by here on our way back from the airport; it's a family tradition.  The chips and salsa are delicious although I have to add a little salt to both. When I used to work near the restaurant I would have lunch at least once a week. David, the owner, was always there to great my party. At lunch the service was really quick.  Now that I work on the other side of the valley I don't get by as often, but when I'm on that side of town I always stop by to eat. I love the Tostada Especial with Machaca Beef.  Los Compadres is great when you have a large party. They are willing to seat you together and will also divide the bill into separate tickets. When it is a large group they are slower, but they make sure your class is filled and the chips just keep coming. Sometimes I get full from the chips before the food arrives. There is nothing fancy about this place just good home cooked food.  A party of two can eat for under $20.00.  In this economy that is a fantastic value!"}
{"text":"My team and I picked this location for our last meeting of the school year. When we got there it was quiet and not very busy at all. The waitress was there right away to take our drink orders and make sure that we have plenty of chips and salsa. Once everyone got there we placed our order and we waited. And waited. And waited. It really stinks because as teachers we wanted to have a fun time for our last meeting however the wait was a little long. Additionally when they brought out the food it came out in trickle's. It was food for one to two people at a time. When it finally came time for my food to come out it had been more than twenty minutes since they first started serving the food and my order was wrong. At that time I was already late for another meeting that I had to get to so after waiting an additional 10 minutes for my order to be corrected I had to get up and go find someone in the kitchen to let them know my order needs to be cancelled. At that point she finally came out with the plate and said well your food is right here. I explained that I needed to leave about 5 minutes ago and as I'm not going straight home I cannot take the food with me. She stood there staring at me and asked again if I wanted to take it with me and I explained again I'm not going home so I can take it with me. I asked if I could have my check so that I could pay and they said that they would bring it right to me. They brought the wrong check and across the room I could still see the waitress shaking her head at me as if I had done something wrong. I truly am sorry that my previously scheduled meeting affected your kitchen the way it did however I came in with plenty of time to order food sit down and enjoy the company of my team and have plenty of time to move on to my next engagement. I apologize that your waitress was upset that I didn't take the street tacos with me however I would suggest that you get someone in your restaurant to light a fire under your workers but because it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to get a couple of street tacos."}
{"text":"For some reason, I don't think this Los Compadres is as good as the other.  This one is a full-service restaurant, so you'd think that fo shiz it would be better than its order at the counter cousin.  But not true my friend, not true.  The service is fine and the food is really good, but it's missing a little something. That little order-at-the-counter Los Compadres kick if you will.  Honestly, it's probably ALL in my head, but if I have the choice, I will pick the 7th Avenue Los over this one any damn day."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Southern California and we were trying to find a great place to eat late at night. We found this restaurant because we are staying near it. We walked in with no expectations and were completely blown away! We walked into a live jazz band who was playing great music and lighting up the atmosphere. The food was some of the best Mexican food I've ever had! Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a delicious place to eat! Plus we didn't burn a hole in our pocket, prices were great!!"}
{"text":"We moved from Indiana 33 years ago and since then lived in Colorado and Texas, so I've enjoyed some good Mexican food over the years.  Diego's is good and authentic.  Friendly staff, clean facility, reasonable prices, and good food - muy bien!"}
{"text":"The decor isn't much but I came for the food anyway. I found my meal (tostada & beans ) quite delicious. Beats Taco Bell any day! Can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. Hostess was not friendly what so ever. Server was unattentive. Would not recommend this place if you'd actually want a drink with your meal or napkins when needed."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD in AZ. Personal favorite: chicken burro enchilada style, no garnish."}
{"text":"I had severe food poisoning from eating here on Thursday. I use to eat here in the 80's-90's and never had a problem. C'mon guys teach your cooks how to handle food and please get a new salsa recipe. Canned stewed tomatoes, green chiles and onions do not make salsa! Dave, please revamp your stuff! Waitstaff was good."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for some comfort food. It had been years since we had been there. The decor, still looks like they are stuck in the 80's.   Sadly, we will not be returning ever again. The food was horrible! And not just one dish, all 4 dishes!   The green and red chile tasted as if they used an obsessive amount of flour to thicken it. The meat in the machaca burrito was crispy and burnt. I felt so bad for my cousin who tried to eat through it thinking it would get better, he finally gave up.   Their rice, tastes like instant rice in the microwave smothered in tomato sauce. Sadly, we had really been looking forward to this visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food awesome service!!l David the GM is always so helpful. The 3 way burrito is the best! Everyone should try it."}
{"text":"Flew into Phoenix to see family.  And on my way home from the airport we stopped here.  It's been at least 20 years since I've been here.  Though it has been painted and some modern fixtures added, it's the same joint--and that delights me!!  Food was fresh, plentiful, and reasonably priced.  Our server was diligent and cheerful.  The restaurant was clean and bright.  My dad and I got to catch up over a nice meal and really enjoyed our visit.  Didn't visit the restrooms or the bar, however there was a table-tent on our table speaking about Happy Hour Specials.  That's a plus!!  Thanks you guys.  Hope to make it back sooner!!"}
{"text":"\"Although it is your typical Mexican food they do a good job of making it tasty at good prices. There green burritos are really good.\""}
{"text":"Wow! Is the only way I can begin this review. Los compadres came through in a big way for my schools cinco de mayo party. We had a huge order and had originally planned on going through taco y taco but they were too busy with it being cinco de mayo. The people at taco y taco told us about Los compadres (same owners), and they were beyond helpful. And the FOOD! Oh my gosh the food was so amazing. From the fresh tortillas they made us the day of to the al pastor. Everyone loved it and had a great cinco de mayo fiesta!  On top of everything they already did for us they also helped deliver our food! Wow, what great service. I couldn't believe how nice they were.    Thank you Los compadres!!"}
{"text":"Today is Administrative Assistant's Day, YAY, so our school's parent club took us all out to lunch here.  There were about 20 ladies all together and we arrived pretty much the second they opened.  They had a table all set up for us and ready to go.  We were immediately brought chips and salsa.  The chips were very plain, but I kept eating them.  Our bowls of chips were never empty.  We only had one girl taking care of our whole table, but after a couple rounds of refilled sodas she seemed to be getting the hang of it.  We kept her pretty busy but she handled it well.  The kitchen however, had a little difficulty and there was about a 15 minute difference between the time the first person was served and the last person.  Oh well, we all got our food and it was all correct.  I ordered the cheese enchilada and chimichanga (a mini one) combination plate.  The beans that came with the dish were sprinkled with cheese and very tasty.  They were surprisingly smooth and buttery, I'm not really picky about the beans.  The enchilada was a big fat disappointment to me because there were onions inside.  I thought it would just have cheese, because everywhere else I have gone and gotten a cheese enchilada it was just plain inside.  The chimichanga was actually really good to my picky palate.  The shredded beef was flavorful and juicy.  It was also covered in cheese, and that is always a good thing in book.  I could also do without the shredded lettuce on my plate.  I'm not sure what purpose it served.  Overall, it was a pretty decent experience.  The food was fine, the company was fun, and the service was pretty damn good considering our large numbers and needy ladies."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Yelp/Grubhub. The delivery fees were competitive and the food that was delivered was fresh, hot and had great flavor. I'm a hard critic when it comes to Mexican food in this city but........ 4/5 Stars: red beef chimi enchilada style and cheese enchiladas, rice, beans, regular salsa and chips 2/5 Stars: the hot salsa. I love my salsa hot and their version tasted like vinegar to me"}
