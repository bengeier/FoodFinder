{"text":"The restaurant is located in a tucked away neighbourhood strip mall . The decor is clean with a modern feel but not overly extravagant, which fits the positioning of the restaurant. Overall the food is excellent and the Tagliatelle with Lobster was absolutely amazing. We would definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"Great place! Servers were classy and accommodating and food came out quickly. We started with the calamari, which was amazing and fresh - but a little too small to share. We had the risotto and pizza (can't remember which one - it had artichokes on it) and both were great. House wines were a little sour. Overall a good experience... I would definitely recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Pre-set menu for a party of 15. Pizza seemed to be ordered from Fortinos. Gnocchi were too floury. Lamb in sauce. Rabbit in sauce. Meatballs is sauce. Too much sauce. I had acid all night and all the next day.  Total bill: $2725 including tip, $185 per person. We could have bought a second hand car for this price. I'm Italian. Never again."}
{"text":"You can't have it all.. service is a slightly lax but I love the food and vibes on a busy night."}
{"text":"Like a scene from Goodfellas, arrived without reservations looking for a table for two. A quick word between host and owner led to a table being brought from the basement and being set up specially by the front window. Talk about service! Ordered a bottle of wine (Masi), grilled calamari and a freshly stone baked thin crust pizza. Our food came extremely quick and our waiter was impeccable with his service. Dessert was tiramisu, which is to die for. Service and food make one worthy Italian restaurant - one which we will be coming back to and recommending for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Food was average at best. Service was terrible and food was cold. Won't be going back. Woodbridge is full of many great Italian restaurants. Go to one of them instead!"}
{"text":"How has no one reviewed this place?  I'd get married in this place, that's how nice it was. It rates within our top 5 restaurant experiences ever.  Everything about this place was perfect, from the glass lobby to the meatballs.  Service was top notch, our server alberto was witty and made great recommendations on top of being attentive. I'm at a loss for words, just go."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!  We have eaten here several times and even hosted a family function in one of their private rooms. The food is delicious - authentic pizza and pasta.  They even have spedeini on their menu. The Nutella pizza for dessert is a hit with the kids. I usually order the seafood pasta which is great. The service is ok.  There is one server that we love named Olympia - she is exceptionally great- always pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. A packed place and there's only 1 server?....oh nope, there were 3-4. It took an hour and a half to get our pasta.  There are no re-fills on pop and the glasses are small and half of it is ice. So you have to purchase a second glass.  Other Yelp reviews said you get bread to start and every table had bread. An hour went by, then we asked for the basket of bread we were suppose to get. Then we got it. No butter. Just bread and spicy oil.  Later we asked why we didn't get the bread sooner, our server said, \"you have to ask for it\". ....ya ok...that's why every table had their bread and at any other restaurant gives it to you right in the beginning.  There isn't much selection for food. There's a whole page of pasta. But there isn't a nice slice of veal option. Just the veal medallion type.  Dessert is pricey. $8/9 for a slice of cake, $7 for a Tartufo ball...which at the store a box of 4 is $5 (I bought them last week).  Then when asking for the bills, he made a big deal about doing separate bills because the \"computer wouldn't let him\".   Then another hour just waiting for the bill!!!! And 15 minutes waiting for the machine that we specifically asked him to bring with him with the bills since we were pretty certain, that would be longer too. Never coming back. I feel horrible that my friends had to celebrate their birthday here. No singing, no dessert on the house for them, I don't even think I saw a smile from the staff."}
{"text":"Superb service. This is definitely the type of joint you take someone you intend to impress! Minestrone was very fresh and flavourful and the recommended veal with mushroom sauce was light yet filling and so so authentically Italian :) I had a mix of spinach and asparagus as side vegetables which were very nicely seasoned and cooked as were the roasted marinated potatoes. I don't think I've ever had antipasto before so I'm no connoisseur; however, I had a small bite of their house-made antipasto over their fresh complimentary bread and I must say I regret not taking that 2nd or 3rd bite! Just remember not to fill up on the bread and save room for the entrée!  As for the venue itself, the restaurant is larger than it appears in the pictures and can certainly accommodate a large party (I think I saw about four large families today seated at several long tables). Décor is classy and upscale (bathroom is so nice you could take a nap in there he he) yet the atmosphere is inviting and laidback. With that said, you might still wanna put on a nice button-up)/nice blouse though!  Absolutely looking forward to returning when I have time to check out their dessert and wine, of course!  *1 star off because for my colleague's lacklustre grilled chicken salad. Apparently chicken was too salty and not very appetizing. Note to self - another reason to skip the salads and indulge in a pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. Olive dip was bland, Bread boring, Grilled Sea Breem good...but NOT exciting. Gnocchi with rose sauce, bland.. I agree with others. Many better Woodbridge choices for Italian food.. BEST Italian for me remains Trattoria Nervosa on Bellair in downtown Toronto.. Yum !!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices  However our waiter needed a shot of enthusiasm. Almost felt like he wanted to get rid of us at 10 pm. Closing lights, moving tables and folding chairs. Not good."}
{"text":"I would give the food 3/5 and service 1/5. My friends and I went on a Saturday night with reservations, we sat quickly and when we all said we did not want wine, he said how about I bring you some bread and olives with cheese. We agreed to it but did not realize after we had to pay for it. It was a sneaky way of him making it sound like it was complimentary dish. We ordered 4 dishes to share: the homemade gnocchi which was good but with just tomato sauce, needed something extra to it, the full rack of ribs which was good but not spectacular, pizza with arugula and prosciutto - a little dry in my opinion because no sauce on it, very little olive oil drizzled on a plain baked pizza dough, mozzarella with tomato which was fresh. I just found that food can be so much better, the service was next to none, we had to keep refilling our water by ourselves since we sat near the table where they left the water jug. At the end of the meal someone came to take away our plates but no one ever came back to ask if we wanted dessert or the bill. We've must've waited half an hour until we finally had to flag down our waiter whom we didn't see the entire service. It wasn't even crowded. I don't think I would go back to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! Working at restaurants and fine dining, I know the standard! This was honestly the worst experience! I wish I could give 0 stars! Please stay away! They ruined mine and my friends birthday! The restaurant itself is nice but the service was horrible!! Our server was Julian and he was a complete mess and ridiculously slow! We were there for 3 hours waiting on everything from him! When I tried to talk to him about a few things he had no remorse! I even told him it's me and my friends birthday and he could care less. He didn't offer us bread, even though I can see on the other tables they have bread. I had to ask him for the bread because we were already sitting for an hour and a half starving. I asked him for water, which he ended up charging me $6.00 to my personal bill. He made a big deal when we asked for the checks that we didn't tell him when we were ordering that it's all going to be separate bills. He just assumed, then made it a big deal that we asked him. I also asked him right away for the machine with the bill, which he didn't come back for 20 mins but went to other tables to close them with the machine. When serving our table of 7 , he served 3 of the girls and went to serve other tables. He didn't even complete our table till later on. He screwed up one girls order. And then she had to wait till we were almost done. We asked for cheese to the pasta, took another 20 mins to bring it. Meanwhile we found cheese and water behind our table and just took it ourselves because we were so tired of waiting for this man. Please save yourself the times and don't come here! Don't let them ruin your special occasion !"}
{"text":"Mastroroberto is one of the best local restaurants in Woodbridge. It has a lot of class with alot of warmth and fabulous food. The service was very attentive and personalized. There was a fantastic singer there usually on Saturdays that sang Beatles, Moody Blues and romantic Italian songs. Everyone was singing along and clapping. It just made you want to get up and dance! As an appetizer, I had freshly grilled squid in a tasty vinaigrette and I had jumbo shrimp in a picante red sauce with roast potatoes and rapini. Delicious! The wine was out of this world...McManis Cabernet from California for sure the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this restaurant for any of your celebrations or to just have a romantic evening with your significant other."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!!!!!!! None of the servers work here have smiles!!! Ruined my Valentine's Day.... Food is okay."}
{"text":"Went back again... Still a 4.5 in my books... The one guy that works there is a bit off... But the other guy from the Dominican is just a niceee guy.  I know...A Dominican that speaks Italian...  Be aware that the portions are big. My Dads a big eater and after antipasto, calimari and some bread, he couldnt finish his main meal lol!"}
