{"text":"Food A-OK ! Just basic select of dish ... Nothing special! A little bit hard to call for service !  Tea time combo come with a hot drink and change to cold drink add $0.75! I ordered 4 combo and want to add $$ to change my drink to SNOW WHITE ( seven up + ice cream ). But the waitress told me that can't ?? U should side order ... So totally we have 6 drinks for 4 people! All HK style restaurant offer add $$ to upgrade their drink ! Anyway, I just go there one .... No second!!"}
{"text":"Food is very good with prices you can't beat.  New favorite spot to eat.  I had the pork chop on rice with tomato sauce & HK tea - portions were large and I couldn't finish the meal.  Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  A friend had recommended me to try, so I gave it a go for lunch. The plaza is pretty packed was still able to find a parking spot after couple minutes. The restaurant was not too packed and we were able to get a booth seat. The service was surprisingly good for Chinese restaurant, the servers in general were pretty polite.   As for the food, there weren't a lot of daily special items to choose from and you can't sub for vermicelli or other items unless it states otherwise. Prices range from $6.99 to $8.99 which is definitely a steal and comes with a soup and tea/ coffee. I order the corn cream pork minced on rice (~$6.99) and the corn cream on the dish was a bit too thick for my liking and it was definitely lacking in flavour which was a bit of a disappointment. The chinese house soup was great however, and so was the milk tea."}
{"text":"Luv this place! Good food with quick and splendid service. Staffs are super friendly.  It can get pretty busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"So I've already been there twice now, and I think its time to give a review on my impression. Its a decent place, and the food is large portioned, and the price is not overly expensive. The first time I went I had the black pepper steak with grav over spaghetti, which is really good. For 8.99 you can't ask for a steak with rice or spaghetti that is over better quality. I'm sure they aren't using the best cut of meat, but the meat isn't chewy which is important. The second time I went, I had the ham and chicken with cream sauce over spaghetti, and the portion was really large that I couldn't finish it. Both times I went, it came with a combo, including soup and a drink. So if you want to get full and are on a budget, its not a bad place to get a decent meal."}
{"text":"It's a so so for me. Not bad, but not good either. I'm truly in the middle with this one.  I ordered from their daily special menu, which came with the soup of the day and a pop for 75 cents I believe.   I got the chicken curry with rice, and a can of Sprite. It's kind of what I expected from a Hong Kong styled restaurant, but the only thing that threw me off is that it was spicy! I've never had a spicy curry from any kind of Hong Kong place.   The flavour was good, no complaints, I'm just not a fan of spice to be honest, I kind of wished they listed it was spicy in the daily special menu. The soup was very meh, but a lot of veggies included! So good thing they didn't cheap out on that.  I've had better Hong Kong styled food elsewhere. This place didn't really leave a distinct memory in my head, but if I'm in the area, and am not craving whatever else is around this place, I'll probably end up back here again."}
{"text":"food 3 / 5 service 1 / 5  This is the first time I write a negative review which is very uncharacteristic of me.  This is a very typical hk style restaurant with a very poor quality of food and even worse service.   I've been coming here quite a few times, though their menu is quite sparse and doesn't have much I like, my gf likes their eggplant on rice so we have come here for lunch quite a few times.  Today I came here again but this will be my last time as the tofu fish rice I ordered today had the tofu gone really bad / sour.  I took up the very small complaint to the waitress and said it in a very gentle way, not even asking for anything else, just to let them know.  Tofu gone bad is quite easy to happen and it is not a big deal.  The waitress whom after hearing my complaint, without saying a word just left.  After 10 minutes, she came back and said that their kitchen staff confirmed that NOTHING was wrong with the tofu, and that is how their tofu tastes like.  I am a 30+ Chinese born Canadian who've had tofu all my life, I may have a good idea what tofu tastes like.  Even as I write this review right now, there is a lingering sourness on my tongue which I am having a hard time washing away with coffee.  I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt to the restaurant by bringing the complaint to a different waitress. Short of arguing with me that the food didn't go bad, the second waitress just brought me the bill, without taking out the dish from the bill or even short of an apology.    We paid the bill and left. I do not hope this experience for anyone and for anyone looking to eat \"Hong Kong Style\" near the Markham area, there are so many other choices where the staff actually cares about your dining experience, I don't see why you would choose this place.  I will be following up tomorrow with a formal complaint to the ministry of health for bad food health."}
{"text":"This place is really cheap (for the portion size you get) and it gets you that fix for HK comfort food (baked rice dishes, Hainnan Chicken etc...) The menu really expands beyond that of Cantonese cooking to include Korean and Vietnamese dishes so really, this place is for everyone.  I felt like Vermicelli with fried rolls and chicken cutlets. The bowl was HUGE and the dish came with a drink (coffee, tea, or cold soya milk)...all for $6.99. I couldn't even finish my dish...noodles a plenty!  This place is quite large and we went on a Sunday night so not really busy."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5 actually. Among all the HK style cafes I've tried (the genre of restaurant, not others by the same name) I believe this is one of the few that actually give quality food, relatively speaking. I've tried the baked pork chop rice and also their steak. I was impressed with both! The pork chop rice had a good tomato sauce and wasn't dependent on the use of processed cheese to be flavourful. The steak was ACTUALLY cooked to medium. Typically at other HK style cafes, they would ask me how I like my steak and still cook it to well done/ unevenly without fail. This is the only one that actually cooked it to my liking. Gravy that came with it was pretty good too. I also had trouble finding a good milk tea, and I believe they do have it here. Overall, with decent food quality, cheap prices, and very generous portions, this is definitely my go to HK style cafe next to Sugar Sweet Cafe!"}
{"text":"Typical hk style cafe. Got the spaghetti bolognese and bf got the curry chicken rice. Food wasn't anything to rave bout don't understand why it's so busy. Bland food bad service all around. Better places to eat at."}
{"text":"One of the nicer quick-meal cafes in the area. Decent service and a decent price makes this restaurant a worthy choice for those looking to get in and out in 20-30 min.   Best option is to order if their daily special menu. Usually changes once a week, with a couple options consistent. Nice option as the price ranges from $8-13 and comes with soup and a drink.  I've found that the food here contains lots of MSG, so if you find that you have a sensitivity to MSG, I would be careful when ordering."}
{"text":"A lot of these lower end hk styled cafes serve really low quality food which is pretty clear when you try their meats. I was surprised the portions weren't that large considering its poor quality. Seating is not great which is expected from these cheaper cafes.   Wouldn't recommend as there are better hk restaurants close by around the same price."}
{"text":"Was in the area and craving for HK sale cafe and found this plc. Was surprised to walk into empty restaurant at lunch time. Food and portion was average, HK tea was too much milk.... don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"For a HK style cafe, service was extremely slow. Took 15 mins for me to get a drink"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and food is still good. Ordered the club sandwich this time and the thing is ginormous lol it had cheese, bacon, ham, egg, lettuce and tomato.. With the addition of mayo. SO JANG (probably bc I was hungry)!   Service was good. They were polite and welcoming, which is something I consider very highly when rating. Overall a very solid 4-5 stars. I couldn't decide between the two b/c the menu was just too.. Funny (unprofessional?). Look at the take out menu and you'll know what I'm talking about.. Lol  I'd come back if I was close by! :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant serves the traditional HK breakfasts up till 11am. Note that it is cash only as well."}
{"text":"There's always parking available and we always get a seat at a booth. This time I ordered the spicy beef noodles. Peaceful atmosphere and would definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"agree with TE Y., the food is decent.  This place was recommended by a friend, therefore we went there as we donno where to eat one day  soup is OK, however is a bit heavy on the MSG, ordered steak with spaghetti ( one of the above avg steak place compare to other Chinese steak restaurants IMO), the portion is huge, I do have a above par appetite  but it's still too much for me to handle, price is cheap and comes with hot drinks or free pop  The place itself is not packed at night, decoration is decent, has a TV playing fairchild all the time, staffs and service are ok, and refills tea for you periodically  Overall a quit decent place to head to if you want cheap and large portion HK Tea restaurant meal, I would definitely go there"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an average hk cafe style restaurant this is your restaurant. If I'm in the area I would def come back here for hk style cafe food. The food is decent, prices are decent. Decor is kinda weird with there paintings but it's clean. Not much to say but def Ur average hk style cafe."}
{"text":"Food- 1.5/5 Service- 1.5/5  I'm a big fan of HK style cafes, and when I pass by this plaza and see a \"HK style cafe\", I was very excited and expected to find a HK type cha chan teng (look up on Wikipedia if you don't know what that is). Place was pretty full (90%) and there was always a churn of people coming in.  When I looked at the menu, and they had one page only with combos... I knew it was trouble. Perhaps I can give them the benefit of the doubt- that they specialize in specific dishes only. I ordered the Specialty pork chop with spaghetti, with the hopes they don't screw up their Specialty dish.   Out came a pork chop and spaghetti with tomato sauce in less than 5 minutes. But they might as well serve the foods separately. Sauce is not mixed with pork chop. Pork chop is dry and barely any meat. Overall dish is very bland.  And they don't even offer tea on the side... They serve hot tap water. Tasted more like detergent than water.   Prices are more expensive than other Hk style places in the area, except, quality is the same...   I regret that I came here for lunch. Hope other yelpers won't make the same mistake I did."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and our friends for a quick lunch and catch up! Service was as expected and food was pretty good. Large portions. The HK milk tea is pretty good too. Will probably come back since its location is right near when my parent's house. Pricing is average."}
{"text":"We drove by numerous times. It was closed due to owner issue last time.   1st. Waitress in black trimmed glasses is really rude. She doesnt care for her job. We asked a question and shes reluctant to answer.  Food portion is small and pricey compare to similar chinese cafes in the neighborhood. I would suggest going to New city at why 7 and kennedy or kiko hwy 7 and woodbine.   I rather eat at tim hortons across the street."}
{"text":"We ordered the house special porkchop baked rice and the curry chicken rice.  The baked rice came out within 3 minutes or less.  I barely made a dent in my soup!  I doubt it was baked or at least not freshly baked for me!  It tasted ok.  But the porkchop and the fried rice was really dry.    The curry chicken was typical Hk style cafe like and was tasty.    The portion for the curry chicken was good.  The baked rice was a little small.  The drinks that came with the combo were good. I got honey lemon water and I don't believe they charged me extra.   We also orders veggies with oyster sauce and thought the portion was great given the $4.95 price tag.  We ended off the night with french toast which was delicious!  The bread was fluffy and thick cut, deep fried to perfection with the perfect amount of peanut butter inside.  I would come back for the French toast. Too bad the French toast doesn't come with w drink. But I thought it was ok priced still at $3.50."}
{"text":"Yet another HK style cafe.  What an original name.  Since I love this kind of food I knew I had to give this place a try.  Tonight, we had :   French Toast  $3.25  Baked Portuguese Beef Brisket  $7.99  Spiced Beef Noodle Szechuan Style  $7.95  Chicken A La King with Cream Sauce  $6.99  Everything was well prepared.  The french toast was nice and thick, beef brisket was probably the best I've ever had, beef noodle was tasty without being too spicy, and the chicken a la king was simply delightful.  The food was so good, I had forgotten to take pics before eating!    It would have been nice if the place was open for breakfast and offered more breakfast items (business hours are from 11am-10pm).  Also preferred if the waiters came around to refill our tea without having to ask them.    Otherwise a wonderful place with a clean and nice decor, low cost but excellent quality HK chinese food.  Recommended especially if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Liked the milk tea ($1.75) and liked the red bean drink ($4.25) but didn't really like the condensed milk, peanut butter toast ($3.50). Learn from my mistake - I thought the toast was a French toast but on the menu it only says toast so it was literally a peanut butter and condensed milk sandwich. I'm sure the food here is pretty decent but I did not get a chance to try. I was really here just for a snack and drink."}
{"text":"My fave dishes are spaghetti with meat sauce and extra cheese,  and steak with spaghetti.  Their drinks always seem to be a bit small tho. Good price.  Not noisy."}
{"text":"100th review!!  Fitting it should be an HK style cafe!  Pros: Lots of booths for a smaller place Vast menu  Cons: Drink is not included with many meals  You will not mistake this place for not being an HK style cafe as that is literally the name of this place.  This place is located in a small plaza but you will never see it if you don't already know about it ahead of time.  The front entrance faces the inside of the plaza, not the road.  Hong Kong Style Cafe does what it needs to do well.  When you first come in, you'll notice the place is not the biggest.  It does however manage to fit a lot of seats inside.  There are several booths along the outside and tables on the inside.  You can fit a lot more than you think looking from the outside.  Turnover is really quick sp even if you come during peak times you should get a seat without too much of a wait.  Hong Kong Style cafe offers a daily set of specials everyday.  These specials come with a soup and a drink for a pretty good price.  These specials along with afternoon tea though, are the only items that come with a drink here.  If you order anything else, you will need to buy an extra drink if you want one.  Most HK style cafes usual offer a lot more choices with drinks. I love getting a HK style milk tea and to have to pay an extra $3 when it normally is an extra $1 sucks a little bit.  That's about my only gripe here.  Ordered the baked shrimp and chicken on rice with cheese and cream sauce and my GF got the pork chop and potato salad dish.  The food comes out rather quickly even when busy.  Portions here are also very good for the prices.  My rice was very good, a little on the salty side but not by much.  My little one absolutely loved it because they give you a good amount of cheese on it.  My GF's pork chop was huge, one of the better portions I've seen.  The potato salad could of been better but for $4.95, you can't complain too much.  The servers here all always great every time I come.  I've never had trouble with service here whatsoever.  They always have 3 servers here and they get to everyone quickly enough where you never feel you're waiting too long for anything.  The place also very well kept and always looks presentable.  This is one of the better HK style cafes out there.  You won't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Would return, but wouldn't crave for it.  Baked Portuguese Chicken Rice and a can of pop was $10.45 plus tip for lunch.  Rice and Sauce portion was pretty big. Was pretty authentic, I would say it could use one more piece of chicken. The Potatoes were pretty good, actually, Potatoes were above average! They tasted special, maybe it was marinated and then stir-fried. Very distinctive flavour.  Place is very well staffed for lunch! Super staffed!!Not good for business, but great for customers!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. It was busy but we were able to have a table. We decided to each have a daily special. Ordered the baked fish in cream sauce on spaghetti. It comes with a drink and soup. The soup came quick and tasted good, but I found it a bit salty. The fish in sauce was a large portion. It all tasted great.  Hong Kong style cafe is a nice place to eat. The staff is friendly, although she had forgotten my wife's drink. You will leave there full without emptying your wallet since everything is well priced."}
{"text":"Cheap daily specials mean that you can have an entree, soup and drink for $10 tax and tip included. Great value, and that's what earns it the 4th star.  I always have the baked pork chop with tomato sauce on rice. The tomato sauce is creamy and the pork chop isn't all bone or batter. They offer a Chinese soup or a Russian Borscht for soup options. Oddly, our combo didn't come with bread and butter as most places do.  They have limited room for larger groups, so make a reservation as they can get busy sometimes (but it's entirely unpredictable when it is and isn't busy). Food comes fast.  Cash only. Large parking lot, park further away and walk rather than fight for the limited spaces by the front door."}
{"text":"The menu option is very little for a HK style Cafe. Food is okay, but not exceptional. There are definitely better places around the block."}
{"text":"At the end of the day, HK style cafes (and that's applying to all of them) should have a breakfast menu. Oatmeal, egg sandwiches, ham + macaroni plus a tea/coffee combo. And sadly, this particular cafe does not, which really disappoints.  I was here at 10:30am with the fam and looking forward to a cheap breakfast. Alas, we had an early, cheap lunch instead. I had the daily special - baked pork chop on fried rice ($7.95) - I have a sneaking suspicion that it was not actually baked, but merely cooked. It was aighhttt, good portion of it.  Also tried the baked fish filet with cream sauce on fried rice ($7.95). Now this one was quite good! Despite, again, not being baked.   Overall, a good deal to be quite filled, especially since it comes with drinks too."}
{"text":"Hong Kong Style Cafe is a Hong Kong Style Cafe. What a original way to name your business... or they just could not think of a better name? Since it is a boy, let's call it a boy!  This is a new restaurant that replaced Ah Yuen Steakhouse http://www.yelp.ca/search?find_desc=ah+yuen&ns=1&find_loc=Markham%2C+ON+L3R .  It was not my bad reviews that closed down Ah Yuen, but it is just business cycle of Chinese business that kept reinventing themselves with the same cast and just giving themselves a new name.  What made a Hong Kong Style Cafe a good HK Style Cafe??  - Value - Varieties - Cheap - Decent food - Breakfast/Lunch/Afternoon/Dinner Specials - Fast Services  Hong Kong Style Cafe has all the above!   Pork Hock Soup Guilin Style ($5.99) includes  soup and  drink, after I ate that, my plan of going to yoga class just fell apart. Just too much food... I don't know if I can even fit into my yoga outfit! I do have better Pork Feet, since they were not too tender.. and the broth lack flavour...  Baked Pork Chop with Rice ($6.99) includes soup and drink was A-OK. The pork was lean and tender and the tomato sauce was quite flavoured.  There are 10 different all day specials for $5.99/$6.99 for you to choose from, if not you can also order from the regular menu which is extensive.  Hong Kong Style Cafe is a good place for a cheap date. Clean interior, nicely decorated, cheap food....... but I am not your cheap date though! :)"}
{"text":"Not a place that would catch your attention had you not done your research ahead of time but I would say it's worth a try.   I got the steak and pork chop sizzling plate set dinner (18.99) with the option for free rice at an additional cost of $1. My mother grabbed the pork cutlet sandwich lunch special while my father grabbed the steak dinner special.  The food here is pretty standard along with most HK style cafes. My rice was not cook as soft as I myself prefer but was not bad. The meats I had started off pretty decent but since I had ordered a sizzling plate, it got pretty overcooked towards the end of my meal.  The black milk tea and honey lemonade my mother and I had were both pretty tasty. However, my dessert which was a scoop of vanilla ice cream, was a bit odd in taste in which I did not enjoy. I probably will not be coming back as its pretty out of the way from everything and there is nothing that stands out from other similar options."}
