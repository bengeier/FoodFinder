{"text":"Tonight I had their turkey dinner. Real home cooked turkey. In house made mashed potatoes. It was so good and filling. My husband had their fried chicken and loved it. Worth a trip if you are looking for good home cooking.!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, huge variety on their menu with moderate prices. Overall it's a great little diner!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast and dinner here at separate times of course. Each time the food has been very good. The only reason I didn't  give it 5 stars was due to the fact it is was really cold inside the restaurant at both meals. I take everything into consideration when reviewing and you have to have heat in the winter months. I may have to wait to go back in the spring for another meal. But I will go back. The staff was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The Diner is a very good restaurant in down. Nice chicken wraps, homemade poutine, and warm coffee. All make you feel relaxed and satisfied in the storm weather in Canada. Also, people here are very nice : ) Recommendation!!!"}
{"text":"The Oakdale Diner has reopened under new management as of 4/2011. I found the food and service (wonderful baked goods as well) to be great, the prices comparable to pancake houses, and the atmosphere a retro trip to the '50's-very fun!"}
{"text":"Went there to get Chinese tonight and had to pay extra to get all white meat chicken and was not told that it would cost me! Not happy at all! They should have said that it costs extra to get all white meat!"}
{"text":"I visited the diner Oct 19 , with my 2 teenage sons for dinner. The restaurant was very busy, but honestly ran like a well oiled machine.  Everyone was extremely polite, and from the waitresses,  the cooks , and management staff, very professional.  Our meals, came in a timely manner, and our drinks were filled, regularly.  The food was delicious,  and comments of DAD I'M TOO FULL FOR DESSERT! !!,  coming from my eating machine teenage boys, I knew my choice of restaurants,  was a wise one. I will continue to visit the diner, as always,  and hope that \" hometown feel diner \"will never change. ...."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've had the pleasure of dining at. The food has been great and the help have been pleasant. Have eaten there a few times now and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"The Oakdale Diner is a great spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Breakfast is a given, they do a great job, portions are huge and everything is amazing.  Be sure to check out the pastry case first because some of their stuff will melt your brain.  SO YUMMY!  I am picky about my eggs over medium and they make them so well every time.  

The Diner is a favorite spot for Chinese food.  Yes, they have a seasonal Chinese Food menu and it is better than every little take out place for miles around.  Why the Diner has such good Chinese food, I do not know.  

We also go to the diner for Italian food, my wife especially loves the meatless stuffed shells.  Huge portions, great prices, and their sauce is just perfect.  Again, why a diner has such great Italian food I don't know, but when I want Chicken Parm I go to the Oakdale Diner instead of a pure Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to. It's a diner with gourmet food. I had salmon with apple salsa and my brother had eggplant parmigiana with Granny Smith apples. Absolutely delicious and inexpensive!! Another diner got a Stromboli that was thick and the size of a loaf of bread. We will definitely return to this surprising restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Every time we are back visiting family my hubby, my sister, and I go out to The Diner with our grandfather. This is probably my husband's favorite part of the trip - he always breaks out into a huge smile thinking about the massive omelet stuffed with veggies that he is going to eat. I am a huge fan of their pepperoni rolls. At the last visit I got a breakfast sandwich, which hit the spot and was the perfect amount of food for me. Service has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"We just visited the Oakdale Diner.  I guess considering it had the word \"diner\" in its title I had higher expectations for our visit, especially considering it was for breakfast.  I had the big breakfast with four sausage links, three eggs, frozen potatoes, and toast.  My wife had french toast and bacon.  The kids had Mickey chocolate chip pancakes.  Overall I would compare the food to slightly above Kings Restaurant.  In the breakfast hierarchy, Eat N Park is the worst, then Denny's, Kings, and then you venture to Bob Evans, with Cracker Barrel leading the chains.  

It wasn't a bad breakfast, I was just expecting more, because of the diner in the title.  I wanted homemade potatoes, not frozen.  In addition, I felt the meals were 1.00 or so a bit overpriced.  Service was fantastic!

I would eat here again, but need to hit Pamela's first!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat! The food is absolutely delicious and the service is great! 

Good home style cooking in a small restaurant that will take you back in time. 

If you're in the area, try this place."}
{"text":"Simply put I love this place. Need more? Well then: The Diner in Oakdale is by far one of my favorite places to grab a bite. The small local diner is welcoming the moment you step in the door, the only challenge is finding a table since it is self-seating. The staff are all friendly and the menu has plenty to satisfy a variety of preferences. From breakfast to dinner if you are hungry the Diner will not disappoint."}
{"text":"It's a shame the service is running your business.  The food is good but this is the second time everyone at my table finished their food before my food was brought out!  They never offered to at least cover my meal. Once they completely forgot we were even there!  Terrible, terrible service. You need to hire more help and a new manager!"}
{"text":"Have a no 1 village special and upgrade fries to putine.  People here are nice.  Food is great.Have a no 1 village special and upgrade fries to putine.  People here are nice.  Food is great.Have a no 1 village special and upgrade fries to putine.  People here are nice.  Food is great."}
{"text":"It was always a running gag between us and the rest of our friends when we drove by to see that their special for the day was \"club sandwich\" or something equally as generic. My girlfriend and I finally walked into the establishment one summer day to bite the bullet and try the infamous diner.

The food wasn't BAD but it was just average. The thing that really got me was how expensive it somehow all was. The other troubling thing was the fact that our waitress looked like she was 13 and had literally at least 7 piercings around her face. I really can only fault the price but the whole place was just weird. Everyone in the diner felt like an extra from Men in Black where you try and guess if they're an alien in disguise.

It's kind of intriguing in its simplicity and ambiguity but once you get in there you realize it isn't doing it on purpose. It's just horribly mismanaged."}
{"text":"The Diner was great. I went on a Sunday morning with my wife and toddler.  Our server was patient and the food was solid diner breakfast food, perfect. 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst tasting prime rib I ever had.  Don't waste your time going there on Saturday's for prime rib night.  Instead try Roland's in Washington, PA on Saturday's (must reserve in advance cause they sell out).

On the other hand, the Oreo Cookie pie was fantastic!  A prefect place to go if you have a craving for a dessert.

Still need to try this place for breakfast.  Haven't written them off yet."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of a restaurant.  The food is awesome.  If you eat here once, you will be coming back for more.  Everything is made from scratch from the burgers to homemade soup - and there is lots of it.   The staff are friendly and accommodating (can I have half a poutine - sure no problem}.  I can't say enough about this place except - Try It!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I was really intrigued that they served pizza/hoagies as well as Chinese. The Chinese was surprisingly good, it was really fresh and they have a Chinese chef. It's great because my husband doesn't like Chinese food so we can go here . And he can get a calzone and I can have Chinese. The staff is also really friendly and the place is very clean. We'll go again!"}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that this place is a 2.5. I was always a little skeptical of this place since they are called \"The Diner\" and also have Chinese food. (I love Chinese food, but would prefer it from a Chinese restaurant.) My husband and I came here for breakfast last Sunday and it looked like a great place with home-style cooking. There were no issues with parking and we did not have to wait to be seated. The inside also had that \"diner feel\" and I regretted not coming here sooner. Immediately upon being seated, I started to question my regrets. There was a giant dying moth on our sticky table and I understand that it could happen anywhere- it just had me feeling a bit uneasy. There was a very small selection of breakfast choices; yet, 1/3 of the entire menu was Chinese food. The prices of breakfast options were average and we did have a coupon, which was excepted without an issue. My husband and I got the \"Diner Two's\" meal, which was two pancakes or french toast, two pieces of meat, and two eggs. Ultimately, everything was just OK. Not bad, but really nothing special. The eggs could have used some salt and pepper, the sausage could have been cooked a little more and my husband was unhappy because his french toast did not include cinnamon and powdered sugar as it said on the menu. To give the place some credit, the service and bacon were good."}
{"text":"Went to this diner after my bike ride and I have to say I was splendidly surprised. My boyfriend and I shared a basket of boneless wings and I ordered the bacon burger. The bacon was supposed to be a dollar more but I got it for free! The burger was a bit dry but still a very good meal. Prices are very good and the atmosphere is like every other diner: homey."}
{"text":"Good value and I like the location. Good enough coffee and better than average value on portions. Great option for lunch."}
{"text":"The Diner is your typical diner- go there for Sunday breakfast or when you need somewhere local. Although they got rid of their Chinese food, the menu still offers a variety of food. I typically am here for breakfast if anything, and I am mostly always satisfied with my meal. 

This restaurant is very small, and gets very packed very easily. If you want to eat here, you either need to come at an odd ball time or be willing to wait. 

The Diner features a variety of desserts as well as an ice cream bar. The decor of this restaurant is amazing, and really takes you back to the '50s."}
{"text":"Ok, this place would have gotten 4 stars had the place been a little nicer, but, hey, it's a diner. Very happy with food, large portions, enjoyed the chili. If you like no-frills good diner food, you'll like this place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband. I kept it basic and ordered a grilled cheese and fries. My husband got a meatball sandwich. 

The grilled cheese was fine, but nothing spectacular. I will say the menu options looked better for breakfast and dinner. The food I saw going to other tables also looked good. I will definitely come back and try something different. 

The service was great. Our server was friendly, personable, and attentive. The inside of the restaurant looks pretty run down, but seemed clean. Not surprising for a diner."}
{"text":"first time..went for breakfast. Pancakes were awful. Dry and cold. Like they were sitting or reheated in the microwave. Cold syrup is the saddest thing ever at a restaurant. Buy the microwaveable bottles, I know you have one.  We got the hungryman and they forgot 1 of our meats..which apparently was \"my fault\" and after we were done eating and realized they also never gave us the potatoes. Biscuits and gravy... Biscuits are clearly not homemade. Small little things that came from a can is more like it. Service has lots of room to improve. Didn't get that \"friendly hometown diner\" feeling. We will try again for dinner , maybe breakfast just isn't their thing."}
{"text":"My husband and I happened upon this small town diner on the way to our nephew's championship football game at South Fayette High School. We both had the \"Middle of the Road\" breakfast, with our own slight variation. Everything was excellent. The breakfast potatoes were the best I've ever had, no seasoning or condiments needed. The service was fast and efficient. I hope I have the opportunity to visit for breakfast again! It's a bit of a journey from home, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Small town, quaint feel diner with a good selection of foods from breakfast to dinner. Food is good, staff attentive, and clean restaurant in an old fashioned diner atmosphere. If you're there for breakfast get it before noon as only one bfast plate is available all day. Don't forget they deliver too :)"}
{"text":"Went to the place with limited expectations. My daughter was whining we had to go. Real negative start. We got there, kind of fun, 50's motif. The food  was ridiculously good. My daughter had fried chicken that was enormous in portion and really tasty. She loved it. I had a  great turkey dinner. Gone a few more times by my daughter's choice. Great, inexpensive eats."}
{"text":"So good. First time I was here. The food was homemade. We got fried mushrooms, you could tell they were handbreaded. I got a reuben and onion rings. It was delicious and onion rings were hand breaded too. My friend got the Italian hoagie and she said it was great. Ate entirely to much because the food is so good. Portions are huge. Great prices too and great service! I definately recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in for take out burger and fries meal.  

This establishment is very reminiscent of the diners I frequented with my parents in the late 1950s and early 1960's. The Hamburgers and French Fries are made in the same manner as back then. The ground meat tasted fresh, was nice and thick and cooked to perfection. 

The fries certainly did not come out of a freezer, you can tell that they were freshly cut and had a wonderful taste (unlike the ones coming from a freezer bag which taste like oiled cardboard).

Wonderful homey place with lots of old fashioned character. Can't wait to return for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is the second time for me. I stumbled onto this lil diner a few weeks ago and stopped in just to give it a try.
I got the double cheese burger with bacon. Very good as far as diner food goes. The wait staff was fast & friendly.
tonight I ordered the Italian hoagie. Excellent. I would recommend supporting this small hometown diner on your next visit
to Oakdale PA. I'll be back to try that Whisky Cake ! Sounds Yummieeee."}
{"text":"The diner owner was so sweet! He gave us each a free pop when we ordered the large poutine. The portion was huge; lots of gravy and cheese curds! We had to get a takeout box and eat the rest for dinner. If you guys are ever around Angus, please visit :) follow @ngo.hai.kim on instagram for more reviews"}
{"text":"Food is always good, service excellent as well. Glad they opened the ice cream on the side porch however it's not very inviting, more like a storage area.  We stopped a week or so ago and the ice cream was excellent, very creamy and perfect consistency. My daughter was glad they changed their 'recipe' as she only agreed to go because other ice cream shops in the area were closed.  Well apparently they went back to the old ice milk she remembered tonight ... Chocolate was too dark and the vanilla was off white and fast to melt.  Hopefully they go back to the better flavor or we will be going a few miles further for ice cream in the future."}
{"text":"Have frequented The Diner many times and loved it in the past, driving quite a distance. Stopped there 4PM, Sunday 4/15/18 and was quite disappointed! The entire place was empty and the two servers, one young lady, and one older lady let us sit there unapproached for almost 10 minutes. The older lady with short dyed brown hair was extremely loud and obnoxious, talking a mile a minute. Eventually we ordered food which was average, but also ordered an expensive supreme pizza to take home. We had to ask the waitress for the pizza, and also ordered two cupcakes to go, which they had NO box to fit them! This made this quite an expensive lunch, only to find that evening, that the box contained a plain cheese pizza, obviously intended for someone else. 
I called the next afternoon and asked to speak with a manager about our displeasure, and was told none was there. When asked when there would be, I was told they \"had no idea\" and they hung up!
Not the place or the treatment we have received in past visits, but this experience will make us NEVER return. This small place that already went out of business once and sat empty, best wake up and get the fact that there are many BETTER choices, and a customer feel valued, goes a long way!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The servers are so friendly and the food is good. They check in often to make sure the meal is going well."}
{"text":"I drive past here daily, so one day when my brother was home from Iraq we decided to go. The waitress was extremely rude, didn't greet us for 5 minutes, and was very short with us when taking our order. It was 10am on a Wednesday morning, they were dead. She instantly greeted the other customers that came in after us. I won't be going back, nor would I recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Good old down home diner. Great food, low priced and a plate full. Only been there for breakfast and wish I could go back everyday for the rest of my life. Sausage gravy biscuits are to die for. Wait staff was very friendly along with the chef. It's definitely a locals joint but we're new to town and the waitress made us feel very welcome. The diner was clean, booths were comfortable and they also have an old bar to sit at. This place is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night at 7. Not busy. Always walk past the desserts as soon as you go in. They are look so delicious but didn't get anything. Stuck with a spinach and feta pizza. The best part of the meal. Their traditional pizza is great with lots of cheese and fluffy crust. Tried a veggie wedgie as well. It was HUGE. Although not sure how I feel about the cold veggies on it. Filled with mushrooms, peppers, zucchini, lettuce tomatoes. Hardly any cheese. I'd probably try one of the other choices next time. Also got the french fries which were super crispy, great dipped in gravy. Overall, get the pizza. Won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Good value, good food, friendly service. Hey, it's a diner, and the food is like grandmas place. Check it out. You won't be disappointed. Roast beef and home style mash potatoes & gravy? Man, I think I'm hungry again!!!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this review needs to be so negative however despite good food and great portions our experience at the Diner was ruined by the rudeness and inappropriate behavior of the young lady who is managing it.  Upon receiving our bill, we provided a gift card we had received and it was refused.  The manager had the waitress tell us they have a new system and cannot access the values of any \"old\" cards therefore they are not accepting them.  When questioned as to how that is possible when the card is less than a year old, she didn't move from her position in a booth in the back, just restated that it's too old and dismissed us.  Her attitude and complete disregard for customer service will result in our never going back."}
{"text":"Food is always great but service usually lacks and if it's hot out the AC can't keep.  Sat eating my meal sweating like crazy!!!  Need to invest some money into the building as they do have the food figured out!!!!"}
{"text":"Very old timey local place in downtown Oakdale.  Very ample portions.  And easy take home.  Wait staff busy and efficient.  Was busy steadily yesterday.  Pricing fine.  Only a couple of places in Oakdale to eat.  We chose this because of its location."}
{"text":"The veggie omelette was huge. It was really good, too, even though it was swimming in grease. They had mancini's which is always a plus. Fruit was fresh too. Only complaint would be the grease.

My wife got her usual poached eggs and toast."}
{"text":"What an awesome little hometown joint! The Oakdale diner is certainly full of surprises! Go in, take a seat, and order what you want. From breakfast, to lunch, to dinner, to American cuisine, to Chinese cuisine for lunch. They have everything, including some delicious pastries when you walk in.

I've been to the diner for lunch before, and today I decided to try their breakfast. I know breakfast isn't really anything to rave about. But I did have a good meat lovers omelette and rye toast. Full of flavor and was a nice fill to start the day. 

You can order take out and they do offer catering services. They recently just launched an app so you can redeem rewards like a free breakfast and appetizers.  I am happy to see this little mom and pop try new things! Oh, and the waitresses are always fun and friendly!"}
{"text":"In the ongoing challenge of trying to find somewhere to eat that isn't a chain we decided to give The Diner a try, it's right down the road from where we live but we never think about it. 
I had the tuna melt which came with fries and I was thrilled, it was a perfect diner tuna melt with nothing fancy in the tuna salad and your choice of cheese (provolone, do the provolone) and it was huge (I ended up taking half home). My boyfriend got the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs which came with a salad, the sauce had lots of tomato chunks in it which he wasn't thrilled about but the portion was huge and he took about half home. It was about $30 for the food and 2 sodas and for the portions being as big as they were that wasn't too bad. Their menu is very interesting from the traditional diner things to pizza & subs to chinese food. The dessert case looked amazing.
The decor is great, it looks like an old diner which I love. Parking was no problem and the service was great. It's not really big inside so I'm sure you would have issues finding a table during peak times."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the food.  We got an Italian hoagie, fries, and fried mushrooms.  All the food was really good, although the fries were nothing special.  The hoagie was perfect.  Toasted just enough to melt the cheese, but the bread was still soft.  Service could have been a little quicker at the beginning, but once we were greeted, no complaints.  They also bake on-site.  6 donuts to go.  They're fluffy and delicious, messy, but not too sweet.  A total win."}
{"text":"I visited The Diner today for lunch. I got a half meatball hoagie, with a side of french fries. The meatballs were very tasty, the bread was fresh. The french fries were fried perfectly, but they lacked seasoning. With a side of ranch, I enjoyed them a lot. Our server was very friendly, and we enjoyed our conversations with her. I look forward to going back for breakfast and maybe even trying a cupcake next time! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Looking for a local breakfast place, we logged on yelp and ok chance on The Dinner. We were so surprised. The inside is very clean and looks like a 1960's diner! So far, love love love!
The service was great! Everybody friendly and cheerful. All questions answered and refills on soda and coffee plenty and quick.
The food is great! We have had breakfast and lunch there. Both times, taking home a pastry for later. 
I would recommend this place to friends and will bring guests there for sure.
A great experience! Bravo!"}
