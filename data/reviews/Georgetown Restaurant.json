{"text":"I'm all about a reasonably priced happy hour, so I was thrilled that Georgetown was suggested. We were promptly seated upon arriving, but it took approximately 15 minutes for a server to come take our orders. Due to the length of the wait for a waitress, we decided to order our drinks, appetizers, and meals all at once. The appetizers and meals arrived at an appropriate pace, but we waited 25 minutes for our drinks when our appetizers were even delivered first. The food was nothing to rave about (although I heard the short rib sliders were fantastic), but the heavy wine pour certainly made up for it.  All of the staff, including the manager, appeared to be working their tails off. One waitress's average pace was actually more of a brisk jog than a casual walk.  I would be willing to give it another shot and would keep it in happy hour rotation if the swiftness of service improves."}
{"text":"Three Birds was by far my favorite restaurant! I was a regular. On my first visit to Georgetown the food and service was still terrific, but there was live loud music that killed the ambiance. My second visit things were better. The music was softer and the food great. The third visit was the last. When I bit into a stale breadstick I knew something was wrong. Next, there was no amuse' (small bite) that was always a staple at Three Birds. Then came the horrible dinner. A greasy, salty, overly garlicky pile of mashed potatoes with an overcooked price of fish. I knew immediately that the chef and the manager were gone, and that I would not be back for dinner. I have been back to the bar, and to see the still incredible servers. The bar area is fun, and the drinks are good. I had some good small plates there, but I can't go back for dinner.  The incredible ambiance is gone. It was once a great restaurant with a wonderful bar.  Now it's a great loud and noisy bar with a beautiful restaurant with mediocre to bad overpriced food. The great servers, some are still there."}
{"text":"This place is up and down.  Really a toss up to be honest.  My wife and I were married in January 2016 in the courtyard and the Georgetown catered it.  The food was absolutely amazing...the NY strip was probably the biggest and best I've ever had (and let's be honest, wedding food usually isn't very good).  The parmesean crusted chicken was outstanding as well.  So naturally we figured the restaurant itself would be just as good.  We went there for a valentine's day brunch and it was very good.  The service was nice as well.  Stuffed French toast and a steak eggs Benedict...  On Friday July 8th we decided to take my parents there for the amazing steak they had at our wedding.  Sadly, the menu had changed and there was no steak.  Oh well...we started off with the truffle fries.  They were delicious.  I had the bacon truffle mac and cheese, my wife had the sesame crusted mahi mahi, my mother had the bologense and my father had the bbq pork strip loin.  The first thing that was very appearent was that the chefs do not use, or have never heard of salt.  A little salt really brings out flavor.  None of the entrees had any salt or seasoning...very bland.  We had to have the server bring us salt and pepper.  Very odd for an upscale restaurant.  Onto the entrees...   The mac and cheese was fantastic but I was expecting a slice a garlic toast or something to go along with it.    The mahi mahi needed salt and was slightly burnt on top of the sesame seeds.  The purple pear and apple slaw that accompanied it was unremarkable and lacked any apple or pear.   The bologense, again, needed a dose of salt.  The penne pasted was visibly old and had a dark yellow hue and was overly chewy.  The sauce, however, was bursting with meat.  The bbq pork strip loin was your basic pork steak.  Very large...and very fatty.  Yhere was very little edible meat.  The bbq sauce seemed to be an afterthought and tasted heavy on the bourbon (I'm just guessing that bourbon was the base).  Two large tater tots accompanied it.  The tots were slightly undercooked and once again...needed a healthy dose of salt.  The server noticed that the alot of the pork was uneaten and asked what the issue was.  We explained the issue to the server and she apologized.  They offer us a free dessert as compensation.    Like I said, this place is a toss up.  The resturant itself is beautiful but a little cramped.  We will give it another try in the hopes that it is as good as our catered wedding food."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for sub-par food and sloooww service. We went for the patio -and it is one of the nicest patios you'll find on the West Side of Cleveland - shaded, lush greenery and spacious. I would say if you want to go sit outside and drink, this would be fine but do not plan on even a mediocre dining experience.    There were three of us in our party, our server who has been there for years apparently, was extremely slow - it took over 20 minutes for him to even take our order.  It went downhill from there, one of us had the duck which the server highly recommended - it was supposed to be roasted - it looked more like it was stewed or braised - unappetizing, no sear on it, and swimming in sauce.  I had the special - ahi tuna, should be relatively simple to make appetizing - wrong.  Was suppsoed to be prepared rare with an olive tapenade (that should have been my first tip-off) on top of a \"potato salad\".  The tuna barely had any pink to it, let alone rare, it was way over-seasoned on top of which the olives made it incredibly salty.  The potatoes were mealy in texture and not much of a salad.  The other in our party had the scallops, she said they were ok - they looked like they had a nice a sear, but don't know if they were cooked properly.  We started with the maine lobster pizza - GRAEASY and gross; others got caesar salads - soso there and completely overdressed.  The food was ridiculously over priced, for the price you pay you're better off going 10 minutes further into Ohio City - the Flying Fig, Crop, or Tremont to Farenheit, or Dante.  Bummer because I really wanted to find a great West Side restaurant with an equally great patio - this wasn't it."}
{"text":"When I heard about all of the awards that Georgetown in Lakewood got, such as \"Best Outdoor Dining\" and \"Best Happy Hour,\" I knew that I had to check it out. And it did seem to live up to those distinctions; I'm actually very surprised by the amount of negative reviews on here.  My friends and I made reservations for Friday evening and were seated without a problem. It took a couple minutes to get our drink orders in, but considering it was rather busy, I wasn't going to blame them for it. Of course, after our waitress (Carly) gave us our drinks, she abruptly left us while one of my friends was trying to order appetizers. It may have been due to the bustle of the place or terrible training, however it honestly seemed like she meant well, which just made me feel bad for her.   As for the food, we split the Maine Lobster Pizza for an appetizer, which was absolutely delicious. It was loaded with manchego cheese, caramelized cipollini onions, roasted garlic puree, and fresh herbs. I highly recommend trying it; it is one of the best pizzas I've ever had at a restaurant. For my entree, I had the filet mignon, which came with a roasted mini baked potato, spring succotash, and veal reduction. The filet was unfortunately a little dry, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it. Next time, I'll remember to order it as \"rare\" instead of \"medium rare.\"  In conclusion, I think that Georgetown is better than the earlier comments seem to imply, but it's not the best restaurant out there. The service could use some work, maybe some better organizational skills on the management's part. However, the food is pretty good, the outdoor atmosphere is amazing, and I will definitely be coming back for at least that pizza."}
{"text":"We used to go to georgetown weekly when it was called 3 birds, we loved it.  The chef was amazing.  When the new owner changed the name to georgetown we continued to go and still enjoyed it.  Then they changed the menu completely.  Made it more bar food.  We stopped going and recently went back twice.  The first time was ok we ordered salads and sliders.   Nice salads, sliders were ok.  We went back last night, once again on a saturday the inside dining was empty, but the bar was full.  Ordered the scallop special which was drowning in a thick flavorless sauce, the special clam chowder, had no clams and what tasted like artichokes in it. Very strange, the bolognese was flavorless and once again had an odd taste of something that shouldnt be in it.  Georgetown has become a place to go for drinks and small bites.  I would not recommend it for a nice dinner.  Wish they had kept the old menu and chef."}
{"text":"I gave it one star ONLY because Yelp doesn't allow you to leave NO stars.  horrible food that tries way too hard.  Live music in a small place, bad idea unless you're a bar.   Georgetown doesn't know what it wants to be, so it's trying to be everything and succeeding at nothing.    they did make a VERY good dirty martini, the ONLY high point in the evening.  at least they have a good bartender!    a hint to Georgetown:  good food doesn't need to be \"reinvented\" or try too hard.  Sadly it was so bad I wouldn't give it a second chance."}
{"text":"The drinks and the look and feel of the restaurant were amazing, but the food was just not good. Myself and another person ordered a lamb dish which came with 3 pieces of lamb.  All of the pieces of lamb on my plate and his plate were cooked differently.  One piece was raw and the other two were over done.  Lamb had a very strong weird flavor and was not seasoned at all.  Another person at the table ordered the duck medium rare and it came out well done.  It had the consistency of pork.  All of the veggies were cooked inconsistently also, some were raw and some were over done.  This restaurant is a short walk from my house so I wanted it to be good, but the food was awful and very expensive.  All of our plates were about $25, way too expensive for crap poorly cooked food.  Dons lighthouse is our normal restaurant of choice, we will know not to stray from there anymore."}
{"text":"Disappointing both service and food. They really need to kick it up a couple notches on both counts! Overpriced as well for average portions of average food!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting on the patio while I post... and have been for 15+ minutes without a single server acknowledging my party's presence. Not exactly what you expect from a \"high end\" restaurant when you have a reservation. Finally waved a server down and calmly explained that we haven't had any attention yet, to which he responded, \"it's not my fault, but I'll take you.\" Wonderful. Love the patio atmosphere, but will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food is good. I like the area its located in, and the patio. I went for dinner, and the prices seemed a little high. I would go back for happy hour and to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Had drinks and small plates in the bar last night and, as always, everything was very good, including the service. The banana peppers and sausage dish was outstanding! Have never been disappointed at Georgetown, try to stop in whenever visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting for the first time to Georgtown on Saturday April 02, 2016.....the food was excellent, drinks were good, prices were reasonable and lastly our server Mark was out of this world..... Thanks for an for an unforgettable time Mark you're the best and it was a honor  to meet Mickey (owner) ......I woke up this morning with those chorizo tacos on my mind....can't wait to get back and real soon!"}
{"text":"Well, there are two words ...well, make that three, that you need to remember about Georgetown.  The first two words are Happy and Hour.  Seriously, it's a solid deal at an OK (not uber cheap) price.   If you're over 30 (ahem) you'll enjoy the mellow vibe.  For a post-work drink during the holidays with a work chum, the atmosphere is quite pleasant.   The bartender/server was personable, fun and just-chatty-enough.  Kudos to her.  Wine:  Two selections of South African reds on special - both tasty.     Nibbles: Maine \"lobstah\" pizza was spend-y but good.  Italian popcorn was \"meh\" - basically some popped, oily corn tossed with some damp peppers.  And a perfectly acceptable hummus accompanied by fresh baked pizza dough (aka flatbread).  I'd return.  Oh yes, that third word?   PATIO ....one of the nicest in Cleveland.   You can't avail yourself of its charms in December, but it's pleasant to slurp a nice red and look  at the twinkling white lights outside the window and dream of June."}
{"text":"Still has the same feel as three birds. Service was outstanding. Great happy hour food and drink specials. Try the speck pizza, it was delicious."}
{"text":"I went for a company dinner party and ordered the Caesar salad, the filet of beef wrapped in pancetta, and the creme brûlée. The salad was nothing special kinda bland but not bad, the filet was a decent cut of meat, however it was clear it had not been trimmed properly and the pancetta was rather overpowering instead of a nice flavor blend, the Demi glaze was pretty flavorless as well. Actually the creme brûlée was the best thing I are there, it was good consistency and flavor I wish it had been torched for just a few seconds longer but it was good none the less. The meal was paid for so I wasn't too bummed out by the whole thing, however I would never return there. In short it's a restaurant that is not as good as they should be- food is subpar and overpriced. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday get together, ordered a flatbread pizza and it was BURNT!  I was shocked they even put it down in front of me.  Literally the crust and bottom was charred black.  I didn't say anything bc we were with a big group, and the service was painfully slow and terrible.  We will never go back.  I also barely ate 1 piece of the pizza and when I told the waiter I didn't want to take it home either, he thought nothing of of it and was just like ok, and took it away.  Hello, read between the lines."}
{"text":"The food was good but the management was horrible. Really bad service. I did not feel appreciative or respected due to manager."}
{"text":"I really miss Three Birds. This place is over-rated. Happy hour is fine. But, entrees are a mixed bag. Old oil is used so I get sick every time I eat here. Not worth spending that kind of money."}
{"text":"I actually wrote this in January, but apparently it saved as just a draft and not an actual review. So here it is, for what it's worth:  We went to this place last night for our anniversary. Despite having a reservation, they forgot to seat us! It was super busy, and we understood, and so we patiently waited while the hostess worked to get us a table. We ended up waiting well over an hour.   Once we were seated, our server came around to get us drinks. I ordered mine and she walked away right as my husband was about to order his! She came back 30 minutes later, he ordered his drink, and we were ready to order our food. She walked away before we had a chance to order any appetizer or entree. When she finally came back another 20 minutes later, we ordered the cheese plate to share, I the salmon, and my husband the beef tenderloin with a caesar salad. She also decided then was a good time to tell us the special for the day, though we had already been waiting almost another hour and had made up our minds as to what we wanted.   We waited another 45 minutes for our cheese plate. It was okay. The cheeses and fruits were pretty basic for a fancier cheese plate. I enjoyed the candied walnuts very much. My husband also got his salad, which I tasted, and we both agreed it was pretty good. Very heavy on the dressing and seasoning though, so if you don't like your salad like that, you may not like it.   Another 45 minutes later, our food came. I can't complain about my salmon, as it was all pretty good, though at that point I was so famished after waiting so long that anything may have tasted good. My husband's dish was supposed to come with a potato galette, but instead he got some seriously gross, undercooked pasty French fries. We've had better fries at Applebee's. What happened there? For the price you pay, you'd think they could up with something better than undercooked fries if they're out of something. Our server did apologize for the wait and she comped our cheese plate, which was nice.   I really wanted to like this place. We live in Lakewood and like to support local businesses. Sadly, I don't think we will be returning though. I sort of want the 3.5 hours of my life spent waiting and waiting and waiting back."}
{"text":"2/13/25.    My husband and I went to dinner to celebrate Valentine's Day. We tried to reserve for the 14th but they were all booked up. The place was packed, which for me is a positive recommendation.  The food was delicious; perfectly prepared, good portions, excellent variety. We had a nice, intimate table, and the service was very good. A special, unexpected treat was when the proprietor, Mickey Krivosh, went out of his way to have his bar staff prepare my favorite cocktail, an obscure champagne cocktail called La Fleur de Paradis.  We definitely plan Georgetown to be one of our favorite places for dinner.   C Stephens"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars because of their patio and happy hour! I am such a fan that when someone needs a suggestion for a great patio I tend to recommend this place! The patio has a great casual ambiance about it that makes you want to keep coming back.  I have to be honest and say that I have only had a few food items. The Pear & Gorgonzola salad is delicious and a great summer choice. I have also had the Spicy Tuna Roll on sushi night. While you can tell a true sushi chef does not roll them (mine fell apart) it had fantastic flavor and the tuna was great! A few friends have had their pizzas and gave 2 thumbs up to them. My least favorite dish would be the calamari as I found it to be chewy.  The drinks are absolutely delicious! Whether you enjoy a good glass of wine or a strong cocktail the drinks are great! I have tasted most of their happy hour cocktails and besides the patio these keep me coming back. You cannot beat the price!  Happy Hour is M-Sat, 5-7pm on the patio and at the bar only.They have $5 wine and cocktails, $3 beer and an extensive bar menu that for the most part is half off during happy hour."}
{"text":"We came early for happy hour and they let us sit outside, we didn't have to stay at the bar like most restaurants.  Their outdoor patio is beautiful.  We then ordered dinner from their $40 for 2.  Choice of salad and entree for 2 people plus a bottle of wine. Beautiful presentation and great food.  Our server was friendly and never acted rushed."}
{"text":"We asked to be seated outside after arriving on time for our reservation.  The hostess was rude and dismissive and told us that those tables were \"reserved.\"  Those tables remained empty the entire time we were there.  It also took almost 30 minutes before we even met our waiter. Just terrible service!  It's too bad cause the food was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio. Thank you for having a tuna fish that was not Asian inspired!!!! A delicious tuna with tomatoes, watermelon, feta and balsamic. Inspired. Thank you for making our evening complete."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy the atmosphere. The patio is one of the best here in Cleveland, but the service is pretty terrible. We had a larger party (8 people) to which we waited forever to get drinks, and then had to ask the server ourselves if we could put in  our food order. The server was taking care of the whole lower half of the patio and had no help whatsoever, nor did she put any hustle on anything. Overall, not the worst, but the food is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 12 for an anniversary dinner.  We were seated at a very small table (two tables meant for 4 at each table) so it was rather uncomfortable.  Service was efficient.  My husband got tacos and the slaw was browning so he didn't eat it.  I picked off the shrimp and ate it.  I think I had a margherita pizza?  It obviously wasn't memorable.  They do have a gorgeous patio!  This would have been a 2-star review but their happy hour prices bumped it to a 3."}
{"text":"We had a very good meal in a comfortable setting. The service was professional and I would highly recommend Georgetown. Georgetown also has one of the nicest outdoor seating venues in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went there on valentines day, but was seated 45 minutes after my reservation.  Many other couples were also waiting well after there reservation for the their tables. The restaurant clearly double booked.    It all really would have been fine except the hostess was totally unapologetic about their error. They were funneling all the waiting couples to a bar down the street that they own without offering any type of fee drink or appetizer for the wait.  Food was meh anyway."}
{"text":"The patio, food, and happy hour was fabulous.  The service needs some work. The bus boys (2) stood awkwardly close to the corner of our table while staring us down and didn't take our plates until we asked them to.  And this happened three times: apps, dinner, and dessert.  Our server overcharged one of the bills and took the rest of our bills and cards with her while she fixed the one with the error.  She returned 15 minutes later asking how the incorrect bill was wrong again and hadn't run the rest of our cards yet.  20 minutes later we got the corrected bill and our paid bills back."}
{"text":"I have been to Georgetown with friends a few times in the past and decided today to try Georgetown  for drinks and something to eat. I sat at the bar ordered a drink and later a pizza. No one asked if I needed a refill on my drink nor did the bartender later ask how my food was. I was completely ignored until I held up my credit card.  Before I left I asked the hostess if the manager was on duty. And who was the manager? The bartender who completely ignored me! He apologized and I told him there was no excuse for his non-service.  It sounded like he wanted to make it up to me but in this day and age if you don't sell service why would anyone want to return? I know people that go there regularly and I will be sharing my experience there!"}
{"text":"overall one of the best restaurants on west side , exceptional cousine & menu changes often so always something new to try, classy ambiance, consistently excellent well trained staff. patio reminds me of being back in European courtyard"}
{"text":"Georgetown is the perfect combination of a beautiful ambiance, great food, and a lovely staff.   A Lakewood treasure that everyone should experience."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my husband and I will never eat here again, unless its under new management or owner.  We use to go all the time when it was Three birds, and the service and food was amazing.  We especially like the patio.    Since it has been Georgetown, we have had 2 bad experiences.  The first was for our Anniversary, we decided to sit at the bar, and it took forever for anyone to take a drink order.  We Ordered a bottle of wine, which they didn't have.  Than we want on to our 2nd choice, and they didn't have.  My husband ordered the Lobster bisque' , if you even want call it that.  it was so watery and looked like a cup of cream.  it had no lobster in it at all.  Even the waitress said it didn't look right and gave us an explanation that all the Chiefs make it differently.  (She did remove it off our bill)  the rest of our order was so, so.    We than gave it a 2nd visit, thinking maybe that was just a bad night.  NOPE, it was even worse.  The hostess was all dis-shelved, She actually told us to \"Hold on\" because she needs time to get organized.  We stood there a good 10 min before she sat us.  ( no, there was not a line, or a wait)..The restaurant was pretty empty. My husband and I sat at the table for 15 mins before anyone came to take our order.  Finally someone came by and asked if we've been help yet.  We said 'No\" .  She than asked what we wanted..... I had to laugh, because we didn't even get menu's.  How could we order???  She ran around the place and found two menus and a drink list.  We ordered two glasses of the wine.  We drank those waiting for a while until  Of, course we had to wave a waitress down to take our order and refill our glasses.  Well, 45 mins since we ordered,our food still has not arrived.  We flagged down yet another waitress to check on our food.  Next thing I know, they;re scrambling around looking for our order.  Finally the manager/owner came to our table with an excuse, that they didn't expect many people since it was the day before 4th of July.  I told him, are you joking?  Most people are going to be out tonight, since they don't have to work tomorrow.  He knew I was upset.  I will say, they did remove about $40 of our bill for the inconvenience.  Overall, I'm just really disappointed.  This use to be such a wonderful place and its slowing going down the drain. :("}
{"text":"Been here a few times since it changed from Three Birds. Pretty good service. Great sounding menu items. Some times the execution isn't as good as the menu promises,  but many times they are getting it right. A little pricey, but the selections are worth it.   Had the Copper River salmon one evening. Prepared correctly, a very large portion with very crispy skin. Came with a pea purée that was a little strangely sweet for my taste, but otherwise great. The seafood Fra diablo was loaded with seafood, but the home made pasta was more like gnocchi than pasta.     Very nice patio. Good and popular bar for the professional adult singles crowd."}
{"text":"Ed 4.27.17   The restaurant was about 30 percent full .2 of us for dinner at 5.45 We were seated at that time and waited 20 minutes for drinks service very slow all through the tine we were there.We started with appetizers fish tacos and lobster pizza . The tacos arrived cold and the lobster on the pizza was mushy and I don.t think it had 1 oz of lobster on it.When we needed anything drinks a waitress to take our dinner order we had to wave her over.We gave up paid and went to a different restaurant .This was our second visit and we had poor service and cocktails glasses only two thirds full at that time.We dined here offen when it was 3Birds and recomended to friends but now I can.t say anything positive or see any reason to return"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner tonight, my wife and I and another couple.  We had reservations, so no issues with seating.  In fact, I thought the place was pretty dead, considering it was a Friday night.  Our waitress dropped by after a rather longish wait to see what we'd like to drink.  We'd been chatting and hadn't looked at the specialty drink menu, so we asked her to come back.  She did, eventually, but she'd been gone so long we'd also had a chance to choose our entrees.  She took our drink order and bolted w/o asking if we'd be interested in ordering our entrees.  A while later (again, the place really wasn't busy, plenty of open tables) she came back with the drinks and immediately launches into the specials.  We were in the middle of a fun discussion, but she didn't say, \"Would you like to hear about the specials?\"  she just basically performed an aural rape on our ears while she (reading from her pad) droned on about the 5-6 different specials.  We semi-politely listened (not like we had a lot of choice) until she was done, after which she bolted again.  WTF?    She came back in a bit and took our order.  Only one of us chose a special (pork chop), though he asked how much it cost first.  \"$22,\" she replied, \"Which is a real deal.\"  Thanks for your input, Stella.  The orders were given and off she went.  The food arrived in reasonable time and we all dug in.  I ordered a salmon dinner, which was described as served with rice cake, bok choy, assorted vegetables, and a horseradish mayo.  The salmon was...weird.  It actually looked FRIED.  We all looked at it and couldn't figure out how it'd been cooked, but it really looked like it had some kind of light breading on it and had been deep fried.  Once inside it was fine...you know, salmon.  Nothing unusual, nothing memorable.  Just...salmon.  I'm not sure what the point of the external treatment was; it didn't add anything to the flavor.  The veggies were overcooked and limp, with a couple leaves of bok choy throw over them.  They all basically tasted the same.  About a third of the way into the entree I finally began to taste the horseradish mayo and found some rice under the veggies.  There may have been two tablespoons of rice, total.  Pork chop boy said he liked his entree, though he didn't sound particularly thrilled.  My wife ordered some kind of chicken medallions and I tasted one.  Not bad.  Hard to screw up chicken.  Her veggies were like mine, however.  At one point the manager (I guess...someone at a higher pay scale than a waitress, at least) came around, pressing the flesh.  He asked how things were...well, generally I let these guys slide and save my reviews for Yelp, but this place has enough portentous attitude, I figured I'd answer honestly.  I told him basically what I've told you here.  He blinked at me for a moment...apparently he wasn't actually expecting anyone to tell him the truth (no surprise...who does (besides me....)) then he looked away from me and asked everyone else how their food was.  They all gave the obligatory answers and he left.  Wow.  Thanks for stopping by, Skippy.  During our meal, whenever the waitress stopped by she'd very rudely interrupt the conversation and take over.  She acted like we were holding up her night.  Well, that is, had she actually paused before launching into whatever she wanted to say.  The dinner progressed and toward the end the waitress stopped by and said the manager wanted to buy me a free dessert.  Hey, great...except we probably weren't planning on ordering dessert, anyway.  Nice scam...buy one individual dessert and everyone else will feel compelled to buy dessert to avoid having to sit there watching him eat his.  Anyway, the dessert menu didn't blow anyone's skirt up, so we passed.  No further offers of goodwill on the manager's part were forthcoming, however.  While we finished our dinner and drinks the busboy(s) started swarming us.  It was ridiculous.  I'd no sooner put the last bite of some bread in my mouth, one was reaching for my plate.  Dude...there's a ton of bread left in that basket, maybe I might want another piece? On one such busboy invasion, this kid was reaching across our table, through our conversation, and we finally just stopped talking and looked at him.  So here we are, four of us looking at him while he's staring down a saucer, trying to figure out how to reach it without climbing onto our table, and I finally said, \"Would you like us to order you something?\"  I mean, since he was apparently joining us tonight.  I thought I saw two brain cells fire momentarily, then go out.  All in all, we won't be going back.  The Georgetown is exactly what it looks like on the outside: a restaurant trying very hard to appeal to the cool crowd, with a chef who throws things at the wall to see what sounds good on the menu rather than putting any thought into how it will taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on their happy hour. They have an expansive happy hour menu which consists of both food and drink specials. The food menu has burgers, tacos, pizza, salad and some other light bites. When I went I opted for the G-town burger and caesar salad. I requested my burger to be served medium and it came out perfectly! The fries are fresh cut, which I prefer. The burger was a rather nice size; I wound up taking 1/2 of it home. The caesar salad was also good. It was served with a baked cheese crisp on top which was a nice addition. I opted for anchovies, since they indicated they are available upon request and I am an avid anchovy fan. The anchovies were nice and light and had a slight lemon taste, these were not the overly salty canned variety - so I was again pleased. I also tried the Amuse Me martini which was also another tasty addition to my meal. It wasn't an overly sweet cocktail but had a nice hint of blackberries and lemonade. The patio there is super cute but alas it was too cold to sit out there when I went. I def would like to go check out the patio, but I guess I will have to wait until next year when the weather gets warm again. Overall I think this is a solid choice for happy hour. Most people should be able to find something to their liking there."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - lovely. Drinks - perfect. Appetizers - nicely done. Entree - horrible and undercooked.  Sent back and came back over cooked and side dishes that came with dinner ice cold.  Was not edible. Service - worst I have had in past 10 years. Would never go back."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for years and it has really gone down hill for dinner this year, even worse than last year.  If you are looking for a place to get a flatbread pizza and a martini, that's about all that is still good here, seems most everyone in the place is doing that, so must be working for them.  Service way down hill too, server was inattentive, had to walk my bill to the hostess to hunt down my server just to pay my bill so I could leave.  support staff young and untrained, manager No place to be found.  People who like this place like $5 salads and $10 flat breads and don't even know real food and how excellent this place used to be.  When paying a $175+ bill I expect more.  Best for drinks on the patio and not much more these days."}
{"text":"Next year we are just going to the Fig.   My husband and I went to Georgetown for my birthday and I think I've learned my lesson. My birthday is bad for restaurant karma.  We had passed this place multiple times and my husband and I were of the we will try it at some point. We decided to go to celebrate my birthday and to have a real date (he's a real good catch).   Upon entering I was taken aback by the schizophrenic decor. Ultra modern lamps with faux wood tables and shabby chic cabinetry and fishing nets. But decor does not necessarily doom the food.   Our server was a bit overenthusiastic but really didn't know fine dining. The specialty cocktails were nothing to write home about so I stuck with my fallback a dry and dirty vodka martini. Instead I got a slightly dirty glass of vodka. Barely palatable. My husband's gin and tonic was weak. An amuse bouche shooter of soup was brought out before we ordered our appetizer. Foie gras and asparagus soup. It was the color of baby vomit, cold ad worst of all bland. Beyond the ethical concerns they could at least respect the animal.   We ordered our appetizer of a cheese plate. Why cheese plate? Because the other appetizers sounded disgusting. 10 dollars got you 3 small pieces of cheese, some stale crackers (grocery store grade), some unseasoned pecans and gooey dried fruit. The cheeses were unremarkable at best. The bleu brie was a single cream varietal which is an insult to brie everywhere. The irish cheddar left a lot to be desired it had NO flavor. And the porter cheddar was good but honestly still did not live up to expectations.  The menu had way more choices than a fine dining establishment could do well. And everything had so many flavors. It was over  ambitious and showed a chef who was not confident in their skills. But not wanting to judge before we actually ate we did order entrees. The serve plugged the special parmesan encrusted walleye to which I say eww fish and cheese do not good bedfellows make. My husband ordered the hangar steak. I ordered the prawns. The entrees arrived. They were obviously over cooked. My husbands steak was well done when it was ordered medium rare. My prawns were cooked to rubber. Not to mention they were still in possession of their poor charred little heads. I hate it when food looks at me. The sauce on the pasta was an unnatural yellow color, resembling finger paint. The sauce tasted of nothing but mustard which of course served only to overpower the delicate flavor of the prawns.  Our server seemed less than surprised that we wanted to leave. She brought the manager over who seemed to just be going through the motions of is there anything I can do. Can we make you something else even if for takeout. My candor won and I said we would like to leave there is no fixing this.   I will never return here. I hope they get a chef with a clue or I can tell they are doomed to fail. Don't go here spend your money at a place where food is respected and lovingly prepared. There are plenty of Cleveland culinary treasure who would be more than happy to take your business and serve you food worth the expense."}
{"text":"Georgetown has a great patio and happy hour specials starting on weekdays.   Last month, we surprising had a really warm day (crazy right, 80 degrees weather in May? That never happens!), and I met up with my cousin for dinner at Georgetown. We sat on the patio, ordered a couple drinks and shareable plates, including the pear and gorgonzola salad, short rib mini sliders, lobster pizza, and calamari. Of all the dishes we ordered, my favorite was the pear and gorgonzola salad. It was so fresh and light, we ate it so fast that we didn't even take a picture!   Typical food, but the patio is so relaxing. If you are ever in the Lakewood area and is looking for a place with a cute patio and happy hour specials, I recommend to check out Georgetown."}
{"text":"Very frustrating experience at Georgetown this weekend. Called earlier in the day to ask if they take reservations for the patio and was told \"no\" by Renee. Arrived at 6:40 to an empty patio but was told the wait would be an hour. Why? According to the host any reservation has the choice to choose between outside seating or a table inside..so they save tables outside. Sooo we should have just made a reservation and chose to sit outside? Sorry Georgetown- this seems like a backwards system & something you need to figure out."}
{"text":"my fiance had taken me here for a surprise  dinner ,we were excited to try it but unfortunately  it was awful. I ordered a shrimp and scalp dish and It tasted microwaved and like a lean cuisine.  it was 18 dollars and my fiance  got the filet  minon  it was awful it was raw in middle over cooked on one side and  and so ruff he couldn't chew it it was disgusting.  I will never go back for 100 dollars you expect the food to be decent but it was cheap quality"}
{"text":"Recently a friend and I went to happy hour at Georgetown to catch up and enjoy an evening away from our babies. We have always had a good experience at Georgetown... until a couple weeks ago. There was a large shard of glass in our mac and cheese. We immediately asked for the manager who seemed to careless. She had a smirk on her face and had no intention of making it right until we told her we didn't want our food. We are talking about glass in our food!  A genuine reaction and trying to right a wrong can go a long way! Very disappointing that Georgetown hires such employees. Obviously we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Gross! Used to be great but under new management we haven't had a good meal (why we keep going back is another story). Our last meal featured slimy risotto and overly salted fish."}
{"text":"I'm shocked by some of the poor reviews.  One disclaimer I'll make is that I went on a Tuesday evening at 7:30p so missed HH crowd on a traditional off-night for restaurants.  The result was prime seating with attentive service.  Perhaps busy nights with slower service are tainting reviewers opinions.   Now the food:  Our table shared the mushroom pizza though the lobster and pepperoni pizzas looked like great options as well.  Good size, full of toppings.    For dinner the three entrees ordered were the walleye, grouper, and halibut.  Each had different sides that were all very well done. One of them (I think it was the walleye) comes with mussels that were excellent.  Even the \"non-mussel eater\" at the table tried one and said she would eat mussels more if they were all prepared that way.    The night was topped off with a cocktail and live music next door at Vosh (separate review) which just makes the perfect combo.   I'm a native of Lakewood now living in NC but will make Georgetown a regular dinner stop on my travels home."}
{"text":"Wonderful view on the patio !  Are apps and drinks where great . Happy hour prices on Saturdays . Great service . Will be back"}
{"text":"This place was interesting and a bit of a struggle for me. We went for a friend's 30th birthday dinner. They accommodated our group of almost 20 in a private room which was absolutely adorable and allowed us to put up decorations. The ambiance was perfect for a classy 30th party. The server was very attentive and allowed us to get settled while offering us drinks. The table ordered quite a few appetizers, which came out quickly while we pondered our dinners. Our dinner orders came out quickly but inconsistently. Many of us ordered the same dishes but they all came out on different plates in different sizes, yet we were charged the same prices. My fiance and I ordered the same exact thing, yet my plate and portion was 1/2 the size but the same price! The serving staff tried to tell us that the different plate made my dish look smaller. Now I am sorry but I am not losing my sight, I can clearly see a difference in size... which I didn't even mind because it was a lot of food... but don't charge me the same price for both!    I felt for what we got they were a little overpriced. We had a little bit of sticker shock when got our bill, and felt the meal was not quite worth it."}
{"text":"Two out of three stars goes to the absolutely beautiful setting tonight sitting outside and enjoying the company of my son.  The decor and ambience is really one of the nicest anywhere in the. Cleveland area.  The other star is for my son's enjoyment of his meal; but keep in mind he's 17 and thinks kraft mac and cheese is the bomb.  The hostess was missing and later frazzled when we arrived.  It was not busy (under 50%) when we arrived around 6:45PM.  We did get a lovely table outside where we wanted to sit.  Our server was polite at first and quickly got our drink order delivered complimented by something disgusting at the bottom of my wine glass-a piece of pasta or something  leftover from the dishwasher.  It took a solid 10 minutes to remedy that after grabbing a food runner to get our server.  We had the meatloaf appetizer-very good.  My son had the bolognese and loved it.  Took home leftovers.  I had the blackened salmon special and it just was not good at all.  There was too much going on with the flavors and ingredients and it didn't work -blackened salmon and risotto with pumpkin and some sausage and heavy cheesy creamy consistency covered in a rich dark mushroom sauce that had a burnt Smokey taste with some other spice that I couldn't make out.  And it was overly salted.  Eventually I saw our server and politely told him that I didn't like the dish after a couple of bites and offered to explain to the manager.  Instead of getting the manager, he decided to argue with me about whether he had been attentive to our table or not (he wasn't) and that's when I knew I was not ordering a single thing more and would handle the matter with my gratuity.  And also with a solid yelp review.  Sorry Mark, you really blew it tonight.  I typically tip 30% on the full bill even if something gets comped; but I gave him 18% on the comped bill.  I have a great appreciation for restaurant servers as It's an incredibly difficult profession.  But I'm not sure I will go back to Georgetown for awhile because the attraction of outdoor dining is diminishing with the change of seasons and the food and service aren't enough to attract when there are so many other great places to go on the west side :/  honestly three stars might be too generous."}
{"text":"Formerly Three Birds, one of my favorite restaurants. The menu is much the same, though the ownership has changed. Haven't eaten here yet, but willing to give it the benefit of the doubt until I do. But people should know it's there, and give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've dined here several times in the past few months and the food is excellent.  Very creative presentations of entrees and salads with a very good wine list both by the bottle and glass.  Great patio for outdoor dining.  The chef changed about a year ago and if you haven't been here since, you really want to go back."}
{"text":"Let me just say, Georgetown gets an A+! happy hour menu and prices are amazing! Seriously. i loved the atmosphere too. even though we were unable to sit outside, (brrrr, hello cleveland fall weather), the patio is adorbs. the white little twinkle lights make this a great place to take a date or just hang out for a glass of wine. definitely will return next summer when the weather is more conducive to dining al fresco! the inside of the restaurant is warm and cozy. i am a huge fan of warm, inviting scenery and this is it. our server was great~ super accommodating and friendly!   the amuse me martini is a plus. loved it! $5.00 for a martini is a steal in my opinion!   i would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice night out. looking to dine on the less expensive side? hit them up for happy hour. i pinky promise you will not be disappointed! can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was recommend to come to this restaurant by a friend of mine. They talked up this restaurant very heavily and I believe is the reason why I felt it was underwhelming when I went here for dinner on a Friday night. I was expecting more from this place; from the food especially. It wasn't bad food or a bad experience, I was only expecting more."}
{"text":"We live close to Georgetown, and love the convince, however will not go back until the food quality gets better.  Saturday night we went to the happy hour and it was full. Our order came out so quickly that it had to have been sitting in a warming oven and thrown on the plate. I had salmon that was small, dry, and awful.   The bar staff seems overwhelmed and rushed. For the high end prices, you get a less than mediocre experience. I hope they get it together as We would like to enjoy the local independent establishments."}
{"text":"One of the best patios in Cleveland... but the service there is less than desirable. Was told there was a 5-10 minute wait for a table on the patio so my girlfriend and I went by the bar and got a drink while we waited...and waited and waited. Finally after 30 minutes I asked the hostess what the holdup was and she wasn't very helpful or friendly. So we waited some more, and after an hour of waiting at a table by the bar, we finally got up and just left. It's going to be hard to stay in business if they keep scaring all their customers away. Also, the glassware was dirty and the drinks had to be remade. Not a good experience at all"}
{"text":"We came here before a show. The atmosphere was very casual and chic. The outside dual level patio was beautiful.   The service was great. Our server came around when needed. She made a great selection from the wine list for us.  The food was yummy! We had the scallops and Mac & Cheese. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Their cocktails are great, their lobster pizza amazing. Overall one of the better restaurants in Lakewood. I enjoy going there on warm summer evenings and fraternizing with friends on their patio."}
{"text":"I've been to Georgetown for happy hour and for dinner on the weekend. I have to say I highly recommend coming here for happy hour because they have great deals on drinks and apps - including pizzas! I enjoyed their $5 glass of wine and the lobster pizza. It was really good! I wish I could give a higher rating but after coming here for dinner I left disappointed. The service is really good, it's just that the food wasn't that great. We had the lobster bisque which wasn't bad, but our entrees were so-so. I had the chicken wrapped prosciutto and the chicken was very greasy and tasted rubbery. They only served it with about 4 little baby potatoes. For $18 this is not worth it.   However, I do enjoy the ambiance and the happy hour deals. I loved the lobster and manchego cheese pizza which you can split with someone. Overall, a 3 star experience in my opinion."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, service was a bit slow, food was sub-par. Overall - it's not a happy hour I'll be visiting again any time soon... even if their patio is enticing."}
{"text":"Summary:  Never host an event or party here!  I have waited nearly a year to write this review, and this was on purpose, so that any \"heat-of-the-moment\" feelings would be gone and I could write a truthful review on my experience at Georgetown.  We got married in the fall of 2015, and we chose early in the year to have our wedding rehearsal dinner on their nice outdoor patio. We discussed the timing, details, amount of people, etc... with their manager and we explicitly asked if we would be sharing the outdoor patio with any other customers or parties. Their reply was a clear: no. We put our name in the for the time/date and checked that off our list.   Planning for the party on the patio: Over the summer they expanded their patio to nearly double the size. About 2 months prior to the wedding, we called them up to check in and confirm the final details of the party. They informed us that there would be another party sharing the patio with us, but they would allow us to choose between the two outdoor spaces (which had nothing dividing them, thus not blocking any of the noise from the two parties). After disagreeing with us about them telling us that we would the only party and the patio would not be shared, they offered us the indoor event room exclusively. With only two months till the wedding and literally every other decent venue booked in the city, we decided to not waste any more time and move our party to the indoor room.   Our biggest mistake here was to not get this in writing and at the end of the mistakes happen, so I wasn't going to let this get in our way with so many other things that we needed to spend our time on.   Night of the event: On the night of the rehearsal dinner, we arrived following our wedding rehearsal. The valet did a good job of getting our cars unloaded in such a tight space and we approached the restaurant from the side. The second we opened the door to the indoor event room (separate side entrance), the level of noise coming from the main bar/seating area was astounding. We immediately asked the manager what was going on and she told us that there was a high school reunion that had reserved the main restaurant and bar area, and that they would have a live band playing all night. NOT ONCE WERE WE INFORMED OF THIS IN THE MONTHS AND MONTHS OF PLANNING, PHONE CALLS AND VISITS TO/WITH GEORGETOWN. It's not like you can even call this a miscommunication, as we spoke with the same exact manager from the start to beginning of the process.   The main bar area for the restaurant was separated from the indoor event room by only a set of double doors, which the wait staff had to walk through anytime they needed anything and was also the only path to the restrooms. This was supposed to be a nice, trendy dinner location and the level of noise greatly exceeded that of a nightclub or rave. I am doing my best here to not come off sounding like irritated middle to older aged adult not used to louder music. I am in my mid-twenties and frequently attend live rock concerts and nightclubs every now and then.   I am going to re-iterate this one more time: NOT ONCE WERE WE INFORMED OF THIS IN THE MONTHS AND MONTHS OF PLANNING, PHONE CALLS AND VISITS TO/WITH GEORGETOWN. When we talked to the manager, she did not sound or act the slightest bit concerned with this oversight and acted as this was business as normal.   The noise pretty much ruined the entire night. This night was a once-in-a-lifetime event to spend on the eve before our wedding, and instead we spent thousands of dollars to barely hear ourselves speak to each other in our \"private room\". My wife and stood up to address the party and thank them for coming, but I vividly recall having to stop and start my speech each time the double doors opened for someone from the wait staff to walk in or out.   Food: They completely forgot to bring out the salad and bread course of the meal, and again, no apologies or remorse from the manager. I really didn't have much to complain about the food, and honestly don't recall anything tasting really good or bad. I was so frustrated with the night that the taste of the food was the last thing on my mind.  In summary, I would never suggest holding an event here. Is the food bad?  Probably not.  Do they have a cool patio? Sure, even though we were essentially forced to move to the indoor room. There are hundreds of great places to eat in Cleveland for even less of a price, that have just as good of a view.   I truly hope that the staff and manager read this review and adjust the way that they go about treating their customers and events."}
{"text":"I like the setting and service of Georgetown, I wish they could raise the level of the food. My first bite of walleye gave me a mouthful of bones and sliding my fork along the filet showed more. My complaint brought a response from the jackass that sautéed it \"of course fish have bones\"! Hopefully management will teach their line cooks to debone before cooking, a simple procedure every cook should know to keep patrons from ending up in a hospital."}
{"text":"TRUST THE OTHER REVIEWERS!  I should have! Against my better judgement I went to Georgetown for the happy hour at 9p. The food is the only thing on special after 9p, no drinks. They also have a crooner they pulled right from the old folks home to serenade you while you wish you would have made a better choice. The stuffed hot peppers are the only thing redeemable of one star. How can you screw up hummus or vegetable pizza? Flat, stale tasting, and the hummus was so small you couldn't even put your bread in into the tiny two tablespoon sized dish. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"5 stars for the Happy Hour specials, which are available until 7pm during the week, and all night long on Thursday's! Tons of specials on majority of their apps and salads, yum! $4 wines and great pours!  It also has amazing ambience. I love the patio, especially at night when it's all lit up. It's also fancy inside but still has a cool vibe.  No complaints for the food. I really liked the caesar and the lobster pizza was descent as well."}
{"text":"THE BEST! I love their happy hour so much.   $5 delicious martinis? YES THANK YOU!   $6 pizza? OK PLEASE I'LL HAVE TWO!  GO THERE GO THERE GO THERE! This is my favorite happy hour spot in all of Lakewood....YES! It is better than Pier W!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a lovely dinner in the patio. Megan our waitress paced the dinner as we requested. Nice wine selections. We look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Never had anything but excellence when ordering seafood.  Last visit with sister and niece two of us ordered the special strip steak and my medium rare had no pink.  It was good but not as ordered.  I will stick with seafood."}
{"text":"Oustanding service and fine dining.  Georgetown offers very well done modern American cuisine. All courses were cooked with care. The dessert was the tipping point to five stars.  I highly recommend the \"Baked Mocha,\" a flourless cake served warm with coffee ice cream covered in whipped cream.  My guest and I were also impressed to find live jazz music accompanying our meal.  Definitely worth trying if you have not already.  Georgetown has more than earned my respect and repeat business.  Well Done."}
{"text":"Holy Gastronomical Gaffe Batman!  This was perhaps one of the worst dining experiences I have had in recent memory.  We went to celebrate my wife's birthday and  left in anything but a celebratory mood.  Pretension... with foie gras...  on everything...  This menu screams out for some tender loving care.  The chef is obviously insecure with his/her ability to combine flavors into a cohesive whole, and consequently every dish has no less than three sides or sauces.  Meats were paired with not one, but two starches, dragging down an already heavy plate.  We started with cocktails; nothing on the cocktail menu appealed so I went with the old standby of Tanqueray and tonic (weak), and my wife ordered a \"dry and dirty\" Grey Goose martini.  Now I'm not sure about you, but my martinis (even vodka martinis) have vermouth in them.  This had no vermouth (what was the dry describing??) and about a tablespoon of olive juice.  Basically it was just vodka shaken over ice.  Not very appetizing.  Our server, wearing a tuxedo shirt that looked like it was tattered from being worn and washed every night for the last three years brought us a complementary shooter of the night's soup...  pureed asparagus and foie gras.  Ethical issues with froie gras aside, it's really not my favorite, so I let it be.  The wife took a small sip and set it aside as well ...bland.  The server after noting that we were not interested in the soup went on to recommend... the foie gras appetizer...  REALLY!?!  We said no thank you, and ordered the cheese plate instead.  When the cheese plate came, it featured un-seasoned pecans, slimy raisins, dried cherries and almonds, and three cheeses with crackers.  The cheese selections left just about everything to be desired.  A cheap, single cream brie with bleu cheese, a bland, tasteless \"buttery cheddar\" and perhaps the one palatable cheese, an Irish porter cheddar.  The crackers were stale.  At this point we were overhearing the people behind us commenting on how good their entrees were, and crossed our fingers that the chef was somehow going to pull this one off ...not so much.  I ordered the chipotle hangar steak, medium rare, and she ordered the spotted prawns and pasta.  The server suggested medium-rare as the house default, which is my preference anyway.  When the entrees arrived, the prawns were un-shelled, with head and legs remaining.  The sauce, though tasty was overpowering with mustard for such a delicate protein as prawns, and it had the unnatural color of a brand new yellow school bus.  The prawns were cooked beyond any sensible level, and the meat was rubbery, the consistency of bubble gum.  The hangar steak, ordered medium-rare, was killed twice.  Once when the cow was slaughtered, and again when they cooked this poor piece of meat to its second death.  The plating of the steak called for cutting it into 3/4\" slices, so the chef could have easily seen, during plating, that the meat had been overcooked.  Instead of starting again, and correcting the problem, they chose to send a flawed plate.  Unprofessional!  When we informed the server of our displeasure with the meal, and our desire to leave, she called the manager over.  Though I understand making an effort to salvage the experience, she just did not take the hint that the entree faux pas  was not our first issue with the meal, and kept asking over and over what she could do to \"fix it.\"  Eventually, she seemed to get that it was a lost cause, and walked away.  All-in-all an epicurean disaster.  I do not understand the rave reviews in other comments for this establishment.  A disastrous disappointment, take your business to one of the other fantastic restaurants where they respect the food that they are preparing rather than beating you over the head with foppish pretension."}
{"text":"After experiencing so many delicious and memorable dinners and happy hours at this location we decided to host our wedding rehearsal dinner at Georgetown. Regarding dinner and happy hour at this location, everything has always been very enjoyable. Does happy hour get better than this?!  Monday - Saturday : 4pm - 7pm  Thursday & Saturday : 4pm - 9pm   Their food and drinks are absolutely delicious, their atmosphere is very trendy and romantic.   Our rehearsal dinner was in the lower patio, which is open to the public during the summer when there's no event. The location was very romantic, trendy and inviting. Our guests enjoyed open bar and appetizers along with a very nice ambiance.  Our guests raved about how delicious the food was, each dish was very well seasoned and hot. The drinks were poured very well and the service was amazing.   This is a great location for happy hour after work, a nice dinner or for your next event!"}
{"text":"I am doing this based on happy hour.. Because I can't stop!! This is by far my favorite perfect weather/perfect food happy hour. Drinks are always on point, food is divine! I know it's a bit pricey but if you want to have a classy dinner and some drinks in the most beautiful garden- this is the spot!! My favorite is the pear/Gorgonzola salad- $5 for a very perfect salad. Generous with the pears and cheese and a great ratio with the dressing. I can't begin to tell the loves I have for the charcuterie board. During happy hour it's only $12 which is an awesome deal. Perfect amount of cheese, nuts, meats, cheeses, crackers. Um, delish!  This is not an every week place but more like the perfect place to enjoy the gorgeous garden and $5 happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow and a little...off, somehow, but the food was soo good. This was our first time in and we had one of the daily specials as well as the short rib entree. Just seriously melted in my mouth. Could have lived without the mushrooms in the sauce but they didn't detract from it being a really excellent dish. Had a pretty tasty lobster pizza as an app too. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here a few weeks ago. We share a few appetizers. I was really excited to see one of my favorite wines by the glass - Michael & David's Petit Petit Syrah. Love it!  We had macaroni and cheese, penne bolognese, a cheese plate, main lobster pizza, and lamb  shank risotto. All were very good. My favorite was the penne bolognese hands down.   Will be back"}
{"text":"They have a great date night Monday thru wednesday! $40.00 gets you 2 salads, 2 entrees, and a bottle of wine!!! I had the Bolonese an art had the mac and cheese! Amazing deal.   Only thing I wish was different was server knowledge. She had no idea about this special and no idea what came with it. Took a really long time to finally figure it out but she was very pleasant as a person so that helped! This could be an amazing special if people knew about it!"}
{"text":"We were just there for dinner.  The wrong entree was delivered twice.  Meanwhile, in the courtyard, a table's occupants were YELLING obscenities.  I asked the hostess if she could do something about this.  She said she could not as free speech was allowed (we were four tables away from the loud group, and I could not hear my husband talking to me due to the excess volume).  We left.  Such an elegant environment  was spoiled by poor management's inability to address one large unruly party.  Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night for a small group work-related dinner. I'll preface this review with the fact that the dinner was free for me, so, I'll just talk about the food.   I had been here before when it was 3 birds, but not since it changed.   I'm not sure what the real menu looks like as we ordered off of a small menu just for this event.   Started with a cheese board with some fancy crackers. Nice cheese choices. They also provided some flat-bread pizzas for an appetizer which were delightful.   For the salad course, I had a pear/Gorgonzola salad. Again, the cheese was delicious. the salad dressed well.   For the main course - salmon served on a bed of rice and bok choy with other vegetables with a wasabi sauce. Salmon was cooked perfectly. Bok choy and rice were also cooked well and seasoned well. The wasabi sauce was a nice compliment to the meal.   Dessert was the creme brulee - lovely sugar crust with a very vanilla custard. Very tasty.   Since I went for a private party, we didn't have any issues with service and the food was very good. However, I can't comment on value or price since I did not pay for this meal.    Overall this was a nice meal, and I think I would go back and try it again in a \"regular\" dinnertime setting."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I did the 2 for $40 deal, where you get two salads, two entrees and a bottle of wine for 40 bucks.  The food was decent, not sure it was worth the regular prices though.  The service was also a bit slow. We did sit on the patio which is beautiful! Overall a nice place."}
{"text":"The low rating is for the service not the food!  We arrived for a 6:30 pm reservation and didn't get seated until 7:30 pm and it was not in the private room that had been reserved. I had the boneless friend checked on mashed potatoes and it was fabulous but had to continually wait for refills on my water."}
