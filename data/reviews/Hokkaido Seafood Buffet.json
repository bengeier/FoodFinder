{"text":"Food was overall decent. Lots of selection. Seemed to be fresh. $18.59 per adult and BEWARE: they charge for drinks AND each refill separately including the hot tea!! I've never seen anyone do that until now. I'm not sure we will be back..."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I didn't expect much, but I am happy that we went! They had a lot of different choices and the food was pretty good. It isn't gourmet food, but it is good!"}
{"text":"The food is acceptable for the price (about $22 for dinner with crab legs). But the quality of the service can't be worse!!!

I've never seen anyone so rude to push their customers out. We began our meal at 3:00pm. After 2 hours, a waitress came to us with checking list and forced us to leave. What is unbelievable is that she then explained to us: we are keeping other customers away because of our 2-hour seating and they don't have enough seats. WHAT THE HELL OF THIS HELL!!! We paid $25 in total  (including tips and taxes) but we don't have the right to stay more than 2 hours?? Her way of talking was extremely insulting with an irritating long face. Ironically, we glanced at the lobby when left, there were apparently at least more than half empty seats, ha, a collapse of itself. 

This is not the end of the story. Today is new year's eve and we do not want a quarrel, so we just argued about several words while the roll of her eyes toward us would be definitely unforgettable. We were totally un-esteemed! We sincerely hope that Hokkaido can train their staff from the very basic in this coming new year. With ignoring customer service, even monopoly in this district can't help a lot."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place for a seafood buffet . We came here with my family of 4 with my sis in law . Everyone really enjoyed . Amazing spread of crab legs , shrimp , Shishi , salami and great desserts . Loved it and will come again"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a textbook example of a solid Asian buffet. The sushi is fine, with some entry level staples and a few types you won't find pre-made on a Giant Eagle shelf. The deserts are okay, but nothing to write home about. Overall, this is as good a place as any for solid, no frills seafood. However, we're I to live farther away, I don't think I'd make a special trip.

Try the Thai style calamari. It's good, if they don't over cook it."}
{"text":"Food is basic Chinese buffet food prices are moderate.
After eating their for my son graduation dinner (His choice) my husband and I treated everyone and paid the bill. One of our party guest decided to leave the tip granted she only tipped her a small amount(I never leave tips under 18%) the waitress had the indecency to complain about the tip and actually asked for more money. 
Tip for buffet style restaurants if you want great tips be thorough in providing basics like refils on drinks...checking in on your tables...clear plates from your tables...you know basic customer service skills...skills and qualities this place does not have."}
{"text":"We've been to Hokkaido a few times now, each time leaving full and happy with our meal. There's a decent variety of the traditional Chinese-restaurant fare, which isn't anything ridiculously impressive but probably above-average by buffet standards.

They do have a grilling station where you can choose various meats and other ingredients, and have it cooked for you. I didn't partake, so can't comment on the quality of this offering. They offered a pretty decent variety of what I'd consider decent sushi by buffet standards that seems to rotate pretty frequently, and includes things from super tame (California rolls) to the fishier offerings (tuna, eel, etc). There's also a selection of things that could appeal to kids that got dragged along and don't enjoy Asian food, such as pizza, chicken wings, and other traditional fare.

It'd be unfair to leave out their dessert section, which includes all kinds of fruit with a chocolate fountain, ice cream, various puddings, fruit salads... the offerings do seem to change between visits, which keeps things new.

Lunch is a bit cheaper (it's what we've usually gone for), but dinner includes crab legs on the buffet for your extra money. Overall, this is a pretty solid buffet that I'd recommend and will certainly return to in the future, but wouldn't go too far out of my way for."}
{"text":"I like it! My boss constantly talked this place up since he loves sushi, and it is well worth the trip. The prices are ridiculously low for what you get. We spent $20 for both of us for lunch! The sushi selection is great with some interesting and tasty creations. The stir fry station was my favorite! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I use to really love this place now the service and food has really went down hill also got the premium crab leg dinner sign put up on me and a friend last night for dinner don't think I will be going back felt real sick after that dinner"}
{"text":"yum yum yum! I went for the sunday buffet and was pleasantly surprised! It's located right near a liquor store and a soon-to-be Ihop so wasn't expecting much. I was impressed by the clean interior and then the wide selection of food. It might not be as wide a selection as sushi buffets in new york but it was plenty for me and after 3+ plates I still wasn't able to try everything I wanted to! The food was all fresh and delicious and at such reasonable prices. 

I left with a full belly and a huge grin on my face."}
{"text":"All I can say Is $19 well spend, given I eat out a lot for work I do not give out 5 stars to often... but I am for this place...

The food selection was amazing and I am very selective in what I eat, everything so fresh.. and to top it all of they have coffee and pistachio ice cream.  Certainly jealous of the local people here who can enjoy this place on a regular basis... who knows when work will bring me back here :(

By far the best buffet I have eaten in a long, long time."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Asian buffet where you can get all-you-can-eat sushi, crab legs (dinner only), etc.  We come here frequently for the crab legs but they've got everything ranging from sashimi to singapore noodles, several kinds of soup (won ton, miso, etc.), some dim sum (shumai, egg buns, pork buns, sesame balls), and a stir fry station where they'll make it to order for you.  There's even pizza and such for the folks who aren't the biggest fans of Asian food.

None of the food is super spectacular but considering the price and what you can get for it, this is a pretty good deal.

Just be careful to not take more than you can eat.  Never have had this happen to us, but they charge $8 more if you have left food on the plate.  There are signs placed at each table warning you about this policy."}
{"text":"Biggest selection of food I've seen in awhile.  All the seafood was really good. The Chinese dishes could have used some improvements. But all in all could not be the selection."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Asian  buffets in the area! When it comes to food quality and taste, I doubt there is any Asian buffet in the area that can beat it. Only problem I have with this buffet might be the price. The dinner cost($19) is a bit costly but then you can't find another Asian buffet with that kind of quality and great taste of food."}
{"text":"Seeing the reviews, I expected decent food. Cold, chewy, overcooked, old; the food couldn't have been worse. Fried rice, which should be easy, was hard and slathered in oil. If you decide to go here, go straight for the cooking station and have them make it fresh. Otherwise, they charge 8 dollars for leaving their inedible food on the plate. My meal was twenty dollars per person. Certainly an amount that one could spent elsewhere for a much, much better experience."}
{"text":"It was a good experiance, I liked the variance of food, chicken, beef, sushi and almost crap dishes were delicious. 
I brought my brothers in this restaurant and they loved it which was surprised me. 
It has beautiful view inside and it is perfect to bring visitors with an appropriate price."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and honestly it's been a 50/50call couple times it was very good and a couple times it has been very mediocre.  Nvr has crab been out at times specified"}
{"text":"nice place, went back two days in a row when i was in pitts.  amazed to find such japanese buffet places inland.  really enjoyed their seafood and selections.  so much food that it fills you up when you first walk in.  their sushi was good and i like it.  if i ever goto pitts again, i'd pay a visit again."}
{"text":"Awesome seafood buffet.  In town for a hockey tournament , nephew is as huge seafood fan.  Food was fresh and plentiful.  Went at night so lots of people in restaurant, food was constantly being replaced.  Try the White Wood Ear Soup, never had it before, always have to try new things."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been awaiting the arrival of Hokkaido for sometime now. When it finally opened we were more than excited. We went to Hokkaido last night and enjoyed ourselves. For just $16 a person it was all the crab legs, shrimp, mussels, crawfish, and everything else you could possibly want. I was very satisfied and stuffed. I plan to go back very soon. The food is worth every penny. I say go and have a good time but let me say remember to keep your silverware because they will take it and wont bring more back. You could always ask  but its hard to get their attention. Despite that I say go and stuff your face."}
{"text":"This is the best all you can eat (ayce) sushi buffer in Pittsburgh.  Great crab legs and steak, too.  With a nice clean environment."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you have a big appetite and want to try a lot of different good sea food, sushi, and asian food.  There's so much to try!  
My three main highlights are 1. Crab legs, 2. Sushi, and 3. Chocolate fountain.  

Dinner is $18 and Lunch is $10.  Visit during typical lunch and dinner hours (so you know the food has just been put out).  It's usually busy during these hours, though the restaurant is quite large so you can usually still be seated.  

ASIAN DELICACIES
Lots of food you'd find at a typical asian buffet such as fried rice, chinese seafood.  
The have some sepcial food such as frog legs, squid, scallops, mussels, and raw oyster.  
The CRAB LEGS, probably the most expensive item there, were immensely popular and had a line of several people the entire night.  I think some people just go here for the crab legs.

SUSHI:
This is one of the highlights, as the sushi is quite good.  It's hand-rolled and there were two dedicated cooks there rolling sushi the entire time.  
There's lots of variety including california rolls, philadelphia rolls, rainbow rolls, and different sashimi.  

SALAD and FRUIT BAR:
Most of what you'd expect at a typical salad and fruit bar.

SOUP:
Wide variety of soup to choose from including sweet and sour, wonton, clam chowder, etc...

MONGOLIAN BBQ STATION:
I have to say this is a nice touch.  You have several things to pick from such as vegetables, pineapple, noodles, SHARK, and sauces, and the some guy will throw it on a teppanyaki grill for you.  

DESSERT area:
They have a gigantic CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN, which you can dip marshmallows. rice crispy treats, peanut brittle, banana into.  This is definitely the highlight of the dessert area.  They also have ice cream, fruit, pudding, and some other pies here."}
{"text":"There is not enough sushi selection. The waitresses all seem antsy about getting the customers to leave soon. We once had a waitresses asked if we could leave because there was a line of people waiting outside. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"I went here because my friends repeatedly suggested this place every time we'd have meals together. I'm never a fan of buffet, but decided to give it a try so I've something to say when somebody asks me to go there. And here's what I'd say: not going there again unless I really have to and don't have to pay for it. 

Go on weekdays, unless you want to pay more than $15/person for an-OK buffet. The space is big, so it's suitable for a group dining. Parking is available for free. The food? Nothing stood out... The food wasn't horrible, but they weren't things that I couldn't find elsewhere or to die for.A lot standard Chinese food, the taste was bland. Didn't try the sushi at all because they didn't look fresh. 

Was it worth the money we paid? I guess... simply coz I was pretty hungry and a buffet was a decent treat."}
{"text":"There's a point in your life, when you think \"Man, I'm old.\"  It usually happens a few years after you say, \"I am not going to stand in a line, outside in the cold, just to go drink somewhere trendy.\"  Or, as it was for me, the day I finally DVR'd 60 Minutes.

I was even tempted to give Hokkaido 5 stars, because it was just a really nice dining experience with our friends and their kids.  There is easy parking.  It's loud and kid-friendly.  I'm not even sure if the table next to us noticed our wailing baby.  And the service was pretty attentive, even though it was buffet style.  The staff was excellent about taking our plates and asking for refills, and friendly to boot.  Oh yeah, and it's BYOB - there is a beer place up the road, but it only sells it by the case.

The food itself isn't amazing.  There is a very good variety, likely to appease your Asian cravings.  There are some quite authentic Chinese dishes, too, you typically find at Dim Sum.  There are chicken legs, sticky rice with red bean, seaweed salad,steamed pork buns, and others.  You always have to assume the presence of other Asians in the restaurant has to confer some legitimacy to the food.  In reality, though, the food was mostly okay.

Like I said in the beginning, though, as you get older, your priorities change.   Also, for two adults to eat for less than $40 total is pretty cost-effective.  They didn't charge our toddlers, unlike some other places (*ahem* Grand Concourse *ahem* for nearly $20 *ahem* to eat fries and cookies).  I can see this place being a go-to get together spot with other friends with kids

Would I have preferred to eaten at Eleven or Meat & Potatoes, or NOLA?  YES!  Is that realistic with a party of four adults, two 2-year olds, and two 3-4 month olds?  NO!  And so as parents, we have to place convenience, expedience, and a if-my-kid-throws-a-tantrum-will-anyone-care atmosphere, above the tastiness of food.

Sometimes."}
{"text":"Great value for the money. Food is refreshed frequently and there's a huge variety. Shrimp is cooked correctly, peeled and deveined for convenience. The beverage is a separate charge 2.00 and that's a standard profit center for any restaurant. They occasionally offer 10% off coupon but really it's a bargain given the overall quality.  Sushi is fresh and tasty. Basically something for everyone. Crab legs for dinner bumps the price a few bucks - too salty for my taste and I don't bother. Don't waste food! There is an $8.00 surcharge & is clearly explained on a table sign."}
{"text":"We went here today for a Family Birthday Party. The food was just ok, but the service was horrible, the servers were very rude and did not give good service at all. I had to ask multiple times for a drink refill and finally after the 4th time they refilled my drink. During the meal they harassed us multiple times about how many people were going on our check. I told the server how many people were on my check and she wrote it down, but still came back 4 times to ask how many people were on my check. When She brought the check I was still at the table eating she handed me the check and stood over me demanding that I pay now. They had added a 10% tip to the check, and so when I signed it without adding anything more she asked me if that was it. 
I have been to this restaurant twice and both times we were treated rudely, and harassed to pay the check before we were even finished. I will never return to this place again."}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service. Cheating in price (they raised $1 per person at check out and  forced customers to pay). Will never come again."}
{"text":"Consistently has great service. Dishes are cleared as soon as you finish a plate. Waitresses are super friendly. Crab legs are constantly being refreshed and sushi is great. They even had pizza for the kids."}
{"text":"Somewhere around a 2.5 overall experience. This is a pricey buffet costing about $20 per person, not including tip, but is still significantly better than many of the 0-1 star $7-$10 buffets I've tried throughout Pittsburgh. 

I went to Hokkaido on Saturday afternoon with five other friends. We were seated quickly and given water after our drink orders were taken. The food here is subpar at best and the tiny bit of service expected at a buffet (such as refilling drinks) is almost nonexistent. We had to flag down several different employees in order to have our drinks refilled throughout the course of dinner. The only thing that I truly enjoyed was the hibachi-style service bar at the back of the buffet where you could pick the ingredients that you wanted the attendant to prepare, it tasted yummy and the white sauce was very good. The buffet was set up like a high school cafeteria and nothing looked too appetizing. The sushi tasted like supermarket sushi and the frog legs were okay. Avoid the shark (because it's old) and stock up on edible seafood, like the crab legs, if you want to try and get your money's worth of food (which I was unable to do). 

The dessert bar was bland. The flan and \"puddings\" (one was just mashed Oreos covered in whipped cream and the other was dried out bananas covered in a very thin layer of vanilla pudding and wafers) were gross and mushy. Even the chocolate fountain that I was looking forward to wasn't very good. I ended up sticking to the plain marshmallows which were in the section labeled \"For Chocolate Fountain Dipping Only.\" I did like their selection of sorbets and ice creams.

Once 3 members in our group had stop eating a server promptly put down our check, hand wipes, and fortune cookies without bothering to ask if we were finished eating. We paid the bill, but continued eating for another 30 minutes until we noticed that the staff seemed to be impatiently watching us as if asking us to leave (and it wasn't because they were closing either). We quickly finished our small desserts, read our fortunes, and left. I understand wanting to maximize table turnover rates, but a business should never make its customers feel uneasy and rushed.

The relatively high price, mediocre food, and below average service made me feel very MEH about this buffet. I am in no rush to go back and wouldn't recommend it to any friends. I guess I'll just have to accept the fact that Pittsburgh just doesn't have any good buffets..."}
{"text":"Really great food! Yeah it says seafood buffet, and there is a lot of seafood, but there's a lot of other stuff too. Sushi, pizza, steak, a lot of Chinese and Japanese noodle dishes. Sauteed mushrooms, chicken, pork. There's a great, and so fresh salad bar. Everything is hot and tastes so good. Piles of crab legs. There's also a habachi grill in the buffet line, with a cook who prepares to order. I even got to try frog legs for the first time! There's so much good food there!

The seafood stuffed mushrooms were the absolute best! 

The service was great too. The wait staff kept our table clear of plates, and messes, and our glasses were refilled before they were empty. I'll definitely be back here, it was absolutely delicious, with excellent service."}
{"text":"If this restaurant weren't a buffet, it would not be in business. I went early on a Saturday evening with a friend. The restaurant was busy, a bit noisy, with aromas of grilled meat wafting through the air.

The sushi selection was limited but of decent quality (don't ask me about the raw fish). There are about 8 different rolls to choose from. In addition, seafood and crab are popular (not so tasty). There are some items for those with adventurous palates--whole baby octopus, squid, raw shellfish. The desert buffet was disappointing with few and low quality items in its offering. There are lots of cheap carbs too--rice, noodles. 4 different types of soup are also part of the buffet. On Saturday evenings, the buffet is $19.25 including tax.

This was a good experience that everyone in Pittsburgh should try once, although I am not sure I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Hokkaido is a decent buffet if you go on a fairly busy night (which is the best time to go to any buffet). There's a wide variety of Asian and American foods, although somewhat surprisingly (given the name) it's rather weak in the Japanese/Sushi selection. 
One thing that bothers me a bit about Hokkaido is the atmosphere. It's a slightly creepy vibe like a 1960's school cafeteria. And a few items I've had there on occasion were just not very good, for instance hot crabs on the buffet that reeked of ammonia when cracked open. But that's the exception, fortunately, not the rule. There are always plenty of good things to eat, although not many wonderful things to eat.
In my opinion, Hokkaido ranks as #3 in Pittsburgh Asian buffets, below Tokyo in the North Hills and Misaki on Rt 51. OK for lunch or dinner, and the price is fair, but I wouldn't take a date or out of town visitors there."}
{"text":"Was horrible. On their website it says they have crab legs but fails to say only during dinner time. Went in during lunch and had a small plate with a few pieces of coconut shrimp which was ok, a few \"salt & pepper shrimp\" and the regular little crab. The salt & pepper shrimp was dry the seasoning was alright but the shrimp was dry like a rubber band. The crab was dry as well, so dry that it stuck to the shell and you could get it off. 
Spoke to the manager whom said \"you didn't eat much\" clearly he was watching me. I told him no as the food was not good. He told me I should go back and find something as he would not refund me my small plate, it's not like I ate half the buffet and didn't like it. He even suggested that I ate my $10 worth of fruit, he was just simply rude and I would not go back nor would I recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Hokkaido is the best Asian buffet I've ever been to! The selection is absolutely huge, wrapping around half of the restaurant, with about a million options. Their sushi is delicious, and made fresh. There's always a good selection of different rolls and sashimi. They have a grill where you can pick your own meat/veggie selections and have it cooked up fresh for you. It's a great place to go for lunch, before or after shopping or seeing a movie at the Waterfront. Lunch is a few dollars cheaper than dinner, and it's a bit less busy. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive to your beverage needs."}
{"text":"$18 bucks w/ tax for all you can eat sushi/bbq/whatever.

My favorites - sake sushi, orange chicken, lo mein, and the fried sesame rice balls.

For all-you-can eat, it has a good price and food that actually tastes decent.  That's tough to beat."}
{"text":"I had avoided Hokkaido since it opened for two main reasons -- 1) their logo makes it looks like a laundromat, and I don't like the idea of eating seafood at a laundromat; 2) I have a a general distrust of seafood this far inland, especially in 'all you can eat' quantities, and most especially at a laundromat.

My boyfriend and I wanted to get sushi tonight, though, so turned to Yelp for ideas of where to do this.  Hokkaido scored high in the results, making this officially the first time Yelp has let me down.  And it not only just let me down, but also helped lead me to a general feeling tonight of wanting to give up on life after a meal there.

We started with the sushi.  I'm certainly not a sushi aficionado, but even I know that sushi is not supposed to be so... chewy.  I don't even really know what more to say about it. I tried a stuffed clam and stuffed shrimp as well, and with both, the stuffing was pretty tasteless and just came off in a clump, leaving me with sad looking pieces of fish, that were, once again, really really chewy. 

I'd been pretty excited about the crab legs, as I'm not terribly picky about those, so it's hard to let me down there.  Ultimately, they were fine... somewhat run-of-the-mill, but at least similar in quality to any you can find at the finest Chinese buffets our Northern suburbs have to offer.  (In fact, that's the only reason I gave this place 2 stars, which to me is really more like 1, since you apparently can't give NO stars.)

Everything started really going downhill after this, though.  When I'd gone to the crab area for my crab legs, I'd tried to even avoid looking at the plate of 'whole' crabs next to them... the meal hadn't been *horrible* thus far, just pretty bland (and chewy), but I was still mindful of the fact though that my general queasiness about this experience could tip over into full-blown nausea at any moment.  After a single glance at these 'whole' crabs told me something was definitely not right there, I just decided to pretend I'd never noticed them.  This plan was foiled, though, when my boyfriend, who apparently has no idea what a crab is or is not supposed to look like, brought one back to the table.  I really had no choice at that point but to look at it a bit more closely.  We ultimately concluded that there was no way this crab came from anywhere farther away than the Mon.  Had the sign above the dish indicated what species of crab this was, I might have had less difficulty with the whole thing, but to simply say that THIS thing was 'crab' made it even grosser.  It was brownish in color and had hugely disproportionate, misshapen claws that could only have resulted from exposure to some type of radiation.   The meat (which, I imagine it's needless to say by now, I didn't consume) was crumbly and dry.  I swear I could smell smoke from the mills released from its shell when he cracked it open.  I don't think I can attach a link here, but if you do a google image search of 'genetically modified spider,' or even just simply 'Love Canal,' you can probably get a better idea of what this thing looked like.

If it's not clear, I think I would go so far as to say that I was actually personally offended by this place.  I struck up a conversation with a seemingly very nice, normal-looking (remarkably so, in this place) woman in front of me at the dessert table, and she mentioned that she likes taking her son here when he comes into town for a 'nice meal.'  I wanted to cry and give her a hug.  By the way, the desserts were also extremely chewy.  And the watermelon was sour.  

On our way out, we saw a sign that indicated you can have your wedding reception there.  So, in conclusion, if you are planning a wedding reception, and want that wedding reception to be the most depressing affair any of your guests have ever attended, and you want your wedding favor to be sending your loved ones home with the runs for the next three days, then I strongly recommend Hokkaido.  Since Yelp doesn't offer a rating for that, though, I'm going to go ahead and highly recommend avoiding this place.  You deserve better, and you're more likely to get it catching something 'fresh' down the hill off the Duck Hollow pier."}
{"text":"This is NOT a sushi buffet.  Yes they had sushi available but if you consider yourself a sushi fanatic you will be let down.  It was very average selection and nothing special from the sushi section.

That being said, the chinese food they had was very good.  Speaking as someone who has been to China a few times, their food is quite authentic in its flavor.  This may put some people off but I loved it.

And the location was great.  I say go but only if you have low expectations for sushi and like good real chinese food."}
{"text":"It is about the quantity. Hello! You are at a buffet!!!
The sushi surpassed my expectations. We had the sushi as appetizers before moving on to the bounty of \"Asian Delicacies\". They were delicacies! There were clams, oysters, crab legs, fried crabs, frog legs (which my friend refused to try), chicken feet (I say you try them if you haven't), woodear among many others. There were a few different kinds of dumplings! Only I was too full by the time I discovered them to have the space to try one. 
Although I might prefer Tokyo sushi buffet on McKnight over this, Hokkaido wins with its desserts. They have things like coconut rice and different (but not bad) tasting cheesecakes. 
Oh my fave thing about Hokkaido? The fact that they charge you $8 if you waste food. Brilliant!! It is depressing to see wasted food and Hokkaido is doing the right thing here!"}
{"text":"I understand the appeal, but I can't in my right mind give this buffet more than three stars.  The food just isn't that great.  I mean the selection is ridiculous and the place is large enough, so when it's busy you don't really notice, but it's just mass produced chinese and japanese food.  I'd rather just pick chinese or japanese and go to a restaurant with better food at their buffet"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food and service. I had previously been there and loved it, however, that was years ago. When I told the cashier I was disappointed, I received no response. This used to be so enjoyable and delightful."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past with less than satisfactory visits, however my last visit was exceptional for a sushi buffet. 

The nigiri were made especially small along with the rolls such that a person could try different variety without filling up- this I appreciated greatly. 

The rolls were not of the largest variety, however they all were fresh. For example, the shrimp tempura roll still had a crunchy inside

Hot foods were warm, everything overall was frequently replenished. I can see why many people enjoy this place, for $19 a dinner, you can get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great selection, many more hits than misses. I come here about once a year and it's dependable. The buffet has an unusual layout, cafeteria style, but it's surprisingly large, usually well stocked, and surprisingly convenient. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second times to go to this restaurant with my family. The bottom line is that I love this buffets because we can select plenty of foods ranging from young favorites stuffs to children's favorite. Actually, my son is picky about food, but I can find sometihing for him. If I had to say something bad aspects, sometime(rare) there are a little bit stale foods. Or there are diffrent tasty thinngs compared to last time; it means that this time, it was tasty worse than before (I don't know why). 
Overall, we all enjoyed this buffets."}
{"text":"There's waitress name Min. every time I take the baby to the restaurant to eat,every time she always love to hold my baby,but her hand is dirty, I looked very sick.and every time I want to knot when she always stood next to me staring at me afraid I rarely give her tips,so I am very uncomfortable,and her service is not good,if I give her little less, she always curse my back,let me feel of the very angry,from now on I never go to this restaurant to eat."}
{"text":"This place is utterly disappointing.   

The sushi was not fresh, an important aspect especially considering raw foods. The cooked foods was lacking in taste, either too salty or ambiguous tasting. The steak was too rough, low quality meat. The salmon was overcooked and too cheesy. The dim sum was a waste of space. 

The clams were fair and were okay. The ice cream was standard. 

In comparison, Tokyo Sushi Buffet is much better.  If you're talking about Variety, I believe Tokyo has a much BETTER tasting and better variety."}
{"text":"Very expensive for bad quality food. The food is not fresh and have a bad smell. I dont know where they get their sea food but it is old and rubbery. Beside the waitresses are rude and impolite. I will never eat there again and i dont recommend anyone to go there. You wana get sick go and try."}
{"text":"Excellent! Yuki and Elain are the greatest! My 2 year old son loves coming here and they always come to say hello. Very child frendly. the food is always fresh and the sushi is wonderful."}
{"text":"Everything on the buffet was disgusting... ALL OF IT - go elsewhere and get quality food. Only good part was the fruit"}
{"text":"Good feed.
Wide collection of sea food, sushi, oriental food, soups and dessert. Can be cheaper than a beef sandwich with coffee if you go on week day lunchtime."}
{"text":"I've been to Hokkaido now 3 times.  I had heard about a sushi buffet that was $8 for lunch...a fantastic deal.  I tried it out...and wow! The sushi is great, they even have very good quality SASHIMI (!!!)...for dinner they have crab legs as well!  Plus cocktail shrimp and a plethora of other interesting seafood items.  Then there is the regular full array of Chinese food, soups, salads, Korean BBQ, and hard ice cream...everything is all you can eat!  Everything is very good quality and tasty.  My new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh!!

Prices are reasonable, but drinks are not included, so tack on an extra $1.79 if you want a Coke (yes, Coke, not Pepsi!)."}
{"text":"Typical China buffet (not Japanese as they said) big selection but the quality is so so. Only 2 things that were good when i was there: salmon sashimi and fresh honey dew."}
{"text":"Went for the Lunch Buffet

Sushi- better than Getgo but dont expect UMI, Penn Avenue, or Chaya quality, but hey its all you can eat, so ill take it.  

Appetizers-  The cheese and clam wasnt successful nor was the stuffed crab.   The salad was fresh and crispy but not a lot of variety to put on the salad.   The wonton section was fun with items such as cheese wonton, pork buns, and a variety of dumplings.  All of these were good plus there is plenty of dipping sauces which I always run out of at other chinese establishments.   I did not try the quesadillas, meat pockets, pizza or Soup.  There were 6 different types of soup ranging from wonton to Clam Chowder???

Main dish-  They had many traditional chinese items but, i particularly liked the bbq chicken.  I also went for the Mongolian BBQ.   This was cool and really was worth the price of admission.   I loaded up on the shrimp and steak which at any japanese steak house would be about $25.   The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the steak was done to my liking as well.  Again, all you can eat!  

Side dishes-  Big fan of the singapore noodles

desserts: fresh fruit like kiwi and oranges, cheesecake, tapioca pudding, rice pudding and ice cream.

The place always seems crowded and for a buffet thats what i like to see because  that means high turnover of food!

I have not tried the dinner selection but am looking forward to giving that a shot once my stomach recoils back to its natural state.

For $9 its tough to beat, but would love to see some Thai food put on the buffet somewhere, just some simple curries would be sweet!"}
{"text":"This place  gets better and better. I found out through a friend that their takeout is the bomb-diggity. Its $9.62 after tax and you get an extra-sized takeout carton to stuff full of whatever you like. You also get a separate container that will hold probably 16oz of soup. You can also fill this to the brim with whatever tasty morsel that fits your fancy. All together, I wager you can get a good 3 lb of food crammed into that box for $9.62.

I got mostly pupus and some noodles. But you could easily squeeze ALOT of sushi into this box. At least 30 pieces. Giant Eagle will charge you like 10 bucks for about 10 pieces or so. I think Hokkaido's sushi is better than Giant Eagle's. Plus they have a greater selection.

I love this place."}
{"text":"Some of the items at Hokkaido were decent, but I wasn't satisfied with most of the food. I don't know about Pittsburgh, but there are better Chinese buffets elsewhere.

First of all, the designation of \"Seafood Buffet\" is a bit misleading. Sure, they have an extensive sushi/sashimi section, but other than that everything else is the same as other buffets. Also, while acceptable, the quality of the sushi isn't good. Everything has that watery, pre-frozen taste. The sushi's texture and smell is fine though, and everything gets replaced pretty frequently.

The hot section of the buffet is a mixed bag. The highlights of the meal were the crab legs, baby clams, and salt and peppper crab. The crab legs were meaty, and buttery sweet. The baby clams were tender and served in a savory black bean sauce. The salt and pepper crab was salty, crispy, and sweet. The hibachi station and some of the fried appetizers are satisfying.

However, every other dish at Hokkaido is below average or average. Nothing is offensive (besides the large clams, I ate one and spit it out), but nothing else is of a decent quality. Yes, this is a buffet, but having 5 dishes worth eating out of the 50+ available isn't what I consider buffet success. I ate my weight in crab and clams, but I go to buffets for variety. I probably won't be returning for a while with that in mind."}
{"text":"I like buffets, and this one has a lot of good variety. They're relatively busy during prime rush hours, so food is pretty fresh all the time (except for the non-Chinese stuff like chicken tenders, pizza, cheese stuffed whatevers but I don't go here for that). Lots of dishes, both classic Chinese-American favorites and more inventive ones (sprite steak!) that get changed up every time I go (rareish occasionally), mongolian bbq made to order station, fruit/ice cream desserts, and the newly added chocolate fountain (though I'm not sure how well-monitored the sanitation is for that...). And I particularly like that they have like 6 soups, so not just your generic hot and soup and egg drop. 

Seafood buffet's in their name - pretty good cooked seafood. Crab legs are there. Some sort of clam dish. Raw bar with oysters and mussels, some seaweed salads. Seafood featuring soups. All pretty good.
But their sushi is terrible. Their fish is really grainy, horrible texture and flavor. I mean, nothing sketch smelling or anything, but just bad quality fish. The rolls are okay mainly because the fish isn't as prominent. I know it's a buffet and not an expensive sushi place, but for the up charge in price versus a normal Chinese buffet, I would expect at least decent fish. 

Service is pretty good here in terms of plates not piling up at the table, water being filled. Even with the bad sushi, this is my family's go-to buffet, but they're not big on sushi and I have enough of that where I live."}
{"text":"For the Pittsburgh area, I think this is the best sushi buffet in town. I love that there's a LOT of seating options. Great for big groups! During the week, dinner is around $19. There's a pretty large sushi roll selection as well as your typical buffet dinner options, ie chinese food options, Hibachi corner, and dessert station. 

The ice cream doesn't seem old like some buffets in town. The servers are really good at clearing your table so that you can make space for more plates!! Parking is never a problem for dinner since most businesses next door are closing. 

The hibachi area is fairly quick and they are good to ask if I want a soy sauce base or teriyaki base. 

It's a little loud at dinner time, since there's a lot going on, but I love that I can take my 17 mo. daughter here and she can scream without having people stare at us. :)"}
{"text":"This place has got to be rated 5 stars!! Fresh food, endless options, and mouth watering delites with every step. The price is very reasonable and the food is more than excellent. I've been here twice and I live out of town and would recommend this to all my friends and family. Great job! Best buffet ever.. endless crab legs...."}
{"text":"Decent food choices and an adequate sushi buffet. They consistently turn out good selections. They have all the usual soup, salad, stir-fry and cooked dishes. They also have a large appetizer selection and some desserts. The variety is above average and nice for a family with different tastes--there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Great selection for the price, very clean and love the sushi! Go for lunch, only 10 bucks a head and still have maki and nigiri offerings."}
{"text":"I think what I like most is the variety.  All sorts of seafood, Chinese dishes, sushi, veggies and even some American food.  Nothing was spectacular, but it gave me the opportunity to eat tiny portions of dishes I have been craving for weeks (e.g. Sweet & Sour chicken, yum).  We came right before the lunch rush around 12:30pm but the place is huge so seating was not a problem.  Sushi and dessert selection was mediocre.  They were out of a few dishes (like the crab legs, ugh) but there was enough of everything else to leave me and my cousin completely stuffed."}
{"text":"One of the better Asian buffet in town.  I only got to try the lunch buffet. Reasonably priced and pretty good quality overalls. Get real busy early afternoons."}
{"text":"Very surprised by this treasure. Sashimi selection good - tuna, white tuna, salmon, mackerel etc. Unique salad section with mango shrimp, great kim chi,  and seaweed. Good soups and hot food section. Dinner seafood was great - blue crabs, crab legs, Crawford and lots of shellfish - raw oysters, large clams and crustaceans. Great value."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE and when I say terrible, it was the worst seafood I've ever had. The food is VERY low quality and even if it was once good quality, they sit everything out so long on the buffet it gets rubbery and has a weird taste to it. My husband and I had an oyster (which we typically love) and we both spit it out because it was chewy/rubbery and had a skunky taste. Like, they left it out in the sun and forgot to refrigerate it. Alot of the seafood tasted like this. Especially the sushi. i'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from the sushi- or it may have been that oyster - :/. I went home with my stomach really hurting and the next morning I woke up with nausea/diarrhea. I highly regret my decision to go there. Really though, I'm warning you. Don't go there unless you want to spend the whole next day in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Being that I lived in SC for years I wasn't expecting much from Hokkaido. Some of the seafood dishes were the normal overly cooked american versions of Chinese that you can get anywhere, but they did have some interesting and tasty food. 

My BF liked some of the cooked beef. I liked the crab, and the sushi wasn't as bad as it could have been. The seaweed salad was better than expected. I LOVED the chocolate fountain! (who doesn't?)  

I was overall pleased with the food, but I expected a different atmosphere (I don't know what I was thinking). There were screaming kids in seats and running around EVERYWHERE! Bleh. I know they charge an extra fee for wasting food... they should charge one for bad ass kids too..."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with my visit.  It has been about a year since I was here for dinner.  I remember it always being great... not anymore.  Almost every single hot item I had was cold or barely luke warm.  It just didn't seem like the quality was what it used to be, in my honest opinion.  

As far as service, I never received a refill on my drink, and I was \"butt rushed\" out the door with the check and them hawking over me until I signed the receipt.  Needless to say, I don't think i'll be going back very soon.  I suppose my days of going here are done."}
{"text":"This is a buffet, so if you are unfamiliar with the concept or dining style, it may be a bit much for the generic American food eater. By this I mean, this is an Asian styled buffet, with combinations and flavors that may not appeal to everyone. I personally enjoy every visit here and haven't been disappointed in over a dozen visits in the past, but as its a buffet I tend to visit during volume hours for a larger and fresher selection. 

Yes, it's wise to come here when you're starving and it doesn't hurt to have an open mind on food. Bland isn't really a flavor here. My companion always judges Asian buffets by the quality of the chicken feet, myself the frogs legs. Hokkaido doesn't carry frog legs and the chicken feet were cold, almost pickled, but enjoyed. Plenty of the other food was delicious, the selection gigantic, and the buffet was kept quite clean. 

Small secret. It seems they may not label everything on purpose. Perhaps that's because the staff hardly acknowledges the ability to speak English. Perhaps it's to the benefit of the educated diner. I scored some red clam sashimi, salmon skin maki, bean stuffed buns, and something I still don't know what it was. The crab legs were actually delicious, the maki/sushi was freshly prepared, the octopus salad always scrumptious. It always seems like the generic American foods suffer but I know nothing of this. I did not come here eat garlic bread, corn dogs, pizza, or chicken quesadilla. 

So sure, it's a buffet, but it has plenty of eclectic dishes. If you're in the mood for an Asian food buffet, there's plenty to cram in your belly here. So yes, four stars, amongst its contemporaries this place shines"}
{"text":"Our first time there was yesterday, dinner time.  The variety is very different from your run of the mill Chinese buffet.  If your not open to different things, this really isn't for you.  I was disappointed they didn't have the coconut shrimp (as listed on their website), but the crablegs were great.  They were large, easy to crack open and not swimming in a foot of salty water like other buffets.  I'm not a sushi person, but from what I saw, they had a nice variety.  The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the service, which is just what I expected from reading the reviews before I went yesterday.  They just walk by and grab plates.  I had to ask several times before I finally got crab claw crackers, I gave up and went to them for extra napkins and we had to stop her just to get refills on our drinks.  We made a special way out of the way trip to go there, we will definitely go again, mostly for special occasions."}
{"text":"$20 is a bit much for just C- food. It was sort of a hit and miss here. The crab legs were good and so was the sushi, by the oysters and clams were revolting. Let's not beat around the bush, I think it's a good 100% assumption that none of these are fresh from the sea and maybe have been sitting in the freezer for awhile. That being said, I found some of the food to have freezer burn...which is as fun to look at as it is to eat. They do have great crap legs, but that isn't enough for the heavy price. Great selection, however the outcome isn't too much to be desired."}
{"text":"This place is always packed on weekends. I feel like every time I come here, there is at least a 15 minute wait before they let me in. For only $17.99 a person and the endless rows of yummy in your tummy food, Hokkaido is definitely worth the wait. 

The atmosphere at Hokkaido is very upbeat and dynamic. There is always some type of party taking place in the buffet. Today there was an engagement party so the place was filled with balloons and confetti. Endless selection of food...all tasted amazing! I love the pepper shrimps and stir fry mushrooms. However, crab legs were kind of scrawny and there weren't that many variety of sushi/sashimi. Oysters though...definitely endless! I think between my boyfriend and me, we had like at least 10 plates of oysters, and they just kept refilling them until we finally surrendered. 

Service was okay. I was kind of annoyed that the waitress gave us the check so early, when we weren't even close to getting dessert yet. I know there are other people waiting, but there is no need to rush us like that. No worries, we took our good old time anyways. 

In conclusion, Hokkaido is good for everything, except for the crab legs. Sushi/sashimi were ok, but if you're only in it for the sushi/sashimi, then Tokyo Sushi Buffet is a better choice. However, if you're in it for all the variety of food, then I highly recommend Hokkaido!"}
{"text":"Best place for buffets! Sea foods are fresh here and sushis are pretty good! Not expensive."}
{"text":"I love it.  Snow crab legs during dinner is a must.  They have quite a bit of selection: tons of chinese dishes, salads, sushis, fruit bar, ice cream, soups, pizza, fries, fried chicken, a Mongolian grill, Dim Sum, a carving board with beef, pork or Italian sausage (which is damn good).

I like the place.  Looks nice.  Would be nicer if the staff can speak some kind of English (Don't worry, I'm Asian).

Overall, I love it."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Chinese buffets around the US and the world. I find that some are awesome and some are down right terrible. There never seems to be an in between. This place is one of the awesome.

I find the service is good and it has a wide selection of food with good quality and price is reasonable. It's clean and the food has always been fresh when I have gone. It also has a full hibachi station and sushi line. I have never had the hibachi but the sushi selection is great for the price. The only downside is the dessert area. The chocolate fountain is meh and apart from the ice cream it's just below average. But I'm a savory kinda guy and it's not a big deal to me.

I like Chinese buffets when I get a sudden craving for greasy Chinese food and a lot of it. It's a time when I can dawn my finest pair of stretchy pants and eat until they rip and still be the thinnest person in the room."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of buffets. It often feels like I'm overpaying to eat a small sampling of food. Part of the problem is that I don't tend to have a huge appetite - BUT I've noticed that if the food is excellent I suddenly have the room to gorge myself on the deliciousness. I've decided that my appetite is a great measuring stick for buffet food quality - and my appetite says that Hokkaido is wonderful!

Note: this is not a Chinese/Japanese specific buffet. It has a lot of the Chinese buffet staples, from the chicken based dishes to the mixed veggies to noodles to the awesome little dessert cakes and pudding - but it also has sushi. Really, really good sushi. All of the stuff here was fresh when I visited and a lot of the items varied between being BBQed, cooked or fried, depending on what was being made and offered that day. There's also few stations where you can customize your own meal, too, i.e. the Mongolian grill, Hibachi, etc.

My point? There's definitely something here to please everyone. I can't even REMEMBER all of the awesome food I've enjoyed here, that's how varied the selection was and is. Plus the place overall just felt warm, inviting and well maintained. Just a fantastic place to splurge. I'd come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I like it. I think this place has a great selection of food (including crab legs). The location is good with abundant parking. Good place to experiment on seafood or sushi (had mussels for the first time they were great). It is kind of noisy though. I was kind of annoyed with one of their policies, it stated that if you do not finish your plate (or however they worded it) you would be charged extra. I am already paying for an all you can eat buffet I do not understand why does it matter if my plate is finished or not. Probably just a way to earn extra  money. Regardless its okay I would come again."}
{"text":"I like Hokkaido. It's the only Asian Buffet I've been to in Pittsburgh and I'm not sure if I'd be brave enough to go anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Because Hokkaido is supposedly the \"best\" one in Pittsburgh. Based on that statement alone, you can understand my sense of caution. I've been to plenty of asian buffets around the world. Hokkaido isn't bad, I've just had better. There's a good variety of chinese dishes, mongolian grill, sushi, dim sum, fruits, desserts and crab legs.

My only problem is the cleanliness. You're probably asking, what do you expect from a buffet? Hand sanitizer pumps around the area, maybe? Clean dishes? Clean eating utensils? Clean serving spoons/tongs?
 
I also witnessed a kid hanging over the freezer to get ice cream. Then he stuck his fingers in the scooper to scrape it out. Then dropped it back in the water. One employee saw but didn't care. I don't know where this kids fingers have been? Not only that but the dishes were slightly greasy and some of my eating utensils had sweet and sour sauce residue on it.
Bathroom was a bit of a mess. Old rags under the soap dispenser and paper towels all over the floor. Maybe it was a bad day?

At least the restaurant didn't smell. So that's a plus!

Food was good
Cleanliness could be far better
Service was as good as it can be
Price is a little expensive"}
{"text":"Hokkaido is my go-to buffet in Pittsburgh. It's pretty decent for what it is - cheap, all you can eat, Chinese food. 

The staples are all there, sushi, snow crab (dinner only), shrimp, Mongolian BBQ, salads, crab rangoon, etc. The usual Chinese fare is pretty good, but I would steer clear of the american dishes (their pizza doesn't taste quite like pizza). The sushi I have found to be simple, but does the job. Don't expect any very fancy rolls. 

They have recently added a chocolate fountain to their desert bar, which thankfully means you can get a plate of fruits as well if you prefer."}
{"text":"This buffet is amazing.  The menu is so expansive I ate myself into a coma.  That was on Friday.  On Sunday I awoke out of said coma with the urge to return on Sunday.  I did just that.

Why you ask?  Well on Sunday I was craving Sushi and as I looked over the Nakama menu for my girlfriend and I, I realized the order would come out to around $45.  For that price I can pick and choose whatever I want, whenever I want at Hokkaido.  I controlled myself a little bit more on Sunday and stuck to the Sushi, which was delicious by the way. Seriously, it's amazing."}
{"text":"It's going down hill...  Went here on Sunday (1/24/16) and the overwhelming taste of MSG sickened us both.  The crab legs were WAY OVERCOOKED and way over salted.  The shells didn't snap like a toothpick would, they merely flexed like a straw would.  The crabmeat inside was soggy and way too hard to get out.  Even the deserts, which my wife kind of likes, had MSG on them.  Pineapple slices with MSG?  Really?  This visit made us realize that next time we want good seafood- we're going to take a trip to Wholeys and cook it ourselves."}
{"text":"Been here many times to be expected with any buffet food isnt exceptional however it is good and the selection is huge.  Plus whil e it is always busy the service is good.  Seafood, sushi, chinese dishes and deserts and id consider it a cheap buffet considering what it offers."}
{"text":"This food was pretty bad - it was stale, fishy, and just questionable as a whole. Even the sushi was suspect. I don't have too much to say other than I do not recommend it.  The one item I was excited for was crab legs and they didnt even have that.

If you are extremely extremely hungry and dont mind eating watery, stale seafood that may or may not mess up your stomach, then this is the place to go. I felt sick after eating here."}
{"text":"I prefer this buffet over most Asian buffets in the Burgh. The food is always hot and fresh because they put out smaller portions. Little Man and I enjoy the hibachi too because who doesn't? Everything is sectioned off from salads to entrees to fried food and a dessert section . The only problem is the price at dinner. It's insane so go for lunch if you don't need crab legs. Also, if your kid is over 36\" they get charged half price, so if they are a picky eater don't bring them along."}
{"text":"I have to update my review because Hokkaido really stepped up their sushi game and I am digging it!  

They finally added the basic sushi pieces - salmon, tuna, mackerel, etc. in addition to the rolls they always had.  The fish on top of the rice might've been sliced a little thin but it was very good and fresh - especially the salmon.

I love all the seafood they have - especially since it's Friday during Lenten season.  We had baby clams, cheesy stuffed mussels, salt and pepper squid, shrimp and crab.  I also have to say the eggplant in garlic sauce was super.

Everything was so good - can't wait to come again when I need my sushi fix!  My sister, who was hungover, said this place \"saved her life\" - so dramatic but there is a ring of truth to this - when you want sushi - this place delivers just that and more.

Thanks for upping your sushi game, Hokkaido!! I'm now a big fan :-)"}
{"text":"It's an alright all you can eat sushi buffet. They do have a variety of specialty sushi rolls and lots of different kinds of seafood, like snow crab legs, mussels, fish, and stir fried crab. The other food is mediocre, typical generic Chinese take out fried rice and noodles. They have American food like pizza too. I recommend coming for lunch on a weekday, it's only $10 then which really is a good deal for all you can eat. My favorites are the snow crab legs and cheese mussels!"}
{"text":"Was here on a Tuesday on the way to a movie at the waterfront at about 4pm. I've always thought Hokkaido was way better than your average Chinese/sushi buffet. Shame on me for going on an off hour. The soups had skin on them, the shrimp was cold and mushy, and all the sushi had been sitting. NONE of the hot food was hot. Think this place is good when it's packed because it means the food is continuously replenished. It's not really right that I paid the price for a VERY substandard experience - they should close in between meals if they can't maintain quality."}
{"text":"I went there with my two daughters(10 and 8) tonight. When I asked for my bill. The waitress asked my daughter's age. my daughters replied. The waitress asked my old daughter to stand up, and told me they would charge her as an adult, because she is tall. I paid for my two daughters in full price because my two daughters have almost same height.

This is the first time my daughters were charged as adult, not only in restaurant, in every place we have been to. I asked my old daughter, how tall she is in her class. She told me she is one of the shortest students. 

So, if you have a kid that is 8 and above, do not be surprised if they charge him/her as an adult."}
{"text":"This place left a lot to be desired. Though they had a lot of the basics (rice noodles, General Tso, shrimp) they aren't anything to relay race about. They have lots of others (octopus salad, soups, sushi bar) but again, nothing to rave about. The sushi wasn't up to par, even the wasabi was dull. If you're going here for quality, make this your last choice. Well, maybe next to last."}
{"text":"Just not my cup a of tea, and Chinese/sushi/buffet is my favorite kind of tea.  The noise level at this restaurant is just off the chains. This restaurant lacks class and has a lunch room cafeteria feel.  

I was tickled that frog legs were on the buffet, but everything else was just blah. I ate here once and don't plan on ever returning."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch several times since it opened many years ago, but never did dinner.  Crab legs are cooked just right.  The shells break as they should, and the meat comes out in one piece, the sign of proper cooking.  Other places the meat falls apart and the shell is squishy - overcooked.  Many delicious staples, including a huge sushi section which is not my thing, but heard great things.  The real marker of a good asian buffet is my observation of the patrons - we were there on a busy Saturday night, and I looked around and noticed more than 2/3rds of the customers were Asian.  Never in my life saw that at another Chinese buffet.  That speaks for itself, and speaks volumes - this food is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this place to me and I'm glad that I finally tried it out! They cook almost every dish in the right way. I was surprised to see that they even served some very traditional Chinese dishes like brine egg. Service was fine. Waitresses were very friendly and they cleaned empty dishes right on time. It was a little bit noisy but how could you complain. It's such a popular restaurant after all."}
{"text":"It's a Chinese Buffet with a lot of options of food including: steak, a lot types of seafood, soups, desserts, sushi, sashimi (raw fish). Sometimes the fish are fresh sometimes not so much. I always check seeing the color of the fish. The food itself is normal but the price and variety worth a try. I recommend if you like to try a little bit of everything in a restaurant and in a fast way-
Easy, cheap and fast."}
{"text":"Never, I repeat never come here. The food is bad, (I've had better sushi at a gas station) the service is horrible, the place was packed and to top it all off, i got food poisoning from this place. I have been throwing up for the past 3 hours. Very unsanitary. And the bill for 4 people was $87. Totally not worth it"}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty low for this buffet but I actually was quite pleased. Everything I tried was tasty and fresh. The waitresses do not suck up to you (it is a buffet people!) but they were efficient and kept our glasses full. My favorites included the octopus salad, calamari, rose chicken, mango salad, oysters, cheese wontons and cotton candy ice cream. Nothing tasted overly \"fishy\", the dining room smelled clean, and they don't fry everything or cover it in cloying sauce. For the negatives, the dessert section was pretty paltry and I didn't like the sushi very much.

Price is kind of expensive for dinner and weekend meals (I assume because the crab leg trough is dinner only) but lunch ($10)  is about right for what sort of things they serve."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi can't beat the price either. Everyone was very friendly. It's A ok in my book."}
{"text":"A good local buffet. I thought the sashimi was very fresh, especially the salmon. Chinese traditional dishes we're very good and everything is refilled extremely fast. Crab legs were very good as well and plentiful. Spring rolls were terrible and the dumplings could be better.  
***Make sure you read the sign on the table before going up to to the buffet.\" If you take to much food and leave enough waste your plate then there is an $8 additional charge\"**
Recommended though as far as Chinese buffets go."}
{"text":"Super clean nice buffet. Huge selection. All you can eat crab legs 20 bucks. Delicious."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi, and the sushi is actually pretty good for an asian buffet. Iv had a lot worse in the area, that's for sure. There are a few other solid choices as well. They also have hibachi and a chocolate fountain! Also good value during lunch at just under $10. This is the only buffet ill go to in Pittsburgh for now"}
{"text":"This place was pretty interesting!  In a good way, though!

PRICING:  We (the 2 of us) went on a Friday Night @ approx 7:30 and the check was just shy of $40.

The buffet is pretty huge with TONS of different and unique dishes on it.  
From Chicken Feet (yep... the claws!) to Sushi!

There were a lot of traditional Chinese dishes (such as Lo Mein, Rice Noodles, Rice Dishes, General Tso's, etc.), but there were also some wild ones like Squid!

The do have crab legs on the buffet (as well as 1/2 crabs).

Lots of fruit and ice cream flavors at the dessert station.
There's even a hibachi station!


Okay, so the breakdown:

PROS:  
LOTS of food options;
Food was kept pretty fresh and plentiful;
Food was hot!
We were seated very quickly on a Friday night;
the wait staff were on the ball when it came to refills and pre-busing the tables.

CONS:
Bathroom attention needed to be a bigger priority;
The only thing that they did NOT have on the buffet that I wish they did have was regular old Fried Rice!  lol, c'mon now!  How do ya not have that?!??  lol


All in all, it was a good experience!
We'll be back and I think that we definitely got our money's worth."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of a buffet.  It's the one type of restaurant that you can walk into and not feel pressured to have to make the perfect selection off a menu.  Especially if it's a place you've never been to before.

The waiters/waitresses are swift, even if they are only delivering a drink to you or taking away a plate you just finished.  I think they might be ninjas.  One second you are sitting there and the next the appear out of nowhere...it's mind boggling.

The buffet itself has everything from hot to cold.  I feel as if I'm browsing the shelves at a market somewhere deciding if I really need that item or not.  Doesn't matter, I put it on my plate, if I don't like it, no worries.  Of course being a Chinese style buffet they have my favorite (a probably a lot of other people's favorite), General Tso's.  I always end up getting way to much at a buffet and end up leaving as if I just ate Thanksgiving dinner.  You know, unbutton the pants, and then sit back for a nap type of feeling.

Seafood salad, General Tso's, garlic sting beans, honeydew, sushi, won ton soup, and to finish it off, some ice cream.  Happy as a clam sums it up.

However, I'm still weirded out by the chicken feet...o.O"}
{"text":"Hands down the best buffet in PITTSBURGH! I'm not going to compare them to other buffets out of Pittsburgh, bc frankly there are tons way better. However, for us \"Pittsburghers\" here, this is not bad at all. Really good food and my big family loves coming here after a long week of work! Sushi is okay, nothing to be crazy about and I don't blame them bc they're not a \"sushi\" restaurant but the salted crabs and crab legs here though.... boy oh boy! It's not super salty just the perfect amount.. I love them. I can eat like 2-4 full plates of crabs alone! Seriously."}
{"text":"As far as a Chinese buffet is concerned I could recommend this place. Maybe one of the best in Pittsburgh but nothing to hoot and holler about. Most of the food was tasty while some of it was dry. Perhaps dry because there were only about 15 people there on a Monday night around 7. Wait staff was friendly and diligent enough to be happy about the service. The restaurant was clean as well. I live in a different state and the city (Houston) is home to a large Asian population and have had the pleasure of some real good food. Overall if you are craving a Chinese buffet this is a good place to try. However, I would not say the food lives up to the price tag at dinner prices. $18 - $20 per person plus drinks."}
{"text":"This is pretty good as far as Asian buffets go. The selection of Asian food is quite good. Ranging from fried rice, noodles, hibachi and even braised chicken feet. But most people that come here aren't going for those items, the golden ticket here are differently the crab legs. The legs here are very good for being a buffet, there's plenty of meat in the legs and the meat looks fresh as you pull it out of its shell. If one is a fan of crab legs, one can easily consume a dozen of these. There's also oysters here, they do vary in size but generally fresh. The oysters aren't the best when it comes to flavor. They also have a good range of sushi, such as salmon and tuna sashimi, and common rolls likes california roll, crazy roll, veggie, etc. There's an OK selection of desserts, but they do have a chocolate fountain for dipping in fruits and marshmallows if you're into that...

I've been here a few times and service is generally good. However on our last visit, the wait staff was a bit impatient. The waitress taking our drink orders literally rolled her eyes when we asked for water with lemon. It sure was a busy day, but don't bring it upon your customers!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite, but they've gotten so stingy over the years that it's really not that fun anymore. 

They have a very strict crab leg limit for dinner. You may only get crab legs once during your visit and there is a 7 piece limit. This results in people (understandably) picking the biggest pieces out and what remains are scraps that the restaurant won't refill until they are gone. The crab legs themselves are not the highest quality, so you frequently get pieces with very little meat in them. 

Also, the dessert bar has dwindled significantly. It used to be full of different kinds of cookies and cakes. Now, there was a watered down chocolate fountain with marshmallows, peanut brittle, and a brown banana for dipping, a couple of other treats, and ice cream. 

The other food is still tasty, but It's just not what it used to be. I understand crab legs are expensive, but I'd rather them raise their prices by a few dollars per person and keep the high quality and enjoyable experience than keep prices the same and make it seem so miserly."}
{"text":"Quantity over quality. When it comes to sushi and seafood, a buffet is definitely NOT the way to go!"}
{"text":"Beware of crab legs. Taste very salty. Probably soaked in salt water so customers eat less to save on food cost."}
{"text":"I come from a long line of eaters. My grandparents sailed over for the sole purpose of the \"buffet.\" My dad won the pie eating contest in the 76 Hubby County Fair. Unfortunately I do not have any medals above my bed...YET. This is where I go to train.

There is a 20 dollar fee to train here, well worth it. First I start off with 10 reps of the king crab legs. It's a great warm up, gets the heart going and the fingers nimble. I follow this up with a few randoms, couple reps of sweet and sour chicken, bourbon chicken, and general tsos.

After this I like to go for a cool down, or what I like to call, the first desert. Maybe some ice cream, banana cream pudding, something like that.

I like to follow up my first desert with some mercury intake. Sushi does the trick. I don't go too crazy with this, like to keep my figure.

Then I go big. The mongolian barbecue. This is where I build the stomach muscle. Steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops and I even saw shark here one time. 

After my stomach has stretched to new heights I like to finish off with my final cool down, some marshmallows run through the chocolate fountain.

Is this the best training facility in the world? Probably not. Does it have some good crab legs and mongolian bbq? Absolutely

Also, like other people said, dont leave too much food on your plate or they will charge you extra."}
{"text":"At Hokkaido Seafood Buffet I had the worst fried spring roll I've ever had and the worst pan-fried dumpling too. The rest of the food that I tried wasn't that much better... they all became unappetizing after a couple bites (or just one bite) with the exception of the stir-fried green beans, but even with those at one point I bit into something hard and unbean-like, like a grain of sand. By the time I got back home I was hungry.

Aside from the food and having to look around for the white rice there isn't anything else I can complain about. (Service was good.) Oops no, they're apparently a chain with several locations in California and on their site they don't list their Pittsburgh location. http://www.hokkaidoseafood.com/locations.html"}
{"text":"12-1-17 Update
I tried Hokkaido again after a fairly long absence. The music still sucks, only now it's unpleasant and loud non-stop low-end Christmas carols instead of the \"Contemporary Christian Rock\" last summer. 
Food-wise it was reasonably good. The sushi is better than TJ Buffet's, but the dim sum is worse. They still make Shau mai way to big with very thick wrappers, whereas TJ's has nice Har gau shrimp dumplings, properly made with thin wrappers.
The Hokkaido special chicken with hoisen sauce is quite wonderful, as are the whole pepper shrimp-in-shell. It's certainly worth the price for lunch, but bring earplugs.
---------------
6-1-17
I am greatly offended by the \"Contemporary Christian Rock\" soundtrack running constantly at Hokkaido buffet. I went for lunch, not to try to be converted and baptized with soy sauce. Duh, it's a no-brainer to put on something like soft Japanese music in a sushi place named Hokkaido, but droning Country Western Rock singing \"Jeeezus Touched me... Oh his greatnessss... blah blah blah,\" no thanks.
Outside of that, the food was reasonably good. I liked the sushi, but the chocolate fountain is unwelcome. Who wants to smell chocolate along with sushi? Certainly not me. Their pork shau mai weren't good at all, thick wrappers and a filling like a cheap meatball. Soups weren't good, gloppy, thick, sweet. If you pick and choose, you can have a pretty good lunch for a pretty good price, but bring ear plugs if you don't want to have religious music crammed down your throat."}
{"text":"I went to Hokkaido for dinner and while I was impressed by the number of dishes, I was not impressed with the quality of food.  If you want to pay $16 for a meal, go to a place where you can get a plate of fresh food rather than something that has been warming under an artificial light."}
{"text":"Food diversity is great and it's kinda yum but I don't think the environment is good."}
{"text":"Cheap and a great selection from the usual buffet fare! I love the sushi selection, although I wish they had more unagi eel this time of year in their sushi's. More seafood than the usual buffet, although the name of the restaurant is a bit misleading as it's just maybe a little more seafood than average - what they have is good though."}
{"text":"Really good pan fried tilapia. cooked to order teppanyaki. they even had chicken feet on the cold bar...which is not a selling point for me but for my dad it is.

they let you bring in your own alcohol with no corkage!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to go here for so long and loved it! Many friends of mine have raved about this place and now I know why. 

The manager took us to our table and clarified the price with us--Apparently, a lot of people are surprised to learn that the buffet is more expensive on the weekends than during the week and have been disgruntled in the past. I consider myself a buffet pro and know that yes, of course the price is going to be more expensive on a Sunday afternoon than on a weekday afternoon. That's the way of the world, folks! Regardless, I thought it was great of him to respond to customer complaints and make sure that clarification was made before we were seated. It was $19.99 per person, but let me tell you---- it's an amazing deal for what you get!!!

The food is split up into sections and each one had abundant options. Fried foods, salad bar, dessert, made-to-order hibachi, BBQ/Meat, and then a section which was a great mix of American-Chinese food and authentic Asian options. You'll find the typical buffet fare of wontons, spring rolls, general tso's chicken, coconut shrimp, fried rice, etc. But don't worry if you are looking for something a little more adventurous! There was fried chicken feet, octopus salad, kimchi and other fare that you don't seen at most Asian buffets. 

I was most looking forward to this place because of what I've heard about their sushi/sashimi selection. And I was not disappointed! I'd say there were about 10 different types of rolls in addition to the sashimi. The rolls were fresh and plentiful. The tempura rolls were still crispy, which is almost unheard of in buffet-style serving. 

I had to sample a little from each section and after three plates, I was incredibly full and satisfied!

They also have a hibachi style section where you can create your own dish to be cooked to order. I was far too full to mess with that section, but I appreciate it's availability, especially for those who might be pickier eaters than me."}
{"text":"It's really cheap. I went for the lunch, it only cost me 10$! However, the food quality is not good... the sushi bar is ok. The crab is not fresh and overcook... however it provides a variety of food, including Chinese food, habachi, Hong Kong dim sum, western food, and chocolate fountain!!
The food I think it's ok are Chinese food, sushi, and chocolate fountain. They said for the dinner, they will provide other kind of crab and oysters which cost you around 18$.
You can give it a try since it's so cheap... if you want drinks, it will cost you extra (2$ for coke)..."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday lunch on April 12th. It was perfection...the best Asian buffet I have EVER had all for $8.95. They have a wide variety of sushi, Hibachi grill, traditional Chinese dishes, great desserts. I even ate SHARK!  I love squid. They had squid salad, stir fried squid, Chinese type squid. They had peeled shrimp, crawfish, oysters, clams, muscles....it was fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is where the farm animals go to pig out at the never ending trough. This is what is so wrong with our country where people are willing to fork out $20 just because they offer never ending crab legs that are not always there and when they are other farm animals jostle just to take a few of the overcooked crustaceans. Unless you feel the urge to meta-morph into a pig STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"What a great place! This was really unexpected: high quality seafood in high quantity and at a great price. Service is quick and courteous. The selection of sushi and other seafood was more diverse than any other buffet I've been to."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday and it was surprisingly pretty good. It's probably one of the only Asian buffets in Pittsburgh within a reasonable distance from Pitt's campus. There is a very wide selection of food. My favorite part was the sushi bar--they had lots of different kinds of sushi and selections of sashimi as well. 
Dessert was alright--they offered some fruit/fruit salads, ice cream, and cake. To my surprise, they also had white fungus bird's nest soup, a lightly sweetened soup with a slightly syrupy consistency that my mom often made for me at home. It was really refreshing to see something like that in Pittsburgh. There is a chocolate fountain as well, but the chocolate tastes more like Hershey's syrup than actual chocolate and has a grainy texture, so I wasn't a huge fan of it. Still cool, though."}
{"text":"Some other reviewers here have said that this buffet is probably the best Asian one in Pittsburgh. I am not sure about that. This buffet is OK, but I might not return. The price is not bad for all-you-can-eat (especially crab legs). The food selection is typical: lo mein, rice, chicken with broccoli, general tso, sushi, soups, American (pizza, chicken nuggets), salad, fruit, desserts, ice cream, etc. Some of the male customers pushed female customers out of the way to get to the food, and my big husband had to intervene."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a buffet with an endless supply of a large variety of sushi and a chocolate fountain?! 

I do have to say, the \"warning\" sign on the tables was a bit much.  I know people do waste a lot of food at buffets, but it is not welcoming to be threatened with being charged for unfinished food.  It is a buffet and sometimes I take things to try that I absolutely don't like.  I'm not going to eat them just because of your threats!  

I was in the area and convinced my husband that we should finally try this buffet.  It was a Friday night and while it was crowded, it wasn't overwhelmingly so as the tables are well spaced out.  I was in the mood for sushi so I started there.  There were about 10 types of rolls, four of five types of pieces and four types of sashimi.  They also had the sauces to add if you wanted to.   None of the rolls or pieces I ate were out of this world or extremely memorable, but they were tasty.  Most had at least one type of sauce on them, though, so if you aren't a fan of sauce on your rolls, you won't like this sushi.

Aside from the sushi, they also have a selection of the typical Chinese buffet fair.  My husband tried a good number of those dishes and again said they were tasty but nothing overly memorable.  They did have a few dim sum options which was a nice touch.

Overall, it was pricey (around $20 per person) but if you went somewhere else and got an appetizer, salad, entrees and dessert, you would be paying at least that if not more."}
{"text":"Four stars only because of the sushi, which was very good for a buffet. Generous amounts of fish and no need to order just pick it up. The rest of the food was mediocre. I would go back for sushi especially around lunch. All you can eat sushi for around ten dollars.  Can't beat it"}
{"text":"Super clean, tons of food selection, super friendly staff and management crew, reasonably priced for both lunch and dinner. High quality food item options available. You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Food is so dry.. seems like its been sitting out for the whole day. They won't replace a dish such as crabs, steak etc before it is entirely gone so food comes out slow. The plates are not clean and the utensils feel greasy. 

I would say the food is just okay. I would not go back here again unless I am looking for a buffet and just wanted to have a quick bite. Yes, there are options but not the highest quality food. The price is manageable but they really have to stop blasting music that is crazy loud."}
{"text":"Post-Thanksgiving meal planning is a tough task.  You've got a house full of guests, each with his/her own culinary quirks (the snooty foodie, the ethnic restaurant authenticity police, the cheapskate, the unadventurous picky-eater who finds chop suey too exotic, the militant vegan, and the long-suffering mother); the only thing everyone can agree on is: No more leftover turkey!  This would be a good time to pack everyone into the car and head out to Hokkaido Seafood Buffet.

To Asian food aficionados, Hokkaido Seafood Buffet may look kinda sketchy -- being sandwiched between a Dunkin Donuts and an IHOP in a divvy strip-mall, its location does not exactly screams \"oishii!\" Its very buffet-ness also induces skepticism -- good food and buffet are so very often mutually exclusive.  All the same, curiosity got the better of us, and so we find ourselves in Hokkaido Seafood Buffet this Saturday post Thanksgiving.

The name of the restaurant is somewhat misleading. There's nothing particularly Japanese about this place. It is really set up to cater to Americans and Chinese. The food offerings run the gamut from pizza to pig's ears and chicken feet. They do have vegetarian fares, and you will also find dimsum-y snacks, Korean pancakes, chow mein, fruit, ice cream, and, of course, sushi. 

The qualities of these dishes vary. The dimsum-y dumplings are probably your best bet (though the wrappers are too thick). The noodle and mongolian bbq station is also a nice touch. The sushi offerings are ok (for buffets) if quantity is more important to you than quality.

Summary: Food-wise, HSB probably only warrants a 3 stars, but I'm giving it an extra 0.5 star for its wide cuisine coverage and another 0.5 star for providing a compromise to a group of diverse eaters."}
{"text":"Funny enough, I've gone to other Hokkaido's in different states, and these people know a good business when they have one.  I actually liked this Hokkaido more than the one I visited in VA.  Why, you ask?  It's very simple.  As a lover of seafood etc, this Hokkaido had more to offer.  The things I loved, free crab legs (which wasn't included in the dinner buffet price in VA), oysters, MANGO SALAD!!!!!!! yes yes yes nom nom nom, dim sum, fried shrimp, small clams in black bean sauce, and sashimi (which I also appreciate so I don't have to throw away the useless filling rice).  I mean who wouldn't want to fill up on these amazing things.  The only complaint I have about this is that they didn't refill oysters as fast as my table was eating them, probably because we were devouring them ^_^  Also, I know that they have a sign/pamphlet on the table \"Don't waste food, you will be charged,\" which I'm actually kind of curious if they really keep to this, as our table was scared shitless we ate every last bite :)  I would definitely recommend this place for a hungry party of seafood and Chinese food lovers,  GOO!! you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I visit here to meet my friend from New York. But try this buffet, I feel so bad for what happen. We want try some crab leg, but every time I go there to pick some, always empty. When my aunt go to check the crab leg again, the kitchen chef felt angry and said that \" you can't come to get crab leg again, u need to pay extra for crab leg!!!\" Hi, man! This is buffet, I felt very bad. The staff there are all rude, service is ok, but the attitude is so rude!!! Nobody will come back !!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good in the buffet realm. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star is they don't have green beans on the buffet. The food is great for the price. The noise level is what you would expect in any open restaurant ."}
{"text":"Lots of different types of food. I'm currently low-carbin' it, so there was plenty I couldn't try. Good crab legs, nice sashimi (good quality, not a tremendous amount of variety...I stuck with salmon and tuna, for the most part). The slice-your-own meats were a bit dry from sitting under heat lamps. I was well-sated and happy with the variety of tastes.

Be sure to give a cursory once-over to get the lay of the land. I'm lamenting not trying the stir-fry station. 

The staff was friendly and strangely omnipresent and in sync with each other."}
{"text":"We used to go to Hokkaido all the time but just went back after a two year hiatus.  The reason we like this buffet is their all-you-can-eat crab legs for a very reasonable cost.  They have instituted a new policy where each person can only have 7 legs and after that, they will charge you per pound.  While I'm not sure how they would enforce this policy, we were respectful of it.  We didn't find the other food on the buffet to be anything better than average.  My husband did say the sushi was good.  We probably won't be going back (and apparently other people feel the same way -- it was as empty on a Saturday night as I've ever seen it)."}
{"text":"If you like cheap quality food come here. If you like ridiculous amounts of cheap quality food, definitely come here. Expect mediocre buffet quality.

They have a large section of Americanized Chinese food (steamed fish, General Tso's chicken, squid, noodles, fried dumplings, etc) and a smaller one of American food (wings, fries, sausage, etc.). Avoid their \"dim sum\" section. Taste was a bit off. Surprisingly, their cold seafood/salad section was interesting (i.e. squid, clams, seaweed etc.). Not too sure about the freshness but definitely had a lot of variety. 

As far as buffets go, Hokkaido isn't one of the best, but at least it fills you up and you can taste about a hundred different things in one night. 2 stars for doing its job as a buffet."}
{"text":"So unfortunately the sushi buffet on McKnight road closed, which was my favorite place ever. This is my first visit to Hokkaido and I'm so happy I went! I really wish this place was closer to me, but it was worth the hour drive to brace rush hour and get there for dinner. 

I really went for the sushi, and sushi I ate! The selection is good, and as far as buffet sushi goes this is some of the best. I only wish their pieces were larger and thicker, but the taste was great! I'm very happy that they had nigiri, sashimi and rolls. 

Do yourself a favor and have some crab legs! Usually I'm shocked at people eating mountains of crab legs at a buffet because in my experience they are always rather salty, not so fresh, and the shells are mush. Not so here! These crab legs were actually really good!!! The shell broke easily and the butter was even tasty, which to me is a must. I was there during dinner hours and there were quite a few people eating the crab legs which meant that they kept bringing out small batches so that they were always fresh and hot! 

The beef wonton soup was delicious - so flavorful that salt wasn't necessary. As far as the other hot items go I didn't sample much - a few pork dumplings and cheese wontons but everything looked to be mediocre buffet standards. 

Final say: if you're going for sushi or crab legs then you will feel like you definitely got your money's worth and then some! If you're planning on loading up on fried foods and standard Asian fare I'd recommend an actual restaurant where the taste will be better."}
{"text":"For about $17.50 after tax on a Saturday night for all you can eat seafood and Asian cuisine, I'd say this place is a pretty good deal. I stuck mostly to sushi, and while not the freshest batch of dead fish slapped on top of a rice ball, I thought it was pretty reasonable. Salmon nigiri was the best of the small selection. I also sampled some of the 'Chinese' food for kicks and wasn't really that impressed. I also tried a beef taco that happened to be next to the Pizza and Fried chicken (ummm k). It sucked. But if you are into clams and crab legs, they got that stuff too.
Also, the desserts were quite nice as well. It is rare for a buffet to have cheesecake, but they did.
Service was non-existent (not one re-fill!) and the hostess who seated us was rude. They need to work on that.

Word must have gotten out because the wait times can be enormous for dinner. We had to wait nearly 40 minutes for a table.

Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars
Portion Size Given Price = 5 Stars
Relative Price = 5 Stars
Service = 0 Stars
Experience with Staff = 0 Stars
Decor = 3 Stars
Clean (yes/no) = yes"}
{"text":"They had a very extensive menu which I LOVED! I'm from the bay area so I've been to quite a few Asian seafood buffets and this is by far the best one yet! I didn't like everything but I thought majority of it was very good. The place was very clean and food actually LOOKED good so that is a big difference from a lot of buffets that I have been to. 

I was able try a lot new dishes that I definitely wouldn't have ordered in a regular restaurant. I tried some of my husband's SHARK (very odd, I know) and it didn't taste bad but the fact that I knew it was shark, made it not appealing to me. The fried frog legs were great! The taro cake was surprisingly good. 

The sushi didn't taste cheap at all and it was made very well. It wasn't the best sushi I ever tasted but it was the best buffet sushi I ever had! lol ALL of the Chinese food dishes were excellent and I don't even like chinese food that much!! 

I thought it was cute that they gave us warm towels with our bill... that was a nice touch. 

The only bad thing was the table service! It was very hard to get a refill and get our check. The waiter gave our card to the WRONG table so it was a good thing that no one was sitting at the table. 

Overall, I would definitely go again and recommend everyone should go at least once. Oh and if you don't have a very diverse palate, there are food choices for you like pizza, egg rolls, soup,and things of that nature."}
{"text":"GROSS.... have been here many times but this time was just the WORST!!!! Food was flavorless, dry and tasted like CHLORINE. Even the water was gross... AND they started cleaning up BEFORE closing... workers were EXTREMELY rude!!!!! Was a regular customer but will NOT be going back... they also put a limit on the BLAND crab legs...  What kind of \"BUFFET\" is this?!?!?! 

One star is GENEROUS.... don't even bother !!!"}
{"text":"Nice variety but only fair taste. Worth a visit if you want a large buffet with a good variety. Don'e expect anything outstanding though."}
{"text":"When you get right down to it, it's a chinese buffet, and as we all know, Pittsburgh and the yinzers with their stretch jeans and sweat pants mentalities, loves them some Chinese buffet.

On Jan 1st I took charge of my life and health and went vegan, it wasnt long after that Lesbian friend of Joe who eats meat with every meal and snack decided that for her birthday she wanted to come here for her celebration. we hit the place and she took off for the crab legs, shrimp, and anything she could find that used to be an animal that was sitting under heat lamps and oozing of juices that used to be blood.

I went to the sushi station and asked one of the sushi chefs if he could make me a california roll and anything else without fish. He smiled and said that he could put his creative mind to work. I was floored with what he came up with. He took many different vegetables and made me a sushi platter that was both beautiful and filling. Using brown rice and white rice, cucumber, carrot, and scallion, he created a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"The buffet here had a variety of dishes. You would definitely find something you will love in the menu; and it's $10 for a weekday lunch buffet. Apart from the sushi, the food was average. I would definitely come here again for the sushi."}
{"text":"The quality and service have gone way down. They had a sign by the crab legs trying to explain that the \"premium\" crab is limited to two pounds per person. I had to ask them to get crab and it was overlooked and looked like the bottom of the barrel. For a Friday evening it was pretty empty. I miss the way it was when they first opened."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE BUFFET...EVER

 I have been coming here since the grand opening. often about 20 or more times a year. its very consistent..the sushi is what i tackle first.. one time i ate 28 peices of sushi in one sitting...lol i wasnt feeling too great afterwards. BUT IT WAS GOOOOD. lol.

 i wouldnt get to hung on the endless crab legs though if theres a dinner rush. the crab leg section is always empty due to all the...\"people\" that go there. 

The salad section doesnt look like it gets too picked out with all the raw stuff over there. people tend to stay away from that area.

  the main dishes section always has an array of different types of chicken, noodles, beef, and fish that make your mouth water.

dont really go to the hibachi cause i hate waiting but i have seen people getting food there and it looks like they know what there doing. also next to the hibachi they have a peeking duck that is to die for. very sweet and tender.

the appetizer section with the egg rolls and chicken on a stick is pretty dope. my favorite is the sesame balls. very doughy and good.

the fruit and desert bar had a recent additon....a chocolate fondue fountain! i feel bad for those people that gotta scrape the chocolate that almost becomes like cement when it goes on the plate.

and when it comes to the ice cream section.... COTTON CANDY ICE CREAM AND COFFEE ICE CREAM...what could be better?"}
{"text":"I am a Hokkaido fan!  Even at its most expensive price ($18), it's a bargain for all-you-can-eat sushi, crab legs, whole crabs, shrimp cocktail...

They also have standard Chinese buffet fare (the sweet and sour chicken is great!) and even some American favorites like pizza, etc.

Although the sushi isn't quite as good as Tokyo Sushi Buffet, it is pretty good especially considering the variety this place offers.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The cream cheese puffs keep me a loyal customer - I wouldn't choose another cream cheese puff in my life. They limit you to 6 crab legs though, so if you want to come for those... don't."}

{"text":"Hokkaido is under new management and the new management is terrible! 

Food is not fresh and the items that people want to eat are not available or empty. 

If you are expecting crab legs, it is now limited to 1 pound per person... that includes the shell! Oh... management will stop by your table to .... not ask how everything was BUT to tell you your party has gone over the crab leg rations of 1 pound per person. 

Not worth it for the price you have to pay for dinner. 

Bring back the old management! Or drop prices and not call your establishment a seafood buffet."}

My only complaint is the kimchi-- it is a tad bland. But hey, the seafood rocks so I can let that go!!"}
{"text":"These other reviewers are CRAZY.... 

Average at best.  Sushi was good but the other food left something to be desired.  
Sushi rolls were more rice than anything.  Decent selection of sashimi.  

Went for dinner - $50 with drinks - not bad but as stated, the sushi was the only think worth going back for.  
They did have crab/crab legs that were good - how can you really screw up crab legs? 

I would recommend the spicy beef & teriyaki chicken sticks but didn't really like any of the other dishes. General Tsos Chicken tasted more like sweet and sour sauce with hot peppers thrown in.  

I will say that we went during the week at about 8:00 (2 hours before close).  Maybe they \"step-up their game\" during the weekend. 

Also - its not the cleanest place.  Tables were clean but the rest of the place could use a good scrub down.  I guess I may have expected too much from a buffet place.  

All that said - doubt I would go back."}
{"text":"19 dollars for a dinner buffet = 2 meal boxes from McDonalds. 

Sad to say, this is probably the best Asian buffet in the greater Pittsburgh area. There is a lot of quality seafood but what really got me down was the presentation which was like a lunch line in high school. The dessert section also put a damper on the whole buffet for me. I love, love a good dessert selection and on first glance it was impressive, a fondue fountain, strange fruits, flan.

The fondue fountain was gross, I have no idea what kind of chocolate they put in it but this couldn't count as chocolate.  The flan was way too sweet, I couldn't even stomach it...

The sushi selection was also really sad. Not enough variety and not enough quality."}
{"text":"They have a very extensive sushi selection which I very much enjoy along with delicious soups!  There is also some very interesting salads like wood ear mushroom that I'd never had before.  The staff seems attentive, but I definitely would recommend going during lunch hours where it's significantly cheaper with still a large seafood selection.  Also, a chocolate fountain! Heck to the yes, overall it's not an extensive dessert buffet, but the fountain is a for sure plus."}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided to stop by here after a movie at waterfront. 
There was so much food, and it was all pretty good--especially the dimsum dishes, and the chinese food. However the sushi had old rice, and fish that was not that fresh, and was weirdly watery.

However, the thing that really killed this place for me was the service. The waitresses were more concerned with flirting with regulars then helping. Literally, they stopped at every table around us to talk, chat within themselves, and basically socialize with everyone aside from us. And when our bill came, they circled our table awkwardly until we paid. We asked them to separate our check, and they only gave us one receipt. Plus they coerced me to pay for my friend's tip bill. The waitress literally wouldn't stop speaking to me in Chinese until I paid for my friend's tip, even though he was about to pay the tip in cash. Not that they really helped us...

Overall, the service just really killed it for me. We were nicely dressed college students, and the service and attitude towards us was so cold, and then straight up rude that I don't want to come back."}
{"text":"This place has dropped to a new low. After limiting crab legs to one pound per person, they are now limited to SEVEN PIECES per person. Please, stop calling your restaurant seafood buffet. The crab legs are one of the only few things that's worth eating at the place, most other dishes are as cheap as American Chinese food can get. The owner will probably respond to this review telling me crab legs are expensive and not to come back until price drops blah blah. Sir, don't say a thing. You're cheap and I will not come back."}
{"text":"YUMMYYYYY.  (imagine that spoken in a Cookie Monster type voice, and you can imagine the scope of the deliciousness to be found at Hokkaido).

My boyfriend and I drove past a sign that said \"Japanese Seafood Buffet\" on the way to the Waterfront, and we both immediately stopped conversing to note \"That sounds delicious....I want to go to there.\"  Coincidentally, our insurance agent mentioned Hokkaido as one of the best meals of his life, and we knew that it was our destiny.  Our delicious destiny.

We arrived at Hokkaido around 545 pm on a Saturday - super early and lame, I know, but we didn't want to have to wait for a table.  Plan worked - we were seated immediately and were in the buffet line in mere moments.  The buffet is arranged around two walls of the restaurant - it's very accessible, and easy to duck in and out to grab a quick nom of something without waiting in the whole line.  The first area is fruit/salad bar, which we mostly bypassed, except we grabbed some seaweed salad and calamari - also noted they had kimchi there as well.

Moving on, you hit some more standard Asian buffet classics, various Chinese entrees, and some more unique offerings.  I grabbed some sauteed scallops, Szechuan short rib, and then my eyes fell on the whole steamed crabs and the crab legs.  Not being in possession of the proper crab cracking tools, I went for the legs instead of the whole crab.  These are VERY popular, but they are constantly refilling the tray with fresh hot legs of nomminess, so don't worry - you'll get some.

Next is a Mongolian barbecue-esque area, where you pick your raw protein and vegetables and a dude stir fries it for you on a hot grill.  We skipped that, and the carving station next to him (couldn't see what type of meat it was).  Next is a baked/fried area filled with super-delicious looking things like egg rolls, seafood pancakes, shumai, and all kinds of awesome Japanese buns and sweets like red bean filled buns, taro buns, and sesame roll things. After that is a good-size sushi area, where sushi chefs work throughout the night to refill the platters as they empty.  There is also a small \"American section\" with boring looking pizza and corn and other lame things, and there's a dessert area too.

Most of what we had was deeeeeelicious!  Especially noteworthy are the crab legs, the red bean buns (which I became obsessed with after one bite), the shumai, and the ngiri sushi.  The rolls were all decent, some were falling apart a little bit, but the sashimi and ngiri were undoubtedly fresh.  Gorgeous cuts, fish was silky and fresh in the mouth - what more can you ask for from a SUSHI BUFFET?  I never expected sushi of this quality here - not saying it's the best I've ever had, but for $16.99 all you can eat sushi and crab legs and a million other things?  A STEAL, people.

We had a plate of hot food each, a plate of sushi each, then a pathetic attempt at dessert (small cheesecake piece, small other cake piece, another red bean bun) and then rolled ourselves home.  We had to eat everything on our plates because they will charge you $8 for uneaten food on your plate!  Not a risk we felt like taking, so load up your plates wisely!

And don't hurt anyone over those crab legs - they will bring more, I promise!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to an all you can eat sushi/sashimi dinner, but were seriously disappointed when we got to the restaurant. There were only about 10 sushi/sashimi options, and everything else were food selections from a typical chinese buffet. Having being spoiled by Sushi Palace and other all you can eat sushi establishments in New Jersey, Hokkaido was several levels below par. The clean plates at the counter were not completely clean, and looked like they were somewhat greasy. A few times, I even saw an employee push a garbage can full of trash past the buffet counter, and made everything look unappetizing after that. 

The crab legs were fresh and delicious, and the sushi was not bad, but I would just much rather go to somewhere else that is cleaner and with higher quality sushi than come back here."}
{"text":"Food is decent i will give them that much and lots of choices but it is expensive and they probably have the RUDEST staff of any buffet i have ever been to. The price for children is crazy considering my daughter barely eats and i have found a bug in my food the last time i was there. I informed the staff n she didnt care at all. Horrible horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I drove by this place the other week driving to the Waterfront (my first trip there). I'm not from Pittsburgh.  I checked it out on Yelp and decided to give it a shot.  Everyone's reviews were right on.   

There is a lot of high quality Sushi.  The Hibachi grill had a good selection of vegetables and meat.  This is the first one I have ever seen with Shark.  I was pleasantly surprised to find crab legs that weren't waterlogged (like many other buffets).  There were numerous shrimp dishes, crabs, oysters, frog legs, mussels, clams, calamari.  For non seafood people there was a decent number of chicken dishes. I don't recall seeing any beef or pork dishes.  They had several soups; I tried the clam chowder which was very disappointing.  

There was a carving station for beef - didn't see anyone going there.  Plenty of Asian  appetizers and a few American dishes (pizza) - which I didn't pay much attention to.  

The deserts consisted of a chocolate fountain with marshmallows, poor quality pineapple, stale rice crispy bars, bananas, and something I couldn't identify.  They did have fruit (melon, kiwi), jello, ice cream, rice pudding and the usual boxed cakes/cookies you see at Chinese Buffets. 

Servers were friendly and refilled drinks quickly.   $18 is a little pricey for a buffet but I wasn't upset paying it. Beware they charge $8 if you waste too much food.  I wonder if they have ever charged anyone that."}
{"text":"Servers and manger are very rude!
When the manager told me what beverage I wanted, and I said hot water, he looked surprised, and I'm pretty sure the hot water is cheaper there, and i think selling soda and stuff like that is how they made money, and the manager probably confused me with another people that orderrd hot water, because the server  talked to the manager for a bit, and then the manager said \"Were you the one that came here two days ago?\". And he said it angrily. I was angry by this because I was on vacation in Pittsburgh, and I didn't even live there! It was actually my first time coming to Hokkaido! If they recognize me, and if they're angry about it, why don't they keep it to themselves? 
I was very upset while eating my food.
I don't even think they deserve one star.
All the Sushi was dry and stinky also."}
{"text":"SETTING:
Clean and open space. Multiple tables to seat small or big parties. Quite expansive buffet that ran along the back wall of the restaurant.

FOOD:
Was in the area for lunch and had an Asian food hankering. All I knew was 1) Me hangry, and, 2) Want something Asian, but didn't have a specific asian cuisine in mind. After zero thought process, I decided to go for the shotgun approach. Asian lunch buffet, I'm coming for ya.

There was a little bit of everything at Hokkaido. It's not a Japanese buffet as the name may seem to suggest. It was a pan-Asian buffet that served sushi, seafood, dim sum, noodles, meat, dessert. We all know that a buffet is usually quantity over quality. So no particular knock on Hokkaido, but I got what I expected: a sampling of your typical Westernized Asian fare. Don't expect anything fancy or traditional, this is a buffet...you get the Westernized \"favorites\" (ie: california roll, general tso's, chow mein, etc). Oh, and if you need some good 'ol traditional American delicacies to add to the mix, you can pick up some pizza, soup, and salad.

For buffet standards, the sushi was decent (I was scared to try the raw fish because I wasn't sure how fresh it was...that's just me). Seafood was fine (mussels, squid, etc). Not the freshest, but tasty enough. Chinese food was what you would expect from a fast food Chinese joint. It was one of those days where I just wanted to stuff my face with all kinds of asian food and wasn't so picky, so I was satisfied--minus the grease stain I left on my shirt.  

SERVICE:
Minimal but attentive, which is what I would expect at a buffet because you help yourself. They take away your old plates and refill your drinks quickly.  

IMPRESSIONS:
I left Hokkaido with one hand over my stomach from over-eating (3 plates in 30 minutes! Ugh!), and another hand holding a slightly stale creampuff. I probably muttered something the lines of \"never again,\" but that's too bold of a statement to be of any value. But $10 for a lunch buffet...now that's value, even if it is Westernized Asian food."}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet.  They have some sashimi sushi and a lot of nigiri which is rare.  The quality isn't great, but what can you expect from all you can eat?  At dinner they have crab legs, but again, the quality is only so so.  I like to stop here to stuff my face when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I was a huge fan of their menu and was very excited about the large amount of sushi options they offered. A pan-asian buffet was all I could ever dream of! I had been to both lunch and dinner here and never had to wait for a table and always had very attentive service, even if it is a bit loud and crowded at certain times.

That was all until sometime in January when I went with a friend. We were both excited because we liked the food so much from previous visits. We went during peak dining hours (8pm on a Saturday night) and the place was packed. We didnt mind and went about our usual routine. We both noticed that the food wasn't up to the usual standards but barreled through it, wary of the infamous fee one is charged ($8) for wasting food. 

When we got to the sushi, it was WAY off. Typically they have very fresh fish, but that night it had a bad aftertaste and texture as if it had been sitting out all day. Fish, ESPECIALLY raw fish, is one thing I refuse to compromise quality on. I didn't finish my plate and neither did my friend. Our server came and cleared away plates but deliberately left the sushi one on the table, though it was clear we were finished with it. Our server asked what was wrong and we told her the sushi tasted bad like something was wrong with it and almost immediately the whole feel of the dinner changed. We went back for seconds, our server cleared our plates and still left the sushi. 

Our check was delivered to our table by the manager who was extremely accusatory about us wasting food. No lie, her exact words were \"This is all you can eat, not all you can leave on your plate.\" After a baffled exchange at the piss poor way we were treated and pretty much berated by the manager for refusing to eat their gross sushi in front of the entire dining room, we hurriedly paid the check and left.

 If you've ever been to this place, you know how ginormous the restaurant is and believe me when I say that just about every table was filled to the brim with paying customers. Why this woman was on a mission to collect a measly $8 for something that wasn't exactly our fault is beyond me. I understand their concerns about food waste, but quite honestly that is the risk you run when you open a buffet. It's not like we had 5 plates full of sushi left or anything. Needless to say, I won't be back. Shame because I used to really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day and enjoyed myself! The food was delicious; but don't expect it to be 5 star. It's a seafood buffet. The only issue I had was the little sign on the table that said I'd be charged an additional $10 if i left any scrapes on my plate. It made me worry if the seaweed bits I left would result in a charge, etc. I do not think it's good customer service to charge for 'waste' when it's the customers food to eat or not eat. Just raise your prices by $10 if there's enough of that going on."}
{"text":"Hokkaido just opened on Browns Hill Road. 

We really liked the food here.  The variety is nice and the deserts are way better then the usual fair at seafood/sushi buffets.  The Sushi was good but not a lot of selection.

We do plan to go back and would recommend it to a friend.

Prices are reasonable for this type of place.
8/per person weekday lunch
16/per person Dinner and Sunday all day
13/ Saturday Brunch."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero star but its not possible on this app. The food is not that great i'd advise you to go to a real seafood restaurant with quality seafood. The service was terrible while I was eating two of the host were literally staring at my friends and I, making the experience really uncomfortable. It got to a point where we had to ask the host to stop staring at us while we ate, then she went on to say \"I don't understand\". worst place every! plus there is a sign on the table we later noticed that said if you do not finish your food they will charge 8$  per plate to your bill! crazy right! But if you don't believe me go ahead and pay to have people stare at you while you eat over priced \"seafood\" garbage."}
{"text":"Super Deal!

Went for lunch for the first time yesterday, after having gone for Sunday dinner one time. My lunch tab was roughly half of dinner or around $10-11 depending on beverage and tip.

Selections were similar to dinner except no Peking Duck, crab legs, grilled eel sushi, and only Red Snapper in sashimi form (tuna and salmon available in Sushi form). 

The cold section amusingly labels crawfish as mini-lobsters and also had duck wings and pig ear. Still love their hot and sour soup and wish I found gravy for the mashed potatoes.

Service is good and parking plentiful. Certain to become a regular lunch spot for me while I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our meal here.  The sushi is good for being buffet sushi.  Everything else is pretty good too.  They do a nice job of keeping the crab legs replenished and the crab legs are good quality."}
{"text":"When my husband and I decided to go to Hokkaido, we didn't have high expectations as most buffets tend to disappoint. We were pleasantly surprised and had a really great meal. We got there around 5 so it wasn't very busy yet. The interior was trendy and clean for the most part- a few booths looked a bit tattered, but we got a nice one right near the crab legs. We dug in immediately trying little bites of absolutely everything. I thoroughly enjoyed most of my choices- everything was very fresh and full of flavor. I tried a few items that just didn't taste good, but they were either too spicy or not something I would normally eat. However, I tried the octopus salad and the tako sushi and loved them both. $17 dollars is a decent price, but keep in mind you're still eating at an Asian buffet. It's not fancy and it's not mind blowing. We definitely be going again, but we'll go early for lunch."}
{"text":"Best buffet I have ever been to except in Chicago or California and then it was very expensive. Great variety.  A chance to expand your horizons with food!"}
{"text":"I went into the place really excited to try it as I had been looking for a good selection of sushi and Asian food. I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but I was disappointed in the sushi quality. They had a good variety, most of the sushi was plain and there were a few good rolls. The sashimi was good quality. 

The Chinese steamed buns were delicious. There was a peach one that had a great flavor. They had the tradition orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, coconut shrimp, etc. all of this was good. They also had a Mongolian grill. 

Overall this place was worth going to for the variety of food. There's something for everyone, even if you don't like seafood and or Asian food. The place was decorated nice on the inside and plenty of room. The price is $18.99 for the buffet, a little steep, but worth trying at least once. No picture because I put so much good food on my plate that it didn't look appetizing :)"}
{"text":"The crab legs, the fish and seafood was awesome. Fresh and delicious. However; all other food ain't good. The price is a bit higher than other Chinese buffet . If you only come here for seafood, go for it. But if you here for all other food , you'll need to think twice."}
{"text":"Intense variety, most everything is quite tasty. Well worth it."}
{"text":"The food is decent, especially the sushi, but the staff is TERRIBLE. My friends from work and I went to dinner here together. We had previously researched the menu and prices via the mobile website. The website advertised Monday - Thursday $16.99 dinner buffet. Not only did the manager/waitress say we were wrong about the advertised price, but the manager continued to say that the price did not come up as $16.99 on her phone, when my friend opted to show the manager the price on the website we were referring to. We ended up being charged $17.99 each. ALSO, when it came time for the checks, the waitress, Joyce, stood around while each of us signed our receipts, and went around and checked each of our receipts (all 7 of us) to see how much we tipped. If she noticed someone did not add a tip on their receipt (most of us were planning on using cash) she commented that that price of the buffet did not include the tip. Then, she collected our receipts and stood at the table next to us for about 5 or so minutes to wait and see who was putting cash down. She was huffing and putting the whole time. Terribly rude."}
{"text":"Wow! There is a reason this is rated highly. Great food, the sushi was awesome, the hibachi was good and the ice cream was as well. I took a friend of mine out and although he isn't a fan of sushi he had a great time enjoying new flavors. The selection is more than your average hibachi buffet. I will say that there is a language barrier from the staff and they are on top of you to pick your plate up and refill your cup. When you need it having them quickly respond is great but there are points where it was a little much. Other than that I was very impressed with the cleanliness and quality. If you haven't tried it yet you should."}
{"text":"3.5 - In terms of buffet food, this place is perfectly average in taste, although the lunch buffet is worth the $9.99 IMO. There is enough variety to fill several plates, even for someone like me who uses precision to take literally one bite's worth of everything. As someone who loves salmon sashimi though, the lack of subtle flavor - or any flavor, really - in it was a bit disappointing. The ones in the \"salmon and avocado roll\" tasted great though, and the other rolls were interesting as well. The \"stuffed mushrooms\" had what looked like a biscuit as part of it, but turned out to have an odd, cheesy foam taste. The mini cakes were mostly dry and tasteless, but the egg pudding and coconut tapioca pudding were good.

Service was great, with all plates quickly cleared."}
{"text":"I really liked it.  It gets 5 stars for variety and atmosphere, and 4.5 for yum factor.

I ate: a variety of quality sushi, awesome hot & sour soup, a sampling of of standard asian buffet fare and a heap of crab legs.  There was also a bar where you could fill your plate with raw meat and veggies and have a chef cook it for you as well as some old fashioned real ice cream and fruit and salad bars.

Oh, and chicken feet.  And pig ears.  Pretty bizarre (and not for me), but I appreciate that those items were available.  How many buffets have chicken feet?

Definitely got my money's worth on the crab legs and sushi."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Hokkaido pretty regularly for the past 3 years, but I'm always reluctant to go. The service here is limited, coming around to clear plates, refill drinks, and deal with the bill. The food here is way below average and the quality control here is fairly poor. Some \"hot\" food I get, especially the chicken, is usually hot on the outside and raw on the inside. The seafood options here aren't standouts either. Most of it is low-quality and no one bothers to really debone the salmon - two things I really wish they'd change but don't. Personally, I would only say to come here if you want to play Russian roulette with your stomach. I've gotten food poisoning from here a couple times in the past few months, so I'm staying away as far as possible."}
{"text":"Great selection. Their spicy oil fish and crab legs are my favorite. The spicy mango salad is nice and fresh too. I go here all the time"}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch.  Service was good.  After we finished our plate someone was by to take it so we could get a clean plate for our next round.  Many have describe the food that is available but you do have to walk the whole line to figure out what you want to try.  Lot of Asian and Sushi, Salad Bar, Soups.  Tried some of the Asian and found most to be hot and OK.  Tried a couple of types of chicken and shrimp and the chicken was not so good, a little on the tough side while most of the shrimp was good except the coconut that was overly breaded and covered with a overly sweet sauce.  The Sushi was good.  Many different kinds and not to bad but the spicy tuna needed a little more spice and tuna.  Did not get to the desert bar but many did and it looked pretty interesting."}
{"text":"4 stars for service, buffet variety and re-supplying
3 stars for the food. 

Everything was just too sauced and/or fried for my taste. I don't think I ate $20 worth of steamed buns and stir-fried green beans.
 
My 21 year old son however, ate his own weight in crab legs and sushi and was more than satisfied.

btw, I forgot to ask about MSG, but I have to guess that it was not used since I did not get a reaction. Thank goodness for that :)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I have eaten jail food before, that being said it really speaks volumes when I say Hokaidoo was the worst food I have ever eaten!. All of the food lacked any kind of taste. Many of the dishes were extremely stale. I got jealous of a man who demanded a refund and left with his children. I would have done the same if my girlfriend wouldnt have disemboweled me and serve my entrails on the buffet next to the salted chicken feet. If you are thinking about eating here then consider that a cry for help and go talk to a professional. This place is a dump."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the type of food that is served here, and I won't hold that against them. It isn't their fault that I have the tastebuds of a child. 

What I dislike about this buffet is that they are severely overpriced and have the nerve to charge people for throwing away certain amounts of food. 

God forbid you leave scraps on your plate."}
{"text":"Excellent place for all you can eat sushi, seafood and other good eats. Their fish is fresh.  Their hot foods are pretty tasty.  I especially love that they have roast duck.  The quality and variety has never let me down. What more can you ask for in a buffet?"}
{"text":"Went there on Valentines day only to be welcomed by a guy reiterating the price is 4 dollars a plate more because of specials in the buffet. Pretty stupid considering the price was plain as day marked. The food was underwhelming considering it was supposed to be better???  I'm trying to convince my girlfriend to give this place up because the price per person compared to what's good is heading in the wrong direction. Every time I go to the meat bar hoping for some prime rib there never is any and it's never replenished during the whole stay. I'm convinced it's filled one time every four hours for them to save a few bucks on cost. And this time, the shrimp wasn't even peeled and deveined like it is every other time we've went. So what turns into a special day was taken by the restaurant management to mean just get the food out."}
{"text":"I was recently asked about my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. There's a solid chance this one takes the prize. Hokkaido cannot be considered buffet if it limits the amount of crab legs I can consume. 

The oysters were putrid and I don't know how I mustered the courage to overcome my instincts. I wish that same visceral courage could've overcome the food poisoning that ensued. 

Hokkaido is considered one of the worst buffet chains where I'm from and have always avoided it. Unfortunately, now that I'm here, sometimes I get stupid and desperate and end up at places like this. 

Just keep driving, go to Costco, and make your own seafood. This place is simply not worth it."}
{"text":"We went back recently for lunch. It was terrible. The cold dish ( black ears) already went bad and they still served it. The fruit was not refresh either. Not sure what happened since we visited last time. It was the worst buffet experience that we had ever."}
{"text":"Now with chocolate fountain! Ok, I'm a sucker for chocolate fountains. If my blood sugar allowed, I could eat my entire buffet in chocolate fountain. 

This place is actually pretty great for the price and has gotten even better over the last year or so.

I'm not a big fan of the sushi, but my daughter thinks it's great so we save big money versus going to Plum. (I think the sushi rice tastes weird and has a strange consistency, and the fish is really fishy.) For the most part, I like everything else--typical Chinese food--especially the hibachi bar. Love the fresh and made-to-order bar! Don't expect much for the salad bar portion. It's just some ripped up iceberg lettuce...although they do have giant peel-and-eat shrimp and whole Maryland crabs.

The service is excellent. Very friendly and attentive.

All in all, it's a mix of really good and fairly eh. Pick the \"good\" items, and you'll be really pleased."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of Hokkaido. Yes, like every buffet, there are some less than appealing choices - but that just means there's something for everyone. The restaurant itself is very clean; and, the servers are attentive and friendly. The next time we go, I'm definitely going to try the add-on cost of being able to take a box of food home because it's always impossible to get my eyes and my stomach to agree on an acceptable amount of food! As long as Hokkaido Seafood Buffet keeps cooking up a plethora of fresh, delicious food, I will keeping coming back."}
{"text":"I do love a GOOD buffet, and quite frankly, around here 'good' is the keyword that is usually missing.  Pittsburgh has plenty of troughs called buffets, and for one price, stuffing yourself silly makes the low quality generally overlookable.  

By far, the BEST Asian buffet in da burgh is indeed Hokkaido.

At first glance, the menu board lists a price that makes you say 'this had better be worth it!', but once you get inside and experience the magnitude of the offerings, from the usual blase to some more unusual dishes, and you load your plate up again and again with tasty treats, you realize 'Yeah, it was worth it!'

First they have a salad section. You can have a simple salad to sate the 'inside the box' eaters, or you can have a woodear salad for the more adventurous. There's kimchee, squid salad and even marinated spicy chicken feet.  

Slide over a bin, and you have the peel and eat shrimp, crawdads and other such goodies.  

One more to the left begins the hot foods that are more akin to the general offerings at a Chinese buffet, like General Tsaos Chicken, Sprite Beef, rice noodles and stir fried rice, Rose Chicken, Frog Legs, and a variety of other hot dishes and stir fries.

Now we're in the corner where the line tends to clog over the crab legs.  I don't get that one personally.  SO much work for so little food, but the line for the crab legs is always a pain - but hey, squeeze by them, avoid the flying crackers, and now you're at the soup station.  Clam Chowder, Hot and Sour, Egg Drop, Wonton...they're all there.

Just to your left now is the 'do it yourself mixins' bin, next to the Hibachi grill.  Here, you pick the goodies you'd like, hand them to the cute little Latino behind the grill, and he hops and chops and grill your desired ingredients into a hot steaming mess of yum.

One more step to the left, and you reach the heat lamps keeping the 'total inside the box' eaters goods warm...polish sausage and a roast beef or pork.  

Once again, step to the left, and you've got the appetizers bin.  Crab Rangoon, pot stickers, chicken-on-a-stick, stuffed mushrooms, quesadillas, fried shrimp, stuffed crab shells, sesame buns, and even pizza for the 'Ewww, I don't like that other stuff' people.

After you put your first three plates down on the table, return to this same spot, shuffle to the left, and you're at the Sushi station. Oodles of varieties of little rice balls with raw and cooked goodies stuffed in the middle, with all of the sauces to make your tongue screech with heat, or tingle with salt. 

Chew, rinse and repeat.  It's a buffet.  

Finally, just before the hallway to the bathroom, all the way down at the end, is the dessert station. Cakes, fresh fruit and a chocolate fountain, ice creams, and dessert fungus and lychees,

Their soda products are COKE (hooray!), but they also have brewed iced tea, the hot green teas and regular teas.  

The staff of 'waitresses' are more like glorified bus persons (they have very few cute Asian guys on the floor - they're mostly in the back doing the stir-frying), but they do keep your glasses full and empty plates scooped away.

I've eaten here many times, and I'm always impressed by the amount of Asian people eating here. You will also see more than a 'few' people who obviously eat here regularly - and they're a good reminder that this is something to do 'once in a while'.

I have never been disappointed. The food is always fresh, and very flavorful, and there is a little something for everyone - all tastes can be sated.

The funniest thing I ever experienced at Hokkaido happened before the strip mall was even completely built. On the outside of the building was a HUGE vinyl banner proclaiming (and indeed, I quote): \"COMING SOON - JUMBO SEAFOOD BUFFEET\"

Fortunately, their lack of a proofreader was NOT an omen of things to come.  Hokkaido does everything else right."}
{"text":"I love buffets. Period. The only downside to my dinner visit was that I was already sort of full from a late lunch, which meant I couldn't fit much into my belly :( Sad, I know.

So my bf and I came here Friday night for dinner and it was pretty crowded. Not too too crowded where you have to wait your turn to get food or when the food runs out and you have to wait for it to be replaced. I've been to the Hokkaido in Long Beach, CA and this was pretty similar to that one. They had a pretty good selection of sushi and sashimi (salmon, octopus, and something else I forget). There was lots of steamed crab legs that never ran out and some pretty (unusually) huge cooked clams. See my photo. They were huge! The food was good and the buffet was clean. However, the service was spectacular! The waitresses were extremely nice and always had a smile on their face, which was a pleasant change from the typical Asian buffets where the waitresses seam to dislike taking the plates off your table.

Dessert selection okay. I did like how they had about 8 different ice cream self-serve flavors. The other desserts didn't really stand out to me. The only downside to the dessert section was the chocolate fountain. The bottom level... um... seemed murky (kinda like the dirty water that gets caught in the side of a lake) and definitely needed to be changed. Let's just say I did not touch that chocolate fountain.

Other than that, I had a good dinner. Only wished I could fit more in my stomach :)"}
{"text":"This isn't my first time here, but this time, very disappointed. Food was only fair, shrimp was mushy,
Beef tough, food looked dry, but the biggest irritant was how fast they wanted us OUT!  After our second plate of food , they brought the bill. Then they came back for the credit card. We were not done! Then as I was attempting to finish my ice tea, to my left, a server was standing there obviously waiting for us to leave, so they could clear the table. The place was virtually empty! Will not return. It's obvious they don't want people returning to the buffet too often. Trust me, the food isn't worth too mant trips and the service is worse."}
{"text":"What a fun buffet- lots of non traditional food items here. My friends and I got a kick out of the fried chicken feet LOL
Their selection of sushi is by far the largest I've ever seen on a Chinese buffet. Wonderful place to try if you want to experience some new things!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner before a show at the Carnegie Music Hall at Homestead and it was the perfect start to a wonderful evening. We both enjoyed the variety of sushi. Everything we ate tasted fresh, and was well flavored, which is not an easy balance for buffet style service. 

And yes, while technically a \"chain\" restaurant it's nice to have an option besides the franchises at the Waterfront in this part of town. I also appreciate the signs on the table warning against wasting food and asking patrons to only take as much as they will eat. It was a subtle reminder that just because this is an \"All You Can Eat\" establishment, it's not a challenge. Take as much as you want, but don't be wasteful--important message!"}
{"text":"Not bad, more selection of sushi, they also have chicken feet, chinese bun(red bean) and siu mai and at the salad section  kimchi, octopus and shrimp mango italian salad .  $18 for dinner. But if you wanna go cheaper go to fortune star instead since its the same typical chinese buffet."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of buffets but this place is so good! Better than any buffet I have ever been to! Each time I am in Pitt i have to go by there & grab a bite!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this place a few nights ago.  I was VERY excited to try it out after reading all the reviews.  I didnt try the sushi at all but I did see it on the buffet.  I got hibatchi and crablegs.  I must say the butter tasted like popcorn butter...ewww!  But none the less they had TONS of variety!  They did have JUMBO shirp coctail that was devained on the buffet.  I think that was awesome!   hibatchi was OKAY.  It was no nakama thats for sure but its part of a buffet!  I think for the $$$ its WELL worth it!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent place however me and my friends were kicked out at 1045 after they closed not letting us finish our food..."}
{"text":"If I could eat at Hokkaido everyday for the rest of my life, (aside from being morbidly obese) I would be the happiest girl in the world. Hokkaido does Chinese buffets right and honestly, it's the best I've found in Pittsburgh. The price is on par with most buffets in the area, but I try to catch their lower lunch prices (about $10) whenever possible. 

As a vegetarian, this place is a gold mine. Probably one of the only Chinese buffets that have such a wide selection of vegetarian entrees and even tofu. I'm also obsessed with their sushi layout. For the vegheads, they usually have a veggie roll along with tamago sushi and tofu pockets. Why pay $3 for each at other sushi places when I can come here and pound 50 of them in one sitting? 

Customer service has always been friendly and efficient. Basically, you blink and your dirty plates are gone. 

Thank you Hokkaido for being one of the few Chinese buffets that doesn't give me food poisoning afterwards. I will be back for much more - more than I'll be proud to admit."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. A variety of different foods. And it also suits those who don't eat seafood. I recommend the hibachi grill. You hand them a plate of fresh ingredients and they wok it up. It's about 8 and change for lunch buffet. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"They have a little bit for everyone, from seafood to frog leg to crab legs to fresh made to over stirfry. Sushi is pretty good an a lot of vegetarian meals. Traditional oriental entrees and so american favorites like pizza or sausage."}
{"text":"This was a fun place! The buffet had a lot to offer. They don't have very good sushi and I couldn't wrap my head around all of it sitting out for a long period of them, but everything else was great! There was just about any item you could find at a Chinese restaurant on buffet and there was also a hibachi which was cool. You are only asked to take what you'll eat and you'll be charged extra for tossing food which is an amazing idea! We are all too wasteful in general. The pricing was a little deceptive. They asked what we would like to drink assuming it was included in the buffet, but it was not. So expect another $3/drink."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese buffet and always makes my husband happy since he can get his sushi fix since I don't eat the stuff. 

I am a big fan of the snow crab legs (dinner only), Mongolian BBQ, crab rangoon, spare ribs (they have these only once and a while) and fried shrimp.  They have a few different chicken dish options that are alright also.

There is also a pretty large sushi selection though I don't eat it my husband is a fan and says that the quality is pretty good. 

Their dessert selection is pretty good with at least five flavors of hard scoopable ice cream, cheesecake, puddings, jello, flan like custard, and recently a chocolate fountain with fresh fruit and rice crispy treats for dipping. 

Overall this is not a place to look for a gourmet meal, but if you are in the mood for some crabs legs and some decent sushi it will definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Quite a lot of food, mostly the standard buffet fare but with a few less commonly found items on. They're a larger and pricier buffet than average. They have a number stations, so you'd probably find something you will at least be ok with."}
{"text":"Since I come from the land of Chinese buffets, Erie, PA I know a thing or two about them. Erie has a Chinese buffet per person, I swear! I came to the burgh in 2000 and couldn't for the life of me find a decent Chinese buffet! They were all pretty disgusting. I was so excited when I saw they were opening up a new one at the Waterfront. Party because it will make my weekly trips to Target that much better! 

I should say that it's not only a Chinese buffet, but also serves sushi as well! I wouldn't say it's the best sushi I've ever had, but you watch them making it in front of you, so you at least know it's fresh. I look for very certain things in my Chinese buffets, which I think you all should. Cleanliness, fresh looking and selection. I feel like they have it all. They have a large selection of sushi, fried food (who doesn't love cheese wonton's!) and traditional Chinese. They also have a Mongolian BBQ where you can make your own plate of raw food an they cook it in front of you. It's pretty tasty, and I try to convince myself that's the healthy way to go (even though I know it's not!). 

The buffet is pricey at $18 but you can catch the lunch specials, which is around $10. And totally unrelated to Chinese, they have this cotton candy ice cream that is beyond amazing! Look for the rainbow looking one! Delish!"}
{"text":"Beware of food poisoning!!!! It's no joke! My husband and I got very sick. The place has gone down hill and is very overpriced, and dirty. They have signs everywhere telling people they are only allowed a certain amount of crab legs, which is very tacky and they don't even have any out most of the time! And when they do have crab legs , they are so small and smell like they are rotten (crab legs are my favorite and the ones they put out are disgusting, they should be embarrassed ) and what about the people who don't eat crab legs (either because there aren't any available or don't like them? ) They still get charged like $20 a person for a Chinese buffet. They are ripping people off! It's ridiculous. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Oh boy...this place. I feel like every time I eat here I have to train for it. I always go with the same crew and we always plan to come here at least a day in advance in order to keep our bellies at bay until we dive into the buffet. So far, every time I've come here, there's been no wait and the buffet lines were short, if there was any at all. Seafood was the freshest I've ever had in the Pittsburgh area and trust me, I took advantage of every piece of seafood they have. Hokkaido houses an impressive amount of food ranging from New York steak to fresh crab legs and oysters. I would avoid the steak though, it looks a bit tough and shriveled as does the Peking duck. I do however, recommend their crab legs and octopus covered in a tasty sriracha sauce in addition to their coffee ice cream. 

As for ambience, it's well lit and clean. Music choices can be a bit confusing, but I always find that to be an excellent conversational point. One thing that does irk me about this place is the waitstaff. They constantly hover around the tables, snatching plates and glasses away from you. Especially when it comes to receiving the check, I always feel like I'm being rushed out of the place...but don't think I'll rush out, it's all you can eat and I intend to eat all that I can! 

Bottom line: For $17.99, you can eat anything and everything here. I highly recommend this buffet, it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"You're definitely here for the quantity and not quality. The variety is pretty great, but if you want good quality food, this isn't the place to go. I wish they made better sushi. They are just so sub-par. I'm not complaining much about the Chinese food buffet section, however. The large amount selection is certainly nice here. 

Definitely not a first date type of place because it's so open. It's more like a mid-relationship-fairly-comfortable-with-each-other type of lunch/dinner place. I have to remind myself to not eat until I am wide enough to not pass between the aisles. That would be embarrassing."}
{"text":"So admittedly, I'm biased.  I love asian food, seafood, and big eating, so I'm naturally inclined to like asian buffets. That said, I think that Hokkaido is by far the best asian buffet in Pittsburgh.  There's 2 things a buffet can offer.  Quantity and quality.

With a full range of over 100 different options including a wide japanese sushi selection, crab legs, tons of great standard Chinese dishes like general tsos and chicken with broccoli and tasty desserts, their selection is as far reaching and as any buffet I've ever seen.  The food is quickly cycled through so it's always reasonably fresh, and the entire restaurant is always immaculately clean, well maintained and fairly stylish.

So they have quantity, but hows the quality?  Basically, it's all tasty and definitely as good as you can possibly expect for the price.  It's not the same gourmet dishes you might get at a high end gourmet restaurants like Little Tokyo in Mt Washington, Jimmy Wans in Fox Chapel, or Umi in Shadyside, but it also doesn't carry their high price tags or limited portions either.  Hokkaido is an AMAZING value, and if after pumping iron in the gym I want to get my protein fix, this is a fun place to make that happen.  Come hungry.  You'll leave full and happy :)"}
{"text":"It is a buffet.  For all intent and purposes, it is a satisfying buffet place.  Don't know why so many reviewers have so much spite.  Lets go back... it is a buffet!  They don't even hide this fact.  It even says it on its name.  Dreamers will be dreamers."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I'm typically a pretty harsh reviewer when it comes to buffets since to me buffet quality food is synonymous to takeout quality, and why would someone dine out to just have takeout?  Also, for the same cost and time spent at a buffet one can go to a much better restaurant with better tasting and quality food.  With that in mind, I have to say Hokkaido isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.

So here's what I have to recommend:

1.  Go for lunch.  Only go for lunch.  At $8.99, it's probably one of the cheapest if not the cheapest buffet out there.  If you're shelling out over $20 for dinner including drinks, why not just go to a Chinese restaurant w/ a nicer ambiance and better quality food like China Palace?

2.  Go early.  I've been there once around 12:30 and once around 2:30 PM and there's a giant difference in the quality of the food.  Get there either before or during the lunch rush.  They have adequate seating and it's not like you'll be waiting... it IS a buffet.  Food will be coming out a lot faster and everything will be fresher.

3.  Stick w/ salmon nigiri.  If you're here for the sushi, their rolls just don't cut it, and their salmon nigiri is probably the only thing worth eating.  Their other options aren't really passable.

4.  Get their dim sum.  If you're going when they're busy, fresh handmade dim sum is being made all the time.  And where in Pittsburgh can you get non-frozen sui mei?  I also like their pork buns (only if they're freshly made of course).

5.  Avoid the usual suspects.  You know what fried rice tastes like.  You know what lo mein tastes like.  You know what chicken teriyaki and General Tso's tastes like.  You know it's all loaded with excessive MSG and you'll have cotton mouth while feeling like crap later.

6.  Do try their Mongolian BBQ / Teppanyaki.  The chef actually knows what he's doing and cooks kinda okay.  If you're new to Mongolian BBQ, it might be daunting, but after a while you should be able to figure out what sauce combinations taste good.  The chef can make a sauce for you, but I don't like my dishes as salty as your average patron.

I find myself eating their salmon nigiri, their dim sum, their beef brisket soup, and their \"szechuan-style\" pork.  I also get some veggies, be it baby bok choi, green beans, or broccoli for the sole reason of pretending to be healthy.  I stay clear of all their other sushi, their, pizza, sausage, pork loin, and random Americanized Chinese.

A quick nigiri fix with some handmade dim sum in Pittsburgh for 11 bucks seems pretty good for me."}
{"text":"This place is great to get stuffed with a lot of different types of Asian food. The quality is decent, but definitely not top notch. However, given the price ($17 per person, and that includes your non-alcoholic drinks and dessert), I think it is very reasonable. Staff are attentive and courteous. There is also a section of food for those not liking Asian food - fried chicken, pizza, etc, a hibachi type area where you choose your meats and veggies to be stir fried, and sushi. The sushi/sashimi is decent - and some I can tell were frozen, but still good. Hey, it is a buffet after all, and it will be tons cheaper if you fill up on sushi here. There are also typical chinese dishes like lo mein and such, and a few more exotic things like kim-chi and chicken feet. Overall, a fun and clean buffet, in a very nice atmosphere."}
