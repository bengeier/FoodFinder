{"text":"This pizza spot came HIGHLY recommended by several friends and we finally got a chance to taste the awesomeness! Stuffed crust with sauce that is not too sweet and not too bitter, pepperoni and mushroom was a GREAT combo! Cash only and sooooo worth it!"}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here 3 times in the last 2 years...Every time i try it's closed?  Like today, a random March Friday 3 pm.  It was closed?  Do they take a lot of vacations?  I've heard good things though."}
{"text":"The best deep dish pizza in pgh the other food is great too the owners know you by name been eating there for 30 years"}
{"text":"Well worth the detour (and if it's not a detour, you're already a regular and surely not reading this review). Getting there is much more of a hurdle than the menu prices. I can't remember how much it is per slice (there's no website), but for what you're getting it's effectively free. I've only had the square cut on several visits. I don't know what else is on the menu but it's too good for me to consider branching out. Whether it's the cook method or preparation, whatever they're doing yields a super fluffy crust that's one of my favorites anywhere. Not a hip pizza joint by any means, but the owners could not be nicer and, dollar for dollar, it's hard to do better."}
{"text":"This Mom & Pop Pizza shop sets the bar high!  When you pick up your order you automatically know you are getting a quality product!  The smell is intoxicating...the toppings are abundant and when you finally get to have that first bite.... you are in Pizza heaven!!!!    My one and only disappointment is that their hours do not extend into the lunch hour!!  They would make a fortune if they did!   My workplace would be a frequent shopper for sure!!!!    The best Pizza in the Burgh!!!!!"}
{"text":"No doubt one of the best sicilian pizza slices in the burg!!   Best by the slice.  I have yet to try the hoagies but hear they are good.   They do not deliver.. take out only and CASH only!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the planet. Homemade everything. Excellent quality food. Pizza is amazing . If anyone wants true Italian food,  you have to try this places. Hours are odd, but if you make it in. Oh boy, get ready for the best food experience f your life. You are welcome!"}
{"text":"This was a Good place to get pizza.  As far as I know they are No Longer Open at this Location."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in McKee's Rocks. Mom and pop shop.  It's just a little shed located across from the dollar general.  The pizza is amazing!  The old lady answers the phone and takes care of the money.  The old man makes the pizzas.  You don't need extra toppings because they give you plenty of fresh ingredients. A large pizza will feed a family of 4 even 5.  The crust is dusty and crunchy.  The sauce is one of a kind.  It's CASH only so make sure you stop at the bank before you get there.  Oh and they don't deliver either.  Like I said it's a mom and pop shop of two employees only.    In fact I'm ordering a pie tonight.  Ps it's great the next day in the oven."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian sub in America!

Pizzas are always HOT and fresh and cooked exactly how I like them. Homemade, delicious red sauce and super fresh toppings. 

Anytime I have family from out of town over we always order from here and everyone is highly impressed! 

Classic Italian food!"}
{"text":"This place is great.. I've had a lot of pizza pie in my life and this by far is the best.. although a little pricey, you get what you pay for ..
      A little Ã³l pie shop in the Rocks that is family run here for 42 years.. everything hand made.., every time I've been there it's outstanding and gratifying... Don't forget cash... NO CARD..."}
{"text":"I may be a little biased here based on the fact that I've been eating at this place since... I was born.  With that said, I've eaten pizza all over the USA and this is still my absolute favorite place to order Pizza from.  When I come home to Pittsburgh for a visit ordering from Pasquarelli's is a MUST!   It is a true mom and pop pizza dive.  The owners are really nice and man can they cook.  The Pizza is unique.  Handmade dough, homemade sauce, tasty cheese, you name it.  I love this place!

If you order here please don't stop at Pizza!  I've never had a meatball that is better than Mrs. P's meatballs.  They are so good that I don't compare other meatballs to them because it isn't fair to the other cooks.  The Steak Hoagie is also one of my favorites.  This place isn't cheap but this is real handmade food!  If you want cheap pizza go to pizza hut."}
{"text":"So bittersweet that I finally tried this pizza.  Bitter because it is the furthest thing from good for my girlish figure....sweet because it is AWESOME!!!!  I tried the sicilian...yum!! Both crunchy and chewy crust. Perfect sauce. Toppings were great as well (although canned mushrooms). Hot sausage is whole discs. I will be back for sure.  This is authentic italian and no frills. Looking forward to trying the gnocchi."}
{"text":"Moved into a new neighborhood, get to try some new pies :D
Pasquarelli's Pizza House jumped off of the page as the place to try. Yes, on name alone, haha. After being told that they don't deliver to me and then that they do, the actual order took place. No, you can't get double or extra pepperoni(-1 the pizza is not that good that they can dictate what you want on it) or extra cheese. No, you can't get a menu and no we are out of Hot Sausage. Too many \"no's\" to me. No, we don't have Coke or Pepsi. No, we don't have bottles.(-1 for all the \"No's\")
Large Pie with Pepperoni and Ham
2 cans of Mountain Dew 
$19.18, seemed a little expensive compared to prices on Mt Wash, where this would have been $14-$16, no mas. (-1)
The delivery occurred ahead of the stated 45 minute time, delivery guy was great.
 The dough was a little tough, in fact my jaw hurt after 2 slices. I tried another piece about a half hour later and it was really tasty and the crust was a bit softer. I also like the \"Dirty Crust\" (+1), they flip the crust down to size covering a presauced section, putting a small bit of sauce inside the crust. They sauce the crust edges sloppy and get cheese all over the top, Dirty Crust. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The Sicilian was incredibly doughy and heavy. I couldn't finish the slice. I found it to be really bland. 

Their regular pizza was also very heavy. I would imagine because they sell this as a stuffed crust pizza, which is really a two-layer pizza with sauce in between the two layers. 

This came highly recommended, but it's not my style."}
