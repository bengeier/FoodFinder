{"text":"I was a bit hesitant to try Nick's after reading some of the reviews, but was quite impressed with the meal I recently had there. We went on a Friday after work for a casual date night, and I ordered the blackened steak, my date had the steak neptune. We both thought the food's taste and quality was great. I'd say the menu was a bit lacking with selection, but then again, it's a steak and pizza place. As everyone mentioned, it was quite busy there, but we found a booth in the lounge. The decor isn't anything to write home about, but I came for a great meal and got it!"}
{"text":"Nick's Steak house one of my favorite places to eat in Calgary- A fantastic family owned restaurant with some of the BEST pizza around and awesome steaks; This place has been around for over 30 years,  a testament to the great service and food offered here. The food is undoubtedly comfort food but the menu is diverse enough to please most tastes. I cant get enough of their pizzas, pastas and steaks as well as the Sunday & Monday prime-rib special.  The service is great with a welcomed absence of any self-entitled servers that think they are above their jobs (common here in Calgary)- Nick himself can be found bumbling around making sure everyone is happy.   The ambiance is a beautiful part of this restaurant. It appears some reviewers seem to think if the place isn't replete with modern finishings, granite bars, top 40 music playlists or servers in tight dresses then its ugly and run-down but really, one should really appreciate the charm of this place with all the awesome old school fixings and decor giving you that comfortable and at-home vibe . The place is clean and well maintained while keeping the vintage nature of it alive and well. This is an awesome place to go before Stampeders games, or afterwards as their have a great bar/lounge. Nicks also has a nice outdoor patio both in the front and back.  Although Nicks seems to attract an older demographic, its really for everyone and a superior alternative to the trendy/glitzy places found elsewhere that cant compare in food and service. They serve dinner untill 11pm so its a great late night spot as well.  What to order - Prime rib with garlic toast - Salad with the house dressing - Ribeye Steak - Any of the Pizzas (seriously awesome)"}
{"text":"I have been there twice and both times the services has been nice. The food is pretty good especially the burguers options and it's not overpriced. For sure I'll be there again"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Nick's and I am not really sure how they have managed to stay in business this long, the only explanation is their location. The decor of the restaurant is severely outdated. Not retro in a cute way, but just outdated and grimy feeling in a way that an outdated hotel room with those gawdy bed covers that no one ever washes makes you feel. If you are going to charge $50 for a steak dinner, it had best not arrive over cooked with frozen green beans on the side as my husband's did. My own pasta dish was runny and bland. I ate less than half and didn't bother to take my leftovers home. Everything was very overpriced considering the ambience and quality was so painfully lacking. You can't charge $15 for a glass of wine when the server bringing it to you is wearing jeans and a dirty T-shirt."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck. Plus they load the food on your plate, so come hungery."}
{"text":"Great place for families!  My kids were a little stir crazy after a long day, but the server totally stepped up to the plate and gave us a great meal.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Always drove past this place but never came in. So it was my bf's birthday last Friday so I decided to give it a try. We had 15 people at this place and the service was quite good (even though it took 3.5 hours to eat dinner). Before I made a reservation for this place, I went online to check out the menu and the prices just so that it's affordable for the guests. With Nick's being a steakhouse, my bf and I wanted steak. The prices were very reasonable ($25-$40) for steak entrees. Came with veggies, potatoes and bread.   Here was where I was a bit disappointed. I was a waitress for 10 years and I understand that the servers need to upsell however, with being a server, there needs to be some smarts and some common sense. You would by far get a better tip when you put your customers needs first and give good suggestions. I know for one that if a server is very helpful, I would give them a better tip. For appetizers, I ordered 4 baskets of garlic cheese toast, 2 orders of garlic shrimp and calimari. The appetizers came out to $80. It was VERY steep but for 15 people, I shrugged it off. But what I was disappointed about was the server failed to mention that ALL the meals come with a side of garlic bread. Had she told me AT THE TIME when I ordered 4 baskets of garlic cheese toast, i wouldn't have spent $40 on cheese toast! So we all ate this bread, filled ourselves up and when the entrees came,they brought 6 ADDITIONAL baskets of garlic toast we were shocked. What happened to all that bread? Ended up going in the garbage! Had she told us ahead of time, there wouldn't be so much waste.  Then we ordered our entrees. We all know there are additional charges to add ons (like chicken, prawns, extra cheese etc). 3 people at our table (including my bf) ordered a $25 steak entree meal with a lobster tail add on and prawns add on. To me, I figured a lobster tail add on would be $10 and prawns would be about $6 or $7. The server didn't tell us how much the add ons were. Mind you....I guess that was our own fault for not asking her but we didn't think it would be THAT expensive. We got the bill and my bf's entree came out to $68!!! Mine came out to $40. Our other friend's entree came out to $92! We were all in shock. We couldn't believe that they charged $30 for a lobster tail add on and $12.99 for 6 prawns!! We were not impressed by this. We understand an additional charge but $30 for a lobster tail? I can order a FULL lobster from Halifax, shipped in over night for $20. And $12.99 for 6 prawns??? They weren't even big.   Overall.....we enjoyed the food however the price was a little too extreme for our liking. We would certainly go back for steak however no add ons."}
{"text":"We got a insider tip from one of the relatives of the owner that the pizza to try was the Euphoria as it's a little different than the regular and his favorite.  So was it good....yup it was....very, very good.  Pizza had a great crust, chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside and quite tasty (due to the smothering of garlic butter).  We added some meat thing to the toppings since the Euphoria is vegetarian but honestly we probably should have just left it alone.  Can't say how other things on the menu are as we've only ever had the pizza but the plates on the other tables sure looked good."}
{"text":"Nick's has an old steakhouse feel, with dark row tables and warm, yellow lighting that permeates the whole establishment, giving it an authentic 70s look. The prices are reasonable and the steak is actually quite good. The pizza looked appetizing, but was far more bland than its appearance suggested.  The waitress we had seemed a little tired that day and it wasn't exactly busy, but she was at least attentive. Which sometimes is all you can ask for. The bar side of the restaurant seemed to be a little more happening than the dining area with the hockey game on a bunch of screens. That part was packed with people. It's location (across the street from McMahon Stadium) makes it a great place to watch the football game or stop in after for a drink. I would definitely go back to Nick's."}
{"text":"The lasagna is average, but in that pretzel sort of \"salty and bland but I still want more\" way. Same with the side salad. Same with the garlic toast. We had takeout from here because Eddy's Nest was closed for Christmas."}
{"text":"Have been to Nick's twice. Once for a steak special meal and once for a veal cannelloni meal. For starters I find the menu expensive for what you get. There's nothing special or unique on the menu. The veal cannelloni meal came with a salad (way too much dressing and not much else except lettuce), garlic bread, and 2 tubes of too-firm/dry cannelloni pasta tubes filled with a grey paste - no actual \"meat\" to be seen (ground veal for example). I tasted it on its own and the veal \"paste\" was bland and unappetizing. The cannelloni tubes were smothered in a tomato sauce and baked with a ton of cheese on top. If you like \"old school\" pasta from the 70's, then this is for you. My husband had the lasagna and was similarly unimpressed. Both meals were about $20 which seemed expensive for a basic pasta dish. When we got home we both had to take antacids to kill the tomato sauce heartburn (I tried not to eat most of the sauce but it was hard to avoid.  The one thing that is great about Nick's is the service. The staff seem friendly and helpful.   If I had to go back I'd probably opt for the steak and avoid the pasta, but I won't go back soon as there are too many other good options in Calgary and area."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give this place a \"minus stars\" I would.  I took my mother for Mother's Day brunch and I have to say this was by far the worst food I have ever eaten.  I was so embarrassed having subjected my elderly mother to such slop.  The food was inedible.  Not even the dessert was good.  It is criminal to charge money for such poor quality food.  Don't bother wasting your time and money.  Worst food in Calgary ... hands down.  YUCK!"}
{"text":"Stick to steak and pizza here. The veal Neptune was disgusting. Store bought hollandaise over packaged-tasting breaded (?) veal. Gross."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch last week. I had a half lasagna which was huge and really delicious. It came with a nice house salad and the server recommended the house dressing which was a creamy garlicky vinaigrette. Very tasty!! I would buy this to take home!! My friend had an amazing charbroiled burger with fries and gravy. He said the burger was amazing. Our server was extremely attentive, super friendly and efficient. Great place to stop in for a bite! Have to try the steak next time"}
{"text":"This is my worse ever dining experience in Calgary. Service is bad, food is over priced. I will never cone back there again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for steak in Calgary. Simple place and has a charm about it that I really love."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place so many times and have never given it a second thought, but upon recommendation from a friend's dad, we figured we'd check it out.  Even though it was quite busy, they managed to still seat us without reservations. My initial thought when I sat down was how it looked like a lodge with the large bricked fireplace, almost floor to ceiling windows and the overstuffed leather lounging chairs.  Figuring I'd go with what they're known for, I got the ribeye steak (served with Caesar salad, baked potato and garlic toast) and my gf went with a Hawaiian pizza. I don't know why I always think I can eat my entire steak, because after gorging on salad and the potato (which had REAL bacon on it), I made it *maybe* a 1/3 of the way into my steak before admitting defeat. By no means was I complaining though, I couldn't wait to have the juicy and tender steak for lunch the next day (ok, 2nd dinner, who are we kidding here? Lol)  We had a few more cocktails while sitting by the fireplace before heading out for the next portion of our evening, but we were both glad we had an enjoyable dinner at Nick's."}
{"text":"Went to Nicks for brunch buffet. Rip-off.  Arrived at 12:30, food was picked over and not replenished from that point on. Staff was blaming each other for mistakes with the order and untrained. Steak was tough and inedible; not to mention took forever to get made. They served them to another table. Eggs Benedict ess runny-raw. Hardly anything for selection. Not worth $24. Nick should go see what you get at Graze (Royal Executive Inn) for that much.  Restaurant was old and seats dirty. Never again."}
{"text":"Brunch is ok, but not a lot of choices. Pricey.. It should be more like $15/person.   Ambience is ok but a bit old and boring."}
{"text":"Nick's pizza is seriously the best in town. I've got a buddy that owns a pizza shop in the south who will want to punch me for this review, but Nick's has earned it: great sauce, delicious crust and they don't skimp on toppings. Go ahead, treat yourself!"}
{"text":"I went here for pizza. The smallest size is more than enough for one person, so you could even share with someone else. There were vegetarian options, which you don't always get with restaurants that have steak in the title. The pizza was good, and the location is good as well."}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was excellent, service was great. Steak and lobster was on special for Valentine's and it was delish. I also had it Neptune for an extra $7. We also changed to a Caesar salad for $4 more and worth it for a really good garlicky caeser. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Nick's Steakhouse for years, but just recently discovered the Sunday Brunch. It's a great deal with coffee and juice included and all-you-can-eat steak for only $20. I've been to the brunch a few times now and the service has ranged from amazing to very good, depending on the crowds. The serving staff is very professional and as attentive as their workload allows. The little steaks they serve are perfect to my taste and the ham/eggs benedict/ omelets etc. are all very good. The dessert tray is amazing! The only negative is that the fresh fruit and veggie offerings don't quite live up to the rest of the spread.   The place has a definite \"family-run\" feel, and the 70s decor looks like it's brand new. Brunch + Steak = a pretty darn good Sunday!"}
{"text":"I walked in and asked the receptionist if was possible to get the beef dip rare. Nick happened to be standing right beside her and he said he would take care of it.  Ten minutes later I had a wonderful plate in front of me"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found Nick's! I have spent the last year trying dozens of pizzas trying to find an even half way decent place, and I finally have.  The cheese is amazing the way a pizza should be and they use quality fresh meats and veggies that really make it delightful.  Can't speak to the rest of the menu but is definitely my new pizza place, and did I mention free delivery?! Thank you Nick's I'm not feeling so homesick anymore now that I have my ultimate comfort food again :)"}
{"text":"Came to Nick's on a Friday at 5:30pm for dinner.  Service was very quick, and very friendly.  I had the pizza & pasta combo (spaghetti with meat sauce), which came with salad and garlic toast.  The salad and garlic toast came out to us in minutes - like, maybe 4 minutes...  very quick.  I had the \"tossed\" salad (literally just iceberg lettuce with 3 slices of tomato and 1 slice of cucumber) but my friend had the Caesar Salad, which looked delicious!  I recommend the Caesar Salad over the tossed, that's for sure.  The pizza was fantastic.  6\" pizza was just the right amount of food for me for dinner.  The spaghetti came home with me for dinner tomorrow.  My friends had a Stampede Burger, Seafood Fettuccine and Half Rack of Ribs - they all said their food was great.  Large portions - not a single one of us finished our meals.  This apparently is the place to go for groups.  We sat next to a table that probably had 24 people.  Just as we were leaving, a large group of (probably) 11 - 12 year old boys (soccer team, maybe? and some parents showed up - I bet there was 40 of them - maybe more.  I recommend - and will go back."}
{"text":"Man, such extensive menu of protein  The one has a ridiculously huge burger bun, my jaw dropped.  Looked like a food contest burger (coming from someone who has not ever seen a food contest burger).  Chicken is good too (not dry, had the creole chicken, seasoning not too salty)  My bro ordered the one, he liked the meat and how it was cooked and seasoned  My dad order steak (medium), and he enjoyed that as well  We were well fed here :-)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for  nostalgia this is the place for 70's food and decor. Nothing fancy, fills you up like an old steak and pizza joint. The location must be worth a fortune if anyone developed it for the upscale NW market we so desperately need up here!"}
{"text":"One of the few classic steakhouses left in Calgary that have a vintage feel.Expect to see the owner (Mark) or his father Nick himself at the front most nights making sure service is up to snuff.The ribeye steak is absolutely the best I've had, and anything on the menu is typically very good.It is not inexpensive to eat here, but one could argue that the quality food and usually but not always exceptional service is worth the price.I hope they keep the 70's-80's feel."}
{"text":"I had never been to Nick's but since moving to Calgary I'd heard much about it.  It used to be, supposedly, a place where any dish on the menu would be amazing - you  just couldn't go wrong.  Well, I gave it a try with my husband and honestly I doubt I would ever go back after that.  My first impression was it's very dark and gloomy, the decorations and lighting seemed dated and not in a charming way once you really started looking around.  It looks like it was built in the 70s and never grew from there.  The server wasn't super helpful with recommendations so I ended up ordering a classic Chicken Parmesan with baked potato and vegetables.  The vegetables were bland.  The potato was so tiny - I've had bigger baby potatoes.  The only thing that saved it was the topping tray with sour cream, bacon bits, green onion... at least the potato was cooked through.  The chicken parm was overcooked, I'd hoped the garlic toast would be useful in soaking up the extra sauce that should have been there but there was so little that the breading on the parm had absorbed most of it by the time it hit the table.  There wasn't much cheese and it wasn't the soft delicious coating it should have been.  After the bland, overcooked, disappointing tasteless meal I'm not sure I want to bother trying the pizza they're famous for.  If this restaurant was a gem once, it's come down a long way and needs to revive some of its lost quality if it wants to stay around much longer on more than just a name.  It would be nice if they find someone who cares enough to revive it."}
{"text":"Nicks's what happened???  I  rarely complain about anything but this time I need to vent.  We used to love this place! You couldn't go wrong with the food, it was amazing.  For this reason we decided to go last night ( we had not been for a year).  First of all what happened to the waiters in dress shirts who looked professional? Now it's Nick's tshirts and extremely tight workout pants for uniforms.  We started off with bruschetta.  It was the worst we have ever had.  It came with garlic toast on the side and a bowl of ??? cold stew of tomatoes which weren't fresh but looked like out of a jar.  Tomatoes should be red not brown.  Our main courses were no better.  My husband's baked potato was half the size up it used to be, my fries were dark brown and looked like they had been refried a few times, and my daughter's mushrooms looked pickled not fresh.   The quality was gone, food not fresh but prices the same.  We'll have to find another place to go to.  Shame on you Nick's :("}
{"text":"Coming from Buffalo NY, where pizza is it's own food group, It's been difficult finding a place in Calgary with great pizza. We've never tried Nick's before, even though we're by the university all the time. When I called and placed the order, the girl was so friendly, and when I came to pick up the pizza, a man greeted me and was even friendlier. That speaks volumes with me because there's nothing worse than giving business to a place who isn't very friendly to patrons.   On to the pizza, it was great! Finally \"real pizza\", as my husband described it. Good prices and size, I'd definitely order from here again. I'd actually like to come and sit and eat at the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"This was another of my usual go to places before leaving Calgary a several years ago.  Since returning to Calgary I've noticed this trend across many formerly fantastic places where people are willing to pay significantly more, for significantly smaller portions, terrible quality and questionable service.    The wife and I ate here on a Saturday night around 6:30pm.  When I pulled up the parking lot was empty.  The place looked closed.  I figured there was no way a restaurant like Nick's would be closed at that time and day.  Sure enough, not closed.   We were stood at the front desk trying to flag someone down for a little over 5 minutes, before some encouraging signs of life emerged and seated us.  Service was extremely slow and unpleasant, but we endured and ordered our food.  I ordered a steak, and the wife a chicken parmigiana.   What was served was disappointing.  The portion sizes were pathetic.  My steak was done in 4 bites.  The wife's dish was even smaller of a portion, and her steamed veggies were 100% raw.   For $23 and $32 plates this was laughable.  Although they tasted fine, aside from being served raw veggies.    At this point we noticed our waiter's friends had come in and they were sitting at another table with him joining their party.  We didn't see him again.  Finally we just went to the front counter to pay for our meal and left.   Nick's is a pizza house, I may give the pizza another go before I decide not to go back but I won't be returning for anything other than pizza."}
{"text":"My very good friend works next door at the Super 8.  He had asked me about going to Nick's at least twice before. So, finally, to shut him up, I agreed to go there on Monday, 29 April, the day before my upper GI. In case I go, I thought, I can hopefully go with a BANG.  The hours are not posted on the website or Yelp! so we called the Super 8 to see if he could look out the door to make sure it was open before we drove up. It was. And, my friend has a discount card. This is getting better and better.  So, the special was the Prime Rib which I chose to ignore for the Steak & Pasta. Though, I did have the $5.99 Original 16 beer (Think Korea's Hite beer but not quite as bubbly but tastes almost as refreshing). So, I have a 2nd drink to oddle (besides Wild Rose).  The steak was cooked medium to medium rare; the way I ordered it. The pasta was delicious. The meal also came with garlic toast/bread that was perfectly warm and the perfect amount of garlic.  The waitress was one of the best servers I have had in a long time. My water glass always stayed full; she checked on us routinely and made great recommendations. She got a nice tip!  The end all was the Mile High Mud Pie. My first choice was the Peanut Butter Mud Pie but I was thwarted by the table behind us as they ordered the last piece!  So, based on the desert menu alone, I have 5 more visits to Nick's.  The decor has a classic homestyle feel to it, with low noise, and great background music. This would be the perfect place to have a/my birthday party (hint hint). I believe the website says this is family owned and it appears to be run like it. If my families home felt like this, I'd never left."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect from here - from the OK reviews, to the not so great ones, to the orange tinge lighting when one looks inside... but there always seemed to be people in here and we drive by it all the time wondering how it really is... so one Sat night we went in and were ushered into the lounge. Seems there were no options for us that way, maybe they wanted to shut the dining room down but it still had people in there. Anyways Nick's, thanks for that cramped booth RIGHT outside the washroom that felt like a sauna! We moved tables on our own. Service so far we thought - PISS POOR! After waiting about 15 min to even ask for a water a server came up to us and apologized as there was a mix up with the sections. Anyways... 2 water please, with lemon, a side Caesar salad to share and a 10 inch Nick's Special Pizza.  The salad that came first was awful, the bowl was warm, the salad watery on the bottom, no bacon, no lemon and the cheese sprinkled on top was that fake powdered cheese that is supposed to pass as parm? The server knew we were starving so she brought us a little basket of garlic toast that we did enjoy a lot. The pizza came in good time and indeed the crust looked and tasted fresh (the menu advised the dough is made daily) I had asked the waitress prior if the mushrooms came fresh on top and she did not have a clue? But, thankfully they were and this pizza saved a star on this review. Good ingredients, nice cheese, quality toppings. It reminded me of growing up in Ottawa (sooo many Italians do pizza right there) 25 years ago, how a pizza should be! $18.99 for a 10 inch here at Nick's, the smallest they have. BUT, it was loaded with a nice mild pepperoni and little cubes of ham as well as some veggies and a nice sweet tomato sauce that could be homemade. We managed to eat it all but we were stuffed afterwards. When I asked for a side of pizza sauce, it came out stone cold, (really?) but it was not on the bill. So, I think that for under $30 we did not do too badly and the service did pick up for us at the end so not a totally bad meal out. Some of the staff in the lounge that we saw could use some tact and training in professionalism which surprised me for this type of establishment that has been in business for years. Would not hesitate to grab a pizza for take-out, do not feel the need to dine in again."}
{"text":"A co-worker had Recommended Nick's to me.  So about a week before the flood, I found myself in Calgary and decided to check out Nicks.  The restaurant itself is large inside.  We chose to be seated in the bar section so we could watch the hockey game.  No problems there.  We both ordered pizza.  I had the \"Nick\" special - ordering the smallest of the three sizes (10 inches).  When it arrived it had about 6 full sized slices.  The crust was decent - much better than chain pizza crust.  There were a lot of tasty toppings, and I was full on about 4 slices.  My pedometer said I was at 12,000 steps for the day with about another 3,000 to get back to the hotel so I downed the next two slices.    We also ordered ice cream for dessert.  Its not on the menu as an option but our waitress was more than willing to make it available.  Overall, I would definitely repeat my next time in Calgary."}
{"text":"GARBAGE  Looks like a 1980's Denny's. This is a place you go with your husband when your in a stale marriage and have two whiney children. Decor has no style whatsoever, and the food does not make up for this.  Husband ordered a boneless Ribeye ($34) - steak was overcooked, small mound of mashed potatoes, a couple cooked carrots and zuccinis (spelling?) and a salad that tasted like a McDonalds salad (iceberg lettuce, no flavour).  I orderd the Garlic Prawns ($12), they were acceptable for Calgary seafood and bruschetta ($11) (garlic toasts were good) but you could tell the bruschetta had been canned. It looked like antipasto all the same dark red colour.  The food was garbage, and we had two beers which were the best part. Service was worse then a Denny's. We ended with a $70 bill and received a sarcastic look and comment when the waitress wasn't happy with the tip we left.  Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the food an ambiance, one of the few places that could satisfy my taste buds in Calgary.   The best steak in Calgary till date, loved the beer sampler. We ordered the appetizer sampler, Pasta, ribs, steak, lasagna with variety of drinks and cheesecake as dessert. The group liked everything!  The servers were courteous and engaging though service time could be improved.  I'm gonna be a regular at Nicks!"}
{"text":"Ah, another place you can do the all-you-can-gain experience brunch (Saturday and Sunday only). I've only been for pizza before so I didn't know what to expect. Let me describe the food. Imagine a super duper long dinner table that could easily fit 40 people. That's the table Nick's uses to put a mountain of food on.  Mini steaks (must order from your server), veal pasta, eggs benny, French toast, pancakes, salads, vegetables, made to order omelettes, hash browns, sausages, bacon, beans, potato salad, rolls, cold cut meats, and trays and trays of tasty desserts. Everything I tried was good.  Great place for a big group. It's not busy and the quiet environment makes it great if you have kids, babies, or fussy eaters."}
{"text":"I love there steaks here, for me it's either here or smugglers, pizza is great, love doing a prime rib and pizza dinner. Always take my friends from out of town here"}
{"text":"Ok I got a 30 steak neptune , one ice cream scoop of potatoes , couple asparagus stalks. 8 oz steak , I could have cooked better myself. Girlfriend got pizza was under cooked, still doughy. They said they would put it back in the oven for a few more minutes. I'm thinking they should have just brought be another pizza or re-cooked it and not charged me. Couple beer 75 bucks later for lunch , Should have spent 100 and gone to Caesar's. What happened Nick ? Used to be really good. Wont be back. I made the Steak Neptune myself and it was waaaayyy better. Hell I'll do it for 2o a pop if you bring the beer."}
{"text":"The food and service were wonderful here in the 1990's. I would not reccomend this restaurant anymore to anyone. ESPECIALLY the brunches. Overcooked omelettes and steaks beyond tough. Sad..."}
{"text":"Before you eat here you have to know that this restaurant has been around for 37 YEARS! That is amazing for any restaurant. Restaurants come and go, but this one has stood the test of time...and you\"ll definitely notice that the decor, although clean and super comfortable, is understatedly retro.  I liked the vibe here. There's a fair sized restaurant area and a large lounge with a cozy brick fireplace. It's usually packed Friday and Saturday nights.  The owner's son played with the Calgary Stampeders once upon a time, so there's lots of Stampeder memorabilia. It wouldn't be completely unrealistic to see some football players digging into some steaks while you're eating.   My friends and I had pizza, Greek salad and Caesar salad. The Greek Salad was delicious and had some bonus creaminess to it. The Caesar (large) was nice and garlicky and came with a generous side of garlic toast.  We had the Ambrosia pizza (think spinach, artichoke hearts  feta) and the Athenian pizza (think feta and olives). Both had toppings that blended together in the most amazing way! I would order both again.  Service was great - attentive, polite and friendly.  This restaurant has a solid menu; is comfortable and laid back; and has some friendly employees who obviously enjoy what they do."}
{"text":"This place is great for pizza for sure BUT stay clear of the Sunday buffet! For $25 you should get food that doesn't look pre-purchased from Safeway. Eggs Benny tasted like feet.....in other words....just eat elsewhere for buffets. Huge waste of money for 8 people!"}
{"text":"\"Oh! When You Are in Calgary, You Absolutely Positively Have to Go To Nicks\"   Ok, I been there, done that, and I can tell you that you do NOT absolutely positively have to go to Nicks.  It's a steakhouse with Italian options.  The steaks are no different than the steaks you can get at any of the top 50% of steakhouses anywhere you go.  Not tough. Not tremendously tasty but good enough.  And the steaks come at steakhouse prices (Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow.)  Being no fool and facing paying that amount of money I got my top sirloin au poivre. This way if the meat was run of the mill, the sauce had a chance of saving it.  Well, I tried the meat naked. The meat was nothing special. The peppercorn sauce was very good. So I had a decent meal.  Baked potatoes are served in foil.  This is what the people want.   I can't blame Nick for serving the potatoes the customer wants. But baking a potato in foil gives you a steamed poorly textured potato that needs a lot of butter or sour cream to save it. Baking a potato naked rather than steaming it in foil gives you a flavorful well textured potato.  Vegetables were quite nice.  Salad? Zzzzzzzz.  The red meat hater at the table got the salmon with french fries on the side. She gave this plate a solid thumbs up.  The other dishes on the menu may be pretty good.  And I am pretty fussy about steak houses.  (You can buy good steaks at a good butcher or grocery store and make a better steak at home than you get in restaurants. Supposedly prime steaks are not always so prime.)  Craig Claiborne once said, if someone gave him a good steak, he would prefer to grind it up and use flavor ingredients to make an amazing meatloaf.  I think he knew something about cooking beef."}
{"text":"Another lunch delivered to work.  A few pizzas & a couple salads.  I had starved myself by skipping breakfast so I was on those pizzas like a horny dog on your leg.  Chicken Carbonara pizza? Interesting.  It tasted pretty good.  Petros Special was a mess and not too impressive on taste.  I skipped the vegetarian.  I'm allergic to meatless pizza.  The salads were alright, but a salad is pretty difficult thing to screw up.  None of the crust on any pizza were in the least bit crispy.  The delivery guy seemed to have quite the attitude.  Perhaps a smile and some semblance of personality need to be injected into him.  Overall a very average experience."}
{"text":"Made day-before reservations for Father's Day Brunch, and we weren't disappointed. Our table of 6 ordered steaks, and the consensus was positive. From the buffet I took pasta, potato salad, Eggs Benny, sausage, bacon, potato pancakes, roast beef with horseradish + gravy, and ordered a small steak on the side, medium rare. Ended with lemon meringue and banana cream pie wedges. It was busy, but service was prompt, friendly, and efficient. It's now $23 per person, up $3 from 2009, but the value is there, so +1 star from my previous review."}
{"text":"I had the pizza + pasta combo, with fettuccine alfredo and spinach + mushroom on my pizza. The pasta was pretty average, as well as the pizza. But our server showed true customer service and that's the reason I'm really writing the review. His name is Eric, and he was so friendly and calm, it just made you feel comfortable and relaxed during the duration of your meal. (My friend made a comment that his voice is perfect for the radio because of how soothing it is.) He was so great, one of my friends was determined to tip him $30. He was never bothered by requests and always asked us if we wanted this or that before we had to ask him. Amazing service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. They were able to accommodate gluten free. Everything was cooked very well. Large portions, enough for two meals. Prices are a little bit high, but it seams worth it."}
{"text":"I went on a first date with a girl here.  We honestly only chose it because it was close to her house and we thought it might be a lame/funny place.  When we went in, the server was very nice.  He was knowledgable on everything and knew what complimented what.  For some reason I thought a place that claimed steak AND pizza would have horrible steak... but it was one of the best I had ever had at that point.  They started closing up and we were still there.  They never asked us to leave or made us feel rushed.  I could hear them vacuuming on the other end of the building, and trying to close everything down.  We had a very good time.  But what REALLY impressed me, was that we went back there again about 2 months later and he remembered us both and offered the same wine as our first visit.  We were blown away.  I wish I remembered his name...  I guess his memory trumps mine.  Great place.  Check it out."}
{"text":"First eating here for me even though I have been in Calgary for 20+ years. It was New Year's Eve and for a party of 5 we were able to make a real for 6:30pm. We arrived early and were promptly seated in a nice window booth.  We ordered three apps for the table: garlic toast, bruschetta and calamari...meh, not great and average at best. Mains included: steak sandwich, top sirloin, ribs and lasagna. The ribs appeared to be the best dish of the group. The steak sandwich was disappointing - at $27 my expectation is no grizzle and a good trim prior to hitting the grill - not so this time. Vegetable accompanying meal were limp and unappealing in appearance. Lasagna was rated 6/10 but even the 1/2 order was huge! The two desserts were solid - cheesecake and ice cream cake.  I'd hesitate returning but the story of Nick's, location and old Skool interior make it interesting. Ample free parking on site is a plus too."}
{"text":"Nick's is by far my favourite steakhouse in Calgary. I never miss an opportunity to visit when coming through town on business. Love the personal touch by Nick and Mark.   Great service. Fantastic rib eye and a decor that brings back memories of an era of good food and good times."}
{"text":"Honestly for the prices I am not impressed.  Went here for dinner with a group of us (5 to be exact) and the food was sub par. To start we ordered calamari, pizza bread, and bruschetta. The calamari was overly battered and lots of it was just pieces of batter with no actual calamari. The bruschetta was very odd, it didn't seem like fresh tomatoes, and it was nothing like traditional bruschetta, none of us liked it. The pizza bread was good but it was pizza crust and dip.  I ordered prime rib as it was prime rib Sunday, and when it arrived there was no jus at all? I mean come on... isn't that like a customary part of prime rib? Ive ordered prime rib many a time, at keg, smugglers, and charcut to name a few and they all serve that.  Also I requested medium rare and what arrived was completely well done, so I needed the jus. The potato mash was overly buttery, the vegetables were soggy with zero seasoning and the yorkshire pudding was over done but the only yummy thing on my plate. For dessert I got the cheesecake and that was tasty, but that really was the only thing I enjoyed. This place is completely overpriced for the quality- go to smugglers or charcut if you want some delicious food that is priced about the same."}
{"text":"Nice family-style restaurant. The prices are a little on the high side for the quality of food and the overall decor of the restaurant. But every time we've gone we've gotten a good meal. The staff is friendly the service is quick and we always leave full and happy. You can tell this restaurant has been around since 1979, the way they serve things (dressing the potatoes at the table, table side meat carving etc) These were VERY popular in the early 80's but now seem dated and kinda weird.  In going here - keep in mind you are stepping back in time! This is a Calgary landmark restaurant for a reason. It's not 5 star, but not 1 either, it's a SOLID 4 star  The PRIME RIB has been perfect both times we've had it. The handmade/tossed? pizza is awesome for sure!  Overall, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Greatest teriyaki chicken ever had. Veal medallions were great too. Fun environment. Great menu! Fast friendly service"}
{"text":"this place is closed!!"}
{"text":"Here's the scenario.  You're lazing about on a Sunday afternoon with your significant other.  You're discussing dinner options.  You're lazy, why cook when you live in the Beltline and have virtually unlimited options at your disposal?  (Are you with me so far?  Of course you are, you're probably reading this trying to determine if you should order from Nick's.)  Then your SO says \"I want really good pizza, from a steakhouse.\"  You decide on Nick's and place your order.  It's ready in 20 minutes and you arrive 5 minutes early so you sit at the sad little table they have for people who arrive early and read Ripley's Believe it or Not book. (Seriously, excellent reading material for those who are early.)  You pay for your medium pizza and 2 pops ($30) and head home to eat it on your couch.  And. It's Only. Ok.  Which really sucks because if you were going to pay $30 for something that was only ok, you'd rather it be an only ok massage, or an only ok midget wrestling match.  Yes it has a lot of cheese and the toppings are tasty...but it just doesn't do it for you.  Maybe you've been spoiled by the tasty offerings over at Una or Famoso (which admittedly offer a different style of pizza) but pizza by it's very nature is usually pretty good, even when it's just ok.  You pack up the rest of the pizza and send it with your SO (for his lunch), a move that earns you some points as he is apparently less discerning about pizza than you are.  Oh well, it could have been worse, you could have actually had to cook!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Nicks out for the first time and was very dissapointed.  First off it was so cold i almost had to go to my car to get a jacket, so we switched tables.   We were the only table in the place and we still had to call our waitress over to the table to replenish our ceasers and then ran out of water and had to share as our waitress again hadnt retunted to our table.   We ordered 5 appitetizers to share and it was very apparent that the cook had no idea on timing.  All appitizers were brought out at the same time and you can tell the shrimp had sat under a heat lamp as it had a film on the top  the cheese bread was sloppy and stacked so it was all stuck together and the bread soggy as all hell.    The shrimp sauce was amazing but we had to put all our muscles in that sauce as the sauce for the mussels tasted like tomoto soup.    I had a side ceaser that tasted like lettuce and water.  And the wings?  Save you money and get them from pizza 73 as that was exactly what they tasred like.    Dont waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"This is a bit of a weighted average review.  Let me explain.  Over the 10 years I've lived in Calgary, I've been here twice. Once for dinner, which really didn't blow me away. In fact, it really disappointed me as my party of 6 or so all found the steaks and such to be pretty sub-standard to say the least. As this was a time before I was a Yelper, let alone a Yelp Elite, I really didn't say or write much more than... \"meh, had better\". This experience would be a 2 star at best.  But recently, I tried out the Sunday Brunch for the first time. Now here's something to actually write about.   It wasn't a huge buffet brunch, but there was a decent selection of salads, hot foods, breads, desserts and such. No seafood to speak of, but then it's not necessarily a hard and fast rule in buffet brunches that there had to be.  You see, on top of the usual choose your own omelette station (which is then delivered to your table...nice touch) and that the beverages were part of the price (thank heavens, I HATE paying an extra $3 for coffee at a buffet brunch), there was the surprise of having an all you can eat all you can eat top sirloin steak offer thrown in with the whole thing. Needless to say, 2x 3oz. medium rare steaks later, I was IN.  The food overall was average to above average depending on the item, but then people rarely go to a buffet expecting 4-star cuisine. But as an experience and value overall (very family friendly too), this was a winner. I wouldn't mind going back again and again over the next few years, though I was pretty damn full after that Sunday Brunch.  Soooo... I would give that experience about a 3.5 to 3.75.  Add the 2 together and divide, you get more or less a 2.75 rating, which would round up to 3.   Sooo.. Thanks Sunday Brunch for redeeming Nick's in my eyes!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Nick's for over 30 years. Their food is homemade. They spend the extra time and effort to make salad dressing and desserts from scratch (the creamy Italian is the best dressing I've ever had). The atmosphere is very family friendly and have never had bad service. This is my favourite place to take the family in Calgary"}
{"text":"This easily makes the list of top five best pizzas I've ever had. We had a large pepperoni pizza which was a little pricey, but so so worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza = Good.   Service = NOT good. Last night some friends and I met up at Nick's for a slab of pie and some chats.  We were a larger group, 8 adults and 2 children and we were pretty easy going.  But for some reason it was taking Louise a long time to take drink orders, take food orders and return for any questions or concerns.  I think my biggest beef with this type of service is a grat of 18% was slapped on the bill a) without telling anyone and b) without providing an 18% gratuity service. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy servers. WHY do you do this to people.  I remember thinking \"This is a 10 percenter tonight.\" and then I saw the auto grat and was like \"HOW! WHY!\"  Bill gets dropped and then another 15 minute wait for the machine.   I don't get it. BUT - the pizza IS delicious.  Maybe just better for pick up!"}
{"text":"Holy crap!  I didn't realize that there was a take-out and delivery version of the restaurant I like so much.  That's right, the Nick's that's located on Crowchild Trail has a mini-twin version of it!  This location is pretty darn tiny, but what do you expect from a take-out and delivery only version?  This place has the same great food as the larger restaurant, but it's faster and possibly delivered right to your door.  I love the food at the other Nick's, and I love the food here.  The prices are definitely realistic, especially when considering it's delivered.  Having this stuff delivered to you is a nice change from the regular Chinese or pizza.  They also do catering so you can have Nick's at your next party!  Woot!  I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner, but I'm sure glad I discovered it!  Nick's delivery, here I come!"}
{"text":"Went here with my bud when he was in town for breakfast brunch.   All you can eat flank steaks, small cuts but if you can order as much as you can what does it matter? I found the medium to be the best on these steaks. The variety of fruit and veggies I found to be impressive. Did not try the bacon and sausages as they looked quite oily, as they always do. The eggs benny was only Okay, but i guess they were sitting for a bit. The made to order omelet was good, but the french toast was not very good. The service was great. The decor looks like it was from the 70s or 80s, which is up to each individual if they like it or not. Price was okay."}
{"text":"What a dump.  This place USED to be good, say, about 12 years ago before Nick sold it.  I was hesitant to do a review about this place considering I have not been there since New Year's last year, but my brother convinced us to join them on a recent trip - this brought back to the surface the horror of what I thought was my last dining experience ever at Nick's.  I would like to share this story with you.  First off, even with reservations, we were waiting over half an hour and when we did get seated, we were seated 1 foot away from another table.  The restaurant has not been renovated for as long as I have known it to exist.  Think Three's Company, Regal Beagle type decor and a 70' steak house amalgamated into this hot mess.  It is a HUGE place with a lounge area as well but it is in dire need of a make over.  The menu is extensive, I will give them that but the lack of quality really speaks for itself.  The last two times I have gone there, it was just horrendous.  The wings were stale, they were made ahead of time and sauced up when we ordered them.   The starter \"salads\" are basically bagged lettuce mix with a wedge of tomato and cucumber on top with your dressing of choice.  They come in a stylish assortment of wooden bowls for those with eccentric tastes.  Hubby ordered the honking 24 oz steak, it came back bloody when he asked for it to be medium well.  They took it back 3 times and it was charred and burnt on the outside and still bloody on the inside.  It was a really thick steak and we even told them to butterfly it, which they didn't do.  The acting manager, a young chap who I thought was a waiter who took off his apron, basically apologized and brought us one of their cheaper deserts, TO GO and did not comp the steak which was barely touched.  When I mentioned the stale wings, he assured me that he would speak to the chef about it and again, did not remove them from the bill, even though we did not eat them.  P.S.  The owners were there as well as Nick himself, neither of them said a word to us and we were a large group.  Having said that, my rib eye was good, and yes the portions are generous but not for the kids meals!  My little guy got 2 nuggets and fries for his meal and he is not a big eater and I ended up ordering him another plate!  I ended up paying for an adult entrée essentially for 4 nuggets and fries.  Service, slow.  Those poor waitresses.  Obviously have way too many tables per shift.  Ours looked like she was going to faint, she was a bit older and I could tell she was having a hard day.  She was very apologetic and said it was an \"off night\" but we still generously tipped her, it was not her fault that the kitchen staff has the same cooking calibre of an 11 year old.  Yes, they pile the food on but what's the point of it if its inedible?  Sure there are pizza's, buffets, and breakfasts but from my last two trips I could honestly say that Nicks has made it to the top of my X'd list.  Seriously, for the location and history, this place can be phenomenal.  Obviously a reno needs to happen and the menu should be cleaned up and minimized, too much going on there thus creating sub par food.  In closing, DO NOT PASS GO, DO NOT COLLECT $200, you'll regret it.  And parking is a mess if you go during busy times.  One small tiny parking lot and the rest is street, and for those familiar with the area, good luck finding street parking.  Sorry Nick, woulda had your back but you let me down twice."}
