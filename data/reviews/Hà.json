{"text":"It was sooo delicious?...try beef tataki and the coconut salmon. Desserts was ok...try the tapioca. Nice ambiance and good service."}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled on this place. The pork buns and crispy tofu I had were fantastic. The outside seating is nice with lots of greenery."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service and frendliness was lacking."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing I had the pork buns, fried rice and salmon with the chicken wings. The atmosphere is great, the wine is reasonably priced and the waiters and waitresses are young and attractive."}
{"text":"It was difficult to rate Hà but I've settled with 3 stars and will come back with a recap after I return for dinner. We went at 2:30pm and the lunch had just finished so there were only 4 things available on the menu; a pho soup, imperial rolls, shrimp chips and edamame. The service was terrible. The staff barely even noticed we were there. The waitress mixed up our simple order of one soup, one spring roll and never brought us cutlery or napkins, I had to get up and retrieve them myself. It's one thing if she said \"oops I forgot cutlery\" as she laid the food down, but to walk away and ignore, and make your customer work, is a big no-no. The soup was really good. It came with no accoutrements (or perhaps they were forgotten too) but the broth was flavourful, the noodles were heavenly and the meat tasted like filet mignon. The spring/imperial rolls were, well, one small fried roll- for a hefty price. But good. In all, good food, a bit expensive and bad service. I will come back though, for a dinner service, and update."}
{"text":"Excellent dîner toujours aussi bon toutefois, les rouleaux dégoulinent de gras. Un passage sur un papier absorbant serait requis.  Les goûts et les saveurs sont originaux et vraiment excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Highly recommend the laska, coconut salmon, imperial rolls, pork belly squid ink buns, pork ribs. Everything is great."}
{"text":"Amazing little joint with great service.  Go for a bike tour around the corner at Fitz and Folwell and then come here for a quick bite and vino.  Really fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I Went their for lunch and like a previous reviewer wrote the menu is limited. We had the imperial roll (5$ for one) a bit pricey,  and the coconut soup for starters, both were very good. For mains we had a very delicious pad thai with shrimp and pork, definitely worth trying, as well as a mediocre shrimp in 5 spice dish. Service was a bit slow for the mains but overall it was an enjoyable meal. I look forward to going back and trying their other dishes available for supper only."}
{"text":"Achalandé et bruyant,  mais nourriture impeccable! Serveuses/serveurs très compétent."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend. I was drawn to the simple and intimate terrasse- I love the ambiance! However you will have to wait a long time to be seated outside if you don't have a reservation. We placed our name on the waiting list and had to wait 30 mins (and also saw our table given away to people who had arrived after us, grr!).   We ordered the salmon tartar spring roll as as an appetizer - I didn't love it, it had a perfume-y aftertaste. We ordered the pork and shrimp pad Thai as an entree and it was a winner! Super tasty and a good portion size - but not for people who don't like spicy food. If you want to eat well but not break the bank I would definitely suggest getting the pad Thai.   I would recommend Ha for a nice warm evening on the terrasse....with a reservation."}
{"text":"I visited this place in both locations, Mont Royal and Vieux Port. Both restaurant have the same food menu, both have an amazing terasse and both have an amazing and fast service.  I tryed the dinner menu at the Mont Royal twice and the selection is very big: a choice of soup, cold and hot dishes.  The buns are amazing and you can only find them on the dinner menu.  For lunch and at both locations ,they offer the table d'hote at a very convenient price.  I always start with the Soupe Coco. It's an amazing soup.  Then I often order those tasty vegetarian spring rolls.  As main course, I tried the coconut salmon, a very light and parfumated taste.  Their Pad Thai is a home made (done from scratch), so you know that you wont be able to compare it to any of the other Pad Thai you will find in Montreal.  My recommendations for the main course is the Grilled 1855 Beef, Satay Sauce, Crispy Brocoli. Its a mouthwatering piece of meat, with fried brocoli, a sauce that is to die for and at the end of your meal you feelthat you had something different and yet very fulling.  Their dessert are fine. I suggest you try to taste everything on the menu.   It is a place I would go every time I need to have some exotic gateway.  Also for a 5@7, their drink are amazing, a different taste everytime, in a very nice and modern decor. This place is a coup de coeur."}
{"text":"All 3 of us agreed that this was the best Asian meal we've had in a long time. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Initially I was worried when I saw the number of menu items offered. Then I understood that this restaurant chose quality over quantity. The food is great, the service perfect and the price seems impossible (appetizer and main dish for 14$ at lunch time).   I am curious to find out if the menu is renewed on a regular basis. I will soon find out since this will be my new spot in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"No. You can't reasonably charge 45$ for two plates of sautéed veggies and rice that aren't even on par with those greasy Thai express take-away. At least the kitchen closes \"late\" (10:30)"}
{"text":"An upscale Pho restaurant that serves a limited menu. Crowded during the lunch hour but empties after 1pm. Outdoor and indoor seating. The prices are high here--$17 for the beef Pho. The broth is decent, but not the richest I've had by far. They also don't serve it in a customizable fashion. There was just a couple basil leaves in mine and far more bean sprouts than I would add. No lemon to squeeze in. The noodles were also non standard rice noodles-- they were flat and about the thickness of fettuccini. That's important because the usual thin noodles retain lots of broth as you left them from the soup. Wider, flat noodles don't. The beef, on the other hand, was superb. Tender and flavorful. The service was also fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant for a long time. This was a huge mistake. The service was OK and the waiter did a good job selling the plate of the day. Fried sweetbread next to stuffed eggplant with pork sauce.  I did not expect having fried blend sweetbread with a mixture of veggies and eggplant (not stuffed) and the pork sauce was ground pork with curry sauce.   Nothing incredible. It felt like someone decided to experiment and it failed monumentally.   I won't go back and I'm just telling you, don't waste your time or money. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Comparé à d'autres restaurants vietnamiens, Hà propose un décor cute et accueillant! Malgré la petite taille du restaurant, on offre beaucoup de places à la clientèle. On peut avoir notre intimité sans avoir l'impression d'être compressé les uns sur les autres.J'ai commandé le pad thaï, il était très bon, mais cela reste un peu cher pour ce que c'est. Rien à redire sur le service. Je compte bien revenir et faire découvrir la place à mes amies."}
{"text":"Une expérience différente des autres restos vietnamiens à Montréal, Hà a créé une carte formée de plusieurs petits plats à partager, réinventés! Vous pouvez aussi garder votre assiette pour vous, mais vous vous priverez de goûter à la variété des plats. J'ai aimé l'ensemble des plats que j'ai mangés, particulièrement ceux qui incorporaient des fruits, ce qui vient ajouter de la fraîcheur aux assiettes. Bien que le menu offraient des cocktails, au moment où nous y sommes allées (soit la première semaine), le bar n'était pas encore prêt. Pour un nouveau resto, j'ai été très impressionnée par la qualité du service et le roulement entre nos plats. Pas de longue attente comme on voit habituellement dans les nouveaux restos, ni de plats à moitié réussis. Essayez le dessert, la texture des bulles de tapioca avec la crème glacée et les fruits rend le tout unique. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Hà is hands down one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Montreal (and also one of my favorite restaurants period).  My friend Claire and I went for a weekday lunch, as my friend had mentioned they have a lunch special.  Indeed, for lunch, you basically get a free starter with a select choice of meals (about 7 options). I often order the beef pho, but had been disappointed the last time I went, so I opted for the cold octopus salad as a main and the mini laksa as a starter.  Both dishes were amazing and so delicious. The laksa was seasoned to perfection and very tasty. As for the octopus salad, just wow. The dish was beautifully plated first of all and the combination of flavours, fresh ingredients and spices was just perfect.  I highly recommend Hà to anyone looking for a great Asian meal with a bit of a twist, either for lunch or dinner. Hà is a great spot to try with friends, family or with your partner.  For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"}
{"text":"Délicieux! Très bon service, belle ambiance, plusieurs plats à partager très goûteux. J'au adoré les buns au crabe et le saumon. Une excellente adresse à Montréal."}
{"text":"Such a great little neighborhood spot. I sat at the bar which was great, because the bartender was very friendly. Nice cocktail menu and a small but diverse selection of east Asian beers to pair with the food.  I ordered the green papaya salad and the salmon tartare spring roll. They were brought to me at the same time, which was a minor annoyance, but fine. The papaya salad was so tasty, but just ever so slightly overdressed. The spring roll was fine. The salmon was fresh and it was plated beautifully, but for the price I was hoping for something a bit bigger. I definitely want to go back and try some of their more traditional Vietnamese options; it was just way too hot for ph?.  Overall, slightly pricey for what it is, but the food is yummy and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have been there twice, and it's one of the best Asian restaurants in the neighborhood. First things first: good drinks. Then, all of the food items I have ordered are delicious. The kind of place where you can shut down your eyes, point to a coupe of things on the menu, and no matter what it is, it will be delicious. You want to be amazed and surprised? Try the buns. I have been thinking about the buns again for several days, imagining the texture in my mouth, wondering how they make it so moist, and how they give the \"bread\" this black color?! It's a place to go amongst adults (like a date, or a night out with girl friends, etc.); they were friendly when we brought our baby in, but it's just not convenient given the setting.  I want to go back (again)!"}
{"text":"Making a reservation on line was very easy, parking not so much. Went there because of recent positive review in the Gazette. Imperial roll was very greasy, and had no taste. Pad Thai was pretty good, but when you order something that's supposed to be spicy and it's not, it's frustrating. My wife had one of the soups, almost no protein in the broth. For us it's all about how tasty the food is, and at this place it's not."}
{"text":"Que ce soit le takaki de boeuf, le poulet frit, le saumon au lait de coco ou les meilleurs rouleaux impériaux, crevettes poêlées.  Bon service, belle terrasse.   On nous promet que le menu va changer régulièrement"}
{"text":"Had a lovely anniversary dinner with my boyfriend at Hà, they treated you like family! It was a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there, and it was absolutely fantastic! Their chicken wings is a must for anyone who goes there. Those chicken wings really took me back to those summer days in Vietnam, that pairs absolutely well with their house draft beer. However, their food seems to be lacking the spicy punch to some of their items in their menu, thus I would suggest to ask for the chef to add a bit more spice. or maybe, i just enjoy spicy foods in general. Overall, the atmosphere of the place is very pleasurable, good for friends, or for a chill date with the bae....  and yes I would definitely go back again! #tresbon"}
{"text":"Lovely second location of Hà, lovely food and the patio is great in the summer! The staff is welcoming and knowledgeable and the food is reasonably prices and portions are big!"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est super, la clientèle est jeune, c'est pas très cher mais c'est très bruyant alors mieux vaut être 3 ou plus. La bouffe... assez décevante, sans gout, à la limite pas super bon pour des plats vietnamiens, mieux vaut aller au Satay Brothers ou même au red Tiger, c'est vraiment meilleur."}
{"text":"Wow. Tout était délicieux. Le saumon au lait de coco était particulièrement à se jeter par terre, même chose pour les pétoncles, dont la cuisson était parfaite.  La vinaigrette maison sésame ail coriandre (je crois) servi sur les fèves edamame était tres goûteuse, je tenterai de la reproduire chez moi.  J'ai vraiment hâte d'y retourner."}
{"text":"We were a family of 6 staying in Montreal for a few days.  I had reserved a few weeks back asking for tables on the terrace - this is why I chose the restaurant initially as it fronts into a park.  They don't take reservations on the terrace, its first come first served which is worth knowing especially because it was way too hot inside.  They kindly switched out the stools for real chairs for my elderly parents.  The service was friendly and helpful and drinks were good.  We ordered most of the menu to try different things.  Our favorite items were the pork imperial spring rolls (my daughter had another one for dessert!), edamame, chicken wings, ribs and pad Thai."}
{"text":"Had wanted to try this place for a while, but even the good reviews I'd read couldn't draw me up to the Plateau during the brutally cold first two months of 2015. We finally ventured out tonight and were not disappointed.  Re reservations, we called this afternoon and got the recorded message that we should email, which we did. We got a call back about half an hour later offering us a 6pm or 8.30pm table for 2. There was in fact quite a lot of space when we got there at 8.30, with a free table for 6, and several tables for 2. The restaurant was in fact maybe 70% full.  I liked the decor, which I found simple and tasteful. I particularly liked that they have hooks for your coats, especially since I had been saying just a couple of days previously that I don't understand why all Montreal cafés and restaurants don't have cloakrooms/coat hooks.  And so to the food: We tried the papaya salad and pork buns for starters, and followed with the lemongrass ribs and the catch of the day, which was grilled arctic char served with a coconut milk and curry sauce and accompanied by sweet potato noodles and shredded daikon.  The papaya salad was good but not as spicy as Satay Brothers. The pork buns were really good. I loved that they were black (from squid ink), and the sauce on the pork was excellent. It was a typical Asian taste that I find hard to describe - a touch of sweetness and a tad of sourness, with neither taste overwhelming the other. And there was just the right amount so that it was succulent, risked oozing from the bun, but didn't make it soggy.  The arctic char was really, really good. I expected way more sauce, but in fact there was really just a touch to set the perfectly grilled fish off. The noodles and daikon had the a couple of Thai Basil leaves on top, but I felt that they would have been better shredded and mixed in. It was just missing a little something to make it an excellent dish.  The lemongrass ribs had been slow-cooked sous vide (vacuum cooked) and the meat (a good amount of it) fell off the bone easily and completely. They were a nice change from barbecue or spicy flavours, fresh and tangy in taste. They were served, or rather, decorated with a few slices of vegetables and edamame in a lemony sauce.  We washed it all down with beer. I tried the Bia Hoi on draft (they also have Boreale and a selection of imported bottles of Asian beer). The Bia Hoi is a lager with a nice golden colour and fine bubbles. I'd expected something more German in style so it was a nice surprise.  The service: We were a tad late and the restaurant called me to see whether they should wait for us or could give our table away. I didn't think anything of it till I got there and found there were plenty of tables. :-/ We were served with water quickly and got our menus shortly after, but I had to ask what the catch of the day was. The waiter was friendly and the service was prompt.  The bill was very reasonable at just under $75 for two."}
{"text":"Situé un peu loin sur l'Avenue, ce resto vaut tout de même la peine d'être connu! Service agréable, ambiance chaleureuse aux lumières tamisées, disposition des tables et du restaurant intéressante... Nous y sommes allés pour la poutine week et elle était vraiment excellente! Je pense y retourner pour essayer le menu régulier!"}
{"text":"About a dozen of us had dinner here, as they accommodate large groups. We ordered a lot of sake and a lot of dishes. The standouts were the crispy broccoli, the beef satay, the coconut shrimp, the house salmon and chicken wings. The edamame were messy to eat. That was my only complaint. But they still tasted good."}
{"text":"Came here for my dad's birthday. The service was very polite and effective.   The food was very good. I'm not usually a big fan of vietnamese but honestly, this changed my mind. Everything was fresh and new. I got the crunchy tofu and the porc spring rolls, i burned my tongue because I was trying to eat everything as it arrived at my table. The tofu came with this really fluffy and tasty coating of crunchy-ness and sauce. The spring rolls were indescribably delicious. I highly recommend ordering them.   My family ordered different meals so I got to taste the pad thai and the coconut salmon as well and those meals made me wish I had more stomach space.   Unfortunately, the terrace was full when we arrived so we had to sit inside. However, the interior is so modern and chic that I didn't mind at all.   My family and I had a great time! It's a really great restaurant for a nice flavourful and laid back dinner."}
{"text":"The food was very good in my opinion, but I'm not going back and here's why: - It's too dark to properly see your food; they have these annoyingly trendy light bulbs that colour everything in orange, but really barely give out enough light, and they are also warm, which brings me to the next reason not to go there: - It's super warm inside; apparently the a/c \"just broke down\". I was sweating through the entire meal.  - The acoustics is really bad; I found it very hard to converse with background music, chatter, bar and kitchen noise (and we were as far away from the bar as possible - near the entrance). It could be nicer on the terrace, but today was rainy and anyhow terrace season is almost over.  - It's pricey for what it was. We paid over $30 a person, and didn't get that much food. The beer pitcher was indecently small (enough for 3 glasses only). In short, a disappointment."}
{"text":"Un de mes restaurants préférés dans le Plateau. Soupe pho absolument délicieuse. J'aime aussi commander les Buns aux crevettes croustillantes, c'est une entrée parfaite à partager et tout simplement succulente. Parfait pour un souper amoureux tout comme entre amis."}
{"text":"After walking up/down/across Mont Royal for a couple of hours, my friends and I were looking for a good restaurant to wind down and eat some delicious food.  This place exceeded our expectations in terms of ambiance, food presentation and quality of the dishes. The coconut salmon was excellent - highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. The shrimp pad Thai was well proportioned and the tasted quote good"}
{"text":"Good drinks and very tasty food. A lot of flavors in each dish. Good drinks as well. Very nice staff. Cozy atmosphere and nice decorations. Whether for a date, with family or friends, great place to eat. Love the back story of Mister Hà the chef that was working there before (even ate there when it was called Souvenir d'indochine)"}
{"text":"Dès l'entrée dans le restaurant, le magnifique décor nous confirme que nous avons fait un bon choix en venez souper ici. Les serveurs étaient attentifs à nos besoins et à l'affût, connaissant bien leur menu. Le tataki de boeuf était une portion très généreuse. Je reviens définitivement!"}
{"text":"Assiette de buf grillé très originale, c'est réussi. Essayer les assiettes du jour, la végétarienne vaut le détour. Joli décor, belle terrasse en été mais pensez à réserver. A améliorer: la musique, confort des chaises hautes."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3 stars and a half because 3 feels a little bit harsh. First of all, the decor looks great. I went there with a friend on a friday night and, even if the restaurant looked packed, we were seated in less than 5 minutes. I ordered the pad thai and a beer. It was good, but I thought it was a little bit too much to make us us pay 21$ for a simple pad thai. Don't get me wrong, it was better than your typical thai corner restaurants, but still, it could have been cheaper. This is the main reason why I'm only giving 3 stars.  I have to admit that I would still go back to try other things from their menu and see if the rest is really worth the kinda high prices."}
{"text":"Excellent rapport qualité prix, bonne nourriture asiatique, service décontracté!"}
{"text":"I had really high expectation after looking through Instagram and Yelp about the restaurant. To be honest, I was debating between giving a 3 or a 4 stars because their food didn't \"wow\" me. I decided to give a 3.5/5.  I think it is a pleasant place to have a meal. It is situated in front of a park and they have a patio where you can enjoy the summer breeze. I highly recommend the patio seats as it seems brighter than the interior seats (I didn't go in but it seemed quite dark inside). I also noticed people prefer the patio seats, so if you can, try to get there early. We got there at 6pm and the patio was almost filled up even if it was a Wednesday night.  The service was friendly and fast. In fact, a waiter came to fill up our cups even when the water bottle was on our table already. However, our waitress didn't told us what was the dishes of the day. We had to listen to another waitress telling it to another table in order to figure out what they were.  The menu is quite simple. They have soups, buns, appetizers, hot dishes and desserts. I wouldn't say they have a large selection of items (if I compare it to other Asian/Vietnamese restaurant). But there is plenty of dishes to pick from. I had a hard time picking what I wanted to eat! They also have a cocktail menu!  I settled down for their pad thai, as I'm a big pad thai lover. I noticed the little spicy icon next to \"pad thai\" so I asked our waitress if it was possible to make it not spicy. But she said they can make it less spicy, which I was fine with. My friend went with their laksa soup, which also had the spicy icon (but she can eat spicy, so it didn't bother her).  We didn't wait too long before having our dishes. My pad thai came with 4 big crispy shrimps. I don't think I've ever had pad thai with crispy shrimps elsewhere, so I was really excited to try it! There were also pork cutes inside my dish. I'm really glad I went with a less spicy pad thai because the more I ate it, the spicier it became. Their pad thai was more on the sour-side. It was an okay/decent dish but quite pricey I find ($18 before tax and tips). I had a sip of my friend's laksa soup and it wasn't spicy at all. She had to add a lot of Sriracha sauce in her bowl to make it spicy. We both agreed the soup was a bit bland and somehow it tasted a bit like pho broth to me.  Before we left the restaurant, the table next to us' order just arrived. Their beef pho smelled SO good! Next time I go, I would probably try it (although it is more expensive -$14- than the other pho restaurants in Montreal). Their buns, coconut salmon, BBQ ribs and grilled beef also looked delicious from the pictures on Instagram and Yelp."}
{"text":"The food was alright, however, at the end of our meal the hostess inappropriately badgered us for a larger tip. Save your cash and go to a more authentic Vietnamese restaurant that isn't staffed by money-grubbing white people."}
{"text":"Beautiful location and amazing service. We made a reservation for a Tuesday night and it was fairly busy. Service was attentive and quick. We got the Laska soup and pad Thai to share, but the winning dish was the surf and turf crispy rice salad. Woah. The rice had a meaty flavor and was crunchy along the bottom and the beef was cooked perfectly. It came along a side of basil salad and pickled veggies.   Cocktails were also a hot. I got a version of the Aperol spritz and it was perfectly balanced."}
{"text":"This is definitely a spot to come for an evening with friends and it showed. Upbeat music with outdoor seating with those patio party lights. Inside its mote dimly lit, music lounge tans it's a bit a stuffy. Food and service though? Awesome. Pad thai was surprisingly good, full of flavor, nice big crispy shrimp and a fair portion. It wasn't as spicy as I expected but that may have been for the better as the flavor itself is present throughout. The pad thai was to have braised pork but I only could taste it in a few bites which was kind of a let down. The salad was ok all present, I tried some the veggie bowl, but thought is was a bit high, although again the portion was fair. Still really good and a unique take on the entrees but not the best Vietnamese I've had. The outdoor ambience with friends I think is the big draw, I'd say 3.5-4 stars."}
{"text":"vietnamese pub. Great little jewel in plateau. superb food at good price = price quality ratio spot on ! combined with fun and courteous service - you can't go wrong here. was lucky enough to enjoy the patio. love it !"}
{"text":"More 2.5 stars.  Really more of a Vietnamese Fusion if thats what you want to call it.  If you know and love authentic Vietnamese cuisine then this will not cut it. We had gone strictly because were meeting a celebration party and the group had decided on this restaurant. We all settled on a prefixed menu at $40 per person. Starts with Edamame with a delicious seasoning. Then it starts to go down hill. Some kind of a papaya mango salad that was too spicy and soggy! Almost everyone (11 out of 15) said the same. Next was sliced beef with stale shrimp chips! The beef was tasty but all the accompanying green salad and shrimp chips were again soggy. Then imperial rolls that were supposed to be wrapped in lettuce leafs for dipping. The lettuce, mint leaves, and cilantro had seen better days. Instead if being fresh crisp lettuce it looked like they had been sitting out and wilted. The main dishes of 2 shrimps and some pork in a pad thai was  overcooked and way too soft! 3 other couples said the same thing. The Salmon was the last on the service and that was not bad.  The meal took so long to come out it was 3.5 hours into the night and it was 11 pm. Desert was supposed to be part of the meal but when we asked they told us the kitchen was closed! Not impressed with the meal so far everyone just went with the flow and said our fair wells! All in all if you want a $$$\"hipster Vietnamese fusion\" experience and you're not fussy about eating \"mushy\" Pad Thai then you picked the right place! Our bill came out to $115.00 with a diet coke! Seriously this is way too much for what we got."}
{"text":"J'habite juste à côté,  et c'est bon de savoir qu'il y a un très  vietnamien à deux coins de rue de chez soi.  Le cadre est très cosy et chaleureux et j'ai eu la chance de profiter de la terasse: très agréable face au parc Jeanne mance.  Pour ce qui est de la nourriture c'est vraiment très bon ce que j'ai goûté que ce soit la soupe coco où encore les dés de boeuf en wok. D'ailleurs pour le menu lunch ça n'a coûté que 16$. Je reviendrai très rapidement pour essayer d'autres mets sur la carte. Je recommande vivement cette place."}
{"text":"Côté désappointement, eh bien, on est servi. C'est du vietnamien de boutique. Pas trop mauvais mais pas du tout authentique. Ma copine est très sensible au MSG et a du prendre un bon café, à la maison, pour se calmer le système.  Pour les Réservations, il faudra corriger le tir. Ils ne répondent pas au téléphone et leur message vous suggère d'envoyer un courriel, alors que le maître des lieux me dit qu'ils n'ont pas le temps de les lire. Le service est très collégial, c'est a dire pas très professionnel et inégal selon le talent de chacun. C'est un peu cher pour la qualité et ne sont pas à la hauteur pour les journées de grande affluence."}
{"text":"I did think it was definitely a-ok! The room is beautiful, I love the light and decor and the service was friendly. It's comfortable and elegant and not too fussy and it's location across from the park is dreamy.   The food didn't blow me away but I did like the pad thai I had with it's super soft and savoury pork, the ingredients all tasted fresh and clean and delicate. (I know, not a good authentic choice for a Vietnamese place but I had a craving.) I would love to go back to try some of their delicious sounding cocktails. One of my dining companions was pretty bummed by the broth in her soup so I'd avoid that and explore more of the small plates next time."}
{"text":"Hà c'est le genre de restaurant consistant qui ne déçoit jamais. J'aime bien le Hà! J'aime particulièrement le Hà en été à cause de sa charmante petite terrasse.   Lors de ma plus récente visite j'ai pu goûter aux fleurs de courgettes farcies aux crevette (spécial du jour), la soupe laksa, les rouleaux impériaux, les buns, le tataki de buf, et le fameux Pad Thaï. J'étais pas seule à manger tout ça en passant. En effet, c'est l'fun de partager au Hà. Pis c'est encore plus l'fun de partager une bouteille de vin aussi. Ou deux... parce qu'on est vraiment bien sur la terrasse!"}
{"text":"On s'est régalés avec un pâté impérial de porc en entrée et un pad thaï. Tout était là, les pâtes parfaitement cuites, la fraîcheur des légumes croquants et la cacahuète ! Nos amis qui connaissaient l'endroit ont pris le boeuf grillé, un régal !"}
{"text":"Pros: Nice seating, Outdoor patio, Fusion food  Cons: Service, Prices  -Ambiance-  A nice place to grab lunch or dinner if you're in the mood for Viet food with a bit of a twist. The service for us was not so great but we could have overlooked that. We had the lunch menu and it offered a good variation. The prices range from 10-28$ for lunch. Tbh a bit pricey for a  Vietnamese person who's use to paying less/nothing for her people's food.   -Food- Coconut Soup: It came with the lunch, you had a choice of soup or papaya salad, I thought it was OK nothing too great. Think of a thai coconut red curry in a lighter soup version with some noodles.   Thai Papaya Salad: This was a solid app, the fresh vegetables are mixed in a well balanced and flavoured sauce. Lacked a little spiciness kick that I'm use to.   Banh Mì: Ok, so I am use to paying 3$ for banh mi so when we ordered this for 14$ I was expecting to be blown away. Unfortunately that was not the case, don't get me wrong it was good but I expected more for the price. The bread is grilled and the whole sandwich was warm.   Catch of the Day aka Octopus /Pieuvre:  The dish that saved this place from 3 star rating, so you should kinda get it.  It was a serving of grilled octopus served with asparagus, watercress and other vegetable mix. The octopus was tender and well marinated. The dish really did keep true to Vietnamese flavours, from the octopus marinade to the salad vinaigrette to the side dipping sauce. A dish worth its price and worth a revisit.   -Overall-  A step up in price and ambiance from your usual Viet cozy/crazy restaurants. You're paying for a prettier seating plan and a twist on flavours."}
{"text":"Saw a review for one of the best salad rolls in Montreal. As a sucker for Vietnamese food, I had to come try it.   Instead of ordering salad rolls, I ordered a papaya salad, chef wings, and the grilled beef dish - and yes, this is all for myself. Papaya salad was blend, lacked acidity from limes, and the unique flavors of fish sauce. Despite asking for extra spicy for the wings, they were barely any heat. I might have a high spice tolerant, but I know what's spicy for a normal person. The only thing I enjoyed was the beef. The broccoli was lightly battered, beef was medium rare (though the cut wasn't the best), and the additional fish sauce with peanuts that added a punch to both the beef and vegetables. I wish they could have had that sauce for the papaya salad.   The restaurant is hipster, with communal tables inside and a patio outside. I hated parking around the area because it's all permit only, except for meters along the front streets, which were fully occupied during dinner time."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes! YES!!!!!!! This place is absolutely amazing. It was EXTREMELY warm in Hà, almost unbearably so, but the food and alcohol made up for it! Drinks were on point. Food made your mouth start drooling as soon as it was served. I can honestly say I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"\"HA HA\" on us!   My experience dining at this restaurant started with trying to find a parking spot on a Sunday night at 7:00pm. Parking was very challenging and I circled for half an hour trying to find one. Finally found one a 15 minute walk away from the restaurant.    I was referred to this restaurant by a neighbor.  Very bad decision. The food and staff was terribly disappointing.  It started out quick but then very long gap between appetizers and main courses.   I ordered a glass of wine, (waitress never came back to see if another one was wanted during my meal). She forgot to order/serve the jasmine rice we ordered and it came towards the end of the meal. Asked for soy sauce and she forgot to bring it, and eventually, after a second request another waiter brought it. Lots of staff, but  grabbing a staff member was trying, as they run back and forth from inside to outside. (Made for far from a relaxing meal when you are seated near the entrance.) Upon seeing previous reviews, we ordered the pad thai with crispy shrimp. There was nothing crispy about the shrimp! It arrived with 4 shrimps (3 were RAW) and the pad thai noodles were soft and overcooked. Manager offered to make us more shrimp but we declined. We were already there a long time and  it was terribly hot inside, with no fan in site. When the waitress brought the bill, she placed it on the table saying that something else was coming from the kitchen. The restaurant offered us as compensation a $7.00 tapioca, fruit and nut desert.  The $19.00 pad thai with shrimp dish remained on the bill. I was stunned. They should have removed the pad thai and shrimp dish from the bill AND given us the desert complimentary! They made a very poor choice trying to keep this customer satisfied, and unfortunately, we did too by choosing to dine here. They should be ashamed of themselves for not taking the shrimp and pad thai dish off our bill. We could NOT eat it! I will be posting a review on trip advisor as well."}
{"text":"( j'avais mis cet avis pour le bar à la même adresse car le resto venait d'ouvrir...) Ce resto est devenu sur le coup mon resto vietnamien haut de gamme préféré! Je cherchais un endroit sympathique pour inviter ma blonde à notre moins unième anniversaire de mariage et je tombe sur une publication Facebook mentionnant l'ouverture cette semaine de ce restaurant. Ma future et moi, on aime bien l'asiatique! :) Lorsque j'appelle pour réserver, on nous avise que le resto est en rodage pour la semaine et que certains plats ne seront peut-être pas disponibles tout de suite...  ça tombe bien, notre couple est en rodage aussi !!   Et bien, hier soir, le rodage semblait complété avec succès! Nous avons été servi et conseillé avec classe par le sympathique William, qui a été très généreux dans son approche. On s'est bien amusé aussi avec le sympathique \"porteur d'eau\" ;)   Nous avons dégusté tous les plats servis avec délice. Les arômes et saveurs étaient à point. Nos préférences dans l'ordre:  Bun crevettes, Salade de papaye , Ailes de poulets, Pad Thai au porc.  Ce copieux repas a fait en sorte qu'on a pas pu prendre de desserts...    La carte des vins est très intéressante mais commence à un prix assez élevés, $50 ... on aurait aimer un peu moins , mais ceci permets probablement de garder le prix des plats plus bas.  Le vin a été servi frais ce qui est excellent, car c'est souvent pas le cas dans certain resto du coin.  Bref, Tout était parfait, une belle soirée et un établissement que je vais recommander à tous mes amis."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a recommendation by another restaurant that was booked - which was lovely of them to share. Try the wings! The Green Tea ice cream! The Octopus was pretty good but a tad bit over cooked - a MOST common thing. Still - it was NOT rubber like is often the case! The space is beautiful and the wait staff was delightful. Oh! And the spicy edamame was delish too! It is quiet enough that you can have a conversation and while it is listed as Vietnamese - it was more like Asian fusion to my way of thinking. A very lovely evening."}
{"text":"Parfait endroit pour un repas savoureux, frais et une grosse touche d'exotisme. Retourner pour un souper de couple apres plusieurs années et quel bonheur de retrouver ces saveurs que j'avais un peu manqué. Sumon lait de coco asperges oeuf frit salade de papaye , boeuf tout était delicieux le service attentionné; Mr Hà serait très fier."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food ! My colleagues organized a surprise dinner for my birthday at this place and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"What a perfect place for a lunch on the terrace. And in the evening the perfect place to eat and have a nice glass of wine. Everything on the menu is very well done. Explore a new dish and trust them to do it well. The rolls are a must as an entrée and the soup is great. Really I trust them so much the last time I was there I ordered a fried rice dish that could be boring or too commercial and it was amazing. Last point the service is usually exceptional. That is all."}
{"text":"Nous avons aimé que le resto soit ouvert et accueillant en fin de soirée (un vendredi, tout de même). C'est un resto qui peut-être assez bruyant (genre resto branché) et nous avons préféré nous asseoir au petit comptoir qui sépare la mezzanine du plancher parce qu'on était un peu trop collés sur l'autre table de deux et il fallait parler un peu fort pour s'entendre. Encore une fois, c'était un vendredi soir... Nous avons pris un cocktail et des entrées, rien à dire, c'était bon sauf une chose qui n'est pas spécifique à ce restaurant mais à PLUSIEURS restaurants de Montréal: on ne peut pas poser sa fourchette (ou ses baguettes) dans une assiette vide qu'on s'empresse de venir nous l'enlever. Je pense que la serveuse, fort gentille au demeurant, est venue 4 ou cinq fois de suite enlever chaque assiette que nous terminions (c'était des entrées). C'est stressant, ça donne l'impression qu'on attend après nous, etc. Laissez-nous finir tranquillement nos repas, svp! C'est pas la fin du monde de laisser une assiette vide devant des clients qui sont encore en train de mâcher leur dernière bouchée! Merci."}
{"text":"Pretty decor, love the ambiance. A lot of small dishes to choose from and good for sharing. Nice wine menu and yummy cocktails. Staff is generally friendly, service is average nothing exceptional. The pad Thai is pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day. Gorgeously designed. Immediately fell in love because most Vietnamese places are very bare bones hole in the walls. Not the case here. We tried the vegan pho and the lemongrass chicken vermicelli. The pho was hard to get behind because you just can't get the same rich flavors of pho broth with just vegetables. The vermicelli was soooo good. Also had a cocktail which was so good. I wanted to just go down the list of cocktails. I may just do that one day!  Oh and their bar, Nhau, is in the basement!  I know exactly where you are now, Nhau."}
{"text":"I was verrry curious about Ha when it first opened on Mont Royal. I finally tried it with a friend of mine last week for lunch. At first, we were disappointed with the limited lunch menu compared to the extensive dinner menu online. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Lunch includes a soup or papaya salad so here's what we ordered in the end:   1. Coconut soup - SO flavourful. Exactly the mix of tangy, creamy and salty with a kick from a Southeast Asian soup.   2. Imperial rolls - We shared the deep fried rolls with veggies and fish sauce on the side. Really tasty!   3. Catch of the Day: Grilled octopus with rice and watercress salad - The combo of all three were perfect in this dish... The smokiness from the grill, the sesame from the rice and the acidity from the salad with watercress and pickled onions.   4. Five spice shrimp - You can never really go wrong with anything five-spice, and this shrimp did not disappoint. It's super satisfying and goes very well with the rice and sauteed veggies on the side.   Most DEFINITELY would recommend Ha for lunch! I will definitely be coming back for their dinner menu on a pleasant evening to sit on their terrace!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Nems and great Pad Thai.  A little noisy though.  Great service and nice place  Will come back"}
{"text":"Had a girls night here a few weeks ago and I really had a great time. We didn't have a reservation, and it was a Friday night, but they managed to find us a table within 10 min. The decor and ambiance is really nice. It's definitely not the normal, casual vietnamese restaurant you're used to. We had the edamame with herbs & lime, and the crispy tofu to share. As the main dish I had the Hà's Pad Thai with braised pork & crispy shrimp, which was fantastic. It's a little bit more expensive than the normal vietnamese food you get but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"First of all I think the owners should update their current website to include the new old port location. To avoid confusion, if you reserve online it's for the mont royal location. So make sure you google Hà on William and then the address and phone number will appear so that you can call and reserve ahead time. You will definitely need to reserve because it can get quite busy. I came here with my aunt yesterday night (Saturday) at 7:15pm and we stayed till 10 pm. At first the restaurant was half empty but by eight pm or so it was packed and we were seated at the bar because all the tables were reserved. Luckily I like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders and watch them make drinks.  I tried their Bloody Caesar which has sake in it. It was very good and spicy. FYI I told the bartender that I like it spicy. Afterwards I couldn't pick which cocktail I wanted and the bartender told me he would create one. So he made me a spicy drink that consisted of a rum, pastis, a splash of Earl grey, lime juice and a red chili pepper. It was surprisingly good considering  I don't like the taste of black liquorice and that is what pastis tastes like. I guess he didn't put much. He said it was to counteract the sweetness of the rum. These bartenders know what they are doing!  My aunt and I shared the papaya salad and the pork buns. The buns come in twos so it's perfect to share with another person. I was surprised that the bun was black because I'm used to seeing white buns. The bartender said it's because they use squid ink to make it black. I feel like they should put that on the menu because most people like squid ink. The dough was good and soft. I just wish they had more pork in it because it was a lot of dough. I prefer the pork buns from Satay Brothers.  For mains we shared the pork and shrimp pad Thai and the classic coconut salmon. The pad Thai was quite big and it had about four big shrimps in it. The salmon was good too and so tasty. If you like coconut I recommend it. These plates are meant for sharing so go and try a few things."}
{"text":"Le nouveau \"Hà\" est très sympa, bouffe/menu (takaki de boeuf/poulet frit/saumon lait de coco), nouvel intérieur moderne & design, petite terrasse en avant, très bon service, j'y retourne dès que j'en ai la chance ! Il y avait déjà pas mal de gens et personnalités artistiques même pour un mercredi soir lors de ma visite. Ça va être assurément très populaire comme endroit couru dorénavant sur Mont-Royal."}
{"text":"This cute place has a small terrace in front of the restaurant. It also seems to be very popular with locals and visitors.   It's not your typical Asian food restaurant, it's little bit more upscale, the portions are smaller and more expensive than what you could find in Chinatown. That being said, their tartare is amazing, the food is simply delicious.   The service is friendly and attentive as well, so despite the price, I would definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and it was outstanding! I had the coconut soup, shared an imperial roll and I had the Grilled Beef with House Satay Sauce. Simply amazing. Service was great. Second time here and it's really worth it. Last time I had M. Hà's Classic Coconut Salmon and it was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Nous étions un groupe et pour plusieurs c'était une première au restaurant Hà;nous arrivons tôt à 18 et même à 2 de plus , on nous accommode. Pour les amateurs, il y a la terrasse, mais en cette journée d'automne en canicule, c'était trop chaud pour la majorité. Le menu midi se résume à une page, et le menu complet est hors limite. On y trouve un choix de spécialité dont les rouleaux impériaux servis fuselés qu'on doit manger en laitue ou la salade de papaye , délicieuse et très relevée avec beaucoup de coriandre. La soupe coco a semblé plaire à ceux l'ayant sélectionnés. Le service est bien et les explications et suggestions avenantes. Je choisis le pad thai aux crevettes avec tofu et porc qui ne déçoit pas. Plusieurs ont pris l'excellent tartare de saumon.La présentation des plats et belles et appétissante, et la qualité supérieure. Pour un groupe, le service est cordial et efficace, je ne compte plus les verres d'eau.  Une nourriture excellente et un prix qui reflète la grande qualité. On y retourne certainement."}
{"text":"Very cool Viet fusion restaurant. Went here during new years eve.  The set menu was great. Also a very cool collection of Quebec craft beers. Waiters were very attentive."}
{"text":"In both location (Mt royal or Old port) the terrace location is a must. You can't reserve on the terrace, so come early. With a sunny weather, you will feel on vacation!  Few month ago, I tried Hà mt royal (3 times) for diner and today I tried the one located on Old port for lunch.   The menu is the same in both locations. But, the buns are not available for lunch.  I went with a special person, my mom:) We both ordered the soup coco and we both loved it. The flavor of coco and spices  makes that soup exotic. It is a must to start lunch with it, in summer or winter. Vegetable Spring rolls are crunchy and the papaya salad is fresh. Their coco salmon is available for lunch and diner and i would highly recommend it in addition to the yummy shrimp & pork Pad Thai. I noticed that both dishes were revised in the old port restaurant.  Finally, we had both deserts proposed on the lunch menu, the small tapioca and the green tea ice cream. These were the perfect ending for this lunch.  Lets not forget to mention the service that was really fast despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded on this Wednesday afternoon."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup la decoration, cuisine asiatique fusion, la musique un peu forte, bon service, la qualité de mon tartare saumon respectable."}
{"text":"The terrasse is pretty on a summer's night - it's lit with string lights and filled with flowers. Definitely would sit outside if you can (no resos taken for the terrasse, but you can sit at the bar and wait for a spot to open up). As for food, I'd recommend the black buns with shrimp, the spicy chicken wings, and the pad thai. It's a little pricey for the portion size, but the food is delicious. They also have interesting cocktails - twists on classics like the old fashioned and the Aperol spritz."}
{"text":"My friend invited me to lunch here and I got super excited to see laksa on the menu. I was disappointed to find this did not make the cut for their lunch menu, but quickly came around when I took a sip of my Coconut Soup--SO good. We also enjoyed their very tasty Imperial Rolls to start and split the Catch of the Day (Octopus) and the 5 Spice Shrimp Wok for the mains. Every dish we had was stellar and the ambiance is great--very nice terrace if the weather permits. Can't wait to go back for dinner to try the laksa."}
