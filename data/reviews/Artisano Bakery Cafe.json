{"text":"It may be a chain in a strip mall in the middle of nowhere, but this place is as good as it gets for Suburbia. The gourmet sandwiches are delicious and not overpriced, the casual atmosphere and free WiFi make it pleasant to hang out and get some work done, and the smoothies hit the spot in hot weather. Love the freshly baked bread, too!"}
{"text":"My first time here was yesterday, at first I was confused and wasn't sure if you were supposed to wait to be seated or not but you pretty much order, get the food when the buzzer given to you goes off, then seat yourself. The atmosphere was very nice and relaxing. Workers were nice. I ordered the chicken Caesar sandwich which had chicken, bacon, lettuce, fire dried tomatoes (I substituted for regular tomatoes) and a hot mustard mayo which was delish. I would've preferred more sauce, some parts were dry but the chicken Caesar salad definitely made up for some dry (sauceless) parts of the sandwich. The salad was really fresh, crisp, cold and the lettuce was juicy. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The space is bigger than you'd think, and there's a good mix of seating: bench, comfy chairs and regular chairs. Free wifi and an pretty good menu from lunch to light suppers, plus baked goods and coffee.   It's a little cafeteria style where you order your food, pay, and then get a buzzer for when it's ready for pick-up. Unless it's the weekend brunch menu - then it gets delivered to your table.   Went for brunch with some friends and did not have the best service experience. For a first time visit, I didn't realize their breakfast ended at noon on weekends (was there past 12) and the cashier didn't bother telling me about the brunch menu. My friend pointed it out and then I was back in line after a wander over to the menu.  Brunch paid for we went and gave our orders for how we wanted our eggs and what sides we wanted. My friends had Your Style Eggs where one asked for only bacon, one asked for NO bacon or sausage and more egg and potatoes. I had the omlette and asked for everything. Even tho the guy wrote down how we wanted our eggs and sides, it came out wrong. Bacon and sausages for both my friends, and we had to send it back - especially because my 2nd friend can't have pork at all. Bacon was kind of papery-thin, like the microwaveable ones. Also, had to ask for ketchup 2x before we actually got it.  Overall the food itself I found was average. Nothing special, and might be a little on the bland side from what my friends said of theirs. I'd rather that than over-salted, but there wasn't much flavouring in the potatoes either. Basic. You could easily do this yourself, if not better, at home.  Still, the place was hopping. Lots of people of different ages having all kinds of food from their menu, from soups, salads and pizzas. I'd be willing to try it again, but maybe not for breakfast - unless I make it before noon, or 11am on weekdays. They also have free wifi, which gives it an extra bump."}
{"text":"great due to +++++ seating and FREE wifi coffee/teas pretty good my salad today was DRENCHED in dressing despite a specific request to put dressing on the side (staff polite/helpful, but a bit absent-minded).... good overall as a workspace but food is so so!  power outlets in middle section great for laptops."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place like a rabbi running a synagogue back in my university days to study with my younger sister & a few friends. Free Wi-Fi, very handsome Persian(?) Italian(?) co-manager/co-owner (unfortunately, it seems he does not work evenings or weekends 'cuz no sighting of his scrumptious ass anywhere during my very recent visit), spacious clean interiors, beautifully-lit, free refills on coffee-- Can't say enough good things about this place.   I came back here after very many years ('cuz I moved too far away) on Sunday, February 24, 2013 with my church friends (there were 20 of us). This large booth that accommodated all but 4 people was pretty darn impressive. It's a special reservation-only table but there were no scary RESERVED signs so we all plonked our butts down. LMFAO. Anyway, the danishes & New York Cheesecake are to die for! Some of their tarts/cakes/pies look like they're from Dufflet which would explain why all their chocolaty stuff is divine but chocolate is chocolate & all chocolate is f@cking fantastic. I have no standards for chocolate (unless it's the cheap, yucktastic oversweetened supermarket crap like Russell Stover, Pot of Gold, Nestlé, Hershey's, etc.) so I wouldn't trust my judgment or standards on chocolaty things if I were you. However, there was no chocolate goodness in sight. I 100% assume it was sold out 'cuz how in blazes is a bakery/café to survive without chocolate? It's career suicide.   I did not enjoy their Café au Lait at a previous trip because there was too much whipped cream that was waaay too cloying & cooled everything down very quickly-- but their BALT (Bacon Avocado Lettuce Tomato) with Chicken (I did not check the menu again on my most recent visit to see if they still had it. So stupid of me!) was amazing on their multi-grain bread. It was huge & everything was very fresh, well-seasoned, gorgeous."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my friends on May 20 2013 arrived around 12:30pm.  That day the weather was nice the patio was full. So we grabbed a table to seat 7 plus baby. Great casual environment for kids. Big and roomy. No rush to leave because seats are first come first serve. There is wifi too.   This is a Self serve cafe.  You Line up, order, pay and you will have to wait at the table with your buzzer.   The menu had a great selection of gourmet sandwiches. (Prices range over $10 and under $15) I really enjoyed what I ordered. Turkey, Brie & Green Apple on Ciabatta bun inside there was dried cranberry mayo and arugula. I never had such a refreshing sandwich. the sour green apple and brie complimented each other. the cranberry mayo was delicious! the ciabatta bun was fresh non toasted. It came with a tiny pasta side (plain olive oil mixture with some herbs) and I bought a OJ juice box as my drink. The bakery cafe serve alcohol too. For those who like to enjoy wine mid day.   It was a Clean, quite, bright environment. Great for family, kids and students doing their homework. The washrooms were clean. Menu is great but not much pictures to give me an idea what I am ordering.   I definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Lots of different seating options with spacious tables and free wifi, perfect for studying!  Apparently they'll have gelato come summer time! The food is pretty mediocre and a little on the pricey side. I got the strawberry and chocolate cupcake which was good though a bit dry . The canned mango spritzer was nothing special and the chai latte was pretty good. My friends got soup and gave it thumbs up, but I don't think I would get the salads again... If this place added Whole Food's salad bar for the same price or cheaper than Whole Foods, I would give it 5 stars, easy. But I'm just dreaming...  What I really LOVE about this place for now, is the pop and coffee.  UNLIMITED refills FTW!  Update March 10th 2011: I've decided to give this place 4 stars instead of 3 because, let's be honest here, there MUST be a reason why I just keep coming back to this place!  I've been here every single day of the week and so far it seems as though Sunday afternoons are the busiest, so stay away if you're planning to study at that time.  More things I've tried recently:  1) Cranberry Protein Pillow ($4.99): it tasted very healthy, but also heavy because it's jam packed with lots of different things (cranberry, white and rye flours, soy beans, oats, sunflower and flax seeds, cranberries and almonds)   2) Ciabatta Bun (68 cents?): if you need a small snack, this bread is perfect. It's nice and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside, perfect! It tastes much better with real butter, not the packaged whipped butter...  3) Cream of Broccoli Soup ($4.59): I definitely finished it way too fast, burnt my tongue in the process... yummmy!  4) Butternut Squash Agnolotti ($9.99): This one is definitely my favorite dish here so far (fresh agnolotti stuffed with a butternut squash puree, baby spinach, cherry tomatoes, in a creamy blush sauce topped with parmiggiano cheese and fresh parsley).  5) Roast Beef Melt ($8.99): The bread and the horseradish mayo are what made this sandwich so delicious. It was also super filling, bonus points!! (Roast Beef, fire dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, swiss cheese and horseradish mayo). Comes with a pickle and a side of your choice (apple, chips or macaroni salad).   6) The Canadian ($8.99): It was a little too sweet for my taste but those who love Honey Mustard will love it.   7)  White Chocolate Pistachio Cookie: Tasted very homemade, but not chewy enough.  8) Bacon & Cheese Focaccia Bread: It was like a pizza with a super thick crust and no pizza sauce, but I really enjoyed the distinct taste of rosemary in the bread.  9) Carrot Cake: It was pretty pricey at over $6 a slice, but it was gigantic. The mysterious chunks of fruit and other things might find itself to be a bit repulsive to others but I kind of liked it because it gave each bite a little surprise... a good surprise!  10) Cheesecake: It was pretty pricey but the size was decent (it better have been!). It wasn't amazing, but it was still A-Ok! Note: It has a thicker texture than the Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes which are normally really smooth, and obviously much tastier."}
{"text":"Never been here before. I found this place on yelp doing a search for \"Bakery\"  I needed some pastries for a party and decided to give this place a try.  Was disappointed with the lack of selection available.   I saw some portuguese tarts and thought perfect! I ask the counter clerk if they were in fact portuguese tarts just to confirm. She didn't seem to know. The other clerk overheard me asking and mentioned some story about how some person comes in from out of town specifically to order these tarts.  I paid $1.85 for each which I thought was a bit pricy, however I did not care for I am a big fan of these tarts and was running out of time.  Arriving at the party we discovered the crust was extremely chewy. The tarts just fell apart trying to eat them. My guess is that they were well over a few days old or they were previously frozen.  All in all I am sure this place is great if you want to just come in, sit and enjoy a hot beverage or soup the be counter pastries I will advise to be weary."}
{"text":"My favourite bakery/cafe!  The food is always hot/fresh though understandably you have to wait a little bit for the sandwiches to be made.  My favourite is the Chicken, Grilled Vegetables, and Goat Cheese panini, so delicious/filling and served on fresh bread.  The wifi and $2/all-day-refillable coffee is a great plus as well.  The fruit smoothies are great as well as the salads. I haven't had any of the soups there yet so I can't comment on those. The desserts are decadent and yummy too though if a tad expensive.  =T  Also if the wifi isn't working, if you let them know they will reset the modem for you, since I seem to have this issue half the time I go there tbh."}
{"text":"Artisano appears very upscale from the exterior but surprised me with its down to earth lack of pretentiousness, good food, abundant and varied dark brown vinyl  seating, free Wifi,  self service and strange fake flower décor.   Place your order at the counter and return when the battery operated portable buzzer goes off.   My Reuben sandwich was delicious and Likeaphenomena loved her cream of asparagus soup, Greek salad and freshly baked bread.  It's the kind of place that my Uncle Vinny would like (if I had an Uncle Vinny).  Come here, meet your friends, eat and do some business."}
{"text":"This cafe is great not only for its food options but also for the versatility of the place. It is a great place to study, catch up with friends, dinner with the family, and more. Bottomless coffee, free samples, homely interior, and free wifi are just a few merits of this establishment. The food options are great and rally against restaurant quality foods. The pizza especially are a must buy! Also, an older population tends to dine here often insuring a calm and relaxed atmosphere. Plus, the parking lot have a lot of spectucular cars to gawk at. This place is a great, homely, and somewhere you will keep coming back and back!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great place for a free WIFI breakfast meeting.  Lots of good fresh food and coffee"}
{"text":"Fast service, mor a very wide selection of food, this place could have a better coffee quality"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Artisano Bakery Cafe for awhile now, but didn't want to drive that far. I was so excited when I passed by their new location in North York. Finally decided to check out Artisano Bakery Cafe today and find out what it is all about.  Walking in, you immediately smell the warm bread.  The place is new and fresh, nice Italian cafe style feel with warm cozy decoration.  It has a big sit down area for a a bakery cafe.  You would order first, and be given a buzzer. Once the food is ready, they will buzz you to go pick up the food at the counter.    I ordered French Toast with Caffe Latte. Breakfast is only served until 12pm, just FYI.  The French Toast was decently good...halfway through, it started to taste a bit soggy but still good. It was served on a tray...which was kinda strange. They put paper on top of the tray, and had the French Toast placed right on it. This would work well if it was a sandwich ..or fries etc. However, because you would pour maple syrup over the French Toast, it made the paper a bit soggy ...since the syrup would soak through.  The latte was good, but a bit watery for my taste. Maybe it was the milk they use...or the foam...it was just a  bit lacking taste.    I would still go back and give other menu items a try...will try their sandwich next time."}
{"text":"Get the French toast! Seriously, you won't regret it, and neither will your wallet.   They have Dufflet's pastries, which I'm a sucker for. They have wifi, which I am a sucker for. They have free samples - who doesn't love free samples? I've yet to try anything but pastries and breakfast things, but I bet the lunch items are great as well.   Also, they offer a nice $16.99 dinner and movie special. Seeing as a movie checks in at $12.00 now anyway, you might as well get a $5 meal at this gem of a place before you see it!"}
{"text":"I tried to come here for lunch the other day, but discovered that my new obsession has closed for renovations until September.   Come back soon!"}
{"text":"Artisano's is quickly becoming my preferred place to do work in this area. Comfortable, wifi, plugs, decent food, and bottomless coffee, what else can you ask for? The holy pent-inity of work-able cafes.   A bottomless cup of joe is $2, and the paninis are nicely melted and sufficiently cheesy. All meals run about $10. Salads are average, but the breads they use for their sandwiches and paninis are fresh and make for a good sandwich.  I've yet to try the pizzas.   Assortment of baked goods caught me eye and seriously makes me consider breaking my new years resolutions only one week in. Stay strong... stay strong... until the next time we meet, Display-Case-of-Great-Looking-Pastries."}
{"text":"I've been here 2x in two days for lunch.   Large hearty sandwiches on fresh bread of all kinds, great coffee, free wifi. I could see this is a potential Coffice, although I have yet to use it at that.   Both times I got take out, but the place is self serve. Grab a table and order your food and get a number or pager. They have soups, salads, sandwiches, paninis and pizzas. There are some breakfast items too. Lots of pastries that look yummy.   Both times I got a panini.  There's something about a toasted sandwich vs a regular cold sandwich. There is tons of choice, so I wind up standing for 5 minutes reading. First time I got the Steak and Provolone, and 2nd time I got the Vegan Roasted Veggies. For the Steak, it was a perfect combination of tastes on a toasty hot cibatta. For my 2nd sandwich, I changed the recommended bread. Note, I think it got more the 1st time since the bread was bigger.   Combo comes with Salad, and Apple or Chips. Chips were yummy and all natural. $9.99. I saved half my sandwich for dinner!  Coffee is $1.99 and very tasty. Compare with SBx across the street.   They also sell fresh bread of all types, includes Spelt, and a Ancient Grain (Kamut, Millet Spelt etc Blend). Spelt one is 90% Spelt, 10% Rye. $4.99  Make sure to ask about their free rewards card! You get points for your purchases to redeem free stuff. Just by activating online I got a free cookie!  Wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if in the area, great lunch/meeting/work place.   They also cater."}
{"text":"I work in this area since finding this place my lunches have become sooo much more enjoyable. The food is great (you get sides with your sandwich), they've got beer if the morning was tough, and an amazing patio.  If you have to do a quick lunch, you may want to to go elsewhere...This place gets busy and for one reason or another sometimes it takes quick sometime to get your sandwich, other than that, it's great.  Finally tasty, cheap, and fairly healthy lunch choices in this area!"}
{"text":"As a previous Yelper noticed the place is close for renovation until September. This is a brand new place and did not need renos. Sounds like something is happening, either searching for a new franchisee or just the dreaded \"closed for renovations\". No work was apparent a few days ago. As of November 17th, it has a new sign, a Mexican eatery.   They were never renovating. Maybe trying to find a \"sucker\" to pay a franchise fee. Artisano head office shame on you!  This took them from from a very high rating, to the lowest. Please try to respect your customers by being honest."}
{"text":"WOW! Yum! This place was completely unexpected.  My company is moving into our first real offices in a few weeks - we were there for a tour of the new space (on Lesmill Road, currently under construction) and decided to stop for lunch too... preview our options in the area!   This is located in a plaza with a bunch of other establishments - a Fox & Fiddle-type pub, a big Chinese buffet, Starbucks, Pizzaiolio,   YUMMERS! I'm a sucker for bread, as we know. The bread here is fantastic and fresh - you can also buy loaves to take home.  For $9.69 you can choose two of: - half bowl of soup (still huge) - half sandwich (from their classic cafe sandwiches, gourmet sandwiches and grilled paninis)  - half salad (eight to choose from)  I got the above deal - soup/sandwich. I chose the \"Grilled Vegetables, Portobello & Arugula on Multigrain\" (Grilled peppers, eggplant, zucchini, portobello mushrooms, arugula, red onions with a nut-free basil pesto & lentil hummus). It was great! I couldn't eat the whole thing, however... I also got the cream of broccoli soup which was to DIE for. I was also a little hungover, admittedly, so the saltiness of the soup made me come back to life.  There were three others in my party - one got the same deal as me, but got the pumpkin soup and the gourmet turkey/avocado sandwich; the others got the classic chicken breast (had a ton of veggies on it) sandwich and a turkey BLT-type thing on amazing cheese foccacia. The place was efficient, clean, seemed like a great place to meet people or to get work done by yourself...   We will definitely be frequenting this place once we move in!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty big bakery/cafe.  There's chairs.  I've only had coffee here.  I don't know if I'd dine here.  But it's a good place to meet up with people, as there's lots of space."}
{"text":"Artisano looks like a nice fancy place when you first walk in - you rare see places like this uptown in North York.  However, when you buy your food, it's such a calm and laid back place to chat with your friends and to go on the Internet (free wi-fi!)  I had ordered a tureky avocado sandwich and it was sooo good.  It was quite large - I wish I had ordered the special where I could've had a half sandwich and half soup (the soup looked really good as well).    I heard the pasta there is fairly good as well - but I didn't get an opportunity to try that.  Would definitely come to visit again."}
{"text":"CLOSED??? Say it ain't so. I really loved this place. I remember coming here a few times before and I would always get the New York style cheese cake. The cheese was so rich, smooth and creamy and it had the perfect sweetness to cure my sweet tooth. I would usually get a hazelnut coffee or cappuccino to wash down the wonderful cheese cake. Croissants were also a nice snack to have here. I remember one time when the server forgot to bring us our drinks she gave us a free muffin on the house. That was so nice of her. After that experience I was hoping they would forget my drink again in the future but it never happened again. Sad to see this place go and there are no other locations near my area. Hope one opens up in the Markham or Scarborough area soon."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my friend before heading to the mall. We must have came here at a perfect time because we didn't have to line up at all. But when we left, there was a huge line up just to order food.  I got half sandwich and half a bowl of soup for $9.49.  The southern pulled pork sandwich was on a calabrese bun and the pulled pork was topped with a coleslaw. It took a while for them to make the sandwich so I expected a warm dish. Thus I was a bit disappointed when I bit into the sandwich and it was cold to room temperature. However, the sandwich was tasty.  The split pea and ham soup was decent, not too salty and they gave a generous portion.  For $10, it may be a bit pricey but it's filling since the soup was a nice portion, the sandwich was good and they give you a piece of baguette to go with the soup.  They also had a great display of sweets but I didn't try any of it. From what I remember, they're reasonably priced.  I wouldn't go out of my way just to try out this place but I would stop by this place if you're near it."}
{"text":"Only been for breakfast. French toast is amazing, Texas style, big enough to share. Eggs in a pocket also good but takes some time to prepare. Don't order if in a hurry. So why only 3 stars? Pay cash only!!! Was charged 4 times on the same day to my credit card for the exact same amounts at various times and mgmt wouldn't even return my calls. Had to go through credit card company to fix the issue."}
{"text":"Looking at all these great reviews i would have thought this place was worth checking out. Maybe we just showed up at a bad time but if this is an example on how to run a business i'm surprised it's still going. We showed up at the cash to order and about 5 minutes later the cook came out to ask us what we wanted. Guess the cashier must have been out on smoke break or something. finally she appeared just as it was time to get our stuff. That's fine.  The fact that there was no social graces in our ordering experience sais a lot about a place. But then we had to look for a clean table to sit at. Hey, face it, there was barely anybody there. So obviously the staff was not busy enough to clean up or seemed to care to. Upon enjoying our deserts which were the only saving grace of this review, not one of our surrounding tables had been cleaned up.  Sounds like it was the managers day off and the staff was sluffing off. It's too bad because i was hoping this would be a nice place to hang out once in a while. Doubt i'll be back again"}
{"text":"Canadian version of Panera bread!   My fiance's family and I came here for lunch during the holiday break.  3 of us opted for heir turkey with cranberry sauce + stuffing sandwich. Fiance got their tuna sandwich with mushroom bisque.  Fiance's brother's girlfriend got the walnut salad and smoothie.  My fiance's dad wasn't too big of a fan of the sandwich and fiance's brother's gf complained that the sandwich had too much meat.   I liked it but still not as good as the version they had in Cosi's but this version is definitely better than Panera's!  Before leaving, for once the fiance's brother's gf was craving sweets.. so she decided to get not 1.. but 2 portuguese egg tarts. I asked for 1 myself and my fiance got a chocolate croissant. The eggtart was pretty bad.. the crust was stale and no egg taste whatsoever. The girlfriend barely finished her first one and wrapped the second one for \"home\". Fiance's chocolate croissant was much much better! Good thing I filled myself up with the free cookie sample by the entrance before this awful eggtart. Their cookies were amazing.. and I believe I cleared the basket before the lunch rush. Oops... might return in the future for their actual weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that this bakery open in my area.  Since it's new so my hubby and I want to check it out.  Looks very comfy to me, with wifi and sofa inside.   I think it's a good place to have a cake and coffee.  Since I'm a dessert lover, I bought a cheesecake and Berry scone on that day.  The cheesecake was very smooth and rich in taste and not too sweet.  Berry scone was quite good, but the cheesecake just won my heart.   For sure I will go and try other thing next time."}
{"text":"Artisano Bakery Cafe is such a nice additional to the area. It is close to both 404 and 401 access.   Since the concept of both Panera Bread and Artisano Bakery Cafe are so similar, I do find I like the set up of Artisano Bakery more. OK I am a sucker for sofas and armchairs... when I see a place that has a few set up, automatically + 0.5 star.  This place is busy during lunch time, so you do expect to wait a little longer for your meals. But the use of buzzer system is great, at least you can go and sit down/relax  and drink your coffee then pick up the food when it is ready.  I have to say I love eating good bread. Artisano bread is great!! I opt for the Any 2 for $8.99 (6 daily soups/any sandwich and salad on the menu). The Boston Clam Chowder is not too creamy but quite sizable, with tons of ingredients inside and served with Tuscan Filone on the side. The Grilled Chicken & Asiago on Ciabatta love the bread and the eggplant and the sandwich tasted really light and healthy.  There are also quite a lot of people hanging out with their laptop out for free WIFI and watching CP24 on flat screen TV. + 0.5 star.  For sure I will be asking my friend to meet me here next time, and even if I am late at least they will be relaxing with a coffee waiting for me!  They accepts VIsa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"We thought we would catch a quick breakfast only to end up ordering lunch due to a lack of vegetarian options. They didn't have ANY nutritional information on the food, which is a nightmare if you have diabetes. On top of all that, the Chai was terrible, although they did give me a refund. Not the best pick."}
{"text":"Artisano Bakery reminds me a lot of Panera Bread. The concept is very similar: artisan sandwiches, soups, salads and baked goods. You order at the cashier, and they give you a buzzer that lights up when your food is ready. I recently discovered this location right where I work, so suddenly, my weekday lunch possibilities appear infinitely more appealing.   There is a half sandwich and soup/salad option, so I ordered a steak and provolone panini with a side of corn chowder. The sandwich featured steak, fire dried tomatoes, grilled eggplant, caramelized red onions and provolone cheese with a horseradish mayonnaise. I absolutely loved the onion focaccia because it was so dense and rich with flavours. The steak was tender and the onions, tomatoes and eggplant were lovely accompaniments to delicious meat.   My corn chowder was sweet, creamy, and satisfying. In addition to being loaded with corn, the soup also had chunks of carrots and potato. The soups are served with a piece of baguette, but I didn't eat any of it because I was so full already from the soup and sandwich.  My friend's order of Southern pulled pork sandwich was also quite good: pulled pork smothered with Artisano BBQ sauce and topped with freshly made coleslaw, all piled onto a Calabrese bun. She opted for a split pea soup as her side. The portion of both the half sandwich and soup was quite large, definitely bigger than Panera bread. The split pea soup was super thick and full of hearty goodness. Although $9.49 for a sandwich combo is quite pricey, I can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients.   After one visit, I'm already quite in love with this place, especially since it's near my workplace. Though it's not exactly cheap, the high-quality sandwiches, soups and salads define perfect lunch food for me!"}
