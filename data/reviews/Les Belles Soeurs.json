{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place! It's probably the best place I've been in Montreal for burgers. It's a small little restaurant and if you're in the neighborhood or on the plateau, it's worth a little walk. Great place and the 5 stars are completely worth it."}
{"text":"J'ai été charmée par ce petit resto burger familial à la déco sympa mai tranquille du petit resto de quartier. Pas de prise de tête dans les assiettes, mais que du bon! Le burger les belles soeurs, à l'agneau, est délicieux! ;)
Ils font aussi à emporter."}
{"text":"Dans les meilleurs restos de burger a Montréal . Endroit très sympathique en retrait de la rue mont royal et superbe Resto de quartier . Service excellent"}
{"text":"Everything tastes like liver. Been here a few times and order something with beef in it and I'm sure they mix old lamb or liver in because seriously, I have not had 1 meat dish that didn't taste like putrid liver. Stop screwing around. 
Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Un bon endroit pour les burgers. Ils sont juteux, très savoureux, et servis dans un adorable pain brioché. J'ai essayé le végétarien, excellent! Pour le reste, le menu est assez limité. La prochaine fois, je me laisserai tenter par leur pouding chômeur..."}
{"text":"Piece of paradise. Feels like home, that is, if your home has funky decor, mega delicious food, and friendly people. What took me so long to come here?"}
{"text":"This is the second time i come here. First time  i wasn't impressed so i decided to give it a second chance. The food is good but the service is very looong! It does not deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the 5-star reviews being left. Was passing by the area and decided to Yelp to see if there were any standouts in the area to grab a bite. Surprisingly, this place had a 5-star rating from seven different people, and I figured they couldn't ALL be wrong?? Worst case, it's more like a 4 star, I thought. Well, unfortunately, the lamb burger I ordered (special of the day, the \"Mexican\" with guacamole, corn relish, cheddar, etc) was nothing to write home about. Meat was pretty dry even though I asked for a medium burger (I get the feeling even though the server nodded her head when I asked for medium, that they just automatically cook everything pretty well done). All the toppings on the burger just didn't come together, and the sourness of the corn was off-putting. The worst was the Velveeta-tasting so-called cheddar. It was almost liquid cheese, totally processed, and didn't taste at all like cheddar. Fries and salad on the side were OK, not great. My burger, fries + one beer (included in the trio) was something like $17+ tax. The place itself is small and very hot inside due to no AC. I wouldn't mind the lack of air conditioning but since the grill/kitchen area is open to the rest of the resto, it got very hot and unpleasant. I don't think this place would survive if it were in a location that gave it competition. Oh well, at least I can say I tried!"}
{"text":"So freaking good overall. I got the lamb burger. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked. The bun was like a potato challah. So soft and yummy. The sauce was so delicious, just wish there was a bit less so I could taste the meat a little more. The poutine was pretty good. About average. The service was awesome. Our waiter was super cute"}
{"text":"Très bon service, la nourriture est excellente et pour un prix très correct!
Je recommande +++"}
{"text":"Je pense que depuis que j'y vais, le restaurant a du changé de proprietaire 3 fois. A chaque fois l'accueil a été excellent, et le Hamburger Les Belles Soeurs est à mourir tellement c'est un délice !!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this quaint little dinner in the Plateau for lunch with a couple of friends on a cold winter's day for a quick bite before returning to work. This space is very homey, with daily specials on a chalkboard, and the service is very friendly; felt like dinning at a friends house. The daily special comes with soup and dessert for a very reasonable price. I opted for the vegetarian burger instead and loved every bite! The burger is actually a slice of tofu and it was served with fries; burger was juicy and flavourful and the fries were perfect. My lunch partners went with the daily special of meatballs and mash. They both loved it although they thought the soup entree was way salty and didn't finish it. Overall, great experience; I would return for a cosy lunch anytime!"}
{"text":"For our first night in Montreal, We looked on Yelp for a place for dinner. And, Les Belles Surs was incredible! I ordered Le Burger Belles Surs and it was the most delicious burger I have ever eaten. It was succulent and incredibly yummy. The service was wonderful and I love the quirky decor. I highly recommend this gem! It is not to be missed."}
{"text":"The burger is yummy (the bun is also a star) and the service is super friendly .  I had their Belles soeurs burger and a beer .  What is not to love?"}
{"text":"À un prix défiant toute concurrence le menu est simple: Entrée + Plat + Boisson = L'addition entre 12$ et 16$
Pour ma part j'ai adoré l'entrée du jour: Soupe aux carottes, sandwich au thon (avec concombres et oignons rouges crus, que personnellement je n'aime pas, mais l'arrangement doit être bon pour ceux qui aiment) avec mi frites, mi salade et une Boréale. C'était bon quand même, idéal pour le repas de midi mais j'avoue que tout le monde ou presque avait pris un burger et ils semblaient fameux! 
La déco est super jusqu'aux toilettes, l'originalité à sont meilleur!
C'est un ami qui m'y a emmené, je pense que je vais devoir y retourner goûter au burger et faire découvrir cette place à mon tour :)

Après avoir posé 5 étoiles, je reviens sur mon commentaire, y étant retournée pour goûter leur fameux burger, alors, grosse déception: Le pain est brioché ça ne fonctionne pas, l'agneau était correct, l'emmental n'est pas de l'emmental, les champignons au nombre assommant de 3, et la sauce censée donner LE goût n'y était pas.

Conclusion: Rapide et économique, honnête mais pas extraordinaire."}
{"text":"We went to this burger place right after we first arrived in Montreal not knowing what to expect. We all ordered different kinds of burgers and all agreed they were simply excellent. Staff was very good at checking on us to make sure we have everything we need. And I know this is random but you HAVE to use their bathroom!! It may be the best part of the restaurant :)"}
{"text":"With the proliferation of chic burger joints in the city, I was very happy to discover this unpretentious little gem of a restaurant in a secluded corner of the Plateau. All I needed that cold Saturday evening was a burger and a poutine, and I must say they filled my cravings with flying colours. My burger was well put together, held its shape even towards the end, when usually burgers start to fall apart, and it was daaaahlicious. I can't remember the name of the burger, but it was the one with a strip of bacon in it. The poutine also made my heart sing, for they were crispy in all the right places, sweet in the right degrees and covered in just the right amount of gravy. As for my husband's order, he had a plate of boulettes d'agneau topped with feta and emmenthal cheese. and he loved it. The restaurant atmosphere was also cosy and being away from the hustle and bustle of Mont-Royal Avenue, I felt a bit like in a small town's greasy spoon, which was a sweet feeling. At the end of the meal I said to myself, why haven't I been here earlier?"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! It has one of THE best veggie burgers I have ever had. I have such a hard time finding good vegetarian options, especially since most people just throw on a pre-processed veggie patty, but not this place. I never get tired of ordering it, in fact I've had it for breakfast a few times ( haha ). The ambiance is pretty good here too, lots of cool details, design, and the staff are really laid back and friendly. Love it!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur burger de Montréal !  On a eu le malheur  d emménager a 100m et maintenant nous sommes  complètement accrocs ! !! Garni svp !"}
{"text":"Restaurant de quartier très agréable. Les plats servis y sont savoureux et copieux. Le cadre apporte une atmosphère cosy, si vous êtes dans le coin n'hésitez pas à y manger (PS : le burger à l'agneau était fantastique)."}
