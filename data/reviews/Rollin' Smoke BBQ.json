{"text":"I waited to write review until I had been a few times. Overall, this place is OK and the staff has always been very friendly and the place looks very clean.  First visit was mix plate of quarter chicken and 2 Ribs. Ribs were OK, not great. Chicken was dry but edible. Second visit was Ribs and pulled pork. Again, ribs were OK and the pulled pork was pretty good, but again nothing special. Last night got just a pork sandwich with a side of Mac-n-Cheese the lady recommended. Got home and opened container to see not a BBQ sandwich but a BBQ hoagie.  Absolutely atrocious. A hoagie changes the texture and flavor of the sandwich and is too much bread.  I paid $9.99 for a plate of bread with a few tablespoons of meat. In full disclosure I was raised in the deep South where exceptional BBQ is found on every street. If you're looking for a clean place that is better than most options available in Las Vegas, it's a good option."}
{"text":"Favorite new BBQ spot in Vegas. Been here three times and spot on every time. Being from the Midwest , it's hard to find something close to real southern BBQ and this place comes damn close. One of the Chefs gave us a free complimentary banana puddin...was quite delish!!"}
{"text":"Great food but a little spicy for my little ones.. We love it though! The manager was super helpful when we were choosing our first order. Good portion sizes as well!"}
{"text":"Great food. Authentic barbecue food with a decent price tag. The environment of the restaurant is relaxed and welcoming. Their selection of sauces is great, although the food doesn't need it. Their mac and cheese is my favorite side. Total bill for 3 people with drinks was $86. Not bad!!"}
{"text":"First time at this place today. Service was friendly and quick. Pulled pork was very good with a nice variety of sauces. Potato salad was excellent, accented with bacon and green onions! Would have given it 5 stars except very pricey for what you get. Extra $$ to even get a side with your sandwich."}
{"text":"First time here, heard about the original, thought i should try it. Having lived in KC for a few years, bbq there was the best i ever had, now this place is the closest anyone can find to the smokey yumminess of the KC bbq....like all good bbq, you always think you can eat more than you actually do :)....hint...."}
{"text":"Our first time at Rollin' smoke BBQ and it was Fabulous!!! Danny is very Friendly and upbeat!! We were also greeted by Lee during our meal who was extremely pleasant. We tried the Pork, brisket, burnt ends, ribs, and hot links. Everything was out of this world!My husband loves the Mac n cheese and the corn nuggets are addicting! Throwing this spot into our rotation."}
{"text":"We tried Rollin Smoke for the first time today and we will be coming back soon! Best pulled pork sandwich I've had, but the sides are what make this place great...we tried the collard greens, potato salad and waffle fries... soooo good! Everything tastes like it's made from scratch in-house, which I'm sure it is! Not to mention the service was friendly and fast, and the restaurant was spotless."}
{"text":"We have heard so many good things about Rollin Smoke so decided to give it a try.  We are from Chicago and have been trying to find good BBQ since moving to Vegas.  This was the BBQ we have been looking for!!!  Had the rib sampler so we could try all rib types...they were all superior and the beef ribs are divine.  Service was wonderful and restaurant was clean.  Don't leave this place without trying the corn nuggets!!! They will change your life.  Will certainly be back and plan to bring friends next time!"}
{"text":"I ordered from the wrong location and showed up to this store to pick up my order.  They apologized for the mix up, called the other store to confirm my order, put a rush on it and then took care of the bill.  All of this while there was a line out the door.  I was incredibly impressed with the customer service and the BBQ was outstanding.  It was my first time trying either location and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!  My favorites are pulled pork,  links, waffle fries, and banana puddin.  Generous portion.  Service is awesome and very friendly."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the luke warm mac n cheese and chicken...brisket was almost hot but lots of bites of fat .  I didn't even like their corn bread! Oh well...sad we wasted our $$"}
{"text":"This BBQ place is awesome. The food was fresh, hot, and full of flavor.  I had the 2 meat combo with hot links and pulled pork. The hot links are made in-house and the pork was moist and delicious.  The corn bread was soft, fluffy and buttered.  Overall, this was a great lunch and I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see them open a restaurant in our end of town. The food is great and portions are huge, so plenty of leftovers for next day lunch. Not only is the bbq really good, the sides are also delicious. Their biggest problem is that they chose a space that is way too small for what I think their business will grow to."}
{"text":"Poor service. Placed order online and went into store to pick up. Upon arrival I gave the cashier my name and she replies in annoyance that \"we don't have an order for that name\" and then turns her back to me and walks away. I was confused as to her expectation at this point. I guess she just wanted me to go away. When she decides to pay attention to me again, I pull up the email to show her my order confirmation and she rolls her eyes and hands me a bag of food and walks away again. So I guess she did have an order with that name after all. No sauces included and I felt like she might have a complete meltdown if I asked her for BBQ sauce. I would also like to add that I was the only person in line at this point so it's not like she was overwhelmed with customers. I ordered and payed online (tipped - but clearly that was a mistake) so it's difficult to understand how this place delivers poor service when all they have to do is hand someone their food and maybe say \"thanks\"   The food was ok but without any sauce it was not what I wanted. Hoped to enjoy some BBQ and instead felt like I wasted $30."}
{"text":"Rollin Smoke Barbeque is amazing! I got The Pit Special and the ribs were tender and the mac and cheese was one of the best I've ever had. I got the banana pudding for dessert and I could've ate an entire tray.  Great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Nice establishment with friendly staff. The food was over priced and did not taste up to standards. I ate the trio dinner plate and got the ribs, hot link and brisket. The ribs were satisfying/decent as the meat fell right off the bone. The hot link did lack some flavor, while the brisket completely tasted off. The corn bread was moist but had a oddly strange taste to it. It also included one side which I got french fries which were pretty good. Overall paid like 19 dollars for mediocre plate with no drink included."}
{"text":"From the friendly service to very good BBQ this place is five stars. I think every employee asked how I enjoyed everything which you do not find very often. The brisket was tender and not dry. I will be back."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was dry, and sauce tasted like it was from a plastic bottle. Also had the brisket and it was also dry and cold. Seemed to have been sitting sliced for a long time.  The manager, a big guy with short grey hair and a beard, wasn't very interested in addressing the problems, and basically told me to not visit again.   Sides were just okay.  Very disappointed, as this wasn't an affordable experience. Famous Dave's has better for less money, and I'm not really a big fan of famous Dave's.  The Big Texas bbq on St Rose is far better and the staff there are friendly and helpful!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ west of the Pecos (river not street). The best in Las Vegas by far.  Some places say they are Texas BBQ but don't come close."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch.  Big Mike helped us and recommended the Duo Choice of Meat.  The pork was very good but the brisket and sides were AMAZING!    Best BBQ I've had outside of KC.  Mike was very friendly and helpful as well.  WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Just picked up my order and I was very disappointed. The original location cooks to order, or at least they used to. This new location is going fast food which is more important to them than quality. I ordered a large order and they told me it would be ready in 10 minutes. It was obviously pre cooked and tasted like any other fast food BBQ. you guys had a good thing going, but fooling your customers is more important to you. Shame on you."}
{"text":"They would have received four stars except that service wasn't four star worthy.  We arrived at 7:37 pm, walked in and realized that they closed at 8 but now understood why that girl looked at us with a mad dog face.  They were about to close and now they were upset because we were eating in.  The people before us got great service as they were being offered to try sauces etc (maybe because they got their food to go).  Someone came in at 7:57 pm and got food to go. They were nice - told them thank you so much, have a good night.  I left a $8 tip off a $50 bill and all they did was bring our food.  I'm not complaining about it because I always give tip at these kind of joints.  For them to throw the food in front of us and not tell us enjoy your meal etc, I will not return.  The food came out quick but it was not hot.  It probably would have been more enjoyable if our food was hot.  But we weren't going to tell them because they were not welcoming from the beginning.  There are a lot of BBQ places I can go to fulfill my BBQ cravings with better personality. A great personality goes a long way with my family.  We didn't even get a bye or good night.  We left 8 minutes after closing.  And lastly, I even cleaned my table for you!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food but a little pricey. Meat is excellent. Walk up counter to order so not really anything to report with service. Good spot."}
{"text":"Me and the wife came here this past friday on April 14. We wasnt too sure if this was going to be good or not. This guy who cook the food came from the back. He gave us a few samples of the meat and greens. Wow this food was amazing. Its been a long time since I had good bbq, but this is as good as it gets.  Customer service they provided was excellent. We felt very welcome. I would definitely would recommend them to anyone who wants some good tasting bbq. I wish they had a bbq place like this in the Bay Area. I would go every weekend."}
{"text":"As with other Rollin Smoke locations, it's all about the fantastic food.  They have the best bbq I know of in Vegas.  The restaurant facility is only ok."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out through Grubhub, they forgot my coleslaw but the food was so good that we didn't find it to be a major issue. The brisket three ways is great. Rib tips are quite fatty but the chopped brisket is so good. I ordered it with sauce on the side(not sure if that's how it's normally served) it needed very little sauce since it was so flavorful its own. The crunchy bits make it. We really had low expectations for the wings but those turned out to be some of the best wings I've had. The skin was crispy, a little dry but that's how I like them. Lemon pepper rub was flavorful and didn't leave the wings tasting like they were covered in a dry rub. Cannot comment on the sides as we did not have any. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ Las Vegas has ever seen. Everything I've tried is exceptional. I usually get sliced brisket and chicken with side of BBQ beans. The beans are the best I've ever had. This place rivals top BBQ joints in the South, which is where I'm from.  It isn't just the food that's great. There was a minor issue with a to go order on one visit. These things happen in restaurants and I wasn't upset at all. The manager went above and beyond to make it right on my next visit to make sure I was a happy? customer. Everybody makes mistakes. It's how they resolved the issue that deserves praise."}
{"text":"I was super excited to get some Rollin smoke BBQ after finding out they had their grand opening today. As soon as I got off work I ran to the new location not even thinking of what time they closed. I arrived at the location all excited to get food and asked if they were still open, they replied they closed at 8 (it was 8:30ish) but would still take my order. They were so sweet, took my order no problem and the food was amazing and fresh when I got it home. I work in the service industry and I know how frustrating it can be to get people in after closing (or even close to closing) but they were so welcoming just seems like a really great team. I will definitely be back (during hours of operation) lol. I will also be sure to refer anyone I know. Thanks Rollin smoke!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot. The rib tips are the best. The only downside is they have a set amount of food at this location per day. Once they run out they close."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST BBQ FOOD IN VEGAS. I've done the homework, don't waste your time and money elsewhere.  Favorite menu item: BURNT ENDS  10/10 for flavor  Try it, the original location always has a line out the front door. Loving this new SW location closer to SUMMERLIN.   CHEF TY HAS THE BEST GUEST SERVICE AND FOOD ANYWHERE! He's kind and welcoming! Melissa is always helpful too!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town IMO! Management provided quality service and an overall fun environment. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great new location near 215 and Flamingo.  Awesome BBQ and excellent service.  Be sure to try the corn nuggets and the delicious Fatty Brisket!!!!  The only negative thing I can think of was that it was quite hot eating inside....must have been 85 degrees inside.    Other than the AC, this place is a must go!"}
{"text":"I'm sooo happy they made their way to this end of town.  Great atmosphere. ..deliciously cooked food.."}
{"text":"Now me and my wife been to Famous Daves, Lucille's and this would be the first  here in Rolling Smoke BBQ.  Let's just said we agree that this place  hands down better and tastier.  We didn't wait that long and the  food came out nice and hot.  She ordered the Smoke Meatloaf which came out crazy big lol which I ended up finishing  it and I ordered the The Big Hawg, which I devoured it and damm, it was good I would definitely come here again and try out the other good looking food they have on the menu If anyone is hungry and craving  for some delicious BBQ then you better come with a huge appetite. Btw the price is a little hefty but you get what you paid for and it's worth it.   Thank you ROLLING SMOKE BBQ"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ!!!  Finally something that compares to the places we enjoyed in the south.  Brisket, Pork, Ribs, and Chicken were very very good.   Service was awesome.  Very friendly, and quick.  They have southern style sides like fried okra, collard greens, and dirty rice.  Banana pudding was really good as well.  Looking forward to getting some cobbler next time.  Sweet tea reminded me of home, and I drank like 4 cups."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Rollin Smoke per suggestion of my father in law. He was always a fan of the OG place on Highland Dr? The menu was pretty simple & they had good platter selections.  My only complaint was that our food wasn't hot? It was warm, as if it's been sitting out & they put it on a plate. I know I like my food to be steaming so I know that it's fresh, or that they took the time to cook it, or that it was in a proper warming container. Just some food for thought.  Drinks are $3, but it's because the cups are also souvenir cups. They have Coke products, iced tea & a Keurig machine which was super fancy btw.   Not a fan of all their sauces, but don't take that into account I'm not much of a BBQ person.  I ordered duo meat with sliced brisket & pork with a side of Mac n cheese & bacon potato salad (my favorite). Hubby had same duo meat combo w/ spare ribs & sliced brisket, sides were corn bread (tasted great, but dry) & waffle fries (had a sweet-ish taste). FIL got the whole beef ribs, which were huge but not fall-off-the-bone juicy & the baked potato with bacon, cheese, sour cream & green onions. And lastly, bro-in-law had a duo meat combo as well with corn bread & Mac n cheese.  All of the good tasted good, but I just wish it came out hot! Will try the OG place on Highland and compare."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Staff is super friendly definite thumbs up there. The menu is huge took a minute to decide on something. When I did I went with the duo plate. I got brisket and ribs while my girlfriend got brisket chopped and chicken. For our sides we got BBQ beans, Mac and cheese, and yams. While the brisket was tender as well as all the meat, the flavor wasn't anything special, we were pretty disappointed. Now the sides however were really good. We liked the Mac and cheese a lot as well as the yams. The beans were a little different but still pretty tasty. Lastly the sauce. I mean what is BBQ without the sauce. They gave us a few different sauces so that we can try them and honestly they weren't all that. We ended up pulling some sweet baby rays out of the fridge. May come back to try the desserts but that's it."}
{"text":"Not all that.  Fresh, quality meats and quick service. Sides are non descript...but the corn things were special.   Its not bad, but I dont get what all the hype is about. $25, after a $5 off coupon for 'meh.'"}
{"text":"Place is super clean and the food is delicious. Really like the Arkansauce on the pulled pork. Also, the Mac and cheese is very yummy!"}
{"text":"The power went out and they kept taking orders! I'll eat this food in any condition lol."}
{"text":"I forget the second location is closer to my home. Had to come and check it out. I wasn't disappointed at all! The bbq is just amazing as the original location, the staff was very welcoming and helpful. Bryan greeted me with a very friendly hello and took my order right away, service was fast. Bbq was spot on. We be back soon."}
{"text":"Just found out about this location.  Same menu as Highland, same great flavor! Best BBQ in city!"}
{"text":"We're so glad they opened up a location on the west side! My husband and I love their BBQ and now it's just up the street from us. Totally dangerous but we wouldn't have it any other way. Their burnt ends, ribs, and meatloaf is definitely our favorites but really it's all pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Coming from Kansas City we believe we know BBQ. And this has to be the best BBQ in Las Vegas. One of my standards is if you have to put sauce on it, it wasn't smoked  correctly. And I always look for the pink smoke ring in the meat. Glad to say I didn't have sauce it. And the brisket had a nice pink smoke ring in it.  Cornbread, hush puppies and corn nuggets are great sides.   Thank you Bryan ( that's Bryan with a Y ) and your crew for great food!   Don't forget o take your drink glass and get a buck off your next visit with it."}
{"text":"Second time to this location. Sadly, I have to say, it is better than the first location. Not that that location was bad, this is just better in my opinion.   The service is great, so friendly it's almost too friendly, but not. Rather it's just right. Food is quick to get after ordering. Sweet tea is great, not gag you sweet but reminds me of the little restaurant I used to love the tea at back in Goose Creek, SC. Anyways.   The food is tasty. I am a huge brisket fan and this place makes me happy just because of that. Spare ribs are cooked nicely, pulls right off the bone. Yams remind me of Thanksgiving with my family (and all the times I make them for myself while waiting for next year.)  I am about to try the baby back ribs.....they look awesome. If I remember I shall be back to tell the tale.   This place has food you will appreciate and service you will enjoy."}
{"text":"While I didn't order any BBQ meal, they kinda ruined a grilled cheese sandwich because of carelessness. they seemed to have grilled it with a tub of burnt black grease that made the bread look as if it had mold. That was not appealing. The fully loaded mashed potatoes were good but man...it's pretty greasy and probably clogged a few arteries.  The fries were good as well.   Also...the prices are high. $10 for a kids meal. Not worth it."}
{"text":"We moved here from Texas so our standards are pretty high for a BBQ joint.  Falls a little short, but not too bad for what we have here in Vegas.  Nothing real special to make this place stand out, just descent BBQ."}
{"text":"Not as good as advertised. The food was obviously warmed up and dry. From the BBQ pork to the mac n cheese it was not fresh. I visited at 630pm on a Thursday night so it wasn't like it was at closing time. For the price of the food 2 sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 drinks for $34.00 it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Service is great just like the Highland location, but I didn't go for the service. All-in-all I was really disappointed. Firstly, I didn't get that fresh off the grill taste, so that makes me doubt the meat is actually cooked there. Secondly, my mouth was watering for the corn nuggets and I was given some that seemed to have been sitting a little too long. So, I won't count Rollin' Smoke out entirely, just this location."}
{"text":"Back at the end of 2014 we visited the Rollin Smoke BBQ on Highland Dr and were blown away by its greatness. I wrote a glowing Yelp review about its fantastic smoked meat and great value and I spread the word to all who would listen saying they've got to get up there and experience this wonderful BBQ for themselves. Ever since we've been meaning to get back to Rollin Smoke on one of our very frequent trips to Vegas.   When we're back in town between October and April we always spend time hiking in Red Rock Canyon, so imagine our delight when we learned that Rollin Smoke had opened a new location just a few minutes south of Red Rock off Flamingo and 215. We were going to be able to spend all morning hiking then have a killer BBQ lunch at the new Rollin Smoke.   When we arrived around 1:30pm there were only a couple of people in the restaurant. I decided I wanted to try one of their \"world famous\" beef ribs and some burnt ends so I chose the 2-meat \"Duo\" that included one side for $13.99. The beef rib substitution added an additional $6.00 to the plate and the burnt ends added another $3.00, so the $13.99 Duo was now costing me $22.99. Not a problem for the kind of BBQ I remembered from 2014, plus BBQ beef ribs are typically very large. I chose green beans for my side. My GF ordered the Duo plate with two spare ribs and burnt ends. She chose coleslaw as her side and she ordered an extra side of potato salad.  Our food was brought out to us and a sense of disbelief and disappointment set in. The beef rib was only about as large as one of the spare ribs, and it was more than half fat. Not just any fat, but partially cooked, unrendered fat. As I pulled this fat out of the beef rib with my plastic fork it came out in globs with long strings attached.   I realized that if we break a $13.99 Duo plate down into its component costs and we use $1.99 for the side to make the math easy, then each of the two standard meats on the Duo plate cost $6.00. The $6.00 upcharge for the beef rib meant I was paying $12.00 for this little beef rib that was mostly partially cooked fat.  The burnt ends were even worse. The $3.00 upcharge for these meant I was paying $9.00 for a few cubes of what turned out to be 90% fat, and most of the cubes were ALL fat and zero meat. This was completely unacceptable and I had to lug my tray back up to the counter to show them what they had served me. The lady at the counter was very nice and immediately replaced the burnt ends with some that included some meat, but somebody at Rollin Smoke needs to go back to basic BBQ school and learn that burnt ends are NOT cubes of unrendered fat.  My GF's two spare ribs were just fair and tasted like they had been cooked yesterday. She ate only one and gave the other one to me. It too had a large amount of unrendered fat and I left it alone after a couple of bites.. The green beans had a seasoning on them that was so salty we just left it alone. The slaw and potato salad were nothing special and certainly nothing like the sides we had at their original location.  Our lunch cost about $50.00. For this we got 2 mediocre spare ribs and a super-fatty beef rib of the same size, two small piles of burnt ends that were mostly fat, and 3 forgettable sides.   So much for BBQ greatness and spectacular value. This was the biggest food ripoff we've ever experienced in Vegas, and we've pretty much seen it all.  The silver lining in all of this is when we were finding the new Rollin Smoke we discovered a Famous Daves BBQ only a block away. So we can still get a BBQ lunch after we hike. It just ain't gonna be at Rollin Fat (er, I mean Smoke.)  My 2014 review of the Highland Ave location will stay in place because at one time in the past Rollin Smoke really was great."}
{"text":"Came here today and got ribs and catfish. The wait was way too long for how slow this place was. The cashier said it was due to the catfish cooking. Got home opened box and the three piece catfish plate was so embarrassing. These had to have been the smallest catfish I've ever seen. More like catfish bites. Waste of $15.99"}
{"text":"Usually get a pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese. The BBQ is great, bread is bread. I've had other things that are all worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Great Food that you would expect from the Original location on Highland Drive. Front counter staff is kind and courteous! It's a smaller spot so expect the dining room to be full during lunch and dinner. I'd have given them a 4th star had I not had to clean my own table while being watched by staff. Did not see one employee cleaning the dining room in the hour we ate. Will try again and hope to see cleaner tables and dining area. GREAT Food just needs some TLC"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ in Las Vegas, good food, clean, great staff. Usually very busy during lunch"}
{"text":"Best Bbq I've tasted. Lots of food choices fun and super service.  I love that they do catering huge help with big partys. Hubby and I  usually go once a week just can't get enough ."}
{"text":"First time coming here, I was referred by a friend. Food is great! Very smokey taste, food was brought out to us fast. Upon ordering the girl at register was telling us the meals were small, omg they are huge portions! So felt like we were being up-priced good thing i decided to go with what i wanted to originally order & she spoke to us like she was mumbling, hard to hear her explain the menu."}
{"text":"This new location is next in a chain of amazing food and fun. Their motto is \"Put Some South in Your Mouth\" and they are not joking! The food here is absolutely fantastic, service is beyond exceptional and the atmosphere is buzzing! If you eat nowhere else, eat at Rollin' Smoke BBQ II!"}
{"text":"I wanted a beef rib plate. This location doesn't sell that. Instead, you can get two ribs for $18.99 with no sides or anything else. Broke my heart.  So, being confused, I tried the 2 meat plate with brisket and pork ribs. The pork ribs were excellent, even if they weren't what I wanted to order. The brisket had a peppercorn bark that I didn't like and had to scrape off. The brisket was dry and didn't have smoke rings, or much flavor. I also got fried okra as my one side; they coated it with some orange dust, and reinvented the wheel for okra, when it was better off left alone.  Still very good BBQ for the Las Vegas area. I'll just go back to the original location."}
{"text":"Totally legit Texas-style BBQ!  Perfectly done brisket, great pulled pork and the baby backs were outstanding!  Next visit I want to try the smoked meatloaf... looks great!  Beans had just enough bite to offset The sweetness, corn nuggets were great and they have SIX kinds of housemade BBQ sauces.  Wonderful cornbread as well... at the end of my lunch they brought me some complimentary banana pudding!  BONUS: The owners were just as nice & gracious as could be... made you feel like a guest in their home.  Can't wait to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The BBQ is perfect!! The service is impeccable and it's a cute atmosphere. The manager has come out to check on tables every time we've been here. He talks to every table to make sure everything they got was excellent! When ordering we didn't know what something would taste like so they gave us a sample to know if we would like it or not! Customer service has been lacking in Las Vegas for awhile now but this place really raises the bar! Everything we have had on the menu is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and wonderful people and service. They are amazing! The spare ribs and potato salad are delish!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service with a smile!  Best brisket I have ever had!  Waffle fries are a little Cajun spicy for me but very tasty!  Another pleasant experience while traveling for business!  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I've been to their location on Highland with a group of friends before. I don't think it's a place that I'd feel comfortable going to by myself, so I'm glad they opened a location in the SW!!   I got the duo choice of meats (brisket and spare ribs). It comes with a choice of a side, so I chose the coleslaw. The coleslaw has a bit of a kick to it, which I enjoy. Last time, my friends really really really enjoyed their loaded mash. Service is awesome; location is awesome. What more could I ask for?  Also they have a lot of different sauces in bottles that you can just help yourself to. My personal favorite is the Arkansauce. The one with mustard is a close runner up!"}
{"text":"We heard some terrific things about Rollin Smoke Barbecue and felt it was time to give it a try. We originally went to the location just east of the strip. Unfortunately it was closed on Sundays. However this location is open on Sundays. You walk up to the counter to order. When your food is ready they bring it to the table. The women behind the counter were incredibly friendly and helpful. While it is not really table service per se, the service they provided was excellent. My wife and I decided to share the st. Louis ribs and a side of waffle fries. Wow was that good!! These had to be the meatiest ribs I have ever had. And waffle fries were perfectly prepared. We loved it all. Despite coming in pretty hungry, we had difficulty finishing the meal. My son-in-law and his son both have much bigger appetites than I have. They went with the all-you-can-eat special for $35. If you have a big appetite this is a great deal. They ordered three or four different Meats. Each one was excellent. This is not as upscale as Lucille's or Famous Dave's, but the ribs are much better. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I can seriously make this the shortest review ever and just put a drooling face emoji because that's how I felt after the first taste. We were a few doors down when the smell drew us in like Toucan Sam followed Fruit Loops. Ok, so first thing we notice when looking at the menu of course was the prices next to each item, they seemed a little high. (I'll justify the price in a minute, I promise!) Everything sounded so good though and the pictures of some of the items looked delicious. We placed our orders with who I believe was the owner, he was very nice, made us feel welcomed and described the menu in detail to help us make a decision. My 2 boys shared the 2 sliders kid's meal with mac n cheese, it was more than enough for 2 kids to share. Of course I had to try their Mac n' cheese which was delicious. My husband had \"The Biggin\" with the fried corn nuggets. I had the limited time fried chicken and hot link with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and gravy. Now for the taste! This is where the prices went completely insignificant at this point and I would've paid $100 for a sandwich! I took a scoop of mashed potatoes, dipped it in the gravy and I swear I blacked out for a quick second. They melted in my mouth before I even had a chance to get a second spoonful. I ended up eating the remaining gravy with a spoon just like soup, it was that good! The crispy fried chicken skin had a hint of dry rub in the buttermilk. The kids ate every last bit of their pulled pork and brisket sliders. My husband loved his sandwich and the corn nuggets were sweet and creamy on the inside while crispy on the outside. We are so coming back!!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I have been here twice now, and we've been super impressed! The first time we went we got the five meat sampler which includes ribs, brisket, chicken, pulled pork and hot links! My favorites were the chicken and pulled pork, while my roommate preferred the brisket and ribs.   As for sides we got mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, yams and added cornbread! My roommate had nothing but good things to say about the yams and I loved their mac n cheese!  Best of all is their service. The employees are all awesome and make the experience a great one (it's just one of the reasons we decided to come back!)"}
{"text":"This is seriously good BBQ. They have the process down. And it's fast, friendly service as well. I have two kids with Celiac and Rollin Smoke's staff is very knowledgable about their foods and which have gluten. They have lots of gluten-free options. I'm so glad we have great BBQ in Summerlin now."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into this place I felt so welcome! I couldn't get over how the owners momma was sitting a table over from my girlfriend and I talking to another couple like they were long time friends she even offered them to try some of her food! You don't see that very much.. the staff was so amazing and very friendly the come out and talk to the customers! Not to mention the food is amazing!! I love this place and will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"The food was expensive. I paid $18 for a meal and a drink. The ribs weren't that great, but I liked the brisket. This location is really small and kind of hard to navigate with how close they stick the tables together, especially when you have the drinks, condiments, and cutlery shoved in the same little corner as the trash can and everyone is trying to get in there at once.   My brisket tasted good. My friend wasn't a fan of the meatloaf. I got horrifically ill for the rest of the night after I left. The only thing with allergen information on the menu said that the meatloaf was not gluten free, so that kind of makes you assume everything else is gluten free, right? I had never had any kind of reaction to barbeque before. Idk what was going on with my meal, but I was in agony for a good 5-6 hours after eating here."}
{"text":"I usually get the 5 meat combo or ribs combo from this place. They seriously know their bbq. All the meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender. Highly recommend the corn nuggets. That is my all-time favorite side dish. This location delivers (I'm not sure if the other one does?) which is a plus in my book! The last time I had them i ordered delivery and everything tasted great except the banana pudding. I don't know if maybe it had been packaged earlier and been sitting in a fridge for a few hours but I wasn't a fan of the consistency. I had ordered the bread pudding before when I was at the restaurant and I remembered it tasted better there. So the lesson is: don't order the banana pudding for delivery."}
{"text":"The sides are excellent! Great service , cute atmosphere chicken was very juicy. We ordered the 5 meat pit special for lunch. Great price for two people and plenty left over to take home. Honestly I would go back just for the chicken and sides ! So good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The staff was insanely friendly and polite, plus the BBQ is some of the best I've had in the valley. This is absolutely a must go place for food!  First, when you walk in you are overwhelmed by the delicious scent of properly made BBQ. The staff greets you quickly and with a genuine smile on their face. They'll offer suggestions if you need it or space if you simply need to review their rather large menu. It should be noted that while the are not the cheapest joint I think their prices are well justified by the quality and quantity of food. I personally had the roasted chicken and the sliced brisket with a side of waffle fries. The chicken was moist and well seasoned while the brisket literally fell apart when trying to pick it up with a fork. All of their rubs were delicious. They even season the waffle fries, which were perfect. I highly recommend their \"Arkansauce\" as it was by far my favorite.   And you cannot I repeat cannot skip dessert. I had the berry cobbler with ice cream of course, and it did not disappoint! Tart and sweet with warm cake and cool vanilla ice cream. It was a pair made in heaven."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that there's a Rolling Smoke in my neck of the woods! No longer will I have to travel over the river and through the woods when I have a hankering for some good bbq.  This location of Rolling Smoke manages to be nicer than the original, without losing its charm. Still a cosy restaurant with just a few tables, it's nice and new (and the bathrooms are clean!). The menu is the same as the original. You order at the counter and someone will bring it to you when it's ready. You fix your own fountain drinks. Nothing fancy!  We chose the 5 meat platter, which came with BBQ chicken, ribs, brisket, hot links, and pulled pork, along with 2 sides. It's enough to share- if you like all of the meats and sides you've chosen. The brisket, chicken, and ribs were the standouts, and I enjoyed the Mac and cheese more than the green beans (although my boyfriend preferred the beans, so it all evened out).   There is a selection of sauces on the side by the drink machine, so you can experiment with them as well.  All in all, a good lunch/dinner spot that quells the BBQ craving. I hope they do well on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Jessica and Michaela! This was our first visit and I'm so glad we made it down. The brisket is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great Barbecue  The sliced brisket was delicious and the beef rib is the biggest that I have seen and as tender as prime rib. Good selection of sides also. I will be back"}
{"text":"I don't give out five star reviews very often. This place offers really good barbecue. I specifically recommend the outlaw burger. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time here and LOVE IT! The customer service is GREAT. Everyone is nice and helpful. Def recommend this spot to anyone"}
{"text":"They used to have big portions especially with brisket.  Now they're tiny now.  Very disappointed.  I used to recommend them."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ place with excellent food and service. The folks we met today were beyond friendly and I hope they have lots of success in this new location! Thank you for treating my family so well!"}
{"text":"How is it that I walk in to pick up an order via grubhub I placed 20 mins prior to leaving my place of employment just to get there & the cashier don't have it ready cause it's on a tablet that isn't present at the work station. But what gets me is I see 2 people that have pickup orders get their orders and all I got was a \"sorry\", a free drink & a \"RUSH\" on my meal! Last time I'll be coming here!"}
{"text":"What can I say. I am an absolute barbecue aficionado. I have been grilling and smoking foods since I was a wee little man.  so when I enter this establishment let's just say my standards are pretty high.  the food was absolutely amazing! And the prices weren't bad either. It's rather small on the inside, but it has enough seating for small groups and a TV for watching sports of latest news. The vibe on the interior is very quaint and has a southern appeal with some humor tied in.  I would recommend the beef brisket chopped, the smoked ham, and more beef brisket; :-)  They have a wide array of sauces that cover all pallets everything from sweet to sour to tangy to spicy.  They also do chicken there but I haven't tried it yet. They cater which is good to know.  the staff and the chefs are extremely respectful and genuinely funny. Our food was out in no time at all.  I will definitely be frequenting this establishment on a regular basis as I have a propensity for all things barbecue. But this place... Make no mistake does barbecue right!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ spots in town. Not only is the food amazing but the customer service is amazing. Leo in the kitchen is always checking on my family and I and ensuring my children love their food! The burnt ends and dirty rice along with the brisket are my fav! Love this place 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"The epitome of BBQ, you do not want to miss out on this life experience. The Brisket 3 Ways is absolute heaven."}
{"text":"I never come here because the lines are too long and there is NEVER anywhere to sit. It's unfortunate because the few times I have been able to stop by when I saw open tables I was very happy with it. I would never pick this because of that inconvenience though. I have tried the trio sammich, which is you like pulled pork I can confidently suggest to you. It's really dry at first but I am assuming its because they want you to add the level of sauce you prefer. Their sauce has a high vinegar content and taste which I am a fan of. On the side I got Mac& Cheese, Potato Salad, and Corn Nuggets. I have also tried the brisket trio with sliced, shredded and burnt ends. I can easily reccomend this too although the burnt ends are my favorite and I could go with just those!   All in all, good food but a really inconvenient place to eat. Like I said before, I never plan to eat here it only happens if I am nearby and happen to see an open table."}
{"text":"Good ribs!!! reason for the 3 star is the pricing! I'm happy to pay for quality but this isn't whole foods. way too expensive to feed a party!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Best place for BBQ that i know of in the city. An old Vegas classic with new locations in the Valley I had no excuse not to stop in and feast on some of the finest smoked brisket around. My friend wanted to order everything on the menu and insisted I order the outlaw burger so I did. The first thing they asked me is if I was sure I wanted to order it (because it's huge) I proceeded. Be afraid not my burger eating friends. The fried onions makes the object appear closer than it is ! Give it a solid press down and go to work.  First things first I actually didn't even see or taste burger it was more of a meatloaf burger which was very easy to eat so don't be scared ! If the meatloaf was on top of an actual hamburger I wouldn't be mad.  This place had great service these dudes are on it. And if yer a dude you wouldn't be mad that they had the football game on (NFL Network) I give this place 4 1/2 stars the only thing I'd say is I wish they sold was beer but I can understand why because I would never leave."}
{"text":"Went here based on the triple \"d\" show.  I was really looking forward to it.  Man what a disappointment.  The food came cold, the brisket came chopped and seemed like they chopped the bones and all.  Definately too much money for what you get."}
{"text":"Always wanted to make it out to the other location and never had a chance. Was in the area and seen they put one in summerlin so I had to go. This place is legit. Best BBQ I have had in Las Vegas yet. Walked in didn't really know what to order and the wait staff let me sample some of the brisket. That right there put it over the top as they made it easy to order and we're extemely friendly. Reminded me of eating BBQ at Grandmas on a Sunday. Everything I ordered was amazing. If you're in the area check it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried is good. I seem to go back for the \"Big Hawg\" time and time again. I've tried almost everything here, and i thoroughly approve. Come check out their Halloween decor!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment compared to the old location. The beef ribs were good, but $9 per bone???  The dirty rice was unedible. Completely mush and sitting in a pool of grease. Was excited to have one near my house, but will not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Rollin' Smoke's meats are superb! We enjoyed the beef ribs the most, was tender and perfectly seasoned. Their service is exceptional especially Sophia's. She was friendly and provided us with detailed information about the meat options and combinations. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Get the meatloaf!!!! It's the best and can't be beat. I typically hate meatloaf, but something about smoked meatloaf with brisket and pork just made me want to try it. Happy I did! We also got chicken that was moist and has excellent flavor. The mac & cheese, hush puppies, and peach cobbler was also on point. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ in Summerlin. Who'd of thunk it. A nice variety of selections on the menu. I had a brisket dish with brisket in three different forms, including burnt ends. Loved every bit of it."}
{"text":"Okay everyone has different tastes...the burnt ends we got tasted like I was licking a peppercorn mill . Never again for the meat/sauce. The corn bread and corn nuggets were great though."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town! Glad we got them on the west side. Our family splits the Pit Special and it's always a hit. Great place for adults and kids."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ!  First timers got a platter which had a little bit of everything. Yummy!  Loaded mashed and mac & cheese sides were delicious. Baked beans where a little vinegary for my taste. Rolling smoke has definitely made new customers out of us!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is great and has a nice smokey flavor. The spicy BBQ sauce is actually spicy! The sweet Mama sauce with a little spicy mixed in is my favorite. The Mac and cheese was the bomb. The baked beans are a little too sweet for me. The brisket chopped was chopped to finely I would ask for sliced unless you want to eat it in a sandwich. I look forward to trying more sides. I got the duo plate and it was plenty of food. The service was really fast. What a great BBQ find!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a casual setting! Everyone was very friendly and great location in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"A great NC barbecue place in Las Vegas. Great brisket. Great pork and Carolina vinegar sauce"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. They got my order wrong, but not a big deal. The restaurant needed to be picked up some."}
{"text":"New location! Food was great, as well as service! Sides are a little small considering prices for the \"pit special\". Banana pudding is amazing!!! Inside only has about 15 tables, a lot of people come in and take out"}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to the this place but we just walked out because all the food was cold. Another family of six walked out because food was cold too. Saw a lady checking a large take out order. One of the meals was wrong. She was still waiting when we left which was 30 minutes. That means her entire order was going to be cold when she gets home."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and service. Was here yesterday and had the brisket and pork with dirty rice and cornbread. Everything was great and the dirty rice was the best I had here in Vegas. Came back today for the banana pudding which they were out of. Thanks Jessica!"}
{"text":"This new location (to me at least) is great. Clean and more open than the OG. When I arrived in the early afternoon there was not a soul in line. I was greeted at the counter with a friendly welcome and even invited to make myself at home. However I did not feel comfortable in my undies in public so I just found a table and behaved myself.  I ordered the \"Biggin\" because I do not recall this from the OG locs menu and it sounded awesome.  This sandwich stuffed with a hot link and topped with pulled pork and chopped brisket.  The trinity of BBQ! GREAT MEAL! Huge portion of meats cooked perfectly and I topped with all the sauces. Damn Spicy definitely had some burn to it.   I definitely recommend this new location, all the great food of the other location however it lacks that Rollin Smoke aroma where you want to lick the walls. I will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to give this new location a try for a very late lunch.  I was in the mood for ribs so we decided to share the pit special.  Staff who took our order was extremely helpful and friendly but there was another staff member who was sitting at one of the tables and would occasionally do some tidying up, that could have at least stopped at tables to maybe see how everything was...being they are just opening this location.   Food was really good and moist but  it was extremely spicy that I could not eat very much.  I eat spicy foods and this was kind of overwhelming.   I've had their food before from a different location and don't remember all the spice.  Will return regardless, but hopefully next time it will be less spicy."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the prices are not cheap. That being said, the quality is way higher than a dickie's or famous dave's. The beef ribs were huge! The pork ribs were good. But I think if I choose ribs. I'll go all beef next time. Can't wait to try some of the other dishes next time."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place.  Not that we don't like other barbecue joints, but this is where we go when we're home and want to get full of some of the best.  We were excited when this location opened over here on the west side.  I've tried all the meats, many of the sides, and my wife is addicted to the Outlaw Burger.  Here are a few of our favorites from the menu:  The Outlaw Burger:  since I mentioned it, this bad boy is ground beef mixed with brisket, onions and bell peppers.  Then, because that's not enough deliciousness, they pile on some cheese, red cabbage slaw and a few other goodies, along with a crazy delicious sauce.  By the way, it's huge.  In fact, if you order it to go, they lay the toppings and bun down sideways in the to go box.  The Trio Plate:  your choice of three meats from the delicious five they have on the menu (brisket, pork, chicken, spare ribs and hot links).  My favorites are the brisket, pork, and spare ribs.  If you're not famished, you'll take about half of this home for later.  And since I mentioned brisket:  you can get this chopped, sliced.  Sliced is my favorite.  Finally, if you or your kiddo just wants a burger without all the \"outlaw\", their Lil Bitty Piggy Hamburger Meal is really a regular sized burger with fries.  (By regular I mean a normal human adult size.)  The burger is as amazing as everything else on the menu.  When you go, keep in mind the dine-in area at this location is really small.  If you're going with intent to eat there, be prepared to either wait for a table, or to fall back to telling them your order is to go.  It's definitely not a place for a larger group either.  There are tables for 2-4, and if you happen to be there when there aren't many other customers (a rarity!), you can push tables together.  But be mindful that you're taking very scarce seating away from the small groups, couples or singles who come in and want to sit and eat--this location really isn't best for larger groups.  You'll know what to do when you walk in and can make your decision about eating in or taking your order to go before you get to the counter to order.  The line to order at the counter forms on the left as you walk in, with a respectably large menu over the counter as you approach.  You can also grab a copy of the menu to read in line or to go with you if you prefer.  Regardless, whether you eat in or take out, the food is amazing.  Napkins and utensils are on the wall to the right of the counter.  Most of the dishes come with barbecue sauce, but there's more on the table.  By the way, they make their own sauces--six of them.  Don't miss out; be sure to try them all.  If you live on the west side and haven't tried Rollin' Smoke, be sure to go.  Your mouth will be happy, I promise!"}
{"text":"I was on that side of town and me and a friend we're looking for a place to grab some lunch..... we decided to stop at this place   I ordered the brisket with green beans on the side and they ordered brisket ribs and yams .....   Our food came out very very shortly ... but I was sad with mine it wasn't hot it was MAYBE a little warm but I didn't want to complain I took a view bites and that was about it my green beans we're super salty :(   I probally won't come back if I don't have to honestly it wasn't worth the price to me 40$ and I barely even touched mine"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best!!!! I threw a surprise party for my parents and mike at rolling smoke did an incredible job at getting me the perfect amount of food at the perfect time. He was professional, kind and even took a big group photo for us!! Thank you so much mike and rolling smoke for the INCREDIBLE food and INCREDIBLE service!!! I would recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Bad customer service, sub par food, small portions and over priced. They have different kinds of bbq sauce but there was only one available for me to try. They were out of sweet tea when I got here, when I asked about it they brewed some more but didn't add sugar the whole time I was there. I had the brisket sandwhich and mac n cheese, brisket was greasy and mac n cheese was bland. Will not come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The best Carolina bbq sauce we have found locally. The food was cooked to perfection!  Great prices and fast."}
{"text":"Fantastic old school BBQ! Saves us the drive of heading to the industrial location behind the strip of the original. can't go wrong with anything they have. Great sides and even better BBQ!"}
{"text":"I liked the BBQ place that was here before this spot but this spot is a legit replacement. Tried all of the meat offerings and they're all legit. I plan to be back many times to try the rest of the sides."}
{"text":"Spectacular BBQ, the host were super helpful when it came to ordering and received us with a warm welcome. Definitely visit this place if you are in town or if some one you know is in Vegas and coming to LA have them bring you grub from Rollin Smoke!"}
{"text":"The food was good and juicy. The meats were meaty and not just bone/fat. The corn nuggets were a delicious surprise. The sides were fresh. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Went here a few months back and it was amazing. The decoration and atmosphere really gives it that BBQ vibe. My sister and I ordered the 5 meat special and it came with ribs, some chicken, some brisket, some hot links and some pulled pork. There's a variety of sauces but I wish they offered a more spicy sauce as they only have 3 or 4 sauces and only one is the spicy one but was no match to my spice level."}
{"text":"I can not say enough about this great restaurant with amazing people! They took care of us today without knowing situation and really made a little boy feel special. Sometimes you never know what kind of day someone's having and how much a difference you can make with an act of kindness. Thank you again and you've made customers for life.  From, Alex Coriell, Nikaela Malerba Brown, DeAndre Capital D Robinson and of course the sweetest - Jordan Robinson :) #AngelicaWasThereToo #ThoseCornNuggetsThough"}
{"text":"There are no complaints with the BBQ whatsoever and I give that 5 stars! My resident BBQ critic said it was sacrilegious to put sauce on the meats and they were excellent! I loved it and the only fuss I would have is the potato salad was very bland. We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"We went mid afternoon on  a Friday, a line as usual, but it moved fast!!  We hit it right, the fare was excellent.  We tried the \"brisket 3 ways,\" our nomination for the best thing on the menu.  Good choice of sauces and the brisket was tops.  I watched one gent go for the special: all you can eat for $36.  You don't have to stand back in line for refills, just stop any staff member.  All you want of anything.  And you have 1 hour.  It is a fun place with friendly staff, great people watching and most of all the best barbecue in town."}
{"text":"The service was great. I asked for recommendations amd everything the girl said was good was awesome! Will be coming back! The collard greens and hush puppies are a must. My husband got the 3 ways of brisket and that was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything is super delicious including the sides!  Counter service and the food comes out quickly.  Lovely BBQ plate for under $20 smackers!"}
{"text":"Bryan is AMAZING! My first experience there was phenomenal from the food to the customer service, I thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout from here tonight and it was pretty good! I had the 2 meat combo.. pulled pork was good, and the spare ribs YUMMM! My hubby had the chicken and that was really tasty as well. Loved the potato salad and the corn fritters were a unique side option. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because I paid extra for a few sauces to try and we weren't given any at all! And for a barbecue place yo forget the BBQ sauce... not cool! But other than that we were very happy!"}
{"text":"Tiny portions, over priced. Was not impressed at all. Brisket was dry and the guy behind the counter did not get our order correct."}
{"text":"Huge servings!! Good food good service.. we'll definitely come back here.. my favorite is brisket. Oh hey they love locals too 10% discount"}
{"text":"Well if your nose is any indication of what's to come, as soon as you hit the door you know that you're in for a treat. The staff are extremely personable and funny and very patient because with all of these options ( and the smell of smoked meat) I had no idea what I wanted. I ended up ordering a brisket sandwich with a side of collard greens. I was a little put off because the brisket was chopped but the flavor was AMAZING but to be honest my favorite part was the collard greens. Ummm I'm a black woman and I'm very discriminatory about green and let me tell you!!!!! These are probably the best greens I've had in a restaurant ever!! The greens have brisket in them (need I say more?) the 5 Stars are well earned and I'd recommend this spot to everyone who wants some delicious bbq."}
{"text":"I will start with the positives.  The staff is friendly, the service is very good.  The restaurant is clean.  It hasn't changed much since it was Billy's BBQ before.  I got a 1/2 pound of brisket.  The brisket was tender and seasoned well.  But here are the negatives.  I grew up on Texas BBQ and one Cardinal Sin is that you DO NOT sauce the brisket.  Sauce is served on the side and optional for those who want it.  While the sauce was just drizzled on the meat, it still was wrong.  And the sauce they served on the side was not good at all.  I tossed it and used my own sauce at the house.  I also wanted potato salad, but they make it with onions, which I still have problems comprehending why people would do this?!  All you can taste is the onions, and not the potatoes!   I'm glad I asked though, because I was informed that they garnish the brisket with chives, too?!  What the... ?!   Most of my favorite places in Texas have plenty of onions, pickles and peppers for those who want to add that to your meal, there is no need to take anything away from the meat, if your meat is good... and theirs is!   Since the potato salad had onions, I opted for the mac & cheese.  It was ok.  Didn't have much flavor and it looked like it had big pepper flakes scattered in it.  It's nothing I would get again.  I would definitely get the brisket here again, but tell them no sauce or chives next time.  It, along with the staff, service and cleanliness is why I'm giving it three stars."}
{"text":"Hit or miss! When they are on it's the best BBQ in town but someone needs to do some quality control because I have had a bone in 2 of my 10 or so orders and I didn't order ribs (:  I was first introduced to them at a home opening in Inspirada and am happy that they opened another location off the strip. This location used to be a different BBQ place that was good also. Good food costs a little and this place is a tad pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"The brisket, corn bread and Mac n cheese was really good but I seriously can not say enough about how awesome the staff was there. Probably the best experience I have had in a restaurant ever"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place! I use to go to the location down off of desert inn, but I live closer to summerlin so I stopped by after I shopped at Kohls. The staff here is friendly and the food is absolutely delicious. I like how there is a choice of different sauces to put on your food, from mild to kickin haha. I ordered the brisker and 1/4 white meat chicken with the beans as my side. So delicious. I also ordered the banana pudding and it is phenomenal. Best way to cool down after my meal. Definitely my favorite bbq place in town!"}
{"text":"Very good!!! Glad to have a good BBQ spot on our side town! We had the meatloaf (as featured in food network)...pulled pork sandwich....2 meat combo with pulled pork and hot links....brisket 3 ways....let's not forget the sides...MAC and cheese....greens....potato salad and baked beans! All really good pork was a little dry but had some moist pieces. We will be back....please stay consistent!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to give five stars when there's no table service, and it would have been a three star but Mom insisted I bump them up.  We got one of the samplers that had chicken, brisket, pulled pork and I believe chopped brisket. Our sides were mac & cheese, waffle fries, and potato salad.  I really like that they have the reusable, dishwasher safe cups. We have a collection of these from SkinnyFats, and now we can add to it. When you bring it back, they'll give you a discount.  The food was great. I could have eaten the whole serving of mac & cheese myself, but I had to share with the fam. The waffles fries had some super tasty seasoning on them as well-there was some seasoned salt but something a little sweet as well? It was good! The meats were delicious as well, and my favorite sauce was Mama's Sweet sauce. The seating isn't ideal if you have a larger group (there were six of us), so I think if we do it as a family dinner again I would take it to go so we can have some more elbow room. The fourth star was earned due to the fact that the meal is served on little cookie sheets and they slid one into my Mom's oversized purse and told her she could have it after she mentioned that it would make an awesome cookie sheet. Too funny! It made her laugh and that was definitely some above-and-beyond service!  I would skip the rolls-not sure if you can sub them for an extra side with a little extra $$$, but we didn't eat any of them. Maybe a mix of rolls and corn bread?  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice. The first time my boyfriend and I went, we were not impressed at all. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and The Biggin Dad's favorite, and we were disappointed. The pulled pork sandwich was small and 'boring'. The Biggin Dad's favorite was pretty good though. Anyways, we decided to give it another try but this time we ordered The Outlaw Burger and The Big Hawg, they were delicious! My boyfriend said the outlaw burger was the best burger he has ever had and I enjoyed my sandwich too. However, I wish their sauces were a little thicker. The watery consistency makes the buns soggy and mushy."}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ in Vegas! Prices are a tad high but the portions make up for it..."}
{"text":"This place never let's me down. Took my fiancee here for the first time and she loved it. Glad they finally open up on the west side of town but now neednto open another in the north west by me. Portions are great for the price."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating the best BBQ I've had in years at Rollin Smoke tonight! Believe me, being from Texas that is a some compliment!! The ribs and brisket were to die for, and whatever you do don't miss the deep fried cream corn nuggets!  Noticed the three men in front of me were ordering Smoked Meatloaf that's been featured on Food Network! Looked amazing! It's family owned from Arkansas and they are down home super nice!   Forget the other places in Vegas, you've just read about the best!!! Thanks Mike and Denise! Watch out Texas, you have competition!!   Have returned several times since I posted that last review and there's never been a time I've been disappointed! Excellent BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Kept seeing mentions in the press and good reviews... and decided to give it a try. We shared the Pit Special with 5 meats. Each of us had cornbread and bacon potato salad.  We ended with an order of berry cobbler and banana pudding. Very satisfying and delicious. Neither of us could have had more to eat... portions were perfect. My husband enjoyed the Arkansauce."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Rollin' Smoke on a whim. I ordered a two meat platter with brisket and pork, as well as macaroni and cheese and cornbread. Service was friendly and quick. My food was ready within 2-3 minutes and came to my table hot. The brisket was excellent and the cornbread alone was worth the price of admission. I will definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Small place in the corner of a shopping center with a big menu , there are a lot of things on the board to read but the helpful and super friendly staff will guide you with whatever questions you have . I got the duo with chicken and brisket and side of Mac and cheese , the food is ok size and that combo (which is the smallest they have other than kids meals) and a drink will ring you up about $20. You definitely should try the sauces available to you table side , I like how they don't drench the meat in sauce and give you various options to put on the side . Definitely no \"WOW\" factor in the flavoring but it is good with enough sauce of course . I would go back to try other things though !"}
{"text":"I really want to rate this place higher but just cant. Its a little funky, kind of big portion BBQ with a bit of a twist on some of the dishes.  I have been here twice now and both times in my opinion the pork was overcooked and dry.  That's a killer in my BBQ book.    The menu is really interesting , I want to try the big burger someday. The staff is very nice, I just think the actual BBQ is average at best."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few times . My favorite is the burnt ends. Damn they are so damn good. May 28th ordered a slew of food , but about 10 minutes later I was called back and told they were about sold out of everything. The girl taking the orders and calling back was helpful but unfortunately I was told the beef ribs were huge and 2 bones were plenty to eat. I can't believe they sent me 2 extremely small bones that were actually smaller than the spare ribs that came. Better yet couldn't even eat the beef ribs they were burned to a crisp . Very disappointed in the quality of meat they sent. I'd have to say the corn bread was very good , pulled pork was ok, spare ribs were extremely dried out . Beef ribs was the biggest disappointment."}
{"text":"We have been to this place a few times on our visits and will be back again I am sure. The first time the meat was a little cold than I had hoped for but was tasty. The last time was spot on and was great."}
{"text":"The food is good. All meats have great smoky flavor. The place is small.  I had the three meat plate which had only one side. It took 30 minutes for me to get that simple plate. I was really not happy to wait so long for the meal. The price is about 30% more than other comparable BBQ place in Las Vegas area. I may return but it's just not worth the wait when there are other BBQ place around town."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time. For our tastes this place uses to much pepper in every thing. The slaw tasted like it had lots chili powder in it. The price for BBQ was to expensive $60 for 3 people. Unfortunate we will not be going back, we need good BBQ in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I'm still giving this place 5 stars because I'm not going to let one time let them have any less. I love this place. It's amazing. I usually always get the same thing. Burnt ends, corn nuggets, Mac n cheese and sometimes the fried okra. Besides the corn nuggets, the Mac was my second favorite item there. But last night it just wasn't the same. The cheese was creamier than usual, i swear it was more cheesy and less creamy. It tasted like velveeta. Super gross. I got a lot of it, and now I'm stuck with gross Mac lol but whatever. Everything else was still super good! I just hope this change in the Mac n cheese isn't permanent."}
{"text":"AWESOME BBQ........and we are from Texas !!! A Must try if in Vegas !!!! The sliced brisket, chicken, and hot links were GREAT!!!! Next time we are trying the Burnt Ends and the Smoked Meatloaf!!!  For sides, try the Kick'n BBQ beans, or Loaded Mashed Potatoes -"}
{"text":"I came to Rollin' Smoke BBQ on a Sunday afternoon it was relatively slow but the service was excellent. I tried the smoked chicken sandwich, which was too dry and sweet for my liking. The sandwich was presented very well and was served on a thick lobster roll. The crisscut waffle fries were amazing, they put a BBQ type seasoning which adds a little spice. The hush puppies and Mac and cheese were also very good. Overall, the restaurant was very clean, the service was friendly, and the food was better than most."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Vegas this is my go to spot.  Simply put this is the best bbq I have ever had.  Burnt ends are to die for.  Just go and enjoy.  There is nothing better!"}
{"text":"I always go here just for the beef ribs which are easily the best I have had.  Took a friend their yesterday but they were out of beef ribs. We had to settle for the baby back ribs.  The baby back ribs were very dry and extremely tough.  I do not recommend the baby back at all.  A waste of money"}
{"text":"Great barbecue place! We would go back for sure. Had the meatloaf and it was HUGE...will share next time. Would have given it 5 stars but peach cobbler could have been better."}
{"text":"Went there & got takeout. We ordered the shrimp plate and catfish plate. I was really disappointed at how little the portions were-catfish was ok. Shrimp portion was pretty small for 17 dollars. They also forgot one of our sides which we didn't discover till we got home. Not worth 35 dollars. Flavor was good just not a good experience this time around with the takeout  (we tried the other location a few weeks ago and it was good) Make sure you double check your order!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going in yesterday and was so glad I did. When I first walked in nary helped me throughout the whole menu. She was amazing! She definitely guided me to the best choices (the burnt ends and brisket) as well as teaching me on all the awesome bbq sauces. Will come back for sure. Service and food A++"}
{"text":"I will come back over and over again. Kaila the manager over delivered on a promise. Grub hub forgot half my order and she replaced my entire order and delivered it herself. How about that ...You earned a customer for life . The food was out of this world.  Best BBQ I have ever eaten!  Never had that kind of service from a delivery . My hat goes off to Rollin Smoke you have awesome employees and food . Thank you guys for a wonderful experience . Shannon"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in a very, very long time!! Every time we move to a new place we try to find a new bbq place, but usually have no luck. So happy to find these guys"}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. Will recommend to friends. My wife doesn't eat pork. So we had the beef rib and the chicken wings. Both good.  Don't forget the corn cake as desert!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for first time today- it was amazing!  Excellent menu- food delicious and personnel so friendly and helpful.  Restaurant is cool-and so glad I tried it!  Did take out- but will be back to eat there"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and I must say it's just as good as the original location. Today I ordered the 2 meat duo with chicken and spare ribs with collard greens and was not disappointed the meat was smokey and tender. The bbq sauces are some of the best tasting sauces I've tasted my favorite was the mama sweet. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"Super tasty ribs!! All their meat here won't disappoint, and with their signature sauce, it's a match made in heaven. I really love their side dishes of the fried okra and the cornbread as well. This place is what I crave when I'm hungry for a savory umami cheat meal.   I only wish it weren't a bit pricey, but I do know it's not cheap to buy and make quality meat."}
{"text":"ohhhhmyyyyyyy this place is normally really good once in a while you'll get a crappy plate but honestly i can't complain they have great flavors and you can def taste the smokiness of the meats"}
{"text":"Ummmm... the service was good. The food was appeasing to the eye. I didn't like the coleslaw and I love coleslaw! It was good smokey flavor to the meat, but nothing spectacularly special about this place. But maybe my opinion is a little biased, seeing that I live in the bbq capital of the world, Memphis, TN."}
{"text":"This is like coming home. You will be treated like family. The food is nothing short of the best barbecue in the US. Not KS Not TN Not NC Not TX. Las Vegas now has two locations to blow you away with the best meat and sides around."}
{"text":"The food seemed like it had been sitting for a while.  The mac n cheese was congealed and the noodles were overcooked mushy.  The chopped brisket sandwich was more bread than meat and was pretty flavorless.  For that, I paid over $16 which is a pricey lunch!  I've tried this place 2 times since it opened on the west side, and I won't be back.  So sad..."}
{"text":"Tried out finally. Since our go to closest BBQ restaurant Famous Dave's closed, have been doing without BBQ. I tried a 2 meat plate. Chose pork and chicken. Loved the chicken, delicious and moist.  No need of any sauce on the side for it. There was a huge portion of shredded pork. Lean, so a little dry for my palate, but sauce can go a long way to remedy that. Flavor of meat was okay, no where near as flavorful as the chicken. Sauces were unexpectedly thin in consistency. I don't eat sweet sauces, so the Arkansauce and spicy were what I tried. Vinegary with heat. Flavor not rich like a thicker sauce would be, but not bad. The coleslaw was tasty, different from standard as it had corn in it that I could do without. Husband had beef ribs. Very meaty and large. He liked the meat itself, but was unimpressed with the sauce. He tried out one of the sweet ones and the Carolina vinegar, both runny like what I tried. His side salad was fresh and the chipotle dressing was quite tasty. Will be happy to go back for the chicken."}
{"text":"It is crap compared to John Mull's or Lucille's over price and I can do better with a baby  Weber"}
{"text":"I love Rollin' Smoke BBQ. Best BBQ in Las Vegas. Their baby back ribs are always tender, juicy, full of true BBQ flavor, delicious, and, with lots of meat on the bone.  You have to try their burnt ends! The best ever: moist, great flavor, and juicy. My wife Liza loves their pulled pork. It is delicious. The green beans and kickin' ass beans are really, really good. Nary, the girl who works the front counter at the Grand Canyon location, is super friendly, always helpful, and just plain nice! I am a local and I highly recommend Rollin' Smoke BBQ when you want truly outstanding BBQ. I have eaten at both locations, and they are both excellent. Pete Scalisi"}
{"text":"Wow, wow,WOW! SUPER AMAZING GOOD. the best mess / shirt stains i made all week...enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wonderful flavor in the food. Will be back soon to taste the collard greens. Great service by Jessica and Michaela!"}
{"text":"This location is closer to our home.. Service is awesome! Food is great. It is less busier and crazier than the original location. Also, this location is very clean. The burnt ends and beef ribs were stellar! We would definitely come back!  Also, shout out to Danny! He made our lunch extra special! :D"}
{"text":"Ordered a whole rack of beef ribs and a pint of loaded mashed potatoes.  Questioned how many pieces in an order of cornbread - was told 2 pieces.  Added 1 order.  To go total came to $57!!!  The worker ended up charging me a pint's order of cornbread instead of the single order, so I got 4 pieces instead of 2.  Really didn't want 4, but the charge was already done so I just decided to keep it as is.  Ribs were not as big as remembered from the original location, nor were they fall off the bone like the ones at the original location.  Loaded mash was not that great and I definitely didn't feel like my $57 was well spent here... This place sucked - period."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time yesterday- pretty damn good! Ordered the Pit Special- 5 meats & 3 sides- excellent tasting & loved the tangy spicy BBQ sauce! So addicting! Mac n cheese wasn't a favorite of the kids but my Mom loved the chipotle cole slaw. Sweet cornbread was my side & it was super moist & yummy!! I will definitely be back soon!!! Best part is this place is right around the corner from home!"}
{"text":"Holy Rollin Smoke this place is a MUST if you are a BBQ LOVER! Being from Texas, I am a bit of a snob when it comes to my obsession for smoke flavored, authentic barbecue, corn bread, spicy barbecue beans and such."}
{"text":"Let me first say that BBQ is a varied and wondrous thing.  There are as many different versions and variants as there are pit masters and pigs. Some folks like it spicy while others prefer it sweet.  Some like it soaked in sauce and others like it dry.  Some like it heavily smoked while other folks prefer just hints of wood. There really is no single requirement or standard.  This is why running a BBQ joint can be a tough gig. You know you're just not going to be able to make it great - for everybody.  At its core however, BBQ is ultimately a choreography of wood, fire, and meat that, when properly executed, is a thing of beauty.  To do this at home is one thing, but to do it in a restaurant-based production line is something completely different. It is a business and an art many fail at.   I had heard so much about RS over the years I was very excited to find their new facility in Summerlin.  As a Las Vegas local, I try to avoid the Strip unless all other dining options (including the neighbor's cat) have been exhausted.  Okay...that was a joke...I love cats... and I would have to catch it.  Anyway, when the new RS opened near me, I made it a point to drop by.  With almost 2000 four and five star reviews, I went with very high  expectations - maybe too high.   I ordered two of their five meat plates to go. Each plate came with three small sides, so I upgraded them to larges and figured I would have ample food to feed six. The service was courteous and fast, so when I headed out the door with two heavy bags in tow I was giddy about the impending feast.  That story changed somewhat when I got home and uncrated the grub.   The first thing that struck us was the size (or lack thereof) of the side portions.  We opened up the large side containers to find them only 3/4 (or less) full.  When we opened up the cornbread boxes (I purchased 3 orders) we were also disappointed to find 6 tiny (I mean tiny) squares. I remember my wife joking that they had clearly mixed up their cornbread with their croutons.  By the time the sides were distributed we each had about a tablespoon or two of each one.   RANT FOLLOWS: C'mon guys - you're not on The Strip feeding a bunch of hungover tourists who will never return.  You are in Summerlin  feeding your hard working fellow locals - and we want a manly piece of cornbread and grown up side servings!  I paid over 80 bucks for my order and, for that price, I should be granted a full container of beans!! We are your desert brothers and sisters...we come to you because we are hungry...feed us! Okay, I feel better... sorry.   Unlike the sides, the meat portions were ample. The chicken was outstanding.  It was juicy, perfectly cooked, and fall off the bone tender. Great bird guys!  The hot links were tasty as well, as were the ribs.  I wouldn't change a thing on either.   The brisket and pork, however, were disappointing to say the least. The brisket we received was so chewy it required a sharp knife (a brisket no no), and the pork was something else entirely.  I have had pulled pork, chopped pork, chunked pork, pork loin, pork butt, and pork chops but what we received was a pile of what can best be described as \"pork hash.\"  It was almost minced.  When I tasted it, it became clear why they had done this. It was full of fat.  That also explained the oozing pool of grease it floated on.  It had a great flavor though - I can't wait to go back and try the actual meat.   Finally, on a positive note, the sauces were a home run.  Our favorites were the mustard and vinegar selections. Just like back home, and even a bit better.  You could pour this stuff on a rock and make it edible.  Great sauces guys! Best I have had in town - by far.   Bottom line here is that RS makes some tasty stuff; tasty enough to bring us back for a second try in a month or two.  In the meantime, my hope is that they get their heads off \"The Strip\" and start feeding their fellow desert brethren like we deserve.  I will even give them a pass on the brisket and greasy fatty pork, because their sauce is so good it even made them edible.  And the collard greens....did I mention the collard greens? Pure Southern  perfection."}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout food from this location 3 times now. In general, I'd say it delicious!! There have been a few issues such as mistakes on our order 2 of the 3 times and burnt dry ribs on the last visit.  Regardless, I think it's pretty spectacular BBQ. The chopped brisket is tender and flavorful. It doesn't require any sauce. Their sauce is on the peppery side. The greens are to die for and the corn nuggets are divine. The cornbread is delicious too but two small squares are $3.50. I think we've agreed that ordering the meat by the pound with the pint sides will feed a crowd for about $12 a person. Honestly, I've never even been inside.  I think it's a bit pricey but very tasty and I will certainly order again!"}
{"text":"Their service is great, fast, food is delicious! Ordered the Duo, w/collard greens, BBQ beans, corn bread. Have also visited their Industrial location, same ownership, same awesome food! Love great BBQ!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must go to if you're craving BBQ! The portions are huge and made to perfection. I ordered the rib platter and added the second beef rib along with loaded mashed potatoes, corn bread, and banana pudding for desert. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, and marinated perfectly. The mashed potatoes were normal, nothing too fancy about them. The corn bread was moist and definitely some of the best I've ever had. I loooooved the banana pudding definitely a must as well!"}
{"text":"The best places to eat aren't necessarily in the best locations but Rollin Smoke proves people will go to you when the food is amazing. I loved the food here, the picnic table dining area, and the merchandise made us laugh. Some of the best bbq I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq restaurant. I am so happy they now have a location in the SW. Everything is amazing! My favorites are the smoked chicken, pulled pork and the corn nuggets. If you like bbq come check them out."}
{"text":"Just ate; That sh*t was MAD good. The stock sauce could only be the Arkansauce, & that tastes great. Sweet with questionable heat. Digged it; Check 'em out!"}
{"text":"So this place used to be Billys, which I tried to get into one day but guess they closed down. Their loss is oilir gain! I like the set up, kinda like my fav place Makai. Order line on the left, registers in the back and the rest eat in sitting area. Small but I hear they will put an outdoor deck in which is great for 3/4 of the year here in Vegas. OK onto the food. The briskett ia the real deal and you can order, sliced, chopped, burnt ends or three ways. Do yourself a favor and order it three ways My son had the pulled pork and gave it a thumbs up and my niece loved the ribs. The menu is vast with lots of sides and some great sauces! Arkansauce and country girl were our favorites! There's new BBQ place on Summerlin and Reggie Hammond says come check it out. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Been to the 1st location a couple times now, always came back... now this one just opened 7mins away from my house, it's been very convenient for me to enjoy my MEAT every Sunday. Food was great, overall quality of the whole meal (x2 beef ribs, x3 baby backs, x2 St. Louis and 1/2lb burnt ends) was amazing. Shout out to Danny at Rollin Smoke 2 for taking care of us during our visit, awesome dude made me feel at home. Can't wait for my next visit (next Sunday) teehee."}
{"text":"The food here is the best BBQ West of the Mississippi! The cashier Michaela is awesome and very friendly and helpful. You will never leave here hungry."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Favorite BBQ place in Vegas.   Burnt tips were awesome and. Mac and cheese to die for.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I think I found my favorite BBQ spot. If you are from San Diego and know about Phil's BBQ, their Beefy Ribs are as good. I also tried a custom brisket outlaw, it was amazing. I wished I would've found this place sooner."}
{"text":"we been goin to the industrial location for years...seems like the quality at grand Canyon location not so good. st.louis ribs nothing like before. The hot links still rip your mouth out. good stuff. go back to the huge 3 bone meaty rib assault you had before. new supplier maybe i dont know. was best in the city in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !! \"Big\" Mike is awesome he is so knowledgeable when it comes to the menu and super friendly . When you come in here you immediately feel like family. I have always gone to their other location but from now I'm coming here it's down the street from my house and super convenient . Ribs and brisket are amazing and the sweet corn basket u must get !!   Thank you for the great hospitality ! I will be seeing you very soon !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and my husband and I shared the Brisket Three ways with waffle fries and an extra side of baked beans. It's a meal for one but plenty for two of us. The waffle fries were cold and would definitely be good if they were hot and fresh. It's a bit pricey (25 bucks) but overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Celebrating my brother in law's birthday on Las Vegas, he wanted barbecue.  We were pleasantly surprised by the flavors, portion sizes and quality preparation. We ordered catfish, baby back ribs, salt with smoked chicken.  Everything was delicious!  The ribs were extremely meaty, but not as tender as we would have liked.  Chef Tyrus came to our table to offer suffeat ions on rib choices and to make it right.  He made a couple of recommendations and brought samples to please us all.  The service recovery was outstanding .  Overall it was a very pleasant experience.  I didn't consider the sides southern in preparation but they were still good.      Before  we leave Vegas we are going back for more!!!"}
{"text":"This is what I picture in the textbooks at BBQ school. Everything is so good! The flavors are so spot on and textures too! The first time I got food from here, I got it to go during rush hour. I was so hungry, that I decided to sample those corn fritter things that they make. Those fritters never stood a chance, I ate all of them before I got home haha. There had to be about 12-15 in the box. I had purchased the meat sampler and ate on that for about 3 days. Relish! Hubs goes bonkers over the meatloaf. Whatever you pick, you won't be disappointed...i hope."}
{"text":"Nobody in Vegas can touch Rollin' Smoke!  Best pork ribs in town and the burnt ends will fill your daydreams forever.  A bit on the pricey side but if you want the best, you gotta pay for it."}
{"text":"New place and excited to try them out.    Ordered the pick 5, which came with chicken, ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and hot links.  We also added collard greens, Mac n cheese, cornbread, yams, and bacon potato salad.  Plenty of food for my family.  Everything came out quick, which was too quick.  The meats were dry and I mean real dry. Just not a good first impression. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I didn't give this 5 starts because I hold a special place in my heart for the perfect BBQ experience that involves a picnic blanket, homemade sauce, and the roasting of an animal known to a family breeder and well-loved until it's swift and mostly painless death. High standards belong to food and drink, the first paternity.   The hubby says something about, \"They have Red Zone playing. That's good for fantasy football.\" Sure.   We got the pit plate special $27, the best way to try ribs, brisket, hot links, and pulled pork, plus three sides: waffle fries, yams, & collard greens. The latter because we thought their side salad was not going to reign in the halls of fine artisian greens.   They have several sauces to choose from, but for me, Nevada chicken Cafe sauce is the best. All the meats were excellent. Moist, if not seasoned to my liking except for the chicken. Stellar chicken. Same with the greens. Next time we will try the hush puppies & the Mac and cheese on a carb day.   Yes, they have authentic sweet tea the way Nan would have liked it."}
{"text":"Got take out absolutely amazing very busy in the restaurant but from ordering to food coming out was 10 minutes , the food itself was fantastic , had the 3 meat combo and pulled pork roll"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. I had the chicken, sliced brisket, yams, green beans, and they threw in some greens for free. Everything was very good. I went with Mama's Sweet sauce and it was good but a little watery. Honestly, I am hard pressed to find something to be critical about. The service was also terrific. Friendly and very fast. I will be back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. It was overall decent but not worth it. The beef ribs were dry, the burnt ends were dripping with sauce, the mashed potatoes tasted like day old baked potatoes, and their mac and cheese tasted like Kraft singles melted on overcooked pasta. I'm giving them 2 stars because the staff is friendly, service is quick, and it's not the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"So glad this new location opened. Awesome BBQ and service. Had the plate triple - brisket, ribs, and chicken with BBQ beans and loaded mash. All were excellent. Will be back again. Thanks, Danny."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town hands down. Customer service is amazing. Walked in with 3 kids (one in a car seat) and a staff member promptly jumped up to give us his booth that he was sitting in during his break. The guy at the counter helped us get the most for our money by substituting for items that our kids would eat. We ordered the 5 meat platter and everything about it was delicious. All the sauces were good but the mama sauce was my favorite. I understand some find it expensive but the portions are huge. We fed our family of 5 for $30! Can't wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great, and a bit pricey in my opinion. The Rib Platter Special is 3 Babyback ribs, 2 St. Louis Spare Ribs, and 1 Beef Rib for $24.99. The Beef Rib was by far my favorite. The Smoked Meatloaf is a dish that was featured on the Travel Channel according to their menu. It is loaded mashed potatoes topped with a piece of Meatloaf, lots of barbecue sauce and topped with fried onion rings for $15.99. I did not like the barbecue sauce on top of this, for me I wish I had ordered the sauce on the side, it really messed up the whole thing for me."}
{"text":"If you hungry then go Rollin smoke. Rib platter with a extra beef rib is the one! Smoked chicken, links and rib tips is another one u can't go wrong. Order the corn nuggets and potato salad, you thank me later"}
{"text":"Eaten at Grand Canyon location 4 times. inconsistent food Taste and very \"pricey\" for what you get...Everything ala-carte unle$$ you \"combo it\" Many xlint BBQ places in town at far better portions & prices. 2 sandwiches, drink & modest tip $40.00.......Come-on?"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for the 2nd time and it was just as awesome as the 1st. My husband and trio platter and I had the brisket  PO-Boy. All of it was great. Everything came out piping hot and very quickly.  Michaela took our order and she was so sweet and friendly. She knew the menu extremely well and answered every question we had.  Just an awesome place!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this location online. We had a little bit of a mix up because our order was sent to the Southern Highlands location, but a manager called us and took care of it right away so we wouldn't have to refund the card.    The food was very good, I loved that the mac and cheese had a smokey flavor to it. My favorite was the pulled pork, it was delicious! I understand it's BBQ so basically all meat, but the price was a little high for the amount of food. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried out Rollin Smoke Barbecue tonight and it was amazing! My husband is from Memphis and we lived in the South so we know good BBQ. So happy that we have found a great place to enjoy some awesome food! The mamas sweet bbq is my favorite but there are other options. Everyone working there was super pleasant and that makes this place even better!"}
{"text":"This is an aggregate review.  I would like to rate Rollin' Smoke higher but they're a mixed bag.  Their prices have skyrocketed over the years and are now pretty overpriced overall.  The portion sizes vary a lot between visits, seems to change based the mood of the person in the kitchen.  It's legit Arkansas BBQ and since I'm from the Ark-La-Tex, it gives me that down home feeling when I eat here.  But this place wouldn't be anything special if it was actually in Arkansas, it would be half the price and it's just special because it's located here.  There are a lot more good legit BBQ places here now than there was when I first moved here.  I do like their large and varied menu, and the meats are good quality and generally cooked just right.  Their sauces a little watered down and lacking in kick, but they're alright.  The food at this location seems to be just the same as the food at the original location.  Don't pre-tip if you order thru Eat24, they messed up my order today, leaving me to have to try to divvy up what food we did get.  I just got refunded for the missing items, nothing back on the delivery fee or way to change the tip.  Food was cold, too."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT. Right from the start, the staff was super friendly, joking and having fun with us like we were old friends. And the food is so effing good. I love my meats, and this place was heaven. I'm writing this as I slip in and out of a food coma. I shared the pit special, a 5 meat sampler plate, with my beau. There was so much food we had to pack a box for the leftovers. I didn't save room for the banana pudding!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I think Rolling Smokes is the best bbq in Vegas. If anyone recommends another place lmk! I think the original locations food was a little better though."}
{"text":"First time here ... they got me. I'm definitely coming back for more ! We had a combo that came with 5 meats and 3 sides . The sauces that they have go great with the food! I'm such a sauce person, that was a plus. Even their waffle fries were bomb ! You basically wait in line, order your food and sit down . They'll call your name and they serve the food to your table . The place is so small, and it does get packed .. but it's clean and the atmosphere is nice. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The best bbq in town! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! I had the baked tater w a hot link on it (plus cheese and sour cream)... So so good, and enough food for 2 meals.  Mac n cheese is also awesome."}
{"text":"Most definitely the best bbq in town and the best part i dont have drive all across town for my favorite bbq anymore!!!! This place definitely a must have once a month!!!"}
{"text":"I Was already a fan of Rollin Smoke from there location by the strip. When I heard they opened up nearby I had to check it out. They did not disappoint at all. Mike greeted us and gave recommendations on what were the best options for my fiance and I. We ended up getting the 3 meat platter with the BBQ chicken, BBQ pork and the chopped brisket. With a side of the corn nuggets (definitely a must try) and an added side of waffle fries. When we sat down at our table the food came fairly quick. Mike offered up to bring us a side of dipping sauce that I never tried at the other location. It was a chipotle ranch sauce that was recommended to try with the corn nuggets but that sauce went great with the nuggets, fries and the side of pickles. I like the arkansauce and the vinegar based sauce with the bbq. I will undoubtedly be coming back again. Oh and Don't forget to save your cup to reuse on your next visit!"}
{"text":"PEPPER!!! Hope you like it cause that is the only flavor you will be tasting. This was some of the worst BBQ I have ever had in my life and I have had a lot. Loaded potatoes, disgusting, mac&cheese, horrible, the beans had good flavor but needed to cook a lot longer because they were hard as hell. The all time worst part of this meal was the god awful peach cobbler. Whoever made that needs to be slapped, and then tortured by having to eat it!!! The sweet BBQ sauce was pretty good, but not even that could save that crap. No, no, no, no, nooooooooooo."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch, my wife order a chicken sandwich I order a plate that had chicken, ribs and brisket. I should have known this place wasn't any good as soon as I saw \"all you can eat, everything on the menu.\" Our order was to go, food came out very fast. I asked the worker for extra BBQ sauce she said there was some already in the bag we got home and there was no extra sauce. That made me a little mad but whatever I was pumped up to eat some ribs. My wife says her chicken sandwich is really dry, my ribs were ok but really salty, the brisket was ok and the chicken I order was just ok. For the price I think I'd rather go somewhere else. I don't plan on come back here."}
{"text":"Baked beans and potato salad were amazing. The ribs were so good with or without sauce. The only complaint I had was the chicken was dry and didn't have much flavor. Everything else was really good."}
{"text":"The food is good but its expensive! We spent $56 feeding 2 people. The drinks and sides are a little pricey. Would I be back, yes! But only when I'm prepared to splurge a little or a lot a bit! I will also add the owner is super hospitable which I love people who interact with their customers!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!They're food was really good!Ordered the 5 meat with 3 sides and added 2 extra sides and 2 drinks for only $40!!And the food we're ready in 10mins.Mikaela/Mikayla (I don't how to spell her name) she was really nice and suggested the corn nuggets OMG it was so good!I also love their waffle fries and mashed potato.My husband loved the dirty rice.The green beans..it's ok.I just love this place!I'm gonna bring my children next time.Im sure they will love it too!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The brisket in the greens is genius. Corn nuggets are cravable thank goodness they give you a ton of them. Mac and cheese tastes amazing (they forgot our side and grubhub screwed us for $7 last time). Yams are almost as good as my Moms and hers are the best so that's saying something. Definitly pick up your food don't use grubhub. If this style food sits there or they forget something your not going to be as happy. Hot and fresh makes all the difference. Easy access too."}
{"text":"This place is weak. Tried a sampling of 4 sides and 3 meats. Not one item would I rate above a 3 of a scale of 1-10. Nothing had flavor. Bbq sauce was like watered down tomato sauce. Cobbler was not sweet at all and nasty."}
{"text":"Good service, decent BBQ, nice staff and military discount make this a good place to visit for BBQ.  Prices for the amount you receive are a bit steep and the BBQ was not outstanding, but very respectable.  That kept it from a 5th star, but I have no doubt we will visit again."}
{"text":"We came back two more times.  The food isn't the same as their original location.  I don't think we'll be coming back here.  Service is whatever, not friendly whatsoever.  Looks like a hangout spot for the workers to chat.  Tables are dirty and counters for drinks are messy.  Food is always dry and not fresh apparently.  I'll be going else where from now on."}
{"text":"BBQ was ok, prices were ridiculous. No lunch specials and I paid almost $16 for a sandwich/fry/drink small combo."}
{"text":"I'm so upset I spent $102 for some mediocre warmed up food. We got one rack of baby back ribs. Barely any meat, dry and did fall off the bone. The only good thing was that there enough for 3 people. Ordered the shrimp platter and that was $16.99 for 8 pieces of shrimp and 3 pieces on hush puppies that were the size of the gum from the gym all machine. Since they were known for their meatloaf - I ordered that. The mashed potatoes that came with the meatloaf tasted sour as if it was sitting out and went bad or if they used old milk/sour cream. We also got two kids meal for $9.99 each for some prepackaged burger patties. Mac N Cheese was not cheesy at all. It was just a bunch of over cooked smushed pasta with lots of black pepper and sprinkle cheese on top.   Don't waste your time and money, just go straight to Lucille's."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the restaurant, but my second time eating their food (first time was a catered event).  The restaurant smells wonderful with the smoky aromas of BBQ.  I ordered take out of:  a two meat meal with a side of dirty rice. Then a piece of catfish, and a half pound of rib tips.  Overall the food was good, but it is not my favorite for BBQ nor my favorite for fried catfish here in Las Vegas.  The service was very good, and the food was prepared in a timely manner.  The prices were what I consider on the high end for BBQ.  The meal includes lettuce, a piece of plain white bread, pickles and BBQ sauce of your choice; and the dirty rice was the one side I chose from a listing of several options.  The one piece of catfish (which I consider pricey) also came with one piece of plain white bread, lemon wedges pickles and tartar sauce.  I would have preferred just one piece of catfish at a cheaper price.  You can sit and eat in; it's similar to a diner atmosphere with a self serve beverage bar. Would I go back?  Yes, but only if it were more convenient than going to the other restaurants that I prefer [for BBQ and catfish]."}
{"text":"Great food, get the burnt ends!!!  Nary is so amazing.  Great service! Great recommendations!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Deliciously smoked, All American goodness with a smile!   I've tried places in Kansas that aren't this good. There was no sauce in my to go order which I took for granted there would be so the fault is mine, that was a bummer. But because of that I got to enjoy the perfectly moist, slow cooked, smoke and dry rub seasonings that would have been drenched out with some sort of spicy bbq sauce. So in other words, good enough to not need sauce...amazing.   Went back, still delicious, the Coleslaw and Brisket 3 ways this time. Got their house spicy sauce. Sweet and tangy then suddenly inferno! Sweated through the whole meal and I wouldn't have it any other way."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, will definitely be back. Prices vs. portions were a little on the high side, but food was very good. Staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"Holy smokes BBQ batman!  Had the rib platter n family had other items.  Everyone was blown away on the huge long smoked meats n fell off bone with very little fat.  Wife said best ribs between  San Diego n North Carolina.  Don't let the ghetto interior discourage you... you'll forget it all after the first bite."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and this place was close by.  We got the 5 meat meal, so we got to sample a little of everything!  Meats were all awesome and tender, the loaded mash potatoes and fried okra were the bomb! Yum!  Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Glad to see them on the SW side of town, this is the second location. Ordering was a process, slow but the food came out pretty fast. Although good, the original location in the Stripper Row corridor is raw and you feel like you are transported to Arkansas with the smoke grill out there. I may just go to the original location for future visits!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and THE FOOD WAS PHENOMENAL!!!!! We had the Pit Special (5 meats, 3 sides) rolls and cornbread. The meat was seasoned well and had a separate distinct flavor for each. We had the green beans , dirty rice, and fried okra. So delicious. The cornbread tasted like it came right out of my Grandma's butter coated cast iron skillet. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Yummmy! Everything I had was delish. The corn nuggets are worth every calorie! I had brisket and the spare ribs with mac n cheese. My husband wasn't a fan of the chicken, was pretty red in some spots, but loved his pulled pork. Everyone who works there is super friendly, and very welcoming. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place truly deserves 100 stars! My whole family took bites of each others plates and everything was absolutely incredible! This is the BEST barbecue i have ever had. The employees are extremely friendly and the environment is excellent. I cant describe in words how amazing this food is!!"}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ place! We went there for dinner and it was crowded but they have plenty of seating in an additional room. It's very casual with picnic tables so there were kids running around which was totally fine. The food is delicious. The beef ribs are big and meaty and easy to eat. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first check in here, got a locals discount...very nice, got the duo plate 2 meats one side for lunch, good size portion. These folks do it right, will be back again when I'm in the area working. I recommend this place for sure, service is great.  Luis V"}
{"text":"My mini family and I got bad poison foods. Seem they did hold of foods which was already ready in few hours ago or yesterday. Because we did ordered and it already fast arrived which isn't right. it should take long time to cooking it. Anyway I'll ask Robert Irvine and Gordon Ramsay to check this place out.   I would prefer Famous Dave instead this.   Poor my man and kids got puke and high fever. One of my kids hit seizure in the early morning."}
{"text":"Says you're open until midnight and it's 9:38pm and you're closed.   Fix your time on yelp."}
{"text":"So happy about another location . This is the best BBQ I have ever had . Love the piggy fries . So much food that even a big guy with an appetite like me had to ask for a to go container . The southern hospitality is awesome as well ."}
{"text":"We came to have lunch here because my family kept insisting that we should try it and I honestly wasn't too excited just because it seemed like a fast food place and so I wasn't crazy about it but once I saw our food come out I was super surprised. It looked delicious and tasted even better I'm a meat lover so I was in heaven. But to be 100% honest the corn nuggets were my favorite. I will definitely come back here again.   PS The mashed potatoes are the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"Food delish,  Danny is awesome helped us out w hubs GF diet!! Meat was tender and tasty... can't wait to go home and try my cobbler pie dessert!!"}
{"text":"Don't know how I missed this gem for so long!! Big portions, friendly staff, and great BBQ!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the original location but this one left me a little confused. We ordered the beef rob half slab plate and the outlaw burger. The beef ribs were super dry and the burger was just sloppy. I had expected a lot because there's so many reviews on how that outlaw burger is one of the best in town. Not really in my opinion. I'm going to say the original location puts out better Bbq IMO maybe I came on a bad day or the chefs here don't know what they're doing whatever the reason I would rather not come back. This is a way better location and it's brand new but if they don't start keeping the reputation of this place strong just like the last Bbq spot that was here it will get shut down. I spent almost $50 for something I could've got way better at a chain Bbq spot. I'm sorry for the harsh words but it's true."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite bbq joint in town.  I've been hearing for a long time about the great food at these restaurants but I had to hold out and wait for this location to open up as the other locations aren't that convenient for me.   Well it finally happens and I got to bring the family to this amazing bbq restaurant.  We enjoyed pulled pork, chicken and ribs and we had great service with a great price.   No complaints and we will def be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! And awesome food!! Thank you Michaela & Melissa!! Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Worst BBQ ever.  We tried the rib platter, meatloaf, and brisket. The beefs ribs were burnt and hard. They tasted like beef jerky. The meatloaf was ok probably the best part of the the meal. The brisket was horrible. We got the slice half pound brisket and it was dry. All you could taste was the massive amounts of pepper they crusted it with. The loaded mashed potatoes were ok nothing amazing. They would've been better if they weren't just cream. Complete waste of money...seriously. I was so disappointed when we left I almost feel like we got cheated out of our money for such bad food."}
{"text":"The food and service at this location are ok and my experience was pleasant. There's been a few BBQ places here, and this location is very pricey and mediocre. I did not find any reason to return. The vibe of the restaurant was low and the employees did not seem to be happy. They appeared to just be going through the motions to collect a paycheck."}
{"text":"Service was great as I called with questions and spoke to the manager who was very friendly.  Food was ok.  Prices for what you get are way high.  Like way, way overpriced.  In my opinion, the food was mediocre. We ordered 2 stuffed baked potatoes that were barely stuffed.  In fact, they were not stuffed, some toppings were poured over and the potatoes were pretty much closed.  Seriously disappointed.  We also ordered one pound of pulled pork, quart sides of mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, baked beans and an 8oz mamas sweet sauce.  All in all we paid over $100 for what we got including tip and $3.99 delivery. It served 4 and we had left overs of the mashed potatoes, beans and Mac and cheese.  The beans were a tad hard, so undercooked.  Considering what we paid and how boring the food was, we won't be back.  I feel bad as I like to support the little guy..."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time last week after hearing a friend say they went there and it is one of their fav places to go. It did not disappoint. The flavor is amazing. Had the chicken along with the beans and loaded mashed. Liked it so much had it again 2 days later, tasted just as good as the first time. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great experience overall.  The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  They know exactly what is gluten free. I had sliced brisket and pulled pork with bacon potato salad, which was so delish! The bf had the meatloaf, he said it was great, and it was huge.  Nice bbq atmosphere. A definite return spot"}
{"text":"This was the first time trying Rollin Smoke and WOW! I am usually not a bbq person, but sometimes I do crave a really delicious rib.  We decided to order the full order of the beef ribs,  Mac n cheese, loaded mashed potatoes, and the blueberry cobbler.  When I say their beef rib was soooo soft and fell off the bone (even for a to go order I was shocked) and it was just so juicy! The pieces themselves are thick with a good amount of meat on it. My husband and I were able to share it. He LOVES the charred parts of the ends of the ribs as well. We usually go to Lucille's, but I'm glad we tried out this place cause our mind was blown.  I loved the mac n cheese (I am not a fan of large pepper corn pieces) so that was my only struggle with it. The mashed potatoes was amazing as well.  The blueberry cobbler was different from other cobblers my husband has had, but he loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is really good if you like Southern food. We got a ton of stuff to go such as fried catfish, sausage, brisket, corn bread, macaroni and cheese, collared greens, and mashed potatoes. The restaurant when you walk in is really tiny. There are only a few places to sit down and it was definitely packed. We walked in and got our food right away. Everything was super delicious! I wish they had more vegetarian options, but for bbq there usually aren't too many options. I would definitely go here again, but I think the best option would be to go. The service was excellent. The staff was so friendly! Everyone was really positive and kind. I think there are more locations, but this is the closest one in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place, got the seafood combo and peach cobbler. Nothing was seasoned at all ! The shrimp was super over cooked. The peach cobbler was ice cold ! Not room temperature from the delivery, it was cold ! Would not recommend at all!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas and it's not even close."}
{"text":"Clean environment. Professional and friendly staff. Relatively fair priced.   The quality of the food was good. I enjoyed their baby back ribs, loaded mash, hush puppies, and corn bread. The full rack, sides, and drink came to just under $50.   I've had better ribs and I've had worse ribs. Here they were above par, in my opinion. Sides were tasty. Pricing was a little higher than I expected, but good ribs aren't cheap so I consider this fair value.   Recommended to anyone who enjoys BBQ and desires a simpler dining experience."}
{"text":"So given the new location a couple of tries. Meatloaf, stuffed baked potato, and chicken on the bone are excellent. Burnt ends were nothing spectacular. Pulled and chopped meats were sorta dry. The sweet sause can cure that. The mac and cheese was ok. The potato salad was an unexpected highlight. Would eat here again noe that i know what to get. Little pricey though"}
{"text":"The very best BBQ in Vegas!! If I could add 100 more stars to this review, I would. The best service too. Very quick and friendly. Makes you feel like you're part of the family. This is our new spot. If you haven't been here yet, you need to! This restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review; however, I'm hoping someone in management sees this.  I ordered the 2 meat plate. The hot links and brisket.  Hot links were good-definitely a kick to them. My brisket was horrible- very dry and mostly fatty grizzle. It was like they cut off the leftover fat from the brisket and crumbled it up and threw it in my plate. I could not even eat it.  Cole slaw as a side was good.  My mother had the chicken and she said it was good. We ordered through grub hub and the delivery was extremely quick! Kudos to the driver.  Not sure if I will order from this BBQ place again though."}
{"text":"Pretty sure the owner big Mike helped me. Talk about authentic BBQ this place has you covered from ribs, to sandwiches and sausage.  I had the ribs they were juicy, lord of meat, good size and wonderful flavor.   Thanks big Mike"}
{"text":"This time we had two racks of ribs and a pound of sliced brisket - always get sliced.  Ribs were moist and perfectly seasoned.  The brisket was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of bark.  We shared the food with a group and they all loved it.  This is the my number one go to BBQ place.  It has never let me down."}
{"text":"Being Southern with a deep fried palate has been a bit of a struggle in Vegas, in regards to finding authentic southern delicacies such as good Carolina Style BBQ ...speaking of which: what's your favorite kind of BBQ? Texas? Kansa City? Carolina? Memphis? So many options! A spot needs to open up that combines them all so we don't have to pick haha Rollin' Smoke does mix it up with their variety of sauces and sides that will put you in a food coma if you don't pace yourself! Plus this place is a Vegas staple with a cool down home ambiance. It makes me feel a little less homesick, and hungry :)"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! However, I have to say the staff madame feel welcome. They gave me a sample of Chipotle Cole Slaw and something to drink. They were awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Las Vegas and I've traveled all over the south with my cousin who wins BBQ competitions all over the country and this is right up there with it. Everything here is amazing from the perfectly smoked meats (brisket, chicken, pulled pork, homemade hot links, and more) to their sweet and spicy sides (mac and cheese is a must!) the corn nuggets are my favorite and the homemade chipotle coleslaw has just the right kick. Genuine brewed sweet tea and homemade sauces to throw on those ribs. If you're a Carolina BBQ fan you've gotta have their Carolina sauce. Mike the GM and his wife are such down to earth people who know southern hospitality.  This is our new go to BBQ spot!"}
{"text":"We went to the store on Highland, just north of the Wynn, & this place is a hidden gem! The food here has got to be the best BBQ I've ever eaten! The reason I only gave 4 stars was for 2 reasons ....1) They only have 1 bathroom that you must share w men....gross  & 2) be prepared for long wait times to get your food! 4 of the guys ordered the all you can eat for $34.99 which I think is a little stout for BBQ . That's $75 if you & your spouse go to dinner, $80 w 2 drinks....that's a lot for BBQ . $25 a head would be a little more reasonable . My husband ordered a slab of beef ribs (you only get 4 large ribs) a pint of potato salad & he got a drink. I had water & the total came to $48. I don't eat much so I didn't want to order a meal...I told him I would just pick off his plate, but I thought his ribs were too burnt & tough on top of rib & was too hard for me to chew, so he ordered me a catfish Poboy which took about 15-20 min to get. The bottom of the rib was very tender & flavorful ...I wouldn't order beef ribs there, I'll try the pork babybacks next time ! If you love BBQ ...you must try this place ! You'll never go anywhere else! The food is absolutely delicious & worth waiting for! Next time I'll try the store @ Grand Canyon...it's only about a mile from my house."}
{"text":"I was in the area and I could smell the bbq in the air so I decided to order food from Rolling Smoke. I am a rib fanatic so I definitely wanted to try their ribs. I gotta say I was very disappointed in the ribs. I thought they were a bit dry and the bbq sauce was not good. Very thin and too mild. A good bbq sauce is the foundation of great bbq. Come on Rollin Smoke! Y'all need to go back to the kitchen and come up with a new recipe. The brisket was dry. The greens were subpar. The catfish and Mac n cheese was ok. The prices were really high for the amount of food you get. There's way better bbq spots out there. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! We were at the downtown and now at the Summerlin location. The ribs, St Louis, Baby Back and the rib tips were excellent. We had their fries and hush puppies, soooo good!! We were greeted and checked on by a great lady named Melissa. I think I'm pro Summerlin location"}
{"text":"Both locations have great BBQ, we go at least monthly never had a meal anything but delicious."}
{"text":"Place is way over priced.  Cost $38.40 for a rack baby back ribs, side of loaded mash, & a drink.  That was for an individual serving.  For that price, I would have expected a fancier restaurant and wait staff. Order is placed at the register.  BBQ sauces are just okay.  Famous Dave's is much better value for the money and taste."}
{"text":"Don't know what's the hype about.  Waited almost two years to try this place mainly cause I don't eat on the strip. Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe i should be vegan...."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!! Love the 3 meat combo plate. Great flavors & quality food. The sides are excellent too. Very homemade & fresh."}
{"text":"We found this place to be somewhat expensive but well it. The portions were huge. My husband and I couldnt even finish. Loved the slaw! This place has a real country feel to it. Close to our house,we will be back."}
{"text":"Lunch with my sister, kiddo & niece. The atmosphere is fun! Didn't care for the metal chairs, but that's a personal thing. It's a little cramped in the dining room, but man oh man, they thought of everything in set up! There is the house BBQ sauce available on every table & then a variety of different sauces at The condiments station! They had lids for the sides and flatware for to go orders as well! They even have a Kureg! We ordered 2 duo combo and a piggy sandwich. Sissy had brisket & ribs with bacon potato salad. That ish is the bomb! Perfectly cooked potatoes, creamy, just enough mayo & the BACON!  I had the chicken & ribs with Mac n cheese. Chicken was cooked well. Super tender. Ribs were delicious. The Mac n cheese is shell pasta, so my kiddo went nuts for it! She had the piggy sandwich and she loved it. The pulled pork is so tender it literally melts in your mouth. I did find the sauce to be a little too spicy for me, but I am a wuss with spice, so if you like spicy you'll love it! A bit on the pricy side, but definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is decorated wonderfully. I love the country and modern elements of the interior. It was my first time eating here. I went with a co worker. The gentleman at the counter. Danny, was wonderful. We had no idea what to order. We asked his opinion and he knew the menu inside and out. He recommended a plate that had 5 different meats and three sides. We were able to split that meal and still had food left over. Great size portions and fantastic food. Even better employees. Thank you Danny for giving great service."}
{"text":"Very positive experience here. I ordered the burnt ends and ribs with potato salad. The ribs were juicy, meaty, and flavorful. The potato salad has bacon mixed in with it. It would be fine without the bacon, but who's saying no to a little bacon flavor. The first couple of bites of the ends were good. Then I started running into some fatty pieces, much too fatty to eat. I would guess 1/3 of the tips were too fatty. The rest of my meal was excellent. Before I left, I told the help it was all good but they might want to know too many of the tips were full of fat. I wanted no refund and it was not a complaint as much as I liked my dining experience and wanted them to know so they could avoid that experience for someone else. A gentleman working in the kitchen heard the conversation and said I had to let him make good on it. I told him I didn't want anything and I wasn't upset. He still wouldn't let me go unless I'd take another order of tips, promising they'd be great. He ended up giving me a 1/4 lb of burnt ends, peach cobbler, and ice cream to go. He went way above and beyond to do me right. And the new burnt ends were excellent. This place has some of the best BBQ in LV and they treat their customers right."}
{"text":"This location sucks! The meats have no flavor and the BBQ sauces are watered down and also lacked flavor. The brisket and ribs lacked smoke and tasted boiled.The prices are ridiculous for the amount of food they give you. I will never buy food from this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Very very disappointed.   The food was on par with Famous Dave's which means not very good.    The prices are way out of line for the portion size and quality.  15-20 bucks for lunch is just out of line.  The brisket was greasy and relied on sauce to show some flavor.  The seasoned waffle fries were sad and HUGE.  The hot link was spiced just right but the hoagie was bordering on stale.  I think it was a day old.   The green beans were the saddest of all, I think they came out of a can.   The place was clean and the employees jumped on cleaning tables as folks finished.   Vegas is not really known for good BBQ joints and there are a few gems.  This unfortunately is not one of them."}
{"text":"Very Very Good BBQ as a person who is really picky when it comes to BBQ this place is great my wife really liked it as well ... Didn't feel like cooking for MLK day but this place hit the spot . Got the pit special with 2 sides of AMAZING waffle fries and BBQ KICKIN BEANS.  A lot of food for 30 bucks def fed two people ."}
{"text":"Love , Love  this place! I've been here a few times now and every time I get amazing service and food. Their ribs are my favorite but I've tried most of their menu and you really can't go wrong with whatever you order. Definitely my go to spot for BBQ!"}
{"text":"I've been the original and this place looks and taste the same. I'm a sucker for good barbecue food and everything I have ordered is delicious. The meat is tender and the sauces are sweet and tangy. My only complaint is with the platters and plates, they would not let me substitute beef ribs for baby back even if I paid the difference. I would love to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"Yumminess closer to home now!!!  The food is fantastic, that Mac n cheese is exactly what I needed today!! The brisket and chicken is delicious.  The customer service was awesome and they are on top things!!  The place is clean and comfortable.    I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"The food here is not really the same as the one downtown.. its decent, but the one thing I absolutely hate is BEING SERVED COLD BBQ!! You can tell when a restaurant has food sitting in reach-in fridges or lowboy drawers and they simply reheat when it is ordered.  Don't serve cold BBQ, especially when both \"cooks\" are simply leaning over on the counter and on their damn cell phones.   When we walked in, there was no one else in here.. they had ample time to reheat everything properly. The ONLY thing that came out freshly hot were the corn fritters.   The mac-n-cheese is filled with whole pepper corns. Although the flavor is good, it sucks biting into whole pepper corns with every chomp of the teeth.  \"Oh, well that's how southern bbq comes\"... I've spent 16 years in culinary. Grew up and trained in Texas as pitmaster.. that's not how it is.   Overall, sad disappointment. I'm surprised this place is still open. The one good thing they have going for them here is the fact that this is now the only bbq place in this area.  Famous Dave's sucked as much as a bbq place could suck... but, we were never once served cold bbq meats!!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.Placed a large order via Uber Eats.  The BBQ itself was nothing special (pork baby back,chicken,& brisket).They use a lot of black pepper in everything,too much.  I ordered 2 bread puddings & 1 cobbler. It seems they scraped the bottom of the pans and gave us the left overs.  Too pricey for the small portions. No,I will not order here again   On a positive note,Uber Eats delivered in the time promised."}
{"text":"Very happy to see another location in town! Best BBQ in town. Burnt ends are delicious. Danny helped me out at the counter and was very helpful with his recommendations. Will definitely frequent this location!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue I have found in Vegas. We moved from Kansas City and this would Do well in that city.   Corn nuggets and okra are awesome sides.  Love the brisket.   Smoked meat loaf was awesome.  The baked potato stuffed with pulled pork was awesome for lunch.    Have not tried any desserts yet but heard lots of good reviews on the banana pudding.   Not a ton of seats so take out is a good option"}
{"text":"First time here and my husband and I tried the brisket 3 ways. It was absolutely incredibly delicious! I was hesitant about trying this place because I'm not a big fan of smoke flavor but it didn't taste like smoke it tasted like tender juicy meat that just melted in your mouth.we also enjoyed the collard greens( not salty) and cooked to perfection! I only wish my belly had more room .The portions are generous and their desserts look delicious. Great menu selection.excellent service. Something for everyone.This place is now in our restaurant rotation. Give it a try , you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cozy country atmosphere with great smoky smell. The food is delicious. Tons of variety in country dishes and several bbq sauce types. We ordered the duo with pork and brisket, pork sandwich with mac 'n' cheese, and brisket sliders with green beans.  The meat was phenomenal and the portion size for the duo was quite large. The sandwich and sliders on the other hand were very small portions. This was surprising, especially considering the price, which is why this place gets 4 stars instead of 5. Be warned, the brisket and mac 'n' cheese is very peppery, so avoid those if you're not a fan of black pepper (my wife hates it). I loved both, and the garlic green beans as well. I'll go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ!! I've only ate here about 4 times but every single time is just phenomenal. Great staff, great food!  OnlineRestaurants.com  Also delivers for them which I ordered from them and it was the fastest delivery ever!!"}
{"text":"Came in to grab something quick for dinner.  The staff is nice and knowledgeable, the service is fast and the food is good.  The Spudtastics (loaded potatoes) are my favorite item."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, fair prices. This place is amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who can swing by. They offer all you can eat and you get all you can eat - it's great."}
{"text":"LITERALLY some of the best bbq, i've eaten in a while. The meat is super tender and totally falls off of the bone. The ribs here are the true definition of finger lickin' good (;   To top off the ridiculously great food, customer service @ this location was over the top! I come in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with a semi big party & we received exceptional service from the moment we walked in until we were ready to go. We had multiple employees check on us during our visit which I totally wasn't expecting from a small restaurant like this.   As far as the size of portions, huge!!!!! Sitting between my mom and fiance, we chose to order two things & share, family style. We opted for the Brisket 3 Ways Smokin' Plate & the Rib Platter Special. After we were completely satisfied and full, we had about 2 full containers of left overs. SoOo sharing with someone is definitely an option when coming here (:   OH! & there's a pretty decent variety of bbq sauces available & all pair very well with both the ribs and brisket. MY personal favorite was the sweet country girl but all were available to try near the beverage station (:"}
{"text":"Tried the brisket, brunt ends and beef ribs a few days ago. BEEF RIBS came out on top!! Had to come back for the beef ribs again today. Fall off the bone, perfectly prepared, delicious!"}
{"text":"Rollin smoke is so yummy. I have eaten here so many times I feel like part of the family. They are so kind and they can cook their tails off. My goodness what haven't I had!? The meatloaf is amazing and unique. It is a must try. Along with the brisket, catfish, greens, pulled pork, sausages.... what haven't I enjoyed from here? Friendly people; a great atmosphere; wonderful food. There's not much more a patron could ask for."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite BBQ place in town. The brisket was our favorite from all the meats, also tried the chicken and ribs."}
{"text":"Meats taste great, but I thought the serving is a little too small. I got 2 meat combo for around $15, it just wasn't really enough food, and I am a 100lb girl. Everything tasted great though."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Brisket 3 Ways with bacon potato salad. The brisket was tender and tasty, and the Arkansauce BBQ sauce gave it just the right kick.   Nary was excellent, friendly and helpful. We joked a bit that may have been the inaugural watch-paying customer for the restaurant's new credit card machine. She got my order to me promptly and with a smile.   I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"NOT good NOT BBQ.  Tried this place before the change. Ordered pork and brisket..  Got a mess of finely chopped burnt ends I think.  It was a mess. Two meats with one side item comes off cheap and light. Potatoes we're ok but no excuse for a BBQ place serving BAD BBQ. Save your money.  Inwasted mine twice."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were going to Famous Daves across the way and decided to try this place out for the first time. And I have to say it was the best decisions of our lives to do so. We had a family platter sharing plate. It was decently priced and a lot of food. The meats were all so perfect ! And the staff was super friendly. One of the cooks came from around the back to welcome us in on our first time there. Most definitely will be checking his place out again"}
