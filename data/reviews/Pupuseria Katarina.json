{"text":"I went here after reading Yelp reviews and also seeing other people checking in on Facebook. This was my first time eating Salvadorian food and it did not disappoint! 

I went on a Sunday afternoon and when we arrived, there was no one in the parking lot, making it seem like the place was closed. Don't let the outside fool you! Everyone knows that old saying, \"don't judge a book by its cover\". Well, that pretty much just sums it up. 

We were greeted at the door by a guy who seemed to be the owner and were seated promptly. The menu is not huge, which for me, is a good thing; less things to choose from and I think the cooks can pay more attention to each individual menu item. 

Hailing from the restaurant's name, pupusas are the main staple here, which are essentially tasty corn patties, stuffed with a variety of fillings and cheese. You can choose to have it stuffed with chicharron (pork), espinacas (spinach), jalapeños, loroco (a native flower to El Salvador), ajo (garlic), pollo (chicken), and revuelta (a mix of beans, pork, and cheese). They are always served with a side of repollo curtido, which is very similar to coleslaw, and also a very thin tomato sauce. If you are looking for spicy salsa, this place may not be the option for you. What it lacks in spiciness, it definitely makes up for with taste. Ideally, you should put the coleslaw and the tomato sauce on top of the pupusa and eat it with a fork. My recommendations would be the pupusa revuelta and chicharron.

I would definitely recommend a nice glass of homemade agua de horchata, which is a refreshing drink made with water, milk, cinnamon, sugar, and a seed called morro. The horchata here is very similar to the Mexican version, the only difference being that in Mexico, it's made with rice. Either way, it's delicious and refreshing!

To top it all off, I ordered a plate of platano macho (fried plantains), which comes with a side of crema (similar to sour cream, but better), and frijoles (beans). Try dipping the plantains in both the cream and beans. You would never think this combination would go together, but it really works. 

The environment was very relaxing, with traditional Latino decorations, along with a nice Salvadorian touch. 

La Pupuseria Katarina doesn't disappoint and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good choice for people who avoid gluten, the manager confirmed that no regular white/wheat flour is used in the pupusa. 
We have tried many of the pupusa flavors and all have been very good. The fried cassava was also very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work one night and was pleasantly surprised.  Good food, good beverages, and great music.  If you haven't tried pupusas you need to go get one.  A corn cake stuffed with goodness then fried in a pan. That and a horchatta are really all you need.  And don't forget they have breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Great food! True authentic! We order for Togo or eat in at least once every week or two!"}
{"text":"The food here is ridiculously delicious. I was so surprised that such simples dishes could even have so much flavor. I got three pupusas: revueltas, chicharonnes, and pollo. I also got a side of rice and beans. The pupusas tasted great with the salsa they provided and some rice and beans on top. I've been to other pupuserias, and this is definitely the best. Great prices, too! Only $2/ea"}
{"text":"This was my first time having El Salvadoran food. I was not disappointed!!! I tried three of the papusas and the were very delicious!!! The Loco was my favorite, full of flavor. The prices here are good I spent $11 and was able to share my food with my family it would have been too much for me. I will definitely go back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing papusas, order carry out. First let me say the papusas are incredibly tasty. There are a variety of flavors, everything from spinach and cheese to beans and pork. All of them amazing. And incredibly filling, 2 papusas, 3 at the most and you have a full meal. They come with a slaw and sauce that go perfectly with the cheesy fillings. But best of all, the papusas are gluten free! I also had my first horchata, and will definitely have to order that again. The only issue is perhaps the inside of the restaurant. When I visited, my friend and I were the only customers, in fact, we weren't even sure if the restaurant was open. Then there was a roof leak at the table behind us and it all felt kind of awkward. So my recommendation is to call in your order and pickup some amazing takeout. The food is definitely worth giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Not a lot of ambiance, but the food is absolutely amazing! This is the third time that my wife and I have been there. We've only ordered pupusa plates with rice and beans. They've been running a special lately for 2 pupusas, rice, beans, and a beverage for $9. You can't beat that price and you leave stuffed as the 2 pupusas are super filling! I want to try other things, but I can't get enough of the pupusas--they are that good!"}
{"text":"STOP reading and go here! 

Authentic Salvadorian food. We were passing through town and came across Pupuseria Katarina and had to stop. Equally as good to anything we had in El Salvador"}
{"text":"Papusas! Their new location serves alcohol which makes it even better. They have so many different papusa options and the slaw and sauce is perfect with them"}
{"text":"All of the food was really good and the prices are cheap. The service was also great and very satisfying."}
{"text":"I loved it.  Pupusas and plátano frito were very good.  I would recommend it to anyone that is in the area.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the food didn't disappoint. To-go lunch special with 2 pupusa's plus rice, beans and a soda for $9. Having never enjoyed pupusa's, Yelp came through once again with a great recommendation. The slaw added a nice flavor too. Note - they wouldn't accept my credit card for a purchase under $10."}
{"text":"Amazing find!  Don't be scared to go in. Once you enter the beautiful wooden doors, you'll be surprised to see an eclectic Latin design. The menu was easy to read, and they have photos of every meal option.  Def recommend for good authentic food."}
{"text":"Fun and different foods to try. I love the homemade cheese and sour cream. The beans are amazing. The staff is very friendly and will help you find something that you will enjoy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my second foray into Salvadoran cuisine in Cleveland, and I can officially say that I am a fan of pupusas!    My husband and I shared a variety for lunch and got some to-go as well.  I think we liked the chicken, garlic, and spinach flavors best, but they were all very good.  

I would have given 4 stars, but there were a lot of bugs flying around, which was kind of gross."}
{"text":"My first Pupusa experience and I loved it. I asked my husband to stop by and pick up some food from this restaurant on his way from work. I read the yelp reviews and went from there as I could not find a restaurant menu. He got a take home menu to go, so I will post pics. I love finding these little hidden treasures around town. I had to try the Pupusa Ajo con Queso (garlic w/ cheese). When I read about it I didn't really think anything thing about it other than I should try it because of the great reviews. Boy, are the comments right on. So simple yet so tasty. I also ordered the Pupusa Locas. Again excellent. Couldn't eat it all. Had plenty for left overs for lunch the next day. The cabbage slaw and hot sauce was good. Just wish it was spicier."}
{"text":"What started out as a group lunch with co-workers ended up being just two of us...nevermind that, we still crushed a table's worth of incredible food!!!

I am usually a water drinker, but decided to give one of their local drinks a try.  I ordered a Tamarindo (sweet and sour) drink to start which was very refreshing and somewhat fruity.  My colleague and I shared several different pupusas...the revuelta (chicharron, beans and rice, chicken) and a loca [all 11 ingredients] which was seriously larger than the plate it was served on!  We also had a side of fried plantains with beans and crema.

The pupusas were great!  Large, filled pocket sandwiches that paired great with the thin picante-like sauce and vinegary slaw served on the side.  The plantains were large, plump and sticky-sweet from the caramelization placed upon them.  Served alongside deliciously creamy beans accompanied by crema it was a decadent side dish to enjoy alongside our main dishes.

Loved the food, server was very pleasant and accommodating to these first-timers to her restaurant...we will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Damn, Daniel! back it again with the delicious pupusas. (that is already a dated meme reference, sorry to future yelpers)

The food at Pupuseria Katarina is damn good. The restaurant looks like a family run place in what I would guess was formerly a Mexican restaurant. Lots of tables. Plenty of parking. Right off the Jennings Freeway/176 exit for Brookpark Road. They close at 8pm on Tues, Weds, Thursday, FYI. 

Service was definitely not five stars, but the pupusas I was shoving in my face made me not care at all. I would have liked for the server to tell us what the special was (2 pupusas, rice and beans and drink for $9) without having to say \"are there any specials?\" or what they have to drink, etc. but the server was attentive and there weren't really any other issues. 

We ordered the garlic and cheese, ruvuelta (cheese, beans, pork) and the pork and cheese pupusas, with rice and refried beans. 2 pupsas a person seems about right unless you have a really big appetite. The pupusas are thick, but very soft and light, corn tortillas filled with different items. They were so good I got an order to go for lunch the next day. The refried beans are amazing. the cabbage and vinegar mixture (I see another yelper called it the curtido) was great on top of the pupusas, as well as the tomato sauce type stuff they include.

I had a perfect flan for dessert. Sweet, but not sickly sweet. 

I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Went here really wanting a horchata.  The first two times the place was closed (later found out their times from the menu and they should have  been open, on break maybe?)  Third time proved to be the charm.  I ordered my horchata first, then the chicken and cheese, chicken and flower, and cheese and zucchini pupusas.  I ordered to go so waited in the car for 10 minutes.  The place is not very large, but it seemed clean. They also had a large TV playing a concert featuring an accordion playing.  When my order was ready, there was no horchata, so that took another 5 minutes while the lady served a table their food.  The pupusas were good.  No one was really happy with the zucchini one, but 3 of us loved the chicken ones.  None of us tried the hot slaw, but the salsa was tasty.  I enjoyed the hotchata and even let the others have a sip.  I'll go back and so would the others that tried it with me."}
{"text":"Honestly this place deserves a 6/5 stars. It is amazing!!

Don't let the fact that it doesn't have a website worry you - there are many menu options for anyone. This was my first time trying pupusas and I fell in LOVE. I got one chicken and one jalapeño one and they both were amazing! It's as if a quesadilla and a pita sandwich had a beautiful love child. I didn't know I needed pupusas in my life but I have a feeling I'll be craving this for days.

The plantains are also delicious! Perfectly crispy and amazing. They come with sour cream and refried beans. The refried beans are DELICIOUS! 

The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. This is such a cute place with GREAT prices and amazing food! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"These are hand down the best pupusas in Cleveland.  Pupuseria Katarina has a variety of Salvadorian items on the menu, but I would skip everything else and only stick to the Pupusas (we have been disappointed by the soup, and almost everyone only eats pupusas).  The quaint blue and white building can be awfully hot in the summer (no air conditioning), but the charm of the restaurant is lovely.  The staff is always kind, and willing to work with lactose restrictions.

Pupusas are a puffy corn tortilla stuffed with different fillings.  Each pupusa will run you about $2, and where else can you go in Cleveland and feed 2 people for under $10?  2 pupusas is more than enough food for a meal!  Personally, I love the ayote (zucchini / squash), and ajo (garlic) pupusas... I like them so much I can't try the other options anymore.  I have tried the loroco before (an edible vine/flower) but I didn't think it was nearly as good as the others.  They have both vegetarian and meat options including pork, chicken, jalapeno, cheese, garlic, spinach and zucchini."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed the first time I came here. Not because the food was bad, or the service was horrific, but because it was closed. This place is closed Mondays, and I alerted Yelp but it hasn't been changed to reflect the hours. As a result, I ate frozen pasta at home because I was too lazy to make real food. Curses!

Anyway, I came back the next day. This place is less shady and appears to be cleaner than the other pupusa place I frequent. Regular pupusas are $2 each. I got a couple to go, along with their Pupusa Loca that includes all of the ingredients (pork, chicken, cheese, loroco, garlic, spinach, jalapenos and zucchini, I think) and is about the size of a small pizza for $5. 

I was a little disappointed that I got such little curtido and salsa roja to go, considering I got 5 pupusas, one of which was oversized. I got about half a plastic baggie for the cabbage slaw, and 2 small containers of salsa roja. I should have asked for more, since I love pickled veggies (I swear I'm not pregnant). The curtido was crispy, refreshing and tasty. The pupusas were delicious! I liked the pupusa revuelta the most, although the chicharron came in a close second. I didn't get to taste the pupusa loca since I got too full--2 pupusas will fill you up!

For the 4 pupusas and 1 oversized pupusas, it was $13. I shared with a friend and only managed to finish the 4 pupusas. Which means we get to eat the oversized one tomorrow. Yay!"}
{"text":"This is probably closer to 2.5 stars, but I have a love affair with pupusas an I really wanted to love this place. I was left with more of a \"I don't really have anything else to do, and at least I may get free dinner out of a couple hours\" type of like, certainly not an \"I can't love without you\" type. I was very excited to see the long list of fillings available that did not involve meat. Being a vegetarian, I do love my beans and cheese, but sometimes, it's nice to have choices.  We went on a Saturday, waited in the front for a few minutes and were finally seated. There was a table of about 14 people, and it appeared to be only 2 servers. We sat at our table for about 10, 15 minutes without being asked for our drink orders or any other type of order.  The boyfriend tries to avoid cheese (strange, I know-but I've come to terms with his weirdness), but he will indulge in certain situations...that being said, the other pupuserias that we've been to have been able to make his pupusas sans cheese. Our waitress informed us they could not do this, which while not preferred, was ok. Between the 2 of us, we ordered 6 different pupusas, an order of rice, and some plantains. After about a 25 minute wait, the pillows of goodness arrived....
And I was disappointed. The size was great, but the fillings and texture of the dough left some to be desired. Burnt and a bit greasy, the additional fillings such as zucchini, loroco, jalapeño, etc, were lacking. The beans were bland. The garlic pupusa was awesome, but I found myself wanting to go to Casa Tazumal and fill my yummy pupusa craving. 
All of this being said, they were very busy. The server did let us know that their regular cook had had an emergency. We may have just come at the wrong time. We'll probably I back, but it won't be for awhile. I know they are still relatively new, so I hope they'll be able to work out some of the kinks."}
{"text":"My only regret is that I came here alone. It would have been nice to try many different dishes! You can really fill up for little money with the pupusa. 

I came in on a Saturday evening around 6pm. It was mildly busy but they were anticipating a large party so the hostess/server seemed a little distracted when I arrived. The menu looked intriguing but I asked my server to order for me and she chose an assortment of three pupusas. I could only finish two and a half but they were delicious. I would give it 4.5 stars if possible just because the service could have been better with more of an explanation of the menu."}
{"text":"There interior was pretty legit. The place literally gave off a Hispanic vibe (especially the music). The service was great and omg the puposa. How have I never heard of it before. I got the puposa Loca which had everything and their exotic flower that gave it it's distinct taste. Everything was amazing. I am coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant to host a small lunch meeting and caught my eye on Pupuseria Katarina. The reviews alone had me dying to try it. It's located just minutes from my job, and I'd never had Salvadoran food before. I ordered hibiscus drink, steak tacos and plantains. Really good! I want to come back and try the tripe soup."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've had my pupusa fix. Why am I eating anywhere else? 

Got 10 perfectly made jalapeno and cheese pupusas for $20. Added on plantains with refried beans and sour cream for another $6. Entire meal was, as always, ethereal. Seriously makes me miss waking up to anoles running around wherever I was staying in central America.

Bonus, the basement is a club on the weekends. Karaoke on Fridays."}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely loves it here, and only had great things to say about it! I can see why! I've never had a pupusa before, and I was quickly addicted. Don't be intimated by the old brick exterior. The interior is welcoming and authentic, and the staff is excellent. The pupusas are served fresh and hot, and come with an amazing tomato sauce! Yum!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the revuelta pupusas. The yuca with chicharron is fantastic. Small, family run restaurant. It's a great place to get our Salvadoran fix. We've been coming here for a few years and it is nice to see how they have grown."}
{"text":"Yes I am a fan of this place! It's located right off of I-176 so it's easy to get to. The inside has the typical Central America restaurant decor with lively colors, landscape paintings, and birds. When I first walked in there was no one to greet me but a gentleman quickly showed up and we had a pleasant conversation about the menu. I went with a variety of pupusas at $2 each since that is what this place is known for. I also opted for the sweet plantains, refried beans, and homemade sour cream platter which came in at $6. (Prices are great here!)

Pupusas are like a stuffed pancake but made with masa - a corn dough. The garlic and cheese pupusa smells amazing and the Revuelta with pork, beans and cheese is the most popular pupusa, but they have other flavors with chicken, exotic flower, jalapeno, spinach or zucchini. The pupusas come with a simple but tasty cabbage slaw (no mayo base here) and a thin tomato sauce. They're about 5 inches in diameter and two are enough of a meal to fill you up; A simple tasty meal!

I found the fried plantains, refried beans, and homemade sour cream to all be pretty tasty as well. I can't stress enough how good simple authentic Salvadoran food is! I will definitely hit this place up again, probably on a Wednesday though since that's when they make their special sweet corn Atol."}
{"text":"I have been passing by this location quite a bit, so I figured I would stop in and check it out.  The outside is kinda of rough looking, but the dining room is alright with a faux hacienda look.  I stopped in for a late lunch and there was one table of guests already there; but it took about 5 minutes until anyone showed up to seat me.  I ordered two pupusas, one with spinach the other with jalapenos.  Both were relatively small, about 5\" across and rather bland.  It was hard to taste any difference between the two; the jalapenos were very scarce and far too mild.  The tomato sauce that comes with was watery and had no real flavor to it.  The slaw was a bit better, vinegary with some very hot jalapenos.  Service was OK, but seems a bit distracted.

Overall nothing great, but nothing horrible, just not the kind of place that I will head back to since there are better alternatives for this type of food."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp reviews. Glad I did. The restaurant is in an old building and it smells old too BUT it is very clean. The service was good and everything seemed very authentic. Even the menu was in Spanish. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. I especially liked the traditional drink, Horchata. I ate and was fully satisfied for $11.88."}
{"text":"These are the best pupusas in Cleveland! I had two revueltas the other day and split platanos, which come with beans and rice, with my table. They all were full of delicious flavors. I love this place!

My mother had the pupusa loca, which has all the ingredients in one pupusa the size of the plate. She said it was delicious. She ate a third of it and was full. My mom also loves the curtido, which is a cabbage and vinegar mix that goes on top the pupusa.

My boyfriend had the hen soup and appreciated that it was brothy and light. He also said he enjoyed the hearty veggies and chicken mix. It was served with veggies and rice.

I wasn't crazy about the marañon drink but that just might be a matter of preference bc I'd never had it before.

The service is decent and the place is cozy and has a mom and pop feel."}
{"text":"Food is consistently amazing and service is even better. Just wanted to update and give 5 stars, they have earned it!"}
{"text":"The pupusas were ok - a little bland.  They had a great app that we enjoyed.  Unfortunately, they charged extremely high prices for their alcohol and the shots are VERY small.  They charged us $7.00 for a very small shot.  They had no alcohol menu and no advertised prices.  It was our fault, I suppose, for not asking, but when you are paying $2.00 for a pupusa it is a shock when the shots (very small) are $7.00 each.  They also tried telling some of the people in our party that they asked for double shots in their margaritas which they didn't.  And, in fact, they said they couldn't taste any alcohol in their margaritas.

So, if you go, only go to eat."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch at 1pm on a Wednesday. The restaurant was mostly barren - not just in terms of guests, but also servers. I stood by the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign for about 10 minutes before a server finally recognized me and gave me a seat. 

I ordered the pork, chicken and spinach pupusas along with a side of plantains. Then waited for about 25 minutes until my food arrived. The food was hot and definitely fresh, but I wonder how the kitchen would be able to handle busier times with this type of pace. 

The plantains were my favorite part of the meal. Cooked to the right level of crunchiness, the sweetness from the plantains paired well with the sour cream and refried beans. Not exactly a mixture of flavors that is intuitively tasty, but it worked. The pupusas tasted homemade, from scratch and had some slightly burnt pieces of melted cheese, which I actually enjoy. While flavorful, I wanted some sauce or curry to go along with the pupusas - the slaw and salsa condiments did not do it for me. 

My first foray into Salvadorian cuisine was neither a bust nor anything exceptional. If I come here again, I would likely do takeout and try other items aside from the pupusas."}
{"text":"After reading positive reviews I came in today to try the jalapeño and cheese pupusa . I wound up with the combo special. 2 pupusas beans rice and a beverage for $9. I opted for the fresh pineapple juice for .50 more. Was a great deal!! I chose the zucchini and cheese and also jalapeños and cheese. The jalapeño was very hot and good. All in all  They were very tasty and I was full. I will return."}
{"text":"This was AMAZING! Our waitress was so sweet and answered a ton of questions. House made cheese was spectacular! Papusas were perfect! Yummy yucca! Great spice on the pork. We found this place by accident and SO glad we did! We came from 3 hours away and we will come again when we are back this way!"}
{"text":"Tasty pupusas that satisfied my craving since moving to NE Ohio from DC. Lots of filling options. 

Location moved a few blocks away on brookpark Rd. Yelp needs to update address. We almost didn't make it because wrong address is listed."}
{"text":"wow. i'm in love. i went on a wednesday night and ordered four pupusas (revueltas, jalapeno, loroco, and the loca), plantains, and the hot corn drink. show stopper was the plantains. like, i'm-so-stuffed-but-i-need-more kind of experience. and then the hot corn drink tastes like a snickerdoodle. it gave me warm fuzzies. this might be my new wednesday hot spot!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Salvadoran food, and it's been solid the four or five times I've stopped in.  

The building itself isn't very scenic- it's a windowless bar-type structure, and is a bit dark inside.  It's clean otherwise, but don't expect a Gordon Ramsay restaurant or something.  

The menu makes sense.  The pupusas are the centerpiece, but they've also got some El Sal/Mexican dishes that are pretty solid.  Honestly, I've mostly just stuck to the pupusas, including the gigantic, coma-inducing Pupusa Loca.  They've also apparently started serving breakfast, which is a shock to me since I've never seen them open before noon and I'm just a couple minutes down the road.  On one occasion about a year ago, I ended up calling them to see if they were open while I was in the parking lot.  It was a little awkward, but not the worst experience.  

Prices are fair, portions are generous, quality is high, and service is, by and large, attentive.  Definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed. I picked this restaurant on a whim to meet my mom for lunch, trusting my fellow Yelpers' good taste and positive reviews. Wow are those pupusas good!"}
{"text":"This was my first lunch here and I can't wait to come back for more!  The owner took my carry out order and he was very helpful describing the menu.  Very friendly.  My to go order came out fast and I could not wait to pull into my work parking lot and try these pockets of amazing flavor.  At a glance- they are small- but they are not!  They are hot, filling, so yummy and the flavors all stand out.  I had pork, cheese and bean and also a chicken.  The freshness of the ingredients are apparent on the inside as well as the warm and tasty masa on the outside.  The fresh cabbage slaw and side of sauce add depth and crunch.  I seriously can't wait to go back and eat everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"The food is great and prices are low. Problem is the service: it took well over 40 min to get served after ordering when the restaurant was only half full."}
{"text":"What a find! Thanks to Yelp, I stumbled onto this place. I'd never had a pupusa before, but these were so good, I will be back for more! I tried the Chicharron con Queso (ground pork w/cheese) and the Spinica con Queso (spinach w/cheese), and they were fantastic! These pupusas are made of masa, had a good nutty taste, were about 6\" around, and there was just the right balance of filling inside them. They were hot off the griddle, & accompanied with curtido (a mild fermented slaw with jalapeños) and salsa roja, which you put on top of your pupusa. The salsa roja is a thin tomato salsa with just a little heat. Two pupusas were enough for a quick lunch, and at $3 each, really quite reasonable.

The place doesn't look at all fancy from the outside, but don't let that discourage you. The dining room was bright & decorated nicely, and had cool Latin music playing. I was surprised that the place was not busy on a weekday. You really should try this place!

Update: Pupusa price is now $3, but still reasonable. The dining room has been modified a bit, now open to the bar area. A few diners today, but the food is so good, I'm surprised this place isn't packed! Try it!"}
{"text":"The pupusas are amazing!  Shared five with two others and had more than enough!  We tried the pollo, loroco, jalapeño, reveulta and chicharron and all were amazing :) there are still about 5-7 more we need to try.  Also going back ASAP on a Friday for some empanadas!  The service was quick and friendly.  The spicy slaw is perfect on the pupusas."}
{"text":"The building is painted in blue and white to represent the colors in the flag of El Salvador. The inside is also painted in this theme. There were Hispanic music videos playing on the television. The women in the videos were gyrating in a way that captured my spirit and made time pass too fast. I could have watched the videos for eternity. Then the food came out. The pupusas are fluffy and airy. 2 of them is plenty and cannot be beat for $4. A little different from the more crispy ones at Pupuseria La Bendicion. Both restaurants serve up delicious food. I will support both and alternate visits. Pupuseria Katarina has a slight edge in ambiance with the paint, music and videos. This is a great new restaurant and awesome dining option for the Parma, Brooklyn and Independence neighborhoods."}
{"text":"This being my first time eating Salvadorian food I would have to say it's delicious! 

I got take out from here this past weekend so I can't really comment on the waitstaff or service. However my order was completed very quickly from the time I called to the time I picked up was only 25 minutes and was ready and waiting for me when I came inside. 

Placed a large order for 4 people we tired almost everything. These unsuspecting tiny pancake like pupusas are oddly filling. I would say that 2 pupusas are filling and maybe 3 if you have a voracious appetite. 

Pupusas ranking (top to bottom):
Chicharron con queso (pork)
Jalapeño con queso 
Espinaca con queso (spinach)
Revuelta (mixed beans, cheese and pork)
Pollo con queso (chicken)
Aja con queso (garlic)

I would recommend any of the above, they were all scrumptious! The pickled veggies and tomato sauce that accompany the pupusas are fantastic additions and need to be eat together for the whole experience. 

Will be coming back hopefully very soon! You can't beat the portions for the price and $20 for 4 people to eat to bursting is a bargain!

Can't wait to try the pupusa loca and ayote next time!"}
{"text":"Ate here with friends the other day based on recommendations from some Spanish interpreters. The owner greeted us warmly, offered some great suggestions and was very patient with us when explaining the different dishes.

We started with the Atol, which is a hot soup-like beverage made from sweet corn, milk, cornstarch and cinnamon. It was delicious. They only serve it on Wednesdays, so plan accordingly.

I ordered two pupusas - one revuelta (pork and beans) and one chicken - and an order of fried plantains, which came with refried beans and sour cream. I preferred the revuelta over the chicken, but they were both good. They were even better paired with a forkful of beans and sour cream along with the slaw and hot sauce that come with the pupusas. The plantains were delicious, nice and sweet.

My friends all ordered vegetarian pupusas - the \"exotic flower,\" spinach and garlic - and were very pleased. The spinach one looked super-cheesy. I can't wait to go back to try some more pupusas. Maybe next time I'll go crazy and order the Pupusa Loca. In any event, my bill was less than $13 and I left stuffed."}
{"text":"Great hidden mom and pop shop in Old Brioklyn. Authentic Salvadoran food. I got the Papusas to go. Pork, chicken, and loroco. I was stuffed. Could have just eaten two. The cole slaw was medium heat and home made salsa. If you are looking for authentic Central American this is your spot. Small dining area if you want to eat in or get it to go."}
