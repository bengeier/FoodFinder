{"text":"Lite Bite is a lunch stop mini restaurant located at 145 Wellington Street West. I have to admit that the food is average, although I will say they make a good souvlaki. Everything is pretty much overpriced for the quality and make sure when ordering you dont get the wife Betty  and wait for one of the other girls to take your order. She doesn't put the sandwiches together well and I've heard her on more than one occasion mutter to her staff to hurry up and serve us if we come closer to 2:30 as it is the end of the day."}
{"text":"This is a nice quiet family owned sandwich shop, they're only open Monday to Friday early morning to approximately 3 PM. The husband & wife have been in the area for 20+ years and are very personable. It makes it nice to go support a small business like that when you see the actual owners behind the counter smiling and servicing customers. They have daily specials but admittedly I've never had anything outside of their Egg BLT sandwich for breakfast and their chicken breast sub for lunch. It's affordable and very tasty place to grab a quick bite for lunch. I wouldn't ever consider eating here otherwise but since I work in the area it's a great option; I have it almost once a week. There are much more expensive options in the area that would serve you lesser quality food so give this place a try. Make sure you say hi to the staff because I'm certain they'll greet you with a smile."}
{"text":"So there's this small shop on Wellington just tucked in among all of those massive bank and insurance towers. I've probably passed by this everyday without even noticing it.

It's a pretty tight space inside, with all sorts of packaged food and drinks placed throughout the room. There are no seats, but there are plenty of food courts nearby.

All prices on the menus are tax-included, which is pretty nice. You're looking to spend $5 or $6 on a sandwich here. There's a specials menu on your way in, which lists some items that aren't on their menu.

They've got some hot trays at the back, and that's probably where you'll want to go to pick up some fresh-made sandwiches, salads, or wraps. They've also got a several beverages available such as coffee and tea.

I ordered a homemade burger which was the special of the day. It came out to $5.75, but you can just see how fresh the lettuce and tomatoes was: quite different from the ones you get at McDonalds or SUBWAY.

The meat, however, left much to be desired. I had ordered a Jr Hamburger from Wendy's and found that the Wendy's patty had much more of a beef patty flavour and texture compared to the one here. Although it was quite large (8-oz), it was more like a meat loaf than a patty.

But overall the prices can't really be beat if you're looking for something fresh and not SUBWAY.
I wonder how the salads and other meats are like."}
{"text":"In a world that is dominated by snooty overpriced restaurants, mediocre food court junk, and office chocolates that make people fat, there is a hero that is offering low-price homemade snacks to ward off lunchtime hunger and 3pm after-lunch sleep spells right here in the financial district. 

Lite Bite, with its unassuming storefront, actually holds a treasure chest of treats within its walls. The mom and pop takeaway shop makes things mostly by hand and is such a great alternative to food court fare. When you don't want to spend $15 on Manchu Wok, they've got you covered with daily lunch specials that range from Shanghai noodles, chicken on a kaiser, lasagna, pasta, burgers, and the list goes on. Prices are typically less than $10. 

Craving something a bit more predictable? They serve up sandwiches, subs, salads, and homemade pastries around the clock. They've also got an extensive breakfast menu to go along with your morning coffee. My go-to is a chicken salad sandwich on brown toast with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, a little bit of mayo, and a sprinkle of pepper. I don't know what it is about that sandwich, but to this day, I'm still craving it. Total, $5. In the afternoon, if I get peckish, I pick up a chickpea and bean salad for $2.50. If I'm feeling a bit naughty, I go for a $1 slice of banana bread. 

Lite Bite is a refreshing switch up from the food options surrounding it. Honest, unpretentious, small business serving up a delicious and budget-friendly variety. Next time you're deciding between getting a donut or breakfast sandwich at Tim's, maybe swing by here for a hearty and healthy Toasted Western on a bagel. At Lite Bite, the bites are indeed light and the food is always just right.

{"text":"When I worked closer to this location I used to go daily, my go-to order was the BLT sub, not sure what it was but it tasted much fresher then subway or Mr.Sub. Tax in it's about $5.35.

They also daily specials, which range from Chinese food, burgers, pasta, etc. 

Their constants are sandwhichs and salads. 

Prices are great typically with drink $6 or $7, my fav. is on Monday Shanghai noodles with pork. 

There's no seating, it's a small mom and pop shop, super friendly, cash only, you can even buy the lottery here as well."}
{"text":"Great little family owned resto a few footsteps outside of work, so very convenient for me.
I love this place and places that are independently owned because you know their ingredients don't come from frozen bags with expiry dates longer than my lifetime.

This cute little spot even has a small patio area in front for you to enjoy your food outdoors. They have a vast variety of food, all depending on the day. it changes daily and they have daily specials. My coworkers have gotten lunch from here which has a heavy box of carbs, meat and veggies for around $8-9 - pretty good for downtown core! I always get soup here, when it's vegetarian. Their soup tastes clear and has none of the MSG and processed bullcrap. It's filling too; a large is around $3 and makes me full for 4-5 hours, so it prevents me from getting office munchies and snacking at my desk.
They also have fresh breakfast sandwiches, which include lettuce and tomato, for the same price as timmies/mcds and it's way healthier.

All in all, you can't go wrong with this place. The staff here are always friendly and ready to help."}
{"text":"I visited this place this morning and they were super efficient with the lineup. This is really good for people in a rush in the mornings but awful for first time visitors. My friend and I felt super rushed by the lady behind the counter, who repeatedly suggested and asked me what I wanted, there wasn't anyone else waiting to be served at the time. 

My friend got an western sandwich  (they microwaved an omelette and put it on a toasted bagel) and I got a cinnamon bagel w/ cream cheese, it was $4.5 and $2.5 respectively. This is really unreasonable for the price, everything was extra (tomatoes cheese, lettuce) and the cream cheese was the block type used for baking/cooking which they pre-sliced. 

The food was really disappointing, would recommend a Tim's over this. It will be tastier and cheaper, trust."}
{"text":"Lite bite is a quintessential take away breakfast spot for me in the financial district. Family owned and operated by a Greek couple, the breakfast sandwiches are well priced, substantial and delicious.  I have never gone for lunch so I can't comment on that, but for a quick breakfast, this is the go to spot for the downtown core. 

Protip: try the iced frappe, the owners import Nescafe  from Greece for an authentic greek iced coffee"}
