{"text":"Food was good. Took 10 minutes to take drink order and another 10 to bring it. Service was very poor and slow. If you have a short time before flight, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre.  Ordered the Irish lamb stew and it was basically a watered down and bland lamb-soup; adding insult to injury, it was a snack-sized portion.  Find another place, there are much better options at YUL."}
{"text":"Ordered fish and chips with poutine.  Fish was undercooked and had a very fishy flavor to it (presumed frozen). Poutine was possibly the worst poutine I have ever had.  Servers were all very friendly and the drinks looked good, but I was not a fan of the food."}
{"text":"Hurleys at YUL is located in the US departure section of the airport.  Used to be the sports bar now completely renovated with a great selection of on tap and bottle beer and whiskeys - food menu has lots of choices - I had the fish and chips - delicious fries and great tasting batter... sports screens all over to watch the game before you take off! Have a great flight !"}
{"text":"I didn't have super high expectations for an airport restaurant. I was wrong. Nice atmosphere, great food, very reasonable prices and friendly staff. If you have time to sit down for a meal before your flight or on a layover this is a great option. They also had nice cocktail options."}
{"text":"Had a Caesar salad and Poutine at Hurley's in the Montreal Airport.  The waitresses were very friendly, the service prompt the food just slightly above average.  I ordered the salad and the Poutine and they arrived together.  They were both good as compared to most airport food.  I would definitely eat there again if I had to choose."}
{"text":"It's in the airport on the US side of departures.  Not too many choices here, but I wanted to kill some time and grab a bite while my flight was delayed.  After reading the reviews, I decided not to get the poutine.  Instead, I got the chicken ceasar salad and a side of sweet potato fries.    The salad was not good.  The lettuce seemed fresh, but there was so little dressing on it that it was mostly dry.  I had to ask for additional dressing on the side.  The chicken was so bad that they should have spared the life of the poor chicken they killed to make it.  Not joking about that.    The fries, on the other hand, were fkg amazing!  Probably some of the best sweet potato fries I've had in a long time.  Overall, don't expect much.  Service was fine, food was eh.  But it'll do okay in a pinch."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and good food, and they dont really hit you over the head when it comes to prices...high class, i liked it"}
{"text":"Airport food is never that great but Hurley's I highly recommend. Had the steak salad (very fresh and well cooked) and club sandwich (good bread and exceedingly good sweet potato fries). Service was fast and super friendly and responsive.  Huge cut above every other (more trendy) restaurant on this airport row. Really excellent place."}
{"text":"Male waiter was an asshole, talking over us and then ultimately getting our orders wrong. Food was ok. I won't recommend this restaurant and will try something different next time I'm waiting for my plane."}
{"text":"I was quite happy with this experience! The prices didn't seem jacked up to take advantage of the passengers, the service was exceptional, and the food my waitress recommended was actually delicious. Kindly Irish pub vibes are very welcome when traveling, and they've hit the service nail on the head with middle aged bilingual service professionals who are clearly being treated with respect, who value their customers and their jobs.   I ate the veggie burger with mushrooms and Swiss and it was surprisingly moist and tasty - perfect plane base. Loved sitting in the big bright window watching the snow. Happy I made it past Houstons in the US departures wing to find this bit of chill."}
{"text":"Not many restaurant options at the airport. The burger was decent. I had the fish & chips, switched the fries with salad. The fish was large and very crispy. If you don't know what to get, the fish was good.  The glass of water they gave us tasted like chlorine. Not sure why.   Our waitress was really nice but service was kinda slow. She did ask what time our flight was before we ordered. Luckily we had 2 hours to spare but then waiting for the food took forever and we became nervous as time got closer to boarding time."}
{"text":"I forgot a receipt. Could you issue it again for me?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple drinks while waiting for my departure. After being served my first beer, never saw the waiter again for an hour +. The staff are loud and unprofessional when horsing around in the kitchen. Not great."}
{"text":"Solid bar with nice choices of high end beverages, especially scotch. Pleasantly surprised, but really otherwise I wouldn't even have gone near this joint.  Thankfully I had time and really just wanted to watch the game on TV and Hurleys at Yul offered a lot of seating. I suppose I'm being a bit harsh considering it is an airport location, but really it was a bit pricier than I expected too.  Seriously you don't have many other options on the US side of the airport here, so if you have time come check it out for some solid beverage choices and decent food to boot."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, 4 stars  A bit pricey but good service and while food may have been warmed up from yesterday, it was still tasty.  We had meatloaf & mash, French onion soup, and a Caesar. If it was not in an airport, 3 - 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I realized that I ate pretty much nothing but meat, cheese, potatoes, and bread while in Montreal, so why stop now that I'm at the airport.  As far as the selection of food options at the airport, they offer some heartier options like stews and burgers. I opted for the Murph Burger, which came with jalapeno, havarti cheese, onion rings, and chipotle. The burger was juicy and the jalapenos were hot. The meat itself could have used a little seasoning pre-cooking. I ordered a side of poutine, which was fantastic. I eventually ditched the bun on my burger and just ate the meat, cheese, and jalapeno bites sandwiched between poutine!"}
