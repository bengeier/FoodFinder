{"text":"I personally recommend this place. Friendly staff, nicely decorated and delicious food. Especially the yakisoba ( must try )."}
{"text":"Love that we have this great new sushi spot so close to home. We have been there twice, and sat at the bar both times. Very friendly service and nice atmosphere. Not a sushi connoisseur, but I like what I had here. The Godzilla roll in particular is very tasty. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious and the service was great. Would definitely go back. Perfect addition to this neighborhood and plaza."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love the scorpion roll & homemade green tea pan a cotta. Not on the menu. Check with Chef Tony!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, cute decor and great service. Some of the best sushi thus far in Pheonix area."}
{"text":"I discovered Yama because a few days before coming here for dinner i had a craving for teriyaki chicken and i ordered to go from here (per Yelp's recommendation).  Honestly the teriyaki chicken disappointed me a lot, not good, mushy chicken and pretty bland.  But i gave it another try because of the reviews on Yelp.   So the day that i came for dinner i experienced fantastic service and food!  Visited on a Wednesday night (ladies night, half off red wine).  We got three tonkotsu ramens and one yakisoba noodles dish.  All were delicious.  And the service was great too.  Very friendly server, waters filled promptly, very attentive.  We will definitely be back to try the sushi!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is Amazing! Great food great service, the owner Ken is coool A F. Not a big place but it's good food , the baked lobster is A1"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town, without compare. The rice is fresh, rolls are fresh made when you order and fish is sooo good! 5/5 score on the crazy tender and flavorful pork katsu (not typical Japanese, but you'll be glad when you try it). I did make one mistake when I ordered a poke bowl. I didn't realize there would be wasabi in the poke dressing. I will order it again, the rest was to die for, but this time without the wasabi dressing on the hamachi."}
{"text":"First time here.  LOVEd the food. So glad it's close to work and home so I can visit often.   CA rolls were awesome.  Goyza was best I've ever had.  Shrimp tempura was awesome.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Yama Sushi has been the best Sushi place I have ever been to. The staff is very friendly always making sure you have what you need. The Sushi is amazing as well. Definatly would recommend going to Yama."}
{"text":"This is a great destination so definitely make a trip to Yamas. Owners are great and the sushi is very reasonably priced. Some rolls are 20% less than what I see at other Sushi Bars."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed.. sushi was ok. Nothing to write home about. But the service was awful.. we ordered a bottle of wine and the girl brought it to the table and just set it on the table.. didn't open it or pour it for us.. luckily it was a twist off, but had to pour it myself.. never had that happen before."}
{"text":"Just went to Yama for a late lunch today. The manager guy let me order off the happy hour menu even though it was a little early. I had a spicy tuna roll for $4.00 and the tonkotsu ramen for $11.00. Both were great, but wow, that ramen was fantastic. I sat at the bar so I could get a look at the rolls being prepared, all looked delish with nice presentation.  Staff was super friendly/attentive and I liked the modern but cozy digs as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! This is a nice cozy restaurant that exceeded my expectations. Excellent service, fantastic sushi, and a wonderful atmosphere. I couldn't ask for anything better. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves sushi."}
{"text":"Went here with a group friends and we all loved it. The sushi is great and fresh, you definitely must try the miso soup and sake! They have a variety options to choose from other than sushi as well, I'll definitely be back to try something new."}
{"text":"Great food ! Chef Tony came personally to ensure we were happy with the food and service ."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The sushi is so fresh here and the ingredients in the roll really speak for themselves. They have the best gyoza! You can tell its freshly made there. The staff was great and welcoming, super helpful and nice people. This is the perfect spot for a date night! Or meeting up with your friends before going bar hopping."}
{"text":"The food here isn't the best especially for its price. However, the service is really good. I would recommend the owners to improve their sushi rice. They served me nigiri and the rice was really just steamed rice rolled up to a ball. It did not have that vinegar flavor."}
{"text":"I really do not get why this place gets five starts. I ordered 5 rolls to go and those rolls were the smallest rolls I've ever seen. When I placed an order, I thought I ordered too many since normally 4 rolls are enough for my husband and myself. However, we were still VERY hungry after ate all of the rolls. Another negative was, they didn't not give us chopstick nor soysauce . I was very hungry and angry so will never return."}
{"text":"Im back again! Good food great people and good vibes! If you havent stopped in yet come on in! Great sushi and great service"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this convenient sushi bistro, yet the sushi was sub par, even for a landlocked establishment. TLDR: HH Prices were competative, but sushi was not. Honestly, are the five star reviewers eating at the same place I did?? I appreciate venues that let fish shine and offer a variety of flavors within their house menu: sweet, crunchy, fishy, savory, tart, earthy, etc...so was disappointed to find a menu heavily featuring krab, cream cheese, excessive sauce, and mostly salmon or tuna--small amounts at that. I can't even say I liked the seasoned rice, which recalled a guilty grocery store sushi purchase. Nigiri was dry and chewy. Overall, the best roll at our table was just OK. Service seemed to over-compensate as if aware. Didn't feel the happy hour contained any sushi gems. Can't speak to the quality of hot dishes as we ordered sushi only.  The location and interior are charming and staff kind and competant, so in my heart I'm rooting for Yama House to flourish! But as a somewhat experienced sushi goer, I can't endorse the star attraction. At least at the time of this review..."}
{"text":"The food is delightful, the interior is spotless, and the staff are rather courteous. As my first visit, they left a good enough impression as incentive for me to return. Also, the waitress Sia was very well-mannered, ever endearing, and knowledgeable of the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Wonderful service. Everything about this little gem was fantastic. The sushi was all fresh and the sale went down excellent. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a high quality sushi joint in mid town."}
{"text":"fabulous sashimi and a grand scorpion roll. sat outside with heaters. excellent service. would go back."}
{"text":"Great specials for happy hour and first Fridays. Nice selection of rolls (the godzilla one is very tasty). The service is always excellent. The bar area is a great place to sit, especially when it's crowded. Love having this place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Our server Amy was amazing, super nice and genuinely helpful.  Amy got our review to 5 stars.  She explain our order well, plus we ended up getting one extra order of Fried Bean Curd.  Salmon and asparagus was awesome, the rolls selection was my style.   I say definitely give this place a go. --- GREAT SUSHI my wife love the sushi --- Decor is cool and the place is very comfortable.    So ask for Amy and order some Salmon and Asparagus rolls, Ok and some sushi."}
{"text":"We have been to Yama Sushi twice now.  It was great the first time and even better the second.  Tony, the chef and owner server us.  He recommended excellent dishes.  It is now our favorite Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Presently surprised when walking in. Nicely designed staff was friendly and food was great."}
{"text":"YES! A great sushi spot in Midtown! Service was super fast, lots of beers on top, and their sushi is dang delicious!   We ordered the yellowtail carpaccio, and as a wimp to spice I was intimidated (jalapeno slices with seeds were layered on top), but I would 100% order again.  Good food and on-point service wins me over. I'm excited to try their ramen/non raw fish dishes!"}
{"text":"So great. The owners are truly wonderful and spent a lot of time at our table. The rolls are creative and the sashimi was really fresh.   Best sushi in north central by far."}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying that this was some of the best customer service we've had in a really long time!! Super friendly staff that make you feel welcomed, give great recommendations on food, and make sure you're having a good time!! Loved it!   I saw that this spot just opened up a couple weeks ago by our place so we went to try it for a late lunch. We had perfect timing because happy hour had just started :). The owner recommended the Gyoza - so glad he did because it was delicious! We normally just stick to edamame as our appetizer so it was a nice change that did not disappoint. We stuck to the happy hour menu for rolls and got the Godzilla roll, Hot Night roll, and the Vegas. They were all so good but the Hot Night was my favorite! You can't go wrong with spicy tuna on top of a roll :-). Support this new local restaurant. They offer the whole package - excellent service, great food, and great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I had being looking for a sushi restaurant and Yama is the place there food is freshly make,we'll cook, well served and pretty good deals for happy hour. I loved the place plus they have a patio to eat with heaters pretty good place to enjoy."}
{"text":"I can walk to Yama Sushi so I have been a number of times. I went alone tonight and sat at bar. Ordered a couple Nigiri pieces and a roll. I then played \"your choice\" with my sushi chef Bruce.   Created a couple great orders. This is a great place with quality fish. It was a great dinner and experience tonight!"}
{"text":"Love Yama so much. My fiancé and I come time and time again and every-time we are never disappointed! Staff is friendly and Great deals during happy hour as well. If you like cucumbers I would recommend the Lollipop Roll. That's my all time favorite here!"}
{"text":"Great edamame appetizer, hamachi kama, California and ninja sushi rolls, Hiro sake, and service from our server Sia.  She even brought us some very tasty Gyoza to try.  Nice small but open setting, cozy, will definitely return to try out more."}
{"text":"Yes it was excellent!!! It's a new place that opened with good sized portions, great quality food, beautiful presentation and amazing service. The atmosphere inside, as well as the space design is gorgeous. Feels like a five star sushi place in NYC. Happy hour was awesome with plenty of choices and great prices and they had plenty of wine choices to go with my dinner. Nothing was missing and not much more you could ask for!"}
{"text":"When you go to sleep and close your eyes this is what you think of when you eat the lollipop roll. Come see for yourself?"}
{"text":"Oddly there are a lot of sushi places closed today, so glad this place was open.  The parking was a little strange at first but once you get past that the food and service is worth it. Everyone was so nice upon entering and exiting, the sushi chefs even made sure to acknowledge us. I have a personal opinion about places that have fresh wasabi, if they have it it's legit sushi!"}
{"text":"The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the sake bomb / beers are way overpriced in my opinion. I originally tried this place about a year ago and ordered a boat of sushi. All in all, my boyfriend and I were not very impressed but it was also our first boat go around so maybe we didn't realize what we were getting ourselves into.   Fast forward to a week ago and we decided to give it another go around. They have reverse happy hour fri and sat from 9-11 pm so we figured we'd give it a try. We fell in love! Other than the overpriced sake and beer the sushi was amazing. Best spicy tuna roll in town and the tuna lover and black& white specialty rolls were delicious and left you craving more! The yellowtail and scallion offered nice full pieces of yellowtail and no fillers. The spicy yellowtail which was not on happy hour was also extremely good. We went back for more a day later and I can't wait to go back again.   We did try the golden avocado which was aesthetically appealing on the menu but I would definitely choose another spicy tuna roll instead of getting it hands down.  Service was great and very attentive. Everything we asked for was delivered quickly and accurately. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Awesome place in Central Phoenix for Sushi. The sushi is \"to die for\" Attentive service and the prices were within reason. Love the trendy décor and the staff was more than accommodating. One problem I had with the establishment was the parking, as there is not enough parking in the front of the business. We ended up parking in a empty lot on the adjacent street. Overall a great experience and will definitely visit again.  Cheers to you Yama Sushi!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh fish and great service. Definitely my new go to sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Cute little place really on trend. We had the best Saki here. That menu is extensive. The food was great. The sushi was tuna sea bass mackerel salmon and shrimp and it was 5 star fresh. We also enjoyed the cooked yellow tale. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted very fresh and I like how they didnt pack our rolls with alot of rice. The restaurant looked very nice and modern. The owner, Tony, was super friendly and excited to seat and serve us. The pork Katsu was delicious. It's a very new restaurant and I'm excited to come back again!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service and great specials for lunch and happy hour! Perfect sushi spot."}
{"text":"First visit and we went late evening after happy hour specials were over. Service was great. Server was very attentive and pleasant. They have a decent selection of sake on the menu. Menu prices seemed reasonably average, but then when our rolls came out I was a little surprised at their size. The rolls were a bit on the small side and I'm not sure they warrant the regular menu price, though super tasty. Shrimp tempura were also somewhat skinny and small compared to what we usually get when ordering the same at other places. Overall we enjoyed the food and the service was great. So will definitely return, but will shoot for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch. This place ROCKS! Great food, great service, & great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often, but I was compelled to after trying Yama. My parents were in town visiting and I decided to take them to what looked like a popular new spot here on yelp. This was some of the best sushi I've ever had! But what made the experience 5 star was the customer service. We were made to feel like VIPs from the second we walked in the door. Anytime I'm craving sushi, will definitely go right back there!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place with amazing food and great service. We got a chance to speak with the owner and cook who were so sweet and talked to us about the opening of their business. I couldn't have been happier with choosing such a small quaint sushi bar. Now the sushi was amazing, I recommend for those who love sushi to try the Las Vegas roll it is to die for. We also had the lollipop roll which was unusual and I have never seen before yet extremely tasty. We also got their gyoza aka dumpling and they were so delicious with an amazing dipping sauce on the side. I would recommend this to anyone who loves sushi and great service! I will be back soon, considering it is 3 minutes down the road!"}
{"text":"Great food and FANTASTIC ambience.  Service is extremely attentive, place is very clean and hip.  Right in the heart of uptown Phoenix, close to a rail stop.  If you like sushi, great place to go.  Bento bowls are very good and priced right!"}
{"text":"It was very busy on a Friday night, but our server was very kind and handled it well.  The spider roll and spicy scallop (nigiri) were both excellent!  The eel avocado roll I probably would not order again.  We also had a sake that was one of the best I've ever had- Sayuri Nigori."}
{"text":"Yama is my new favorite sushi spot! First off the staff is so amazing, friendly, personable and not annoying (because we all know those places)! The food is fresh, tasty and didn't take years to get to our hungry tummy table, either :) It's in a great and easily accessible area, making for the perfect, sushi craving hitter, any day of the week!! I just moved down from Alaska and have already found my new, fresh seafood sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"My first time to Yama was extremely fantastic, food came out fast and was amazing and the employees were kind and attentive, 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"Loved this place came with my baby due to a Groupon deal. Waiter was super nice and friendly. Ordered 4 rolls and edamame. It was all delicious. No bad experience other than parking have to park on the side but once u figure parking out it was a great place. Will def come back"}
{"text":"This is a cute, little sushi restaurant right in the middle of Downtown Phoenix. Nice ambiance and very polite servers.  The specialty rolls are delicious. They had a scorpion roll (which I had never seen at any other restaurant) and it was awesome. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The best word for our experience is \"meh\".  It was noisy and service was chaotic and slow.  Orders came out at random, and they were (in 2 cases) totally wrong.  Now, they didn't charge for the stuff we didn't order, but still.  Salmon was fresh and tender, but mackerel was gross ... tasted like a fishy refrigerator.  The staff seemed to be trying, but we won't hurry back."}
{"text":"Had my first visit here due to the great reviews on Yelp and I was soooo pleased with my entire visit! From the moment I walked in the sushi chefs greeted me which was awesome and welcoming. Once we were seated we were greeted by our server who was SO sweet and nice and attentive! We had miso soup to start and we tried a variety of rolls... EVERY SINGLE ROLL WAS DELICIOUS! Came in during happy hour and got such good deals! Not to mention, the server reminded that happy hour was approaching an end and if we wanted to add anything before happy hour ended. Coming from a restaurant background that is so rare and showed she cared more about our experience than making more money. I will definitely be going back and I agree with all the great reviews, I'm a fan lol"}
{"text":"Great place for outstanding sushi. Central PHX has an awesome sushi location. Superb sake selection. Excellent service. Best gyoza ever!"}
{"text":"Newly opened.Very nice place. The ambience is good. The sushi is delicious. Good Friendly service. They have happy hour everyday 3pm-6pm, good specials. Come check it out"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty good. Ambiance was so so and patio was real loud with central- needs some barrier between. Service was lacking knowledge on menu but nice."}
{"text":"I am SO excited that Yama Sushi House has opened! I have been twice already and I can't wait to go back. Everything is delicious...from the miso soup, to the golden avocado, the yakisoba, ramen and of course the amazingly fresh sushi. The staff is so friendly and welcoming, I have definitely found my new favorite sushi spot!!"}
{"text":"Went with 3 friends and had a ton of food! Tried 10 different dishes, each one was superb! Great service, clean, friendly, and thoughtful. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"I really can't understand how this place has 4.5 stars! Granted, the service was great. Even though it was very busy that night, the servers came around often to fill our beverages/clear our dishes/etc., but not to the point of smothering us with attention. In that regard, I think they hit the perfect note. However, the quality of food was VERY underwhelming. Actually, the actual phrase I used after paying the bill was, \"I feel like I got robbed.\" Our order of chirashi had pieces of fish that were not properly cut - there was one piece that was still attached to another. That tells me the sushi chefs are not properly trained. Not only that, the pieces were tiny. There was a large mound of fine julienne daikon to make it look hearty, but the serving was so small for an $18 dish. The rice underneath was not sushi rice, either. Most Yelpers seemed to have enjoyed their rolls (they were just OK in my opinion - nothing to write home about), but if you're looking for quality sashimi/sushi, this is NOT the place. Save yourself the heartache, and hit up Hana (BYOB -what!) or Hiro instead."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi spot in Phoenix. We've been coming here since they first opened, and have enjoyed watching them get better and better. Don't let the small size fool you, every dish is incredibly fresh and memorable. I'm a huge salmon fan, and a good sashimi is the way to hook me. The salmon sashimi here melts in your mouth, and is better quality than big name restaurants. The prices do not reflect the quality or portion size  here, they could easily charge more and we would be happy to pay it ( but please don't, it's one reason we can haunt this place). We have never once been left wanting more or disappointed. Perfect for date night or when you just want superb sushi."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place! I absolutely think PHX was in need of a new- good sushi place since my favorite place in Old Town closed. The atmosphere is nice, cozy, simple decor, kind of modern, I found it pleasant. It was really cold temperature wise,  mentioned it to our server, she had someone turn up the ac, which was really considerate considering I was really cold and I didn't know if anyone else might have been too ( it was warm during the day, so it's understandable), it was great customer service to adjust the temp to make it more comfortable! We ordered a few different things off the menu, which is very neat and organized, isn't to overwhelming, easy to read. Any questions we had were answered. Our server again, was so kind to let us move over to the table next to us since it was bigger and the food we ordered was out growing the table we had been seated at. The food came out quickly, and we enjoyed everything we ordered! The sushi tasted great and very fresh! Our server was very sweet, very personable, prompt and very accommodating. I look forward to going back! Thank you for bringing central PHX a delicious sushi place!"}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, service and food! Happy Hour is a must and is now our official date night go to"}
{"text":"Great little spot! Everything we had was delectable! Prices are reasonable. All the seafood was very fresh. We were lucky with parking, but I can see where that could be a challenge.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here! Food was delicious and our server, Jason, was great. We had the gyoza, spicy garlic edamame, two rolls, and ramen. Everything was great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing sushi dinner here last night. The waiter was awesome, friendly, and attentive but not bothersome. We had the spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, Las Vegas roll, chicken tempura roll, and a crab something roll (can't remember the name). It was all delicious! I would definitely recommend trying this place, I'm for sure going to go back!"}
{"text":"A+   Recommendations: Lunch- tuna poki bowl, gyudon, katsudon Dinner- sushi or chicken udon  The yam tempura rolls and eel are prepared very well here.  Everything is good here except the ramen- if you want ramen check out  ramen dozo in Tempe."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best happy hour in the valley. Phoenix is sleeping on this place! Service is outstanding and I love the mellow environment and the sake bombs. Get the Godzilla roll. Mmmmmm go yama"}
{"text":"So happy I visited Yama. Salmon is like butter. Everything was amazing. I want to move in to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Happy Hour prices are amazing. The staff is always super friendly. This is a smaller place with a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Super great service and food   Fish was super fresh and noodles were perfect texture ! We were only in Phoenix for a couple of hours and enjoyed our stay so much ! Must go"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I do not use 5 stars lightly and I'm fairly critical when it comes to restaurants. Having worked in the restaurant industry for many years in the past I have certain expectations.    This place exceeded them all!  The service is top notch.  Extremely friendly staff that is very welcoming and genuinely seem to care about the customers and enjoy what they do.  We had the pleasure of meeting the chef/owner and this man was a delight!  I just wanted to hug him!  We started with the spicy garlic edamame and the Agedashi Tofu.  Both were very flavorful and fantastically prepared.  We then had a sampling of different veggie rolls, sushi rolls, and nigiri.  Not one thing to complain about.  It was all very fresh and the veggies were crisp!  Dare I say...probably the freshest sushi I've had in the desert.    We will be back again and again.  It is walking distance from home and I have a feeling We will be regulars.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a large party  (16-people) on a Saturday evening. The manager and staff did an exemplary job accommodating us. The food was excellent, pricing was reasonable, and service was outstanding. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Yama Sushi twice now and have very much enjoyed the food each time.  The staff are very friendly.  The sushi comes out fairly quickly and is excellent quality.  I like this place a lot.  I had to take away one star because each time our service was a little slow.  I think our waiter just had too many tables.  Despite slower service, we will be back for sure because the sushi is really yummy."}
{"text":"Great service and even better sushi. Recommend the lollipop roll. Recommend trying their coconut fried shrimp if available as a special"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in CenPho! Walking you see a remodeled restaurant that appeals to the eye.  We were immediately greeted by a lovely server who sat us right away and took our drink order instantly. The happy hour is honestly ridiculous amazing! $4 rolls, $5 sake bombs (small) $7 (large), free gyoza if you like their page on FB by 11/30, $2 edamame... just awesome! Even with these prices you are still getting great quality!  The owner and/or manager introduced himself to us and made sure we were having a great experience.  If you haven't been here, check it out!"}
{"text":"Chef Tony and all the staff are very friendly! The sashimi is excellent, very fresh and good portion sizes. We came with friends and tried pretty much all the rolls on the menu! You must try the Golden avocado and the dumplings, so good!! They offer traditional rolls plus some very creative, very tasty originals. We loved everything we ordered and highly recommend eating here. This just be our. Ew favorite neighborhood sushi place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, good service. Small place but that wasn't a problem. Waited a while for one of our rolls, but we think the waitress forgot to put the order in for it, and we had plenty of food to eat in the meantime! Will come back for their happy hour sushi specials again."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night for First Friday! They were offering amazing deals on food and drink. For the quality, you couldn't beat those prices. We were there around 9:30p til close (11:00p). The inside seating was a bit loud at the beginning of our meal, due to the small space they had. But that's a minor detail in comparison to the delicious food we had and service we received. Will definitely be visiting this place again in the future!"}
{"text":"All of my visits here have been really enjoyable dining experiences. The tonkotsu ramen was perfect for lunch when I came here on a cold day; the ramen was piping hot, the broth was very flavorful with a generous mix of ingredients such as cured egg and slices of pork. I returned for happy hour two days later and got the godzilla roll and a spicy salmon roll - both excellent, and I washed them down with a refreshing glass of Sapporo beer. Yesterday I came with a friend and we enjoyed excellent shrimp tempura, ramen, salmon roe nigiri, and a delightful blossom roll. The very friendly staff, very reasonable prices, the modern Asian decor, and of course the excellent food make dining here a true pleasure and I know more return visits are in order."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, wonderful restaurant. Very good food. Will definitely be back again after having such a good first experience."}
{"text":"I love Yama!  I eat here at least a few times every week. Everything I've tried has been delicious, fresh, and high quality. I especially love the poke salad, the golden avocado, spider roll, and the hot night roll.   The staff is friendly, accomodating, and always greets me with a smile. The restaurant itself is well-designed and looks hip and swanky. This is a great place to take a date or a group of friends for happy hour! Great location too- super close to the light rail so you can have that extra sake bomb..."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Sushi is pretty good. Great service. Parking is very limited, so street parking on Pierson might be necessary."}
{"text":"I just moved to Phoenix from California and was looking for a good new sushi place. The atmosphere was welcoming and the service was good. The food was prepared quickly, was delicious, and reasonably priced. Coming from California I have very high expectations for sushi and I was impressed with this establishment."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for Yama and decided to finally use it. My friend and I were seated right away and started to look over the menu. We decided on some sushi rolls, miso soup, and some cold sake. They did not have hot sake here, which was a little disappointing. We got our sake right away and then it began. The very very long wait for our food.   After waiting for quite a while, our server returned to let us know our sushi would be out in 5 minutes. I had to remind her about the miso soup, no big deal but we could have been eating the miso during the wait.    When we finally got our sushi we were excited! This was relatively good until I noticed that the rice was a little hard. My friend had the same observation. This was a little disheartening.   I probably won't be going back to Yama anytime soon, but it was a nice meal and worth the Groupon price."}
{"text":"This is a pretty fresh spot. The sushi is very good and there are a lot of different kinds of sushi to choose from. The drinks are reasonable price and they have an awesome deal for the ladies to get sushi and a bottle of wine on Wednesday nights. Unfortunately I am a man and I cannot get the deal :(. When is gentleman's night? 5 stars when this place brings forth a gentleman's night with a pitcher of beer."}
{"text":"Food is very good!! Especially Yaki squid jumbo taste very special! Highly recomended"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The prices are great and you get good fast service!!! Any time they offer beef ribs, you gotta go for it!!! No regrets"}
{"text":"Definitely won't return! Will sway people from coming here.   High hopes for this place because of all the reviews but the sushi was DISGUSTING! First of all,everything on the menu has siracha and jalapeños on it and second of all the menu is completely unimaginative. The patio area is nice but for the size of the restaurant you'd think the service would be better. Honestly can't believe how awful of an experience I had here."}
{"text":"Went here for my girlfriends birthday and it was really really good! I had the rainbow roll as well as the spicy tuna and spicy crab rolls, all prepared to perfection! If you are looking for a nice atmosphere and great customer service I'd definitely recommend it! Chien was our server and they were great!"}
{"text":"Overpriced rolls, smaller portion food that aren't really that tasty.  I'm willing to pay $$$ for good food but this isnt the place to spend that kind of money. Best Sushi place in AZ I have ever eaten is Shimogamo. Made by real japanese. It's as close as authentic taste in my opinion. I have been to Japan before so yea I have taste real quality food there. People that said this sushi place is great had no idea what they are missing.   On the other hand, their entree isnt too terribly price or taste weird (compare to their sushi). I would suggest getting entree rather than sushi if you must come here to eat. Their omurice is actually not bad.   Service can be horrid especially when you order for pick up and was told it takes 15 mins, you went there and they made you wait another 15 mins and more. I order for pick up percisely because I dont want to wait that long. Manager was the one taking my order too and told me the time which made the situation worse. It seems like he didn't know his own kitchen.  The good: They have done a good job with decorations of the place. I appreciate it when a place put effort on making their restaurant presentable. But its sad when something is pleasant to look at but hollow and has not other quality.   The cons outweight the pros when it comes to this place though."}
{"text":"My faaavorite AZ sushi place! I'm really picky with my sushi. I grew up in Southern California by the beach, so fresh sushi was all around me. This is the only place in Phoenix that I've tried so far, that has given me the feeling of home! The fish is delicious and fresh. The staff is so kind and nice. It's rarely super busy so we always get sat and start eating almost immediately. Pro tip: go on Sunday's after 2 for happy hour. Miso soup becomes a $1, and the price of the rolls gets seriously reduced. My favorite roll is the Hot City Roll (I believe that's what it's called). SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"So glad this spot was filled by a wonderful business. Went with a friend a week ago and I can't wait to go back.   When you walk in you can tell they really took their time on decore and layout. Not that no expense was spared but they were effective. I love the layout and colors.   The service was perfect. Very prompt and helpful. They all seemed to enjoy their job. I assume they are either family or the management has trained them well. We were impressed.   The sushi was top shelf good. We got the Baja Roll, Godzilla roll, and the Hot Night. The presentation was very good but wow the quality is what i remember most. The rice, sauces, an textures were balanced and robust. So damn good!  Parking was a bit of a hassle becasue it looks like they are replacing thr blacktop. They are closed to the central light rail stop though!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots. Flaming dragons (\"WE ARE FLAMING DRAGON!\") and baked lobster rolls are out of this world.  Melt in your mouth goodness. Fast service, warm interior, and never too packed either."}
{"text":"The only reason that I put \"A-OK\" is because of the parking.  There is LITERALLY only 2 spots.  One being handicap.  They DEFINITELY need more parking.  But the place is Great!  Food was Excellent.  Service was Wonderful,  Nice Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Don't understand why they arent always packed when we come in. Sushi is always so good, service is good too.   Happy hour is the bomb.com. Two people can feast for under $20. 2-6pm  Order the calamari. It is so good!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best sushi experience I have ever had. The restaurant itself is small but not cramped. Everything is very clean and the staff are all incredibly nice. We ordered a large hot sake to share, which was delightful and enough for two.  To eat we had their gyoza to start. They were cooked perfectly, with one edge being nice and crispy while the rest were steamed to perfection. The oil on them was noticeable but it was a clean enough oil that it didn't impede upon the flavor.  Then we shared their Tidus and Yuna Love Boat which was incredible. It had a dragon roll which was good, a spicy tuna roll, again very good. Both met the standard for those kinds of sushi rolls. Then there were I think four different types of nigiri, all of which were beyond amazing. The octopus nigiri was my personal favorite as I enjoy the texture. And lastly there were 6 types of sashimi, 3 slices of each. The slices were generous without being too much to eat. They each practically melted in my mouth, which tells me that the quality of their fish is higher than many other sushi restaurants.  They also have fresh wasabi, which makes the meal absolutely perfect.  We then enjoyed their green tea mochi for dessert.  Our server Jason was very nice and extremely attentive. Our waters were never empty for more than a minute since all of their staff took the initiative to fill waters regardless of whether or not they were our server.  We can't wait to come back for another date night, or to try their happy hour!"}
{"text":"I really loved this place and I will be coming back for sure. I wanted to just say that the service here is amazing! I wish I remembered our waitresses name because I want to shout her out! She was this really sweet, petite and super friendly miss. Everyone that works there is super nice and it's just great overall service."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good sushi place and per Siri it was on the list of choices. We don't live in Phoenix but do travel here often. My husband and I walked in, were seated quickly with a smile. Our server was Yan. I would highly recommend you asking for her. She was very pleasant and just attentive enough. Ken the manager came to greet us and was very polite. 5 plus stars! Thank you all for great sushi and a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for Japanese restaurants around the area because I'm pretty much addicted to Japanese food. I am SO glad that I found this little gem. I came in at around 4 in the afternoon and was greeted by the owners of the restaurant. They were very sweet and welcoming. The service was excellent.   Spicy salmon rolls are my go-to, and Yama's spicy salmon definitely did not disappoint. I had their seaweed salad as well and it was delicious - just the right amount of sweetness. In addition, I had their famous gyoza and I was quite pleased. It was not deep fried, and tasted very fresh. The decor of the restaurant was clean and classy, but not at all pretentious.   Last but not the least, it was very affordable! I came in during happy hour so it was really cheap, however the regular hour prices weren't bad AT ALL. I cannot wait to come back to try their other rolls and their ramen!"}
{"text":"This has honestly been the best experience ever. amazing service!!!!!! the food was phenomenal. MUST TRY GYOZA !! First time here and I am currently writing a review while eating because I must share to the world ! Love nat"}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh salmon. Tastes right. I don't trust most sushi places anymore, but I'm all about it here. I even like the ginger a lot more than usual. Friendly employees. Cool spot."}
{"text":"We tried this place for lunch today and will definitely go back. As a warning, parking is difficult here. Thankfully we were able to snag a spot close by as there are only few spots in front of this restaurant.  We started with the gyoza and the tempura yam rolls. Both were delicious! I had the teriyaki chicken bento box which was very good. The teriyaki sauce on the chicken had a bit of sweetness to it that I enjoyed. The salad was heavily dressed but flavorful. It also came with rice and 4 California rolls. At $9.00it was very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. We finished lunch with the tempura cheesecake which was super yummy.  The staff here was very friendly and the service was very efficient. She never let my drink go empty which was nice."}
{"text":"There's plenty to say about this wonderful place! Chef TONY is the best Sushi owner I have ever met. He is such a humble guy, and takes pride and dedication to his food and customers. I will always recommend this place! It's true, best GYOZA hands down! Tell Tony if it's your first time in!"}
{"text":"The first Friday menu alone is worth coming. All of the food was great, friendly staff, and great music. Parking is small but it's worth the hunt. Overall I would say it's a great experience and I will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"It was delicious, we particularly loved the spicy salmon role and the salmon nagiri. The wasabi also had a very good flavor. Fairly priced. Our new favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting to write a review for this place! We went here for my birthday back in September and it was great.  Overall i liked their nigiri the best. All the fish was very fresh and cut well. We had two rolls which tasted good but given the price they were on the small side and the rice was a bit dry. Their gyoza is excellent. Service was outstanding.  Parking is a challenge. They only have a couple spaces out front, we had to circle the block to find street parking. No big deal but kind of a hassle.   We will definitely be back for nigiri and apps."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 3 and 4 star.  We went on a Tuesday night and were quickly seated.  They were busy, and it took a while to get a drink order in.  We ordered waters and a sake bomber.  The menu had a $5 bottle of Sapporo Light and didn't note that larger bottles were available.  Halfway through drinking, we ordered a second $5 bottle of beer (because you receive a generous amount of sake).  Then I saw other tables with larger bottles of beer and asked our waitress how much those were.  I was told $6.  It would have been nice if the large bottles had been listed on the menu or if we had been informed when ordering a sake bomber that larger bottles were available instead of spending $10 for something that could have cost us $6.  I let the waitress know of my disappointment.  It took a while for the order of spicy garlic edamame to arrive, which was well seasoned but a little too oily. Then it took a lot longer for our food to arrive.  After 10 minutes, we pointed out to the waitress that we were missing one of the rolls and were told it was coming.  It finally got to us about 15-20 minutes after the rest of the rolls, and it was explained that it had been delivered to the wrong table.  During the meal, I had to keep stopping the staff to ask for water refills, even though I placed my empty glass at the side of the table.  I only got one refill the whole time (they kept saying someone else was taking care of it), and I left very thirsty.    My vegetable rolls were wonderful.  My partner got four rolls (cucumber, avocado, vegas, and I don't remember the fourth) and said they were good, especially the avocado.  There are no vegan soup options except the appetizer miso, but they offered to make a vegan ramen with veggies for me, and it was great!  The prices are reasonable and the food was good.  We'll be going back and hoping they'll work out some of the service issues the longer they're open."}
{"text":"Limited parking so best to uber. Happy hour  2-6pm.  If you get the 300ml bottle sake you also get free gyoza appetizer which they claim is the best gyoza in town. ( it is pretty darn good)   We got an assortment of nigiri and rolls, which did not disappoint. When we ordered the \"salmon roe\" nigiri, they accidentally brought us \"salmon roll.\" Honest mistake since they sound exactly the same. They apologized and made us the correct order and gave us the salmon roll for free! So cool !   Everyone who works here is very polite, pleasant and friendly. They are all very well versed with the food and drink selection.   Would recommend !"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful night at Yama. The sushi was the freshest I've ever tasted. Arizona sushi is always kind of questionable, and most places rely more on fancy rolls in order to dodge the question of how fresh the fish is. Here, they have great rolls also, but the quality of the nigiri is excellent.   I haven't had such delicious Tuna or Salmon since being in Japantown in LA. This is an outstanding little restaurant. There aren't many tables here -- the owner came over and was very friendly. I can see why they have great reviews on Yelp. Server Amy was always there when we needed her. Just a great experience.  The only mistake I made was in ordering some Sake that Amy recommended. It was delicious. But this tiny little bottle was very expensive. That's my fault--I should have asked before ordering. I just figured, \"How much can a little tiny bottle of sake be, anyway!\" Big mistake.   We'll definitely be back. We intend to be regulars. And we're in the \"mood for sushi\" regularly!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi joint in central Phoenix! Amazing gyoza and sashimi! Also must try the Magic Roll. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The rice is way over cooked it's mush ruins the sushi!  Very bad!  Other than that,very friendly."}
{"text":"I had the salmon lovers lunch special which is several pieces of salmon nigiri, and half a salmon roll. The salmon tasted fresh and delicious. It melted in my mouth. Sitting at the sushi bar, I noticed how friendly and efficient the chefs were. My iced tea was refilled without asking, and I even was offered some to go.  Other reviewers had stated that they liked the happy hour. However, after checking out that menu, it didn't seem like very much was offered, as least to my liking.  Overall, a good place for fresh and tasty sushi."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service and sushi was very good. Pretty chill spot, not too crowded and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I Wanted to check since it newly opened, so I brought my friend to treat him. I ordered a Gyudon for my friend and a Katsudon for myself. The waitress repeated the order but she was almost whispering and I was talking to my friend so I wasn't really paying that much attention. But apparently I should have. It takes 20 minutes to get food and she serves a Gyudon and a Donkotsu Ramen. Okay. I told her this wasn't my order and she brought it back to the kitchen, saying she will get me Katsudon. I didn't really think it would take 20 more minutes since they screwed up the order and if you rush it, it should NEVER takes 20 more minutes. You NEVER cooks the food like you JUST got the order from the customer. So I told my friend to start first but my meal is not getting served. ANOTHER 20 FREAKING minutes. She didn't check if my glass was empty or the food is okay for my friend.  Okay it's busy Thursday night at 7PM, let's give her a break. But seriously, the food. Really? First I am Asian. I'm not a big fan of CALIFORNIAN rolls, which most of snobby people would think as cool food, but I know what Japanese food should be like. But this Gyudon and Katsudon is never what I expected. The beef in the Gyudon, I don't even know what part of cow it is. They put too much ginger in the food and all you can taste is just ginger and the fat from the beef with salty sauce. The amount of the food isn't impressive either. Now the Katsudon, jesus Christ, who serves Katsudon in a flat plate? And what about the amount? The meat was thin only size of my palm. Mediocre taste and over-priced.  I don't necessarily wanna blame the waitress only on everything. But there are DEFINITELY not enough staff to cover the tables. I saw them running around and the other table getting served every 15 minutes. I don't know what the hell is going on, but they should really change the way they run A RESTAURANT. I assume the restaurant was busy not because the food was good but because it is on Groupon. And there were only 2 Asians out of at least 50 customers. And you know what that means."}
{"text":"Yum! The best days to go are on fish delivery days...then the tuna nigiri is terrific. They have traditional japanese offerings and so if you are missing Tokyo cuisine this is the place to go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tonight only - we have been here 4 times - tonight it has taken forever to get our sushi. Our fellow diners have finished their meals and we are still waiting on four sushi rolls.  Management is very apologetic, but doesn't excuse we have waited an hour for four sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I ordered from grubhub and was rather disappointed. The Bundaberg branded ginger beer arrived as some other brand and the sushi simply tasted fishy and not fresh. The rice was tired and old. I've had sushi all over the world and for a '4+' yelp rating this doesn't even come close to what I expected."}
{"text":"Really good sushi! My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday and happened to go during happy hour. The rolls are at really good prices and taste fresh. The atmosphere is inviting as well. Recommended to try!"}
{"text":"After living down the street from Yama for about 6 months, my fiancé and I finally decided to try it one night a couple of weeks ago, and I am glad we finally did! (We aren't sushi people, so that was our hesitation.)   We got there around 7:30/8p on a Saturday night, and the restaurant was very crowded, but our waitress was still attentive and extremely friendly. She didn't seem at all stressed by the number of tables she had to serve, which I thought was nice. It did take a while to get our drinks and our food once we had ordered, and I think this was maybe because the bar and kitchen areas aren't that big, but I don't know for sure.  To start, we ordered sake mules, which we thought was a fun concept and is something we have never seen before. They were pretty good - my fiancé enjoyed his a lot even though I didn't as much, but I also don't really like mules so I'm not a good judge :) we then ordered the Sweet Spicy Crispy Calamari, and it was delicious! We order calamari just about everywhere, and had never had it in a sauce quite like this - I loved it!   For dinner we split a roll that was on special, which I believe was called the King Scorpion Roll. Like I mentioned, we really aren't sushi people, but this was a cooked roll so we decided to give it a try. It ended up being really good! We also split the Teriyaki Chicken dinner plate, and that was amazing! I would definitely go back and have some of that.   I did think this restaurant was a bit expensive, but considering what we got it really wasn't bad. I'd definitely come back and have since recommended it to friends who are into sushi! :)"}
{"text":"Went here on a wim, saw the yelp reviews and couldn't resist. After a day of walking around at the Farmers Market we worked up an appetite. Saw that it was only 6 mins away. The only negative thing I could say about this place is lack of parking. But you can park on a side street or look for the two labeled parking spots. We were greeted and sat immediately. Our server was very sweet and attentive. We got our food within ten minutes of ordering. I got a chicken teriyaki bento and my wife got tako yaki and a tuna roll. The bento was stuffed with goodness. Teriyaki chicken on top of cabbage, white rice, a salad with ginger dressing, and I subbed a spicy crab roll instead of the California. I normally don't eat a lot but I ate the whole thing. Needless to say I may have found my new favorite sushi spot. It's small but that atmosphere is perfect. The food is great and the staff are amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a nice atmosphere all around. The Alaskan and Godzilla rolls were delicious. I will definitely be back. And try the Tempura cheesecake for dessert. It was lit fam."}
{"text":"Great food! The ramen and the sushi were amazing as was the gyoza.  Nikki, our server was great! She really knew the menu and the drink selection and helped a lot. Will eat there again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today for the first time! Would definitely go back. The magic roll and poke bowl were delicious!"}
{"text":"I will definitely be going back!! The sushi was delicious and the customer service was excellent! The owner of this restaurant was very attentive with every customer and really made it an even better experience. Our waitress was the sweetest she really took the time to answer any question we had and was very polite. And did I mention the food was amazing?? Lol it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great sushi that just opened by our house! We came in and the owner greeted us and made our time here feel welcomed. They had us try two things off the menu we did not order which was absolutely amazing. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"GREAT LOCATION JUST SOUTH OF CAMELBACK ON CENTRAL!!  Happy hour specials are a steal of a deal!! We order pretty much the house and all was good!!!  MISO was excellent and for $1 ... wow!!   Overall we will be back and recommend this place to everyone.... must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for a birthday dinner! We kinda went all out, so we got to sample a little of everything! Drinks - sake & sake sangria, both highly recommended! We started with the gyoza (perfection) and spicy edamame. For our main dishes, we got a mix of sushi - pink lady roll, ninja roll, spicy tuna (all yummy)- a bowl of ramen (with spam!!!), and the \"April Special\" Honey Sesame Chicken (the most perfect batter ever!). We finished the evening with a dessert feast of fried cheesecake, mochi, macha ice cream, and hot lava cake. Everything was delightful! The staff was so friendly & helpful & Chef Tony even came out to check on us and wish me a happy birthday! Thanks Yama, for an awesome night!"}
{"text":"First time at Yama Sushi house and the hospitality was amazing. Our server Hung had a great sense of humor and was on top of his work.  The Food was awesome and it came out in a timely manner. I will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Great Japanese spot right on Central! We had the katsu chicken - delicious and lightly breaded. Tonkotsu ramen, very good. Gyoza, some of the best around. Great happy hour pricing too!"}
{"text":"Service was faster than my 40-time in high school. Parking was eh but the deals on the Happy Hour menu were well worth it."}
{"text":"First visit was amazing. Greeted by the owner and workers as soon as I was inside.   I had one shrimp tempura roll, philly roll and a spicy crab roll, all which were fresh and very well put together.  Will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"Was our first time at this sushi restaurant, it was unbelievable - the quality was great and fresh and very worth the price.  Rachel is an unbelievable waitress and we will definitely be back to this establishment. Loved the sunshine roll"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff greeting from the beginning. Never had really had much sake before and the server was very knowledgeable and explained the different types.  Sushi was awesome, spicy tuna roll was mostly tuna with just enough rice. The nigiri was made properly with just a touch of washabi under between the fish and rice. All delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this is my favorite place but it has some decent sushi. I was expecting it to hit my spot and it didn't. Maybe it's because I ordered off of the happy hour menu. Maybe the rolls in the menu are a lot better. We started off with the sea weed salad and that was really good. We then Ordered the spicy crab and  I think Godzilla roll. The fried part on the Godzilla roll was the only thing I tasted. The spicy crab was ok. I also ordered the Ramen which was pretty good. We also had sake bombs to go with our meal and you can't go wrong with them. I love them. The outside patio here is pretty nice. The weather was perfect so it made it enjoyable. I'll be back to try something else off the actual or if anyone has any recommendations I'd love to hear about it."}
{"text":"Yama is amazing from the service, and most importantly to the food! Their happy hour deals are amazing and this cute place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great service and a fairly large menu. The food was good, but seemed a bit overpriced for the quality. A lot of the specialty rolls seem to rely too heavily on mayonnaise, which distracts from the other flavors."}
{"text":"This place is simply THE BEST SUSHI - TRUE AUTHENTIC AND FRESH SUSHI  in Phoenix!  They are local and on top of pleasing their customers!  They have been in business for one year and celebrated their annual anniversary the day of our visit. They were generous with all of their customers and had a complimentary mimosa for the occasion!    We tried almost like everything!  The best thing and a must try on the menu was the yellow tail belly carpaccio --- we had 3 of these!  Other popular rolls for us were the spider rolls, rainbow  roll, tuna lovers roll, striped bass, and the pink roll (literally is pink soy paper)!   I could go on and on because we loved this place so much we kept ordering!!!  They even cater to your wants and desires, such as change the sea weed to soy paper, add jalapeños or light on the rice!  Nothing was a problem to make the experience right!  This is our sushi go to from now on and the only place I'm recommending is this place!  If you haven't gone, go!  If it's a drive for you, it's worth it!  Parking isn't an issue and I'm serious, I stand by this review, no disappointments here!    Cheers Chef Tony!  What a success!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a good review because I don't want this place to blow up and make it difficult to get a table lol but it's very good sushi. Extremely attentive and kind servers. Even the manager made it out to the table to ensure our food was perfect. Absolutely will be going back."}
{"text":"The most Japanese cuisine! More than just Sashimi and Sushi! Everyday Happy Hour! Love the fact that they are in our neighborhood and is non corporate. Love supporting the small business owners!"}
{"text":"The food was great - I love hamachi and it was fresh and perfect. The rolls were unique and really tasty - the lobster roll amazing. The proprietor and staff were incredibly welcoming and warm. Just a great place. I asked whether they had coffee at the end of the meal (most sushi places don't but I thought I would ask). They apologized for not having coffee and minutes later, showed up with a take out coffee for me that they went next door and bought. We love yama!"}
{"text":"Hands-down best sushi I've ever had in my life! The pink lady roll in the baked lobster roll were out of this world :-) I highly recommend this restaurant to all sushi lovers! Oh and the green tea was amazing :-) can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Yama for date night. Let me start of by saying the service was impeccable.  Our server was attentive, not over the top and as soon as a plate was finished he was right there to clear it so the table would get cluttered. We had sushi rolls, some from happy hour menu which had a great selection and great prices, pork ramen, sake bombs and I really enjoyed my cocktail, the Hiro sake mule. Yum! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"After attending a Japanese cultural Festival we were in the mood for some authentic sushi. Thank you yelled for suggesting Yama Sushi House. I had the chicken teriyaki bento box my daughter had the Scorpion roll and the other one had a Dragon Roll that was all phenomenal"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot!   Check this place out now! They have amazing sushi and great customer service.  I have been to Yama twice now and had great experiences both times. The first time I went there for my birthday with a large group. The reservation process was easy and everyone in the group enjoyed the food. The manager was super friendly and helped make my birthday memorable with on the house sake. The customer service here is some of the best I've ever seen--and it doesn't hurt that the food is delicious!  The second time I went to Yama, I got a to go order which was quickly prepared and tasty! The food at Yama is very reasonably priced too--especially considering how good it is.   Also, there is a great boba place next door called My Tea, which I love! So stop by Yama and fill up on yummy sushi and then head over for some tea!"}
{"text":"Fantastic new sushi joint! Appetizers were delicious and sushi was light, fresh and beautiful! We had the spicy edamame, potstickers, house salads, Magic roll, and Phoenix roll and all were perfect! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour as others had suggested. We feasted. Everything we got was beyond delicious. Make sure you get the seaweed salad, it's a must!"}
{"text":"Let me start that I am a native Californian and can attest that some of the best sushi and sashimi we have eaten are at restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area.  We have been in the Phoenix, AZ area for 18 months and have been trying out different places.  Until today, we have not found any sushi restaurant that compares to the SF Bay Area.  We found this place by using Yelp and decided to try it out because of the good ratings the restaurant received.  My wife and I were totally happy with the quality of the fish.  The fish was fresh and tasty.  My only critique would be that the sushi portions were on the small side.  Given the small portions, I would say the prices are slightly too high.  But we will be back.  Most of the tables are for parties of two with a couple for a party of four.  More than four, they will be to do some rearranging."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service! It's a super cute little place that just opened. If you're looking for a sushi place to go tonight in downtown Phoenix, this is a great choice!   *HINT: Go during First Friday, they have good prices!"}
{"text":"An amazing but unfortunate experience. Let me explain.  My sis and I drove by this place the day before. We had a sushi craving. I looked on Yelp and saw this place and their great ratings so decided on this spot for lunch.  We arrive and are seated immediately. We place our orders. Luckily, everything we ordered was cold. All of a sudden, the power goes out for a few blocks. Patrons who ordered cooked foods had to leave. We ordered all raw fish so there was no issue. I felt so bad for the owner. He said food not eaten in 30 minutes will just go to waste. So he started to give us a free for all on food. We had some huge chunks of salmon. There were a few fish belly bites tossed in the mix. There was so much given I forgot if I actually received what I ordered.  When it came time to pay the owner said that his registers wouldn't work. We luckily had cash and we were treated so nicely and were provided generous portions that we paid what we thought was the bill. Others got to walk out without paying. A few who walked in after the power went out were turned away. The owner despite not being in the best business situation made the most of it. We lucked out with a few extra bites (by the way, everything was delicious).  The good karma will certainly go back to you, good sir."}
{"text":"Checked out Yama sushi for happy hour last week. I must say I was pretty impressed with their California roll. It was packed with crab salad and it was rolled very nicely. However, my favorite thing here was their gyoza. Normally I don't expect very quality gyoza from sushi places since that is not something they are supposed to specialize in but this gyoza was amazing! They have pretty good prices for happy hour. The only think that I would recommend staying away from is the appetizer which I believe is called tokoyaki. This was one of the weirdest things I've tried. I'm sure some people like it but I thought the texture was just super off putting. Nonetheless, this place has a great location right in central Phoenix and they have an outdoor patio. Great spot for happy hour"}
{"text":"Quite fresh sushi; was here for  happy hour - happy surprise. We didn't really try any of the rolls except for the the hot night roll which despite being fresh lacked that kick and flavor I expected out of a name like that ! Really good service. They got one of our rolls wrong and gave us the correct one right away. The  veggie tempura is also recommended !"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and service!!! Been here twice so far and loved both visits! They were very accommodating as I had my 9 month old with me and we didn't wait very long at all on a Saturday night even though they were very busy. Every piece of sushi we ate was perfect! Also, the squid salad is a great appetizer along side a seaweed salad. Love love love this place!  The prices aren't too bad either for sushi. The first time we went we ordered 8 rolls 3 appetizers and a sake bomb and our total was $120. The rolls are above average size and the service was fast both times. I would definitely come back again and again to Yama!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I highly recommend checking it out. The sushi is fantastic, they have a great happy hour, and the service is very attentive. The dining area is small, but very comfortable. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Jason took great care of us. Andrew rocks as well! Thank you Jason for 5 star service and thank you, Andrew for telling us about Yama Sushi House ! Definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"Awesome spot- went there pretty buzzing last minute before they closed and they hooked it up. 5 star service despite them closing and us obnoxiously barging in 15 before closing. Sushi was fire... so good... hit the spot- I'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is a cute little hole in the wall type of sushi joint but the decor is very modern and hipsterish.  My husband and I dined here on a Wednesday and we thought it was good but still needed some small tweaks to make it great.  Here are a couple of pros and cons:  Pros: -food was served quickly -presentation of food was done well  -flavors were great -very nice staff and very accommodating and polite -convenient location with parking -very clean and well decorated  Cons: -ramen noodles seemed to be from a package and reheated (not fresh) -pork in ramen was way overcooked -asked for shichimi soup spice and got sriracha the first time around...? -service was haphazard and awkward (possibly their first server job?) -server did not get us drink refills and didn't even suggest it until the end of our meal (our glasses sat empty for almost the full hour we were there) -SO LOUD!  the acoustics in this place made it nearly impossible to have a normal volume conversation or be able to hear my husband across the table even though it was not full (definitely recommend getting some sound muffling foam or something for the ceiling so the noise level stays low)  All-in-all the food was good, place was clean, staff were very nice, but the quality of the food/service, as well as the ear-piercing need some polishing.  I hope to try this place again in a bit to see how they progress."}
{"text":"This small Japanese restaurant is pretty delicious. The fish is pretty fresh and succulent. I had an ice cold Sapporo which never disappoints as soon as I arrived. For an appetizer I ordered a yellow tail Kama which was seared and marinated with a ponzu sauce. I had a soft crab roll that made me want more. I then worked my way to my wife's plate and stole a few pieces of an unknown roll which was also succulent may I add. I enjoyed all my rolls and Sushi. Parking can be a bit of a hassle, I suggest you drop off your party directly at the front, then work your way south on Central and park at the next shopping center."}
{"text":"Finally a central phoenix restaurant where the servers are friendly and the food is great. Get the Gyoza - it is awesome."}
{"text":"The best sushi in CenPho and really nice service.  My friend and I ate so much, but everything was good.  The atmosphere is a little generic, but the prices are right on.  $12 for 4 big pieces of blue fin tuna sashimi.  $9 for 2 giant Ama Ebi prawns.  Please support this place so it makes it."}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to sushi. I decided to try Yama for lunch. Tony, the owner was so excited to serve me and my friends. He made sure we were satisfied, he made recommendations. I ordered a vegas roll, sashimi salmon, gyoza----500000000 stars! It was cheap and delicious. Will be coming here on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience today for lunch. Quick service & our server was attentive and kind. The food was very good & plenty of parking at that time. Clean establishment & prices seem to be in line with other sushi restaurants around."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi and decently priced!  Truly the best part is Rott n' Grapes next door will call in an order for delivery for you. A friend of mine were enjoying some wine and ordered a sushi boat. Shortly after, it sailed on in front of us and added the perfect sushi accompaniment to our wine! I also feel the boat was a killer deal. Tons of food, probably enough for more than 2 people, but we finished it ourselves  :O  Will definitely be \"back\"! :)"}
{"text":"How awesome is Chef Tony!  We where driving around looking for something to eat and he was so kind to feed us!!!  Amazing food! Pls come see him in his new endeavor!"}
{"text":"Great service and sushi is yummy. We got the chirashi bowl, lychee sake sweet and delicious be careful as it tastes sweet can easily drink a whole bottle without realizing it and the lollipop sushi great presentation"}
{"text":"I used to have this place deliver food to my work via grubhub. I always enjoyed the Las Vegas roll and the Golden Avocado. I shared with coworkers and they were in awe of how crispy, fresh and delicious the food was.   However, I have had some less than satisfying food experiences during my lunches with Yama's food. The yakisoba was a bit bland and just tasted a tiny bit like Chinese 5-Spice. It was my first time trying yakisoba. I was having my \"cheat day\" (but it is always cheat day when I am ordering Yama) but I was excited to go to town on that yakisoba! I expected it to have a better flavor sauce, or something.   The other thing I was less than happy with was the takoyaki. It was something new I wanted to try. I love squid and from what I had seen online, takoyaki looked awesome. I wasn't prepared for the gooey texture when it arrived, and I couldn't stomach it. That being said, I decided that since takoyaki is a \"favorite\" or frequently ordered menu item according to grubhub, I figured I would let it slide. It is probably a very authentic dish that just wasn't on my palate's radar.   Anyway, I decided that the Golden Avocados and the LV roll are my #1 favorites from Yama, but the baked lobster roll is also great. Wash it down with a Bundaberg ginger beer!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.  The Magic Roll was delicious.  The service was prompt and courteous.  The food was quick, especially considering I was a walk-in/take out order.    Unfortunately nothing is perfect, but the worst thing I could find on my first visit was the parking.  It really sucks.  Though that won't stop me, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  Happy hour appears to run through 6 PM, even on a Sunday.  Ordered (3) rolls for just myself.  Would have been plenty for two peeps.  Service was ok - a few hiccups.  Went back for drinks on a separate occasion.  These guys add sales tax on top of the listed alcohol price.  Legal?  Not sure."}
{"text":"Food and service was good. Nice location for central PHOENIX."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! The sushi to the ramen was fantastic. Tony was the one that took care of me. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and actually recommended me the ramen. Was not disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Yama Sushi House is not only some of the best Japanese food/sushi in Phoenix but it's also one of the best run restaurants in town. I went here to celebrate my brothers birthday with family and after being seated when receiving the drinks we ordered a waitress accidentally split beer on my brother. However horrible that sounds it was an accident that was not looked over by the staff/management as they took amazing care of us for the rest of the night by: replacing my brothers shirt with a new clean dry one, a free appetizer and more. What started out as a not so great birthday dinner ended as one of the best costumer service examples we're ever witnessed. My family and I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the unassuming look of this place fool you - it has hands down the best sushi I've tasted in the valley. Service is phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!  We recently just moved to the downtown Phoenix area, and there is lots of restaurants to choose from.  I was scrolling through Yelp and came across this new sushi restaurant! Since we moved we haven't found our new sushi spot in this part of town, but we did now!  Currently, I'm pregnant so going out to eat is not fun or enjoyable, so I decided to place an order for take-out for my boyfriend to pick up on his way home. The food was amazing!!  It was ready in about 15 minutes which is awesome and super convenient!  I got the shrimp tempura roll and it was amazing! We also ordered the sashimi combo and spicy yellowtail roll, and my boyfriend loved them!  The sashimi pieces were big and thick compared to other places in town and very fresh!  The presentation was beautiful, even in take-out. They gave us plenty of soy sauce, wasabi, and lots of ginger! Which I love because I can eat the pickled ginger just like that, so I was pleased to see we got plenty!  Pricing was great and comparable to others sushi spots, but the customer service and food was top notch! So well worth coming here over other sushi bars.  My boyfriend even asked me if I have been there before because the owners were asking about my pregnancy and to bring the baby in when she is born! Which is great to make customers feel more comfortable rather than a quick transaction!   The lunch specials look AH-mazingggg and priced well, so I cannot wait to have my baby and make this my regular spot!  We are avid sushi goers, on average we would go about three times a week before getting pregnant! So I can't wait to come into the restaurants and check out the ambiance and environment!   Very pleased with my experience with their take-out!  We woke up this morning still talking about how delicious the sushi is!  So happy I found my new spot!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time at this place. Sushi at the Happy Hour is anything but Happy!  If like want imitation crab and cucumber in every roll you will love this place.  The shrimp tempura roll had more Crab crap than shrimp.  Never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Loved our visit at Yama Sushi! I was surprised to come in an empty restaurant on a Sunday afternoon but our waiter was very friendly, atmosphere inviting and the sushi was delicious! We ordered edamame, shrimp tempura roll, magic roll, spider roll and two sake sangrias. The sangrias were a little too syrupy for me but strong. The rolls were very tasty and enjoyed every bite. I probably wouldn't order the spider roll again because for $12, they only gave us a few pieces. I deduct one star because for the price, the portion size is on the smaller side. Usually, we order two rolls that is sufficient to fill me and my husband up at other Japanese restaurants. However, we had to order three rolls to fill us up.   Our order came to a little over $50. I will definitely be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday around noon. The sushi and tempura were great. And best of all our waitress was accommodating. Went to My Tea after for some boba, compliments the sushi nice :) Would come again"}
{"text":"Great new Place to the uptown area. The food is amazing and the owner/employees are welcoming and hospitable. If you enjoy sushi this is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"The sushi was excellent. Our favorites were the spicy girl and the yellowtail scallion.   We also tried the magic roll which was very good and the flaming dragon which was also good but I would order it without the eel next time. Also the garlic edamame was wonderful.  Pictures from left to right: magic roll, spicy girl, yellowtail scallion, flaming dragon"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after reading all the positive reviews. Was thoroughly disappointed. I'm a ramen fan so I ordered the Tonkotsu pork ramen and what arrived was a strange broth that tasted like miso soup and was topped with Spam. I thought they mixed up my order, but was told no that was the correct pork ramen soup. I was clearly not enjoying the dish so the waitress very kindly offered to replace the soup with a sushi roll of my choice. I decided to try the Phoenix roll. It seemed decent enough until I bit into something that tasted so rancid I had to spit it out.  Now, my husband ordered a different sushi roll and it was OK. Nothing to write home about, though. So over all we were not fans of Yama."}
{"text":"I took my dad on a belated Father's Day lunch at Yama, and it was great! The restaurant is clean and chic. Yan, our server, was super friendly and attentive.   We tried the Lollipop specialty roll, which was tuna, salmon, yellowfish, and imitation crab in a roll form, and instead of rice and seaweed, the outer wrap is thinly sliced cucumber. It is skewered on the side with a cute toothpick to give the 'lollipop' look. The 5 pieces of the roll were bathed in a light soy sauce-based sauce. Very refreshing dish to have on a hot summer day. I highly recommend getting this roll!  Then we ordered the sashimi party platter, which is a June special. It was a large platter of fresh, beautifully presented salmon, yellow tail, red clam, white and red tuna. Very filling and price was very reasonable.   We also ordered unagi sashimi. It was delicious as well.  Other have commented on the lack of parking in front of the restaurant. This is true, but you can parallel park on Pierson, which is the small street just north of that strip mall.   This place is very deserving of 5 stars, and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place. Everything we had was great! Had the baked lobster roll, it was delish. We went for happy hour and the California rolls were a bit small but pretty tasty. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We just happened on this place. Excellent sushi and rolls!  A must if you're on Central. Staff are really attentive and the Sushi Chef is great. Thank you for a fabulous lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing quality of sushi! My boyfriend and I went here tonight and got a few rolls. We got the Las Vegas, Shrimp tempura, Dragon, Baked lobster, and Phoenix roll. They were delicious! The baked lobster is expensive, but SO worth it! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a good sushi bar. Nice happy hour. Gyoza was yummy too. Salmon sushi was probably one of the best I've had. Super fast service. Friendly as well! Limited parking in front  like 1 spot! Found parking on street though. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful food, awesome atmosphere! I can truly say I did not like sushi until I came to Yama sushi house. My now wife has always been a big fan and convinced me to come, I was shocked with how delicious the Las Vegas roll is. Deep fried and drowning in delicious flavors!   I highly suggest Yama Sushi House. Really nice, friendly service and a quiet atmosphere. Happy hour is 100% worth it and the time I go the most. Cheaper sushi and drinks, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE OMG. New favorite spot. It is delicious and QUALITY. You can really tell they care about the food their customers receive. I can't wait to come back! Thankyou for a great meal!"}
{"text":"For a brand new restaurant, the owner sure doesn't treat customers like he wants them to return. Beware of the shady practices here! The first time we ate here, we used a \"$25 Worth of Food for Two or More\" Groupon. Although the total was less than $25, they said tax wasn't included and we had to pay for that separately. That was strange because I've used dozens of Groupons and **never** needed to pay for tax. Okay, fine. But it gets worse.  The 3rd visit, my boyfriend used a Groupon (the same one). At the end of the meal, they explained that it only covered sushi, so the chicken dish wasn't included. Obviously this was confusing since the Groupon said \"$25 Worth of FOOD for Two or More.\" We asked if they could make an exception because the title was misleading and the manager came over to say that no, they wouldn't because in the fine print (the very last sentence) said it was only for sushi. What he *could* do, was let us order another sushi roll. (Um, duh. We were under the $25 amount). He did make sure to mention that since we didn't tell the server beforehand that we had a Groupon, he didn't even have to let us use it at this point. What?? So, we asked for the last roll to-go. He explained that we couldn't do this because he wants guests to enjoy the experience in the restaurant, not take food with. Ridiculous! We did sit down, we did experience the restaurant, and now we wanted the last roll to-go. Ugh.   Any reasonable owner would have made an exception since the Groupon title was confusing, but instead, his unreasonable and unsympathetic attitude has made us swear off this place for good.   (By the way, that terrible-tasting teriyaki chicken definitely cost less than the sushi roll, so it would have been in the restaurant's best interest in terms of profit/cost to allow that anyway.)"}
{"text":"The cuts of fish given were very small and a poor part of the fish. Most of the cuts were close to the tail; which made them chewy and not soft. The ahi tuna was pink, (frozen?) if fresh it would be a dark red. They also did not cut the fish correctly, again making the fish more chewy than melt in your mouth. It was as if the place is low on cash, buying poor cuts of fish, and hired someone who is not a trained sushi chef. Not recommended if you expect to eat good fish."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Great ambiance, great food. The staff is extremely friendly & they are constantly checking to make sure you are satisfied. Location is awesome too. I'll definitely be back. Enjoyed the lollipop roll, fish was very fresh."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner!!!  Waitress and owner was very doting. Sister is gluten free (allergy) and they went out of the way to make sure that all was good. 100% on customer service.   Definitely come again!"}
{"text":"BEST sushi spot in town! Their gyoza is homemade and their sushi is fresh and delicious! I love how it's not packed with rice like most places are. The quality is 5/5 and the staff is so friendly! I love the owners Tony and Ken and Amy is an amazing server! Everyone was so attentive and made us feel welcomed! Must give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Love their ramen!  I've had it delivered via Door Dash on multiple occasions, and it is delicious every time!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, wonderful service, great atmosphere, and reasonable prices -- what more could you ask for? We had the tuna poke and Hamachi Kama as appetizers, both were absolutely phenomenal. I was especially impressed by the Hamachi, so fatty and perfectly grilled. We also had salmon rolls and their \"black and white\" roll. All the fish was very fresh and the portions were incredibly generous. Way more salmon than rice in the salmon rolls, A+. Our server was also super attentive and very helpful and nice. Our water was never empty! Highly recommend this place, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place.   The bento box lunches are a great deal and they do an awesome job on the basics. Their specialyt rolls are also very good.  Recently I messed up on a to go order and they totally fixed the order, though it was my fault. They did not charge for the fix, though I said it was my fault. It is just how they operate."}
{"text":"A little overpriced for what you get, and the fish isn't noticeably fresher. I'd go back because they're one of the few sushi places in the area that make baked rolls. Service is good too."}
{"text":"5 stars on all aspects!! Great selection of cold Saki;  Tofu was on point; the Golden Avacado is a must (); the Godzilla roll offered an exquisite balance between flavor and temperature and the Boston roll had fantastic flavor combination.  Highly recommended - we will be back!! Parking is limited."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Second time around MUCH BETTER. Found a parking space, yay!! This place is so nice, modern yet comfortable. Little things like up lighting under the bar along with hooks to hang your purse, clean bathrooms, and the food was REALLY GOOD! We ordered the spicy salmon, Vegas and shrimp tempura rolls and they were all very good!  Not overly sized but appropriate. Our waitress was Iris and she was lovely. Very cheerful and attentive. Wonderful visit. :)"}
{"text":"Great new sushi place in Central Phoenix. My son and I tried just about everything on the menu and it was all wonderful. The catapillar, magic and flaming dragon rolls got the best ratings."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time recommended by a friend. New restaurant and great atmosphere. We ordered the magic roll, fried avocado (appetizer), tonkatsu ramen, udon, and Alaska roll.  Fried avocado was really good, never had it anywhere else - it came with tuna I think. The magic roll is my favorite, it was wrapped with soy paper and had two different sauces on it. The salmon on top of the Alaska roll, was a thick cut salmon and not like other sushi places will give you a small piece! Yummy! All in all, everything we ordered was delicious! And service was great, the waitress kept refilling our waters. The owner even stopped by our table to make sure everything was good! Definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I lived in Southern California before moving to Phoenix, so my sushi standards are pretty high. That being said, this place delivered! I went in for a to go order and it was ready within 15 minutes of my call. I ordered the Phoenix Roll, which was delicious and reasonably priced for good sushi. I also loved the spicy garlic edamame. Definitely spicy, but really yummy. The only thing I didn't love was my shrimp tempura roll. It could have used more eel sauce or spicy mayo. But, other than that, I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The BEST Sushi in Central Phoenix. Great staff and friendly vibe. Not to mention good prices! We are here often!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good quality but low key sushi place since moving to Phoenix back in April and I am happy to say that we found just that at Yama. We really enjoyed the fried tofu appetizer and all of the rolls that we ordered. Waiter was very nice and attentive. This will definitely be our go to sushi haunt for a casual meal!"}
{"text":"I look on Yelp for a good spot for a   sushi & bar. I tried different ones in the area around Central & Camelback. I came here because they had really good reviews on Yelp. And all I can say is they are on point! Love the location and great sushi. Prices were good 2-6 Mon-Sat. I will for sure be coming back a lot. Tony the head chef was hella cool! This will be my  spot :)"}
{"text":"Lots of good yelp reviews but really it was mediocre to bad.  My negihama roll was poorly made and fishy.  The tonkatsu ramen was bland and noodle mushy.  The hamach Kama was pretty good.  Too bad really nice place and our server was fine.  The parking is crazy tight.  Just go to hana or cherry blossom, the food is much better there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi house in Phoenix  Many reasons   The food is fresh The people are friendly  The ambiance is quaint   Perfect I love it"}
{"text":"The sushi is good and the service is excellent. They have a great happy hour too. We have been here for both happy hour and eaten off the menu as well and left satisfied every time. See you soon Yama!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.. top notch sushi.. sushi taste is fresh and filling..  dragon roll is as good as it looks.. their eel is very fresh! I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been twice now n although haven't tried everythg, what I have had was very good n the service/friendliness of the staff bumps them to ***** .. The sushi has all been good n fresh, bento boxes are perfect for lunch, the gyoza's are actually really tasty n the calamari was tender n flavorful. I def will be back n support this small kick back spot over smthg like Stingray or RA .. Plus they have Lagunitas IPA on tap!"}
{"text":"I must admit this must be one of the best sushi places I have visited in the US. The service, the food, the atmosphere, everything is TOP! I had the Lollipop which was amazing, never seen this on a menu before. Also the Phoenix roll was heavenly, my last roll was a spicy salmon roll to keep my feet on the floor :) We had a bottle of Sake suggested by the manager and it was very smooth. He let us know that this Sake was offered in only few restaurants as it was a new Import, but I forgot the same oops!. I have bookmarked this place certainly coming back"}
{"text":"Popped by during happy hour today for an early dinner. I ordered the Hot Night Roll, the yellowtail carpaccio, agedashi tofu, and some miso soup. I finished everything but the last few spoonfuls of soup.   Overall, this is a good place. It's not super high end sushi, but it's good, happy hour makes things super reasonably priced, and the service is really friendly and attentive. The hot night roll is a california roll, which some eel sauce and spicy tuna on top. The hot-sweet combo was perfect and the roll was the perfect size. The yellowtail carpaccio was also good, though I would have wanted to taste the ponzo sauce more. The jalapeno slice on the fish was one of those weird instances where you get a smoking hot pepper; this isn't something to be helped though. The agedashi tofu, wasn't really traditional. It didn't come with bonito flakes and I wanted more sauce. But! I left nothing on the plate, so it was still damn tasty.   I'd go again. Especially for lunch since it's close to work. The have some poke bowls that sound yummy. And they have some non-sushi items or even less traditional sushi items (like chicken teriyaki rolls) for those of you that aren't feeling the raw fish. You should try it!"}
{"text":"We waited for over half a hour to get a second order. We were doubled charge for almost everything on the ticket. It took us what seemed like forever to get the ticket fixed. The food was average at best."}
{"text":"Environment here is good - small but very modern.  The service is great as well. The sushi here was really good and I really liked the avocado appetizer that they had. It was really yummy. There isn't much parking in the front but street parking can be found easily."}
{"text":"Yoooo this is the freshest Salmon Nigiri EVER. Happy Hour rules! I love coming here when I'm in town. The service is definitely improving from when they first opened as well. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"We came for happy hour and we're blown away. The food was so amazing and our waitress just awesome. We had such a good experience. Everything was perfect... food, service and price!!!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food and attentive, friendly service. One of our new favorite spots for sushi in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Everything we had was awesome! Hot Night Roll and the Spicy Salmon roll were definitely the highlight.  Also don't sleep on the Gyoza, definitely in the top ten!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Tasty dishes and friendly staff. Seriously yummy. We found a real gem in this place!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Employees were so attentive and came by the perfect amount. Food was delicious, fresh and came out quick! My fiancé and I really enjoyed our dinner and the atmosphere. This was a great find and look forward to many more date there."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Since my favorite sushi place shut down I've been having trouble finding the right place. And I think I've found it! Highly recommend Yama Sushi House! Very clean and the staff is extremely friendly. Cute place!"}
{"text":"We are new to town and we're looking for a go to sushi place. We tried the standard sushi rolls and were pleased.  We tried a couple of the specialty rolls. All I can say is wow.  They were delicious.  Excellent presentation as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Food was amazing! Definitely will be back and am so happy to have a great sushi place in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday, and it was a dreadful experience. We orders a saki after being told it wasn't too sweet: of course it was so sweet that we couldn't finish it. Additionally, the fish was I'll prepared and poorly cut so despite it being of decent quality the consistency made a bad experience. The worst part however was the OLD sushi rice. Rice is very important to all sushi, but especially nigiri. The texture was tough and it was served cold. Most likely it was old, which is why I'm giving it such a bad rating. I would have given 1 if not for the decent selection and quality of fish (before cuts were prepared). I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in with my friends last night before a movie. We ordered drinks and some food. We got all the food before we got any of our drinks and we had to ask for water about 30 min into our dinner.  The waitress wasn't attentive at all she barely came by and never asked how the food was. When we didn't leave her a good tip because she sucked she threw a fit and cussed as she walked away. That was completely unprofessional and although the food was good enough we won't be returning. One of my friends used to work there and she recommended this place for its fast and pleasant service but we didn't experience that."}
{"text":"This is such a great place. I usually get the Bento Box...yummy Everything is so fresh, beer ice COLD servers are so friendly.  My go to place for great food and service."}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD. Loved this place all around: the environment, the food, the price! I recommend the honey chicken and the katsudon! Great little place in one of the best food areas of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the unagi bowl (bed of rice, thin slices of avocado, delicious eel with sauce and a small seaweed salad on the side) and it was amazing. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It is in a perfect location on central and is brand new. I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi. The owners, waitresses, chefs, etc. are all very friendly and the food is phenomenal. We got four different sushi rolls and an appetizer and a couple of drinks and the prices were very reasonable. There was not a bad thing here. The inside looks beautiful and all of the rolls looked great as well! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in AZ! Hands down the best service, best food, best drinks and best prices.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Their salmon is always so fresh and please try the sake sangria- insanely delicious! Thank you Yama sushi for being the BOMB!"}
{"text":"For the ambience, decor, and service I would rate this place 4.0 stars. Unfortunately, it is the food that is quite lacking. The sushi and food I would say is average. I've had fresher fish on sushi rolls and though their uni nigiri was creamy it lacked flavor and sweetness. Their takoyaki was tasty but the octopus was barely there, the pieces were too small. The omurice was flavorful, but the chicken was too dry and the egg wasn't fluffy. Additionally, for the quality, this place is overpriced. If you are looking for fresh fish that's more nigiri or sashimi style and hot foods I would recommend Hana Japanese Eatery."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are so good I'm going to try everything on the menu. This place is my favorite sushi house. The service is great everyone is so pleasant. They also gave us free dessert for instagraming a picture of my meal."}
{"text":"Amazing ingredients and reasonably priced for the quality of food provided. The best sushi available in Midtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, great customer service. At the end of my meal when I was feeling very stuffed I pushed my plate away and told my fiancé I was over it. The waitress over heard and was genuinely concerned that I wasn't enjoying it. I loved it! I stuffed my face and have gone back for more."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but it was just average in my opinion.   I must say that we are from CA and there's great sushi spots all over, so we're a bit spoiled.  Also, My Wife and I only eat a few types of fish... so I can't speak to the menu in depth.    The owner was amazing, super nice and genuinely helpful.  He almost got my review to 4 stars.   The server was good but wasn't great.  Server didn't explain one of the dishes well and we ended up getting some extra stuff we didn't want.  We didn't make a fuss about it since this is a new restaurant.  She was kind though.    Salmon nigiri was awesome, the rolls selection wasn't our style.   But the manager did offer to customize however we wanted.  Wish was nice.  My wife didn't like the Ramin.  She thought it had no flavor at all.    I say definitely give this place a shot.  Decor is cool.  Small place, but really comfortable.     Lastly, they had music playing and the song \"Killing in the name\" came on.  For those you who don't know who RATM is, they're an awesome band but have tons of F-bombs in that song.   We had our 4 year old son with us and had to distract him from the lyrics.  We're pretty easy going and strangely got a kick out of it.  But geez, pretty bold sushi spot jamming rage.  Zack de la Rocha says it best in the song \"come on\"!  Updated review based on Management response and resolution."}
{"text":"This sushi place is phenomenal. I have been looking for a great sushi go to and have found it. Also, service was great! The playgirl sushi roll was excellent."}
{"text":"The establishment was in excellent condition, very clean, tasteful, and seating was both inviting while still remaining intimate (fun date spot). The fish was so fresh and thickly cut, sushi rolls were 5 star and appetizers are made to perfection. You would never guess the high grade food would be nestled along here. Everything looks so amazing it's impossible to disappoint. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Last bit not least, the owner came out to greet new customers and say hello to repeat ones. This place is a gem!!"}
{"text":"Great new Sushi restaurant in town, great food, excellent vibe and awesome service... I'll be back. They have several dishes with jalapeños which also make it a plus."}
{"text":"The sushi was awesome and the service was great. Tony kept checking on us to make sure that everything was good. If we had any questions about anything on the menu the staff were more than helpful, we will be back"}
{"text":"Cozy spot on a Sunday night. Very good service to add to the delightful sushi options. Ordered a tonkotsu ramen as well that came with some grilled spam. Never had spam before and I'm officially a fan. Even the ginger slices that no one eats tasted fresh. Salmon nigiri and the Vegas roll was on point, definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Summary: Avoid this place. I experienced shady practices by a guy who was either the manager or owner. Will not return!  The long version: I bought two Groupons to this place for \"$25 worth of food.\"  Visit 1: Ordered $22 or $23 worth of sushi and was told I'd have to pay the tax. I have used Groupon many times and have never had to pay the tax in a situation like this. Not even once. I was a little annoyed, but it's not the biggest deal in the world.  Visit 2: I ordered a chicken dish (which tasted terrible, by the way) along with some sushi. The total came to about $27 after tax. I present the Groupon when asking for the bill, and I'm then told by the waitress that it's only valid for sushi. It turns out it does say that in the fine print, but the title of the Groupon is \"$25 Worth of Food for Two or More\" NOT \"$25 Worth of Sushi for Two or More\". I then asked our waitress if I can talk to the manager.  The manager/owner comes over and I'm thinking \"Certainly they'll make an exception. After all, the title says '$25 worth of food.' Not to mention, their food costs are much lower on chicken then they are on sushi. Chicken dishes are always among the most profitable dishes for restaurants.\"   Me - I tell the manager that I neglected to read the fine print, and the title of the Groupon is misleading. I then asked if he can make an exception. Him - \"No, we can take $17 off your total bill, which is the cost of the sushi.\" (At this point I'm thinking \"EVERY other restaurant in Phoenix would've made this exception\") Me - Well, can we order a sushi roll to go since we'd have $8 left on the Groupon? Him - \"No, you can't take it to go. We want customers to come in and enjoy the experience.\"  This is perhaps the most unreasonable restaurant manager I have ever encountered as a customer. I will not return and will recommend that people do not go here."}
{"text":"First, Let me say the server was super nice! She was helpful, patient, prompt, and friendly. I came today for oysters (they were out) This is a new experience for me (place running out of oysters) Apparently they only come on certain days (huge disappointment) The miso soup is something I would not recommend just to be honest it taste like the package pre made Miso soups they sell at Fry's Grocery Store. The rolls were actually pretty good! They also came out pretty fast. I had the Spicy Tuna--Which had some spice unlike some places that state it is spicy but lacks the kick. I had the Scorpion Roll--MmMm delish, and I had the Eel Roll--Very Good--Not overdone and the rice was tasty. Also had the classic Vegas Roll--Great. This place is decent and worth the shot if you are in the area for your sushi kick. I have to add they play raunchy music--I would not be able to physically bring my daughter here--Not family friendly in that aspect!"}
{"text":"Pretty excited whenever a new sushi spot opens in Phoenix, especially one with great reviews.  We got there on a busy Friday night. The set up was small, with a warm atmosphere. The Casual decor makes it appealing for lunch.  The service was incredibly friendly from the moment we arrived. Very attentive,  and quick to appease the guests requests.  We were given a First Friday menu that listed discounted items. Which is an automatic plus,  for cost conscious sushi fans. We chose the Gyoza as a starter, and were not disappointed. The texture was soft and spongy,  and the pork was very flavorful.  We then moved on to the sushi rolls. The selection overall was pretty mediocre,  no crazy creations that were out of the ordinary. The Salmon Nigiri and Spicy Tuna were fresh,  but nothing spectacular. The Playgirl roll had a nice spiced mayo atop salmon and avocado,  but again nothing to get excited about.  I'm giving this place four stars because of the awesome service and price point. Definitely a good future lunch spot,  but the sushi isn't spectacular or unique enough for top tier status."}
{"text":"The small little shop is so elegant just as the food is good. Had their top three apps the golden avocado which are slices of avocado with two different sauces and a crunchy filling. The avocado is so rich and creamy. Also tried the gyoza and you can tell they are hand made very delicate skins and rich pork flavor. The spicy calamari is super tender and heat was just enough to get your attention without setting your head on fire. The hot night roll simply super with the crab and avocado and the tuna on top with eel sauce and was rolled and cut into perfect bite sizes. The restroom was tidy and clean. The only thumbs down was the noise level - three tables of diners and it seemed very hard to hear. Please take a chance and try them out, would love to see them succeed."}
{"text":"For a Bay Area native who is used to fresh sashimi and sushi this place is worth a visit.   My friend and I used the Groupon to try this new highly rated sushi restaurant. We were immediately seated and are waiter was extremely attentive and polite. While our restaurant had monthly special rolls, we went with the spicy calamari, 2 chef special rolls and salmon sashimi.   Appetizer-Spicy Calamari: The fried calamari rings were drenched in a sweet garlicky spicy sauce over a bed of fresh cabbage. I love garlic so this dish was bursting with flavor. My only critique was I hope it was more on the lighter crispier side like what you would get with tempura flakes.   Chef Special Roll #1: Magic Roll smoked salmon with cream cheese wrapped in story paper and drizzled in spicy mayo and eel sauce...I'm usually not a proponent of cream cheese in sushi but this one was a winner.   Chef Special Roll #2: Lollipop Roll an array of fresh sashimi tuna, yellowtail, and salmon with avocado and a kani stick all wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber all of which was masterfully arranged like a lollipop with a toothpick...it was sweet and refreshing a great compliment to their saucy rolls.   Salmon Sashimi: Buttery and Fresh need I say more?   Summary: Awesome service and yummy sushi!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very warm and inviting. The food was excellent the service was above and beyond. Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"We ate here last week on a Friday night. They were super busy, but I went in any way.  Our server, Nikki, was super helpful.  I wasn't sure what to order, so she suggested the Gyoza, phoenix roll, and a magic roll.  I was SO glad I asked her for a suggestion because the gyoza was amazing!!  Everything tasted wonderful and Nikki really went above and beyond.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I would give this place four stars, but there were just a couple areas of improvement that they could do. I'm from California so maybe it's just because we're spoiled there.  First: The tables were so close together that when we were trying to get to our table we had to wait for the waitress to finish talking to the table next to us to get by.  Second: The rolls are a on the smaller side, which I understand since it's probably more expensive for them compared to California.  Third: The rolls aren't really that amazing, I have definitely had better and fresher tasting rolls before so after the third roll it was kinda hard for me to continue and enjoy it.  BUT we did go on their one year anniversary on the first friday of the month so they had a lot of discounted prices. That was pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I got a few items to go for lunch the other day. The server who helped me when I went to pick it up was very nice, and apologized for the long wait to get the food. Unfortunately the food was just not good at all. We all got something different, and no one was happy with their food. I got a ramen soup and a sushi roll. I had one piece of the roll and threw the rest away. The fish was just bad. The soup was ok, but not worth getting again. Maybe it is better eating in, but we probably won't be back. Much better sushi and ramen places on Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We found good reviews on yelp so decided to stop in for happy hour. This was one of the best sushi experiences I've ever had. I travel and try many sushi restaurants. Everything was prepared fresh. They have the best gyoza I have ever had! The tuna lovers role was amazing! We had some saki bombs very fun.  They also have us some samples of other saki they had.  The lychee saki tastes so good! We will keep coming back this place is a must for anyone in the area.  The parking is complicated!! You can park in rotn grapes parking spots they share spots."}
{"text":"Came here on one of their first Friday of the month deals. Pretty good ambiance, small place but adequate seating. Staff is friendly. Parking is pretty horrible but you can usually get a spot on the street.  Winners: nigiri, takoyaki and the seaweed salad were awesome. And they were on the deals menu which was even better. I also got a ramen but was pretty disappointed by it. Noodles and broth okay. No meat, just veggies. Really nothing I was impressed with.  Will definitely come back for the small plates tho."}
{"text":"I don't understand the awesome reviews. We cheated on harumi for this and it just didn't compare. The rolls were lackluster and not very big. The cost was higher and the quality was lower than I'm used to. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! The service is great, the food is amazing, and there are always great deals! I'm from San Diego and haven't had the best sushi experiences since I've been in Phoenix, but Yama house has the best fish!! The rolls are so good and the sashimi is even better! By far my favorite place in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"I love here ! This place is so good and everything so great cuz the sushi is my favorite I'll come back here every week"}
{"text":"We tried the lunch chefs special, ninja roll, hot night roll, rainbow roll and everyone was delicious."}
{"text":"Clearly we went on an off night, as this was some of the worst sushi I've ever had. Sadly the sea urchin was old, we sent it back. Still on the bill. Rolls were grocery store quality. Too bad :("}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in AZ. This is such a whole in the wall place which makes it all the more special. First things first: the service here is impeccable!!! Every time my boyfriend and I go here we somehow manage to get the same sweet server. She's so polite and careful with our orders and food! Best server arnd! I only wish I knew her name! Next: the sushi is fantastic!!! It's not too pricy, and is a little smaller that sushi at other places I would say. But is soooo good. Everything feels very very clean here and I love the homey small vibey feel to it. 10/10 will always come back to this place."}
{"text":"Quick disclaimer, ordered takeout and didn't eat in. Ordered fifteen minutes before their posted close, but that wasn't a problem. Delivery was very quick. I ordered two rolls of sushi, one spicy crab and one Godzilla roll, which was a specialty roll. Sushi was decent, could've had more flavor, and the spicy crab definitely could've been much spicier. Overall a good experience, and I'll definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Yama Sushi House is fantastic. This sushi house was the only one we could find in the area that was open on Sundays. My boyfriend loves sushi and got the rainbow roll, the dragon roll, and the eel. I got the honey glazed chicken and the AAC roll. The food was very fresh and delicious. Everyone was very friendly and said bye to us when we left. The service was also very fast. It was my first sushi experience and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Finally found a sushi restaurant in the Valley that's actually fresh sushi and delicious! Walked into this place with my best buddy in town and we both love the service and the great food served to us. The ambience is nice and comfy without the lights being too dimmed and the space was great. Also, the music is not too loud, great waitstaff, and they accommodate with the Groupon very well. Can't wait to go back to this place and wanting more!"}
{"text":"Great spot!   This was our first visit, but certainly not our last.  Convenient, comfortable spot.  Great service, delicious sushi.  I very much liked that the owner Ken walked around, making sure we were happy.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I should have written this sooner, but if you are looking for some unique sushi rolls that are tasty, some amazing service, great atmosphere then come to Yama Sushi house, the only one real negative I can give was make sure you get there early because parking is tight. But honestly that's the only one. Great location, the food was awesome, I went for my Birthday and everyone was so fantastic, I will definitely come again!!! Management was so welcoming, I hadn't been here before but I took a chance and Im so glad I did!!!"}
{"text":"I love Yama! I'm new to Phoenix but it's definitely the best sushi I've had in the area by far!   It's a cool little spot...great service. They have a great happy hour menu too! I highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, and it was delicious! Very fast service and the iced green tea didn't taste like green water. Spicy Salmon roll was a little smaller than most places, and not too spicy, but it was tasty. Las Vegas was also good too though it was 75% crab salad. We also had  the golden avocado appetizer which was a little bit of spicy tuna in an avocado quarter, and tempura fried. Nothing wrong with that, totally delicious.  My favorite part was the salmon sashimi. It was nice and cold, fatty and was a thick slice. And to anyone reading this, if you have never tried that green leaf they add to the sashimi, try it!!! It's called Shiso and has an amazing flavor *swoon*  I wouldn't say it was the best sushi ever, but it was pretty tasty, especially for Phoenix."}
{"text":"This review is to be continued... as I only have a few minutes to have a few rolls on happy hour. Very fresh. Very fast. And it's really good. I only tried Godzilla and hot mess, since they were on hh. Bomb.com."}
{"text":"This is our third time here and the food is good so we don't know why we don't go here often. There are three other Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood. This one is closer, serves alcohol and is run by Japanese. You can tell that they are trained well because the sushi cut is consistent and it's fresh. Also, their soup is flavorful, not salty and fulfilled my craving for ramen noodle. If people don't know by now, the gyoza is a must order. With that said, they should make dumpling soup."}
{"text":"Great service. Decent sushi. Best part of what we ordered was the Salmon sashimi. The rolls were good, but not ahhmazing - still in search of the best sushi in AZ. I'm still believing it's possible even though we're in the desert (I mean CA is only a few hours away!)."}
{"text":"Owners are really friendly and nice. Sushi isn't that great. They forgot to put an order in. When we asked them to put it in anyway. Rather than bumping the missed order to the front of the line, they put it in as if we just ordered. We ended up canceling it because we didn't want to wait around. Food was ok. Hana is 5 minutes away and a lot better quality.  Service ok. Owners seem to try really hard to be friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know how long this place has been open, or how we missed it, but it is absolutely delicious! We had calamari, gyudon, shrimp tempura, and the dynamite roll. Everything was fantastic. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi. Service was okay. It's a gorgeous restaurant.. not much to say.. Meh."}
{"text":"I preface this by not even wanting to be blown away with sushi, I just wanted a place close to home that had a nice atmosphere and could be on par with even sushi station. I think the best sushi I have had actually comes from Yogi's over the obligatory top tens in AZ but I hate eating in a cafeteria setting.  I think they forgot the salt or flavor in everything.  Negatives:  miso soup has no flavor, add a tsp of soy to give it some  sushi has no flavor, I have no idea how the can do this but they have seemed to be able to extract flavor even from the ones with eel sauce and sriracha on them.   coconut shrimp's batter has no salt in it. The chili sauce cant save the blandness but a cocktail sauce could.  The teriyaki steak looked good but it tasted like it was boiled in water. I could see the sauce on it but when I took a bite it tasted like a naked steak with no seasoning at all. I dont know how that is possible.  I asked for salt and the only shaker they had was one with huge flakes in it. I doubt they had any in the kitchen.   Positives:  The food came quick. The waitress we had was great."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food, fast and friendly service, great happy hour specials. We will definitely be coming back here the next time we are in the valley!"}
{"text":"YUMMY !  The menu has you traditional/classic rolls and they also have very innovative signature rolls. I tried 2 of their signature rolls and I was not disappointed. Prices are average for sushi - about $10-13/roll. The restaurant is very modern. Service is was quick and friendly. They were so helpful especially since it was my first visit. They left such a good impression on me. I can't wait to come back. This restaurant has a bright future.   Parking is difficult, there's very limited parking the the front. I have yet to figure out where I can actually park...heh."}
{"text":"One of the BEST sushi places I have visited. Great atmosphere and staff! We had the Phoenix, Las Vegas, Rainbow, Spider and Uptown rolls. They were delicious and had fresh ingredients. I highly recommend this cozy spot!"}
{"text":"Really excellent sushi. They have a large menu to choose from, and everything we had was refined and delicious. They also specialize and recommend pan fried dumplings (gyoza), which are also great."}
{"text":"Totally confused by these stellar reviews and the Java mag review. This place was average on all accounts. The $2 happy hour fake crab nigiri shows they are catering to people who don't know any better."}
{"text":"I am so happy we have a great Japanese restaurant in Central Phx. I have enjoyed their great appetizers, sushi and ramen noodles. All amazing!  We will be back often."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quicker dinner with my girlfriend and was so pleased with this place! The staff is so friendly and attentive. The sushi is great and well priced. Multiple members of the staff came up to check on us periodically and make sure we were happy. The owner or GM came by to thanks us for coming in and personally made  sure we were happy with everything, this quality of customer service you don't see too much and it was refreshing. Definitely worth dropping by for some good sushi and a great atmosphere!! These people truly deserve your patronage and you won't regret a dime."}
{"text":"Rolls are so good and the sashimi was incredibly fresh. We sat at the sushi bar and the customer service was fantastic. The guys making the sushi were very friendly and our server Yan was so sweet and answered all of our questions. We will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be able to attend their soft opening last night (8/29/16). It was amazing, to say the least. We ordered a Miso Soup, Edamame, California Roll, Futomaki Roll, Baja Roll, Godzilla Roll, and a Vegetable Roll. The food came out in a steady but good pace, and our drinks were always topped off. Everyone working there is very nice and are eager to make your meal a special one.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for amazing sushi great atmosphere and a good time."}
{"text":"Really relaxed place with friendly staff with great food. We had a good experience on our first visit and definetly plan on going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic sashimi! Super fresh! Was open on Sunday evening. Many highly rated places downtown were not."}
{"text":"We are new to Phoenix and I am so pleased with Yama Sushi. We were definitely skeptical that we'd find good sushi here AND we were definitely pleasantly surprised. The sushi and service was terrific! Five Stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Alright alright! I ordered the Cali roll, spicy tuna roll, Boston & Phoenix roll (: I will say everything was clean fresh and totally acceptable tasting!! I especially liked the Phoenix roll. With that said I feel the need to clarify that I kinda felt like this was a bit run of the mill.. nothing special to really stick in my mind or wow factor. I also was disappointed that I only received minimal wasabi with my order. Four rolls and about a half tsp of wasabi?? Guyyyyyys I like it spicy ):   All in all not really disappointed but not wowed either. I'm used to SF area sushi so I may be a bit picky. I'd say this is prob a solid little spot but I don't think I'd return on my next trip to AZ. Gotta try em all though!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite little sushi house! I've been to Yama Sushi House many times and I've always had a great experience. The staff is always so warm and friendly. I've never had a bad experience in all the times I've come in.   Happy Hour prices and specials can get you stuffed for under $30! Their specialty rolls are unique and delicious.   I will continue to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Yama house, I loved this place. Its clean, quiet and they greet you at the door. The food was affordable although I do go at happy hour. You get a lot for your dollar. Their ramen wasn't the best it was pretty bland with no taste. Go to a noodle house if you want ramen. They are friendly. The parking sucked however its worth going for the food. Its not kid friendly do to what they had on the menu."}
{"text":"Came across this little gem on yelp being in a newer area of town and I have to congratulate Yama sushi house on excellent service, food and experience. You could tell they take pride in this restaurant and do their very best to make you feel like a guest in their home. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh Yama.....You are one of my favorite sushi places in town these days....Your owner is so friendly....Your gyoza are sooo fresh and tasty....You offer non fish sushi rolls which I 100% approve of. The only thing.....Your ramen......Eeeeek. not for me. The waitress, when asked what was in the ramen failed to tell me it had a giant slice of spam in it....Ohhhhh nooooo. I'll stick to sushi and be happy.    PS last time I got the special bacon wrapped scallops....Ridic....Put that on the menu!"}
{"text":"Just your run of the mill sushi house. Not much to brag about here. The rolls are decent. The service however, is excellent and welcoming. Happy hour doesn't have that big of a selection. A bit expensive."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant in central Phoenix.   Everything about this place was great.  Fresh, innovative food, friendly knowledgeable staff, good wine, upscale yet homey decor.   I don't eat sushi but saw very satisfied customers at the sushi bar.   We had several dishes and were amazed at the potstickers.  Very light, not heavy.   Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, I got the Las Vegas roll which was good, I only didn't give 5 stars just because I've had better. The service however is 5 stars! I recommend them.  The tempura cheese cake was pretty good and perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"Great Sushi Place in Phoenix  Decor was splendid, staff - courteous, food - fresh  Can't get any better than this!  Order the golden avocado, ramen and any of the sushi rolls - won't disappoint"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona. I'm from the Bay Area so finding an excellent sushi house was difficult. Great rolls! Great service! Great location! 'Highly recommend this place! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good enough food, there was an issue with the change and the server that I feel like the waitress was kinda rushing us when there where plenty of tables open. Like her shift wasn't over and she was there when we left. Maybe she was just an inexperienced server that doesn't realize you don't take a change canister or whatever crap they use till someone leaves the table. But I guess I like tipping the waitress like 50% for mediocre service. Lol. The bar next door was absolutely insane to the point where it ruined the patio, it is central Phoenix though so what should I really expect?? Maybe it was a bad night, I will try it again."}
{"text":"I'm always 3rd place???  So stoked to have sushi waking distance away with a bar and the food rocks. Had one of the best salmon skin handrolls jn a long time.   Great location.  Nice people.  Super good."}
{"text":"If I had a one time only 10 stars this would be the place to get it. I am currently in my life  sushi phase so I have been eating sushi on the regular so I've had a good variety in the last 2 months.   The food here is sooooooo fresh. The Las Vegas roll is the best I've ever had because the sauce they use and the tempura batter is perfectlyight and crispy. You can tell the fish is extremely fresh which at times is difficult to find in the summer in Phoenix.   They have a happy hour special where if you buy a bottle of saki you get a free order of gyoza. The owner/chef sold this as his gyoza is the best in town. I love gyoza so this is a high bar to set .  He wasn't exaggerating. You can tell he makes his food with pride an love.   All of the staff is extremely friendly and attentive from sushi chef's to waitresses. Very proud of this self owned little business and even prouder to support it."}
{"text":"Yama's sushi is decent. We're spoiled with fish that tastes a lot more fresh. It's good in a  pinch if you're having withdrawal from sushi. I personally had the tonkotsu ramen and it was ok, the pork was very salty and the broth was lacking flavor.  Very friendly staff and a nice location + environment."}
{"text":"This place absolutely amazed me! From the customer service to the food, this was an all around great experience. The owner came out to introduce himself and even shook our hands as we all left. We got some standard rolls (Las Vegas Roll, Crunchy Salmon Roll) and then their Hot Night Roll which is now my new favorite roll! The rice tasted much fresher and moist than any of the sushi restaurants I've eaten at. We also got a Ramen dish and it was equally as amazing. Their Happy Hour is from 2p-6p weekdays and has a great selection of standard and specialty rolls at a reduced cost. I like that they have two sizes of the Saki Bombers because I can never finish the larger size of Sapporo. We mixed it up and also tried Asahi as well. Amy was our waitress and was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back for sure."}
{"text":"Me and my husband are regulars at your place we love it all the time, food is always amazing so as service. But this time (yesterday) we were so disappointed, the waitress Sally is the worst, we asked for a water with lemons when we were seated and didn't get the water for 30 minuets and that's after 3rd time reminding her and it was no lemons as well when she finally brought it. It also took her about 15-20 minuets to bring out the beers that we ordered, and same thing was happening to people next table, few people didn't get a silverware and couldn't start eating for a while because she wouldn't even come to a tables, everybody was pissed. It wasn't even busy in the restaurant, just 3 or 4 tables. And she had like 3 dirty tables after other people left and never cleaned them the girl from the kitchen had to come out and clean it for her. It was horrible service like this for a first time ever, on top of it it was my birthday and my mood was completely ruined. We still love your place because food is absolutely amazing all the time as well as the rest of your staff but hopefully that girl will get a proper training so she doesn't affect the impression of your future customers. Low stars just because of her."}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour the other day.  There was a good mix of both classic rolls and specialty rolls on the discount list.  We had the Hot Night and Godzilla rolls as well as a few of the standard Philadelphia and California-type ones.  We also had a few pieces of nigiri.  The sushi tasted fresh, and the happy hour prices were very reasonable.  Service was great and I especially liked the free mints for dessert at the end!  The rolls here were on the heavier side when it comes to sauces, which some people probably will love and others will find less \"authentic\" - but then again, I've never been to Japan, so it's all good to me.  :)  Overall, I'd definitely come back, but probably only for happy hour since the usual prices are a little more than I'd be willing to pay."}
{"text":"I like this place. They have happy hour, but some items are less discounted than others. Rarely a wait early in the evening."}
{"text":"The sushi was absolutely delicious, the decor was calming and modern, and the service was very enthusiastic and helpful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This sushi spot is great. Great fish, rice, and service. Their prices are fair and they have a good happy hour, m-f 2-6. One of my favorite details is their 'spicy' rolls are only fish and sriracha. I never order spicy tuna/salmon/yellowtail rolls anywhere but here. The ninja roll is my favorite speciality roll, included in the picture. I also order the salmon sushi, shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizers, and seaweed salad. Did I mention the flawless serviced provided??"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi place in town!!  The service excellent!  The sushi fantastic!!  My favorites and recommendations so far, the yellowtail carpaccio and the gyoza.  We haven't even come close to trying everything  and hear the magic roll should be next to try.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Thee best sushi around town!! Since I found out about this spot my lady and I take the drive into town to celebrate whatever the occasion is to have awesome sushi and drinks! The staff is all very friendly and don't have any complaints at all! Keep up the great job!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a solid 4 stars but -1 for parking. The sushi was decent and the service was ok but there are literally 2 parking spots for the restaurant. The rest of the strip mall has parking spots that are reserved for other businesses. I used a Groupon for $25 and got an AAC roll, futomaki roll, a Las Vegas roll and an order of gyoza. The food was good, a definite 4 stars. The restaurant itself is small and quaint and wasn't too loud or busy around the time I went which was noon on a Friday. The staff and the sushi chefs were Asian which is a definite plus. I would return and try this place again"}
