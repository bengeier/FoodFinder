{"text":"Lovely little coffee shop :) It's cozy and you can get delicious coffee and simple eats. It's great!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cortado and it did not disappoint!  Nice atmosphere staff was so so when came to friendliness, very hip/eclectic art hanging."}
{"text":"When I was talking to a friend about chai tea lattes, she highly recommended Delanie's Coffee. Just hearing her describe the layout of the place (stairs that lead to open seats and a view of the shop) piqued my interest. Since it was only a 15 minute bus drive from Pitt, I went on the same day I talked with my friend. The verdict: Absolutely loved the drink and the ambiance! Definitely one of the best chai tea lattes I've ever had. Next time I'll be back to try their vegan sandwich."}
{"text":"I was originally drawn to this place because of convenience , and the fact that I'd much rather support a local, independently owned business. I only frequented Starbucks because I truly LIKED  their coffee, but I don't usually support any corporate businesses. I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! They've done a fantastic job of making it homey, warm and inviting. It's updated and cozy without being at all pretentious. Their coffee is nothing short of amazing. Strong and flavorful, but only because that's what I LIKE. The staff is so attentive that I only had to order once before the dark, longer haired gentleman ( sorry his name escapes me right now, which is awful because he always waits on me and is so friendly) had my preferences memorized. It's worth it to ask about their menu because they'll make whatever you like, however you like it. As a vegan, I was also so impressed to know they  offer many organic, all natural selections as well. I love that they serve fresh pressed juices,too. This is popular in other states because of the health benefits, but not so much in the burgh. They're perfectly sized and convenient and are a great natural substitute to coffee. Juices can provide more energy than caffeine, and I'm glad they realize that. I really have nothing negative to say, here! This establishment is clean, inviting, has fabulous employees, and offers great products all over the board. It's refreshing to leave an establishment with a smile on your face and eager to devour whatever delicious concoction they've made for you. Keep up the good work, Delanies. You'll continue to see me on a daily basis! And your staff ALL deserve gold stars."}
{"text":"Great place in South Side.  Not being a coffee drinker, it is hard to review a coffee shop, but they have a great tea selection of Harney and Sons teas as well as loose teas.  Love the open storefront windows as well as all of the seating. A great place to meet up with friends or just read a book.  Highly recommended for anyone who doesn't \"need\" to go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Wonderful and personable service. Above all, great coffee. Not too bitter. A perfect no frou frou latte. I will definitely be a repeat customer when I am in the area. Thank you."}
{"text":"Consistently the best coffee in South Side. Offering high quality Ethiopian, Kenyan, Guatemalan and House blends, all in a friendly, warm, sunlight atmosphere. Baristas are skilled, accommodating and willing to assist you in finding the perfect drink. Cold brew and chai are both house made and untouchable. Breakfast sandwiches (made from an actual cracked egg) are made-to-order and incredible. As is the pesto summer salad. A great escape for those who enjoy more than the average corporate coffee experience."}
{"text":"Love that they have cold-brew coffee. Not many coffee shops in Pittsburgh have this option. They have the small local coffee shop feel as well, I'm not sure if they use any organic ingredients, but I hope they do :).  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have never encountered such cold, unfriendly, rude staff as I have at Delanie's Coffee. Everyone that was behind the counter (four dudes) all appeared to be the most miserable coffee shop workers I've seen. There was one man in particular (I won't describe him here) who took my order with the absolute worst attitude! I had no idea why! I wasn't being difficult, the coffee shop wasn't too crazy busy - I tried to overlook it. (maybe he was just having a bad day, right?) But then he proceeded to shoot me and my date absolute DAGGERS the entire time we drank our coffees. And we were sitting on the balcony, by the railing, so that we could look down over top of the counter/main entrance. He was just staring up at us the whole entire time, and it just made me feel so weird. I'm not one to read too much into that kind of thing, but I just got bad vibes from every staff member there. My drink was delicious, but I'll pass on Delanie's from here on out."}
{"text":"My idea of a perfect coffee shop: great coffee, great food, and great atmosphere. We were in town for a concert and wanted a place with coffee and vegan options for breakfast. The make-your-own sandwich with egg, bacon, and cheese and fresh veggies pleased the omnivore in our group. The coffee drinks were hot and delicious:  creamy and flavorful with prominent coffee flavor. Wish I had a place like this back home."}
{"text":"Cool space, excellent muffins. Loved checking out the art on all the walls while enjoying a latte!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quite trendy. The buck stops here. The medium and large iced coffees, although priced differently, in fact contain the same amount of liquid! The coffee also tastes like it burst forth from a festering geyser of rodent excrement. I called and left a message about the up charge and I'm waiting to hear back. Stick to Dunk D.

Also, very sad to hear it is connected with Local because LOVE that place."}
{"text":"I had been walking by this place for some time and finally needed a place to get some work done and had a reason to go in. The only barista working was really polite and helpful. I ordered an iced chai and it was delicious. 

He decor is nice and simple. Everything was clean and they had lots if outlets for laptop users. I liked the upstairs area but it could have been a bit cooler up there. Maybe one more fan would help. 

They had these reusable mug covers to keep your hand from getting burned. They looked handmade. I would have bought one but I rarely buy coffee out. I liked that they had them though. Environmentally friendly is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"(Spacious, inviting, well decorated.)

I stopped in here on Small Business Saturday and found a place well deserving of that kind of support. This place hits all the notes of the typical \"indie coffeehouse\" checklist, but it looks authentic and friendly. Different seating setups available -- bar stools, soft chairs, wooden tables for 2 or 4. Chalkboard menu offerings. Local art installed on the walls. But the kicker is, the food and drink are better than average and cheaper than average! I had a superb soy mocha, made perfectly and carefully. Well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! They have my two favorite things .... Fresh great coffee and juice. It is a great place to relax or get your creative juices flowing. I love that they fully support other local businesses and the artwork they have on display is numbered by artist/name and for sale! Great atmosphere and the people who work there are always very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this place, it's got a ton of rotating artwork on the exposed brick wall, great coffee and a less-is-more seating approach - good amount of seating without being aggressively packed in. Lots of outlets, good music playing... feelin' like I need to make my way back here real soon."}
{"text":"Other than the people begging for change outside the shop, this place is great. I like the art on the walls and the people who work there and, of course, the delicious drinks and yummy food.  Delanie's is my favorite way to \"treat myself\" when I know I deserve something special."}
{"text":"Delanie's has a wonderful set-up and ambiance- their loft makes the shop a wonderful and peaceful study nook. Their featured artists are always interesting. Coffee is great- my lattes are always smooth and the perfect way to start a day."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly and jovial baristas, best iced coffee on Carson st, roomy sitting area, and a pretty large variety of drink choices. This is my go to place for meet ups and pick me ups!"}
{"text":"First things first -- I enjoyed the cold brew and breakfast sandwich (smoked salmon) -- my friend's ham, egg, & cheese was just ok (heavy on the bread, light on the meat). Problem was having to wait 15+ min for the order; perhaps could increase staff on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"LOVE this coffee shop! The urban atmosphere, spacious seating, and delicious homemade chai (my favorite) make Delanie's a win.  The two level seating, super tall ceilings, and hip atmosphere make this coffee shop stand out among others. Would highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Were not sure they were open from outside but they are. Nice ppl. Great fresh scones baked on site."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out or work. There are some cool art work on the wall. It's nice to see the front open in summer. I like their cappuccino, though the latte art could be improved a little bit.

I'd like to try some food items next time :)"}
{"text":"Came here to get some work done with a friend and ordered a breakfast sandwich and a latte. Both were just average. The staff was also pretty cold and unfriendly when we were looking for the daily menu. They saw that we were looking around confused and didn't offer to help, until we asked. Apparently they didn't have the menus on hand, and one of them rushed out to print them. No apology at all. 

On the bright side, the upstairs seating area was really quiet and had plenty seating, making it a great place to do work. I wouldn't come back for great coffee or food, but maybe for the conducive environment for work."}
{"text":"They make custom breakfast sandwiches, really nice touch and staff is super friendly, they offered me access to their wireless network, I didn't even ask! Coffee is great, more along gourmet type then your typical mega chain stores, I'm a creature of habit and tend to lean towards bigger chains (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts), yes I'm guilty,  at least know what I'm getting when I'm in unfamiliar towns. As far as Delanie's, I look forward to hopefully shifting my habits and making this the go to place in the South side  while I am staying here for my Latte's and Triple Shot Espresso drinks when I'm in need of that boost."}
{"text":"Very good decaf caramel latte! Creaive atmosphere and a friendly smily barista :-) 
The only thing-i didn't like the music - not my style"}
{"text":"I will be making a lot of excuses to whip out my laptop and \"work\" here. I love this place.

It has a great vibe and it's a good spot for working or hanging out because it's not crowded (seriously! take your coffee to go so I can have that table!).

I had a coffee and it was yummy, crack-filled goodness. 

But, my nephew got the triple latte, I think it's vanilla, caramel and mocha, I can't exactly remember, but it tasted like heaven and unicorn tears. Honestly, I think little cherubs were flying around sprinkling love and magic in it. It's sooooo good. You must try it."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and delicious juices! Great coffee house, neighborhood environment! The reason that I will always be a patron... As I was enjoying my juice I noticed that the owner/manager bought a warm sandwich and water to a homeless man sitting outside. Good people!"}
{"text":"Really good drip coffe and fresh fruit smoothies."}
{"text":"We had a wait at FatHeads down the street, so walked over to Delanie's. Pleasant experience with the \"better than Starbucks\" hot chocolate as stated by my 12 year old. Three drinks under $10, great music, visit with the locals, and smells of deliciousness. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best café. It's really fairly priced and an excellent value relative to other similar places. The grilled cheese is to die for and the various coffee drinks taste like the tears of angels. The service is really good and friendly as well. The ambience is awesome and I love to come here to write papers and just hang out with friends. It's super open with the loft up top and especially when the doors are open, and there is always a cool assortment of art on the walls turning those creative wheels in your head when you have a huge paper due but don't major in English (or have an even more huge paper due and do major in English). 
Just try it. You will not regret it. (Fyi Saturday, Sunday afternoons are usually poppin which is nice but also can be hard to find a seat)"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop thats quiet with a friendly staff and great prices. Always a fun (but small) crowd and love the postings on local events. Coffee is generally good, very good iced coffee. Sometimes the internet can be a little bit slow but that isn't a big deal for me."}
{"text":"great smoothies and coffee and juice!!!! made to order by nice staff in a quiet, calm spot! a must for pittsburgh traveling :)"}
{"text":"I worked remotely from here one morning and thoroughly enjoyed it. They have a pretty good selection of breakfast sandwiches/brunch type sandwiches for a coffee shop in addition to the typical bagels, muffins, and yogurt. I opted for a brunch type turkey sandwich which was very filling and generous. I almost couldn't finish it so it's a great value for only ~$7. The coffee had a good flavor also. It wasn't too sweet which was great for me. The coffee was smooth and delicious. 

I love, love, love the upstairs loft. The upstairs is quiet and away from the noisy streets, but you can still enjoy the view and people watch. Music choice is really soothing - was a very 90s rock when I visited. They have great artworks by local artists for view and for sale.

Delaine's has a great, mellow vibe. Food and coffee are both enjoyable. It's a great place to study, read, or hang out."}
{"text":"Such a fun little place!! Quick food, though got busier later than I came in. I didn't try the coffee but it smelled amazing. Easy ordering a MTO egg sandwich, little pieces of paper at the register you fill out with how you want. All real ingredients, real food. Got egg ham and American cheese on a croissant. Croissant was buttery and flaky, whole sandwich was delicious. The rest of the menu looked good too!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a nice space.  However, a place needs to serve up a good cup of joe to get a good grade from me.  And given that Beehive is only a block away, I will always give the nod to Beehive for the bolder and better cup of coffee."}
{"text":"The have vegan food! They prepare food right in front of you and its actually really delicious. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Got a mixed berry smoothie- it was more like blended ice with faint if not any taste of fruits. Not sure about their coffee but I dropped it in the trash the moment I tasted the \"smoothie\""}
{"text":"The coffee was delicious and they have multiple unique flavors. The shop is super cute and surprisingly spacious. I'm definitely going back to try more coffees!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous coffee shop that hosted a wonderful Yelp event.  The coffees were delicious (espically when there was just a dash o Bally's in my latte) and several beers for my friends.

The decor is perfect.  Places like this make me want to move to the Southside.  Great coffee, great bars, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh and one of my favorite spots in the southside. Very eclectic feel and pleasant staff. I always love the music they play here. Great to catch up with a friend or bring your books to study. The best time to go is during the warm weather when the windows are open."}
{"text":"Delanie's is hands-down the best coffee in the Southside.  The turtle latte is soooo good, very sweet. Their chocolate chip cookies are just OK, but they make up for it with these oatmeal cream pie cookies.  Mmm.  The employees are super nice, and I've never had to wait long for a drink."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch one day and got a breakfast sandwich. I liked that they had the little sheets you could fill out for the sandwiches. I got bacon, egg, gouda, and roasted red pepper on a bagel. It was a pretty good sandwich in general. I don't think the bagel was the best, but I am picky about bagels. It was too soft and just wasn't a real bagel to me. Next time I'd just get a different type of bread, but I liked that I could get other toppings on my sandwich.

This was the cheapest cold brew coffee I've ever seen. $2.75 for a 16 oz. And it was good coffee. I'd definitely grab some again next time I'm in Southside, or would want to try one of their espresso drinks too.

I thought the space was really cute. I loved the loft seating. And they had a lot of art for sale on the walls, which was awesome. The only bad part was that when I was there, it seemed really noisy. I think a lot of people got smoothies when I was there. So not somewhere I could sit and work for too long, but worth going to."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill and was looking for a coffee shop that I could get a drink and hang out for a while. Happened upon this place. Looked interesting from the outside so I went in. Glad I did. I just got a regular cup of coffee which was excellent. Decor was nice and people were friendly. Only downside was music was a bit louder than I'm accustomed to at a coffee shop. It wouldn't be so bad but it was an alternative type music which wouldn't have allowed to have a quiet conversation."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a cold pressed juice on the south side. The juice bar is amazing and the juices freshly made, with vegetable only options. The combinations are delicious, and they are heavy on fresh vegetables. The juice bar makes it much better than other hipster coffee shops."}
{"text":"I've never really known what the hype is about Delanie's, and I hadn't been in recent years. (From what I've heard they've gotten their act together since they first opened in 2011.)

After a lengthy business meeting that left me starving and in need of caffeine, I decided to stop in and give them another fair shake to see if this place was legit or if it just appeals to those who live nearby and/or college-aged women who get a boost from flirting with the mostly male, hipster staff. 

I ordered a cappuccino and a chicken salad sandwich. No frills about the service. No one bothered to recommend anything to someone who was not at all a regular customer or would be familiar with the menu. As some other Yelp reviewers have pointed out, the vibe from the baristas tends to be cold and weird. I've yet to experience the \"class\" and \"friendliness\" that others allegedly have, but I'm sure that does come and go in waves with the moods of the staff.

Really wasn't wild about my coffee even though I wanted to like it. Not sure if it was the roast or what the deal was there for me. I did, however, love my chicken salad sandwich, so kudos to you guys for that. The croissant was warm which made it that much better. It took a long time to come out and almost had to ask where it was as I was drinking my coffee, but good nonetheless. 

In terms of atmosphere, it is cool that they have a loft space and exposed brick but I wouldn't prioritize that over the coffee or service. The women's restroom looks like it hasn't been mopped since the day they opened. I consider that likely a byproduct of a mostly young male staff.

Overall verdict: other than the Beehive, there aren't many unique grab-and-go lunch spots or coffee shops in the South Side and so I see the appeal and convenience of going there from that perspective. However, compared to other coffee shops in the city, I wouldn't be jonesing to get down to Delanie's if I wasn't already in the South Side. In terms of coffee shops in other cities, I definitely don't consider them to be running with the big dogs."}
{"text":"On my mission to stake out new coffee places in Pittsburgh as part of my staycation, I ventured down to the Southside through Monday morning traffic to check out Delanie's. First off, I was blown away by the beautiful space, offering tons of seating and lovely views of original artwork along the walls. I got a small table up in the lofted area after I made my order, which consisted of a drip coffee (delicious and full, and only $1 between 7am and 9am on weekdays!) and a made-to-order breakfast sandwich (like as in I watched my eggs being scrambled and cooked) stacked high with fresh spinach and thick-cut bacon. I found myself cursing all the years of school I spent in Pittsburgh without adding Delanie's to my study spot rotation. Delanie's would be equally awesome for a catch-up with a friend in addition to being work-friendly (I easily found an outlet as well as the Wi-Fi password). Highly recommend the trip to the Southside to check out Delanie's!"}
{"text":"Cute and modern cafe. Reminds me of the coffee shops in Williamsburg except not as pricy and 30% less crowd. There's a nice loft where you can get more seating. 

The drinks are always well made and the baristas are always open to listening and making suggestions. The food options are swell as well! It can get a bit hot during the summer since they keep the storefront window open but usually it's very nice atmosphere and the artwork on the walls are so refreshing! They really gather a great collection of talent! I stop by often for a drink just to see what new art is around! 

I can never underrate a local shop that supports artists! 
Free wifi, great drinks, nice vibe and beautiful art. What more is there to want? 

Maybe an AC but hey I understand. Electricity isn't cheap."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the Burgh and wonderful breakfast sandwiches !!!  This is frequent stop on east carson street!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite coffee shop in Pittsburgh! Not only are their lattes creamy, rich, & delicious, it's a great place to study/read. Super hipster, and great little upstairs area that overlooks the entire place with the ideal lighting and ambiance.

They also have fresh juices, fruit cups, and other random treats. I used to spend a lot of time here studying. When it's warm out, they open the windows and its even more awesome enjoying a book, the outdoors, and a perfectly brewed caffeinated beverage.

And...wait for it....it's better than Starbucks. 

Also if you get an Amp'd rewards card, you get a free drink on your birthday along with other perks if you remember to bring it and swipe it with your purchases (I always forgot)."}
{"text":"ive been in here a couple times .  it's geared toward the college-aged / 20-something females that live in the south side commons and thereabouts.  nothing particularly outstanding going on .   Big Dog is a better spot for an high-level coffee/caffeine experience . delanies is as someone else mentioned very trend-aware which I can't stand .  it's better than no coffee joint in that part of Carson Street but ..."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to East Carson! Sure, there are already numerous coffee shops up and down the street, but Delanie's has a vibe all its own. And the iced chai is great!"}
{"text":"I wish I had more reason to hang out on Carson Street, because this is where I'd do it. Great coffee, nice people, beautiful space. Really a few steps above the chain coffee place a few blocks down the street. Glad to have them on the South Side."}
{"text":"Delanie's has really epic breakfast offerings as well the usual arsenal of coffee shop beverages. The breakfast sandwiches have freshly fried eggs and real veggies on them, and the pumpkin muffins they serve in the fall and winter are out of this world! Unfortunately some of the baristas are a bit creepy so I try not to come here alone, but with a friend or my boyfriend in tow it's a great place to eat breakfast or a snack and get some work done!"}
{"text":"A must-visit coffee shop on the southside. 

The staff is so friendly here! I've only been a few times and two staff members remembered me AND what I ordered last. 

The coffee is fresh and flavorful, with no bitterness. I am in love with their State Fair Grilled Cheese: Granny apples, cheddar, caramel sauce, pepper bacon, and American on sourdough. 

If you can stick around, check out the seating upstairs and you can watch everyone preparing drinks and food below. If stairs aren't your thing, the first couple of seats near the front are great for people-watching, whether or not the garage door is open. 

The bathrooms are single stalls and clean.

There is street parking out front on Carson, lot parking a block back, and a healthy ride station in the parking lot too. 

I'll always stop past Delanie's if I'm in the area because the staff are so friendly."}
{"text":"It's a great coffee shop. I saw this place on Yelp when scoping out coffee shops in the city and wanted to come check it out. They serve great coffee here, in addition to wonderful pastries, smoothies, breakfast/lunch sandwiches, cookies, and other related items. There's also a second floor to bring your purchases up to if you're looking for a quieter place to converse or chill out while you enjoy your purchase as the first floor is near the entrance, which tends to have people coming in and out and as such, is more busy in general. Certainly more convenient to get to as it's one of the coffee shops not far from the crossing from Oakland into South Side (Birmingham Bridge). Their smoothies are pretty decent as well. Pastries are also pretty well worth it, too. I do recommend a visit here at least once."}
{"text":"What bad is there to say? The coffee is bomb the artwork is sick and was a great place to study for finals !"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is cool lol. They have a second floor in a small shop. Their smoothie was good. I didn't try their coffee since I've had two cups today..."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Delanies! Great space to study and work -- and it is usually nice and quiet. They are a great community space, and feature art work and performers regularly. I don't drink coffee - but the tea and snacks are great. The staff are always welcoming, which is a great added benefit!"}
{"text":"Just found this place! I loooooove love the feel of it. Art work on the old brick walls, friendly staff, happy people. I am in. Will be back soon. Who's comin' with me?"}
{"text":"This place is super nice. Beautifully laid out with plenty of seating, lots of natural light and exposed brick, and a staff that actually seems to like their jobs. :)

I got an iced coffee and water, and the coffee is incredible!! There is a great balcony/loft area that overlooks the shop and is used for additional seating. The bathrooms are also clean and well maintained! And, last but not least - free wifi!

 I'll definitely be returning here when I visit South Side, Pittsburgh. Thank you, Delanie's, for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to come in Delanie's for awhile now but never got a chance to yet. But a friend wanted to meet up there last week and she mentioned Delanie's so I couldn't be happier! We went on a nice sunny Wednesday afternoon and it was *packed*. Packed as in we walked in and there were no tables to sit so we decided to walk around for a bit then come back. I was happy to see more tables opened up by the time we came back. Although it's located right on the main road of South Side but atmosphere inside was very nice and chill. 

It was too warm to get a hot drink so we both went for a peach green tea & a mixed berry smoothie. So refreshing! I also tried their turkey club sandwich on a croissant. So. Delicious! I've had quite a few turkey sandwiches around town throughout the years and I have to admit - this is easily one of the best I've ever eaten. My friend got hungry watching me devoured my sandwich so she went ahead and ordered their chicken salad sandwich which she liked very much too. They also have some fresh pastries like donuts, cookies, brownies too. 

Overall, this place is a thumbs up for me; I can see myself going back to Delanie's quite often now to get some work done, meet up with a friend, read a book or if I'm in the mood for their sandwich!"}
{"text":"Delanie's was super quaint coffee shop. Coffee was tasty and my boyfriend got the dirty chai and it was delicious! Their food is also reeeaaallly good. The service was great and quick. Highly recommend Devil Wears Gouda."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this coffee shop. The girl behind the counter suggested a black and gold. It was ok but very sweet. They have tons of food options as well as coffee so come hungry! I had an everything bagel and a black and gold latte. They are unique because they have many lunch options for here or to go. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday for lunch, and instantly loved the open air setting on a beautiful June day. The cold brewed coffee was rich and refreshing, and their egg and turkey sandwich was filling, toasty, and perfect. Affordable and with pricing that matches its big-chain competitors, this place can't be beat. My only complaint was the very limited menu, but they do everything well it seems, and they have gluten-free and vegan options, if that's your thing. Add friendly baristas and quirky local art, and you've got a great stop for a breakfast/lunch nibble or a coffee fix."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to sit down, have a delicious cup of coffee, and study. The upstairs nook is so cozy and a perfect environment for studying. I love the coffee; my first sip blew me away! It's coffee shops like this that make me never want to go to Starbucks ever again. Also, the staff is so friendly! :)"}
{"text":"The place looked awesome! I ordered the turkey club which ended up being a very sad sandwich (see photo). It definitely was not what I was expecting based off of the other photos uploaded here. I didn't get any avocado, and instead of bacon it was just sliced ham. Kinda bummed, mostly because the photos here on yelp I saw of the sandwiches looked amazing. I guess it depends on who makes it. 

The cold brew was pretty decent though."}
{"text":"This was genuinely the best almond milk lattes I've ever had, and I've had many in the past few years because a) I usually only ever drink almond milk and b) I love trying out new coffee drinks. 
The coffee was thick and frothy and just tasted extremely luxurious for a reasonable price. 

The place is also cute and has a nice upper level where I found a comfortable corner to do work."}
{"text":"Delanie's may be my 2nd favorite coffee house in the 'burgh. I love the openness of the atmosphere, and how they were able to fill the high walls with art and their menu. I love the wall seating downstairs, but I would definitely take my friends there if I wanted to host a get-together or work together.

I got their Cold Brew, because it's a staple for me and it was perfect. The next time I am in, I would like to try some of their fresh juices or a blended latte.

I also nommed on a Vegan Pita while I was there, made with sesame ginger tofu, vegetables & Daiya cheese. It's been painfully hard to find places that served vegan cheese so I'm extremely appreciative that they carry it.

I will admit that I was on my way to another coffee shop the day I first discovered Delanie's. I found parking out front of their building (on E Carson WOO!!) and decided to just stop in there and check it out. Delanie's greeted me with delicious smells and the natural light was so inviting, I had to stay. I wound up staying for 5-hours and I don't regret it at all. I got so much work done while they played Hozier in the overhead speakers.

It was such an enjoyable experience, and I will most certainly continue to come back."}
{"text":"Delanie's sets a very high standard for everyone else, they manage to have mastered quality, class, and courtesy. That seems to be an increasingly difficult task with businesses who force their employees to be polite, whereas you go to Delanie's, and you get a very genuine politeness, while they manage to make coffee with pure quality, and some of the most bangin' breakfast sandwiches I've had in quite some time. I wish it was more on-the-way to work, but it's worth the ~1 mile diversion to support a business like this one. Tell your friends to check this awesome joint out if they've not tried it yet. Let's do our best to keep small businesses like this up and running. 
From:
A reformed Starbucks addict who's now discovered what real coffee is."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Delanie's for some time, and I wish I lived closer that I could hang out here all of the time.  When my friend and I got to the door, we thought they were closed because the door was stuck shut.  One of the baristas opened the door for us and apologized.  It was super nice of him, as we were about to just walk away.

I ordered the Turtle Latte ($4.50), which was a cold mix of peanut butter, chocolate, caramel, and espresso.  As others have said, this drink is almost like a milkshake but not overpoweringly sweet.  The barista told us this was one of the first drinks he invented when Delanie's started, which was a fun tidbit.  I really enjoyed this drink, and I have never had anything else quite like it.

The shop is really big, but a few more tables would be nice.  We did manage to get a seat; however most everyone was sharing tables.  While my own neighborhood favorite coffee place is Commonplace Coffee, Delanie's is definitly one of the best coffee shops in Pittsburgh and easily the best in the South Side."}
{"text":"Coffee has a different taste and we were not fond of it. Cool vibe, and decent service. We ordered two black coffees and they brewed a fresh pot. The place had a lot of locals"}
{"text":"Nothin' special..basic coffee shop."}
{"text":"Soooo...

I lurve the staff. Kelly and Michelle are absolutely adorable plus they are super nice and know how to whip up a delicious Dirty Chai Latte. 

The pastries as well are absolutely delicious. 

From the outside Delanies might not look that big but it's quite spacious and a great place to do some busy work or to just hang out for a quick Cup o' Java. This is definitely my go to coffee shop whenever I come to the South Side."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, love the exposed brick walls and upstairs area with room to spread out and work. The brass tree in the corner is cool too. 

Randy is the shit, I was having trouble connecting to the interwez so he rebooted the entire place and got me up and running, very sweet of him.

Solid white chocolate mocha. The muffin was ok, make sure to get it toasted 2 times to ensure you get it heated all the way thru. 

I love the front window letting in all the natural light, great place to kick back, your feet up and read. 

There was a newer employee who you could hear throughout the entire place, yes it's small, but we learned information about her we probably could have lived without. Just saying =) Made for a few great laughs though!"}
{"text":"..still my fav coffee shop in south side (possibly a top 3 for all of Pgh IMO)

Baristas are alwaysss so kind.
Plenty of seating is offered including a cool loft. 
Windows/walls open up on nice days.

We are here quite often. I stick to their regular coffee (love it) my fiance usually orders raspberry mocha or iced coffee."}
{"text":"Cute place with a decent cup of coffee.  Was happy with my breakfast sandwich and my avocado toast.  Staff could be a bit more friendly, though.  Bit of the \"holier than thou\" hipster attitude in there.  More than the Beehive even, which is funny cause Delanie's is owned by amp'd (same owners as Diesel)."}
{"text":"I stopped in with CM on Tues. for some beverages and conversation.  We originally came by at 7:30pm hoping to try one of the breakfast sandwiches, since CM was hungry and I'd read good things about them from other reviews.  The barista apologetically informed us that they turn off the oven at 7pm (apparently, it takes a long time to cool down), and suggested Carson St. Deli a couple blocks down as an alternative.  We followed his advice, and then returned at around 8 to have the drinks we'd originally been planning on getting at Delanie's.

Since I hadn't had dessert, I had to try the turtle latte ($4.50).  Rather than being a true latte, this drink is a milkshake-like drink with chocolate and caramel syrups, as well as real peanut butter, smoothie powder, and some espresso.  It's served cold, rather than hot, which the barista explained is because the peanut butter won't incorporate into the drink otherwise.  Although the drink involves sweet ingredients, it isn't overly sugary due to the espresso and lack of ice cream--it's what you might call a well-balanced dessert-y drink.  In terms of consistency, it's thicker than a frozen coffee, but not as thick as a milkshake.  If you're looking for a milkshake alternative, or something like an iced coffee but sweeter, I'd highly recommend trying it!

Rather than going with his preferred coffee shop drink, a cafe au lait, CM decided to break the mold and try an espresso con panna ($1.50).  This is a standard espresso shot topped with fresh whipped cream (not the commercial stuff from a can).  CM was quite pleased with this drink.  Even though I normally shy away from straight espresso shots due to their bitterness, which I'm sensitive to, I tried a sip, and was favorably impressed.  The whipped cream helped cut the espresso, giving it a pleasant fluffy texture as well as a nice flavor balance, making for a unique drink.

Service from the barista was incredibly friendly and helpful (thanks for recommending the deli!), and quite efficient as well.  The ambiance is very appropriate for a coffee shop, with art from local artists hanging on walls of exposed brick.  We sat up in the upstairs loft, which provided a great view, but also felt self-contained and cozy.  Overall, we were very pleased with our experience at Delanie's, despite the unavailability of the breakfast sandwiches which we'd hoped to try (we'll have to return another time to try them!)  In my view, Delanie's is definitely the best establishment of AMPD Group, which also owns several restaurants and bars around town, including Local Bar + Kitchen, Ten Penny, and Steel Cactus.  If you happen to be on the South Side, check it out--you won't be disappointed!  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome local coffee shop. Their breakfast sandwiches are fantastic! And you have to try their turtle frozen mocha drink. It's made with real peanut butter! So good. I would say this would be one of my top 5 favorite coffee shops in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Love love this place, best breakfast sandwich around. But damn, it's been at least three times I've come here to a locked door during posted hours. Seems like the morning crew, particularly Saturdays, tends to be late. Really annoying! Get it together my friends, Delanie's is a gem and I'd like to be able to nosh on a sandwich at 820 if you are meant to open at 8."}
{"text":"Great coffee, pastry, juice.

Good for people watching. 

Good for meetings. 

Fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly baristas, beautiful art, free wifi, decent amount of seating. Pups welcome. And great coffee!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh , and the people are kind! Great place if u need background action noise to study! Nice tall counter or regular height tables and some cozy furniture upstairs. Way friendly accessible power outlets! You never feel like a bother"}
{"text":"This place has my favorite iced coffee in Pittsburgh. The space is cute- the store front opens in warm weather and there is an upstairs loft-like seating area with more tables (extra outlets!) and sofas. There is free wifi and local art. They carry assorted pastries, including those from Glutenny. I also saw fresh squeezed OJ. I haven't tried the breakfast sandwiches yet, but I can see that they are popular.

The atmosphere is fine, though the few times I've been there, the music has been on pretty loudly (like I feel the beats going through my body). It was 90 degrees out the other day, and the store front was open and the store had fans, but the back of my legs were sweaty. Also, if you sit there long enough, you will smell like breakfast sandwiches, which may be a plus or minus."}
{"text":"**A great place for good cup of coffee and meeting with friends or getting some work done**

Delanie's was a great find!
Very cute little storefront, right on Carson Street.

They have everything from your basic cup of coffee to more elaborate coffee creations!
Now, I'm no connoisseur of coffee, nor do I claim to be, but I really liked the Vanilla Latte that I had chosen--in fact, I had 2!

What I do know, however, is food!
Delanie's was pumping out some very tasty little treats!
Pumpkin Cheesecake that was moist, flavorful and beautiful--yes, beautiful!!
They also make cookies that are amazing and perfect; huge chocolate chip cookies that are as big as your head!

The other thing that I \"know\" is service and the folks here were very nice, moved with urgency, and were not put out by accommodating any special requests from guests.

I would most definitely stop in again and recommend Delanie's Coffee to friends!


[damnit, I didn't have to use the bathroom and totally forgot to, at least, check it out!  Sorry, you guys... you know I like to put a bathroom check on these things, but I'll get it next time!!]"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. 
My friends and I went here around 12pm on a Sunday. We were super excited I heard it was really good from the friend we were visiting in Pittsburgh. 

However, while ordering they were out of many things. I tried getting their banana strawberry smoothie, they were out of bananas. I tried ordering their yogurt which has berries and granola in it, and they were out of both. My friend tried making her own breakfast sandwich and they were out of bacon. Even the homemade juice had very limited options and they are known for it. 

Overall it looked super cute inside to do homework or catch up with friends. But they need to try harder to keep their food stocked."}
{"text":"I really like coffee shops that try to set themselves apart.  My typical go-to place for coffee is Starbucks, but today I was meeting a friend in South Side so I went where she wanted to go.

Delaine's has a quaint and pleasant atmosphere like a traditional coffee shop, but with a bit of an artistic flair.  They have artwork hanging up on the walls done by local artists that are for sale so the artwork never stays the same.

The baristas are friendly and polite; you can tell they really care about the impression customers have of their coffee shop! 

What I like most about Delaine's is that there are two floors. They don't try to cramp all the tables in one space like other coffee shops tend to do."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee shop. The layout is amazing with a cool balcony to sit on up in the back and big windows that open up on nice days. The coffee is great and they have a good selection of smoothies and juices as well if you don't like coffee."}
{"text":"After my Saturday morning work out I stopped by Delaine's to get out of the cold drizzling rain on my way to work. It's officially autumn so I did exactly what I always do, ordered a pumpkin latte.

The drink itself was delicious, not too hot and they must use a different pumpkin syrup because it had a very distinct real pumpkin taste. The prices are right on par with any of the other coffee shops lattes. I was a little overwhelmed with the options when I walked in. All the usual coffee shop drinks plus all sorts of smoothies. The food looked amazing too. 

I need to go back again to try something other than my standard and a pastry. 

It really is the picture perfect space to spend a cool rainy fall day. The music was low and the lighting is indirect with lots of natural light coming through the windows in the front. They have large soft chairs that are low to the ground and very welcoming. I didn't get to venture upstairs but I could see they did make use of the loft area that space offered.

I very much recommend this as a great alternative to chain coffee spots. It's picturesque and the espresso was great."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for our morning coffee.  We decided to head to Delanie's Coffee because it was on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport.  Located right on E Carson St, it's quite easy to find.  Even though it doesn't look like too much from the outside it's quite nice inside.  It actually has two levels of seating with a bar and a few tables downstairs and then a couple of tables and comfy seats in a loft type area.  The walls are made of brick which gives it a comfortable feel while the lighting is a combination of track lighting and can lights.  They also have photos and artwork on the wall that is for sale. For my coffee on this morning I decided to go with a cappuccino while my wife went with a mocha.  It was not crowded on the morning that we were there and so our coffees were ready quickly and we headed upstairs to drink them.  My cappuccino ended up being pretty good.  The coffee flavor of it was nice and smooth without any bitterness.  It was the foam layer here that was interesting as it was quite dense and was more like a bone dry cappuccino than any other I have had.  Yeah I had to do the Google in order to properly describe it and learned quite a bit.  In any case, it was still enjoyable and my wife enjoyed her mocha as well.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My coffee was good and I am interested in trying a couple of their $7 Gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches which I only noticed whenever we were close to leaving."}
{"text":"Cute café, very pleasant employees and nice atmosphere but dear GOD this latte was terrible. Actually tastes like lawn clippings and could not bring myself to take more than three sips. My sister's chai latte was WONDERFUL on the other hand. Prices are pretty cheap, about $3 for a medium cup. Good location and parking."}
{"text":"Only went there once. Had pomegranate tea.. Seemed a little weak but atmosphere was cool. Had a decent selection."}
{"text":"Yum! Such a quaint place and I'm obsessed with the fact they let you have a piece of paper and just order your breakfast Sammie the way you want. 

It looks like the owner is working too. Unless the manager on staff that morning was just very passionate. I love when the owner is there on busy mornings. Wasn't a long wait and it was way easier to get food for brunch as compared to waffles InCaffeinated. We couldn't get in there ever. 

They had everything I wanted so I was happy about that. I'm an avid hot tea drinker and the barista asked if I wanted two tea bags in my large hot tea...which was very considerate. Like, I don't think anywhere I've ever been has asked me that. Wayyyyyyyyyy plus! Plus the food was bangin'. They let dogs inside too."}
{"text":"Nice lookin place and friendly baroosters. I think he even remade my drink because he wasn't satisfied with the latte art he made. And if it really was a sugar free vanilla caramel latte, it was one of the best ones I've had."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, latte was good, not as good as espresso a Mano or commonplace but leaps and bounds above any national chain. If you waste your time with Starbucks, do yourself a favor and get real coffee here instead."}
{"text":"I walked in here during an all day rain-a-thon in Pittsburgh (so rare, right?) on a Saturday. It was pretty busy, but all of the hustle and bustle was contained to the upstairs, which looked like a cool loft area. It wasn't loud either. The first thing I noticed is how high the ceiling was and I loved that. The art on the walls was a delight to look at too.

I ordered something vegan with tofu (I'm not vegan by any means, but wanted to try it), and I got it delivered to me on a plate with two small toasted pieces of bread, lettuce, slices or bell pepper, and warmed tofu. There was something else on the bread that I don't remember, but I was really surprised by how delicious and satisfying this was. I am a fan.

For my drink I got an iced vanilla latte and I have to say it's the best vanilla latte I've had around town. I ended up having two more throughout my time there...I just inhaled them. Seriously..so good. I came back on Sunday and had an iced mocha, which was just as good. This is my new favorite place for real!"}
{"text":"Make your own breakfast sandwich?  Now you're talking!  

This was the morning perk-up and fuel location for us on this fine Friday.  The people that work there are hip and awesome and the coffee came out scorching hot and the food is made quick and delivered to your table via pony express.  

Also impressive is the aesthetics of the interior, being two levels with paintings and such decorating the walls.  

This would be a regular stop for me, if only I lived in this town."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the friendly, attentive staff! I'm from California and recently moved to Greensburg, PA. Had to drive a hour out to find a big city (Pittsburgh) but worth every minute of the drive! The staff here immediately greeted me and answered all my questions about the drinks on the menu. My iced soy latte was great. The beans were roasted wonderfully and the drink turned out very smooth. I would definitely come here again and try some of their other menu items - they had some yummy looking pastries in their display case!"}
{"text":"A huge contrast from the Beehive, but awesome in its own way.

The space is really nice with exposed brick and an upstairs section as well. It's big, bright, and clean and the coffee is good.

The service is great and the people are really nice. This is a solid place to settle in and get some work done."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little coffee shop! I love everything from the paintings/drawings from local artists for sale to the adorable menu. My go to are the frozen lattes. Unlike the Starbucks frapps they don't taste watered down. I highly recommend the Nutella frozen latte. This is definitely a great spot to just hang out and catch up with a friend, work on your laptop, or read a book."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I've been here a few times each year during a business trip for something small and sweet as I walked by.
     In those years I have had some wonderful, sweet items. Some so good I've made a second stop as I walked Carson St. going some place else, just to get more.
     I haven't tried the coffee here since it raises my blood pressure but let me tell you, they look so good. I think I gain a pound watching someone else get their coffee last year. It was so tempting.
     This year I stopped in after a nice steak dinner wanting something sweet and sort of healthy. Or at least not entirely bad for me. I saw these lovely Oatmeal cookies with sweet creme in the middle. I took it back to the hotel and I was ready to enjoy it in a few bites with some milk. I was very disappointed to find it had coffee in it. So much it over powered the creme and cookie. Which was a big bummer. I was even more displeased to think the sales person neglected to mention it. It's the first time it's happened and it will remind me to ask next time.
     Don't let this mishap keep you from enjoying a coffee and sweets. Everything here is fresh and made very well. Some are almost to decadent to eat but I would still eat them if I were you. Just ask if it has coffee in it.
     There is also some fantastic art on the walls to view and buy if your so inclined. Unfortunately none of the art is mine."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwiches in the city.


The staff are nice and attentive.  The sugar loaded smoothies taste great.

The space itself is also very cool.  I like the artwork.

Prices are acceptable for what you get.  Fresh made food is really nice."}
{"text":"Delanie's is a nice place. The coffee is good, and the baristas are down to earth and friendly. I really like the atmosphere in this place. It's got the exposed brick/artsy vibe. And it has this seating up high that inspires high-thinking creativity (the elevation definitely corresponds to the thinking). I have never had trouble finding a seat. The mocha is my go-to. Wifi works great. You can login a couple hours of work time here, no problem. 

Overall, visit Delanies. I like it."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times. It is a very good place for coffee but I was not very interested in  trying something to eat since the whole place  smelled eggs. It was winter and the doors were closed. The first time I went it was fall and the doors were open and it was great. No smell.  I think they can use a little more cleaning and keeping up of the place and better  ventilating system. Otherwise is a great place especially when it's in and out sitting with the big windows open,  in very centrally located  area on Carson with nice stuff.  The coffee is super!"}
{"text":"A nice find in Southside. Some of the non-coffee drinks run on the sweet side but they brew Toby's coffee and the regular kind is good. I had the matcha latte but it was too sweet for me. They have a nice upstairs and it's a good place to catch up with friends, do some work, or read a book. Very chill atmosphere & free wifi (:"}
{"text":"As a southsider, Delanie's is a go-to for me. Their coffee is always spot on and their breakfast sandwiches are made-to-order. I usually go with a caramel latte, and it's never done me wrong. Plus, they're dog friendly!

Sometimes their pastry and beverage case is a bit bare, so it seems like they could use some inventory help. Also, I'm not super crazy about the juices; they're just okay for the size and price."}
{"text":"Delanies makes a mean latte, among other things. Staff are super cool and I've never had a bad or even sub-par cup of coffee there. Which is something I can't say about other more popular coffee places.

Plenty of seating and good atmosphere for getting shit done. Go."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and coffee with a friend based on yelp recommendations.  The coffee was great, the food was very delicious (hummus pita, ginger tofu sandwich), and the decor was awesome.  We sat up in the loft.  However, unlike most reviews I read, the barista/staff were not friendly.  It took me a while to figure out how to describe them, and what I finally realized is that they were snobs.  I think they would have been just as happy had we walked out and went to Brueggers instead."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I don't drink hot beverages other than hot chocolate! :)

This local coffee shop has been a great place for meetings and they feature local art! With free Wi-Fi and a decent amount of table space it is my go-to space when I need to schedule a coffee meeting in the Southside. If you are like me, the hot chocolate is a great option. 

The menu includes the usual hot beverages, smoothies, and now some food items. They have a case that includes baked goods and some pre-made food choices. I haven't tried the hot foods, but the options for breakfast often look yummy!

The staff is always friendly and the place is clean. I suggest checking it out!"}
{"text":"\"I am going to write this place the BEST review on Yelp\" is what I may have said as I walked out of Delanie's.  Turns out they don't need it...look at all these positive reviews!  But I am a lady of my word...

I don't eat or drink a lot of dairy these days so I am hugely grateful to find a coffee shop that offers not only soy milk, but my personal favorite replacement, almond milk.

The friendly hippie hipster hatted gentleman at the counter was a delight, and we bonded over our shared love of the music he was playing, Bird and the Bee (catchy stuff: http://youtu.be/TMy6X5cQul8).  My black and white mocha with almond milk was so sweet and delicious.  My friend asked for a mocha with extra espresso, and wow, did he ever listen - that'll put some hair on your chest!  She was thrilled, of course.

The food looks tasty, the space is full of beautiful details, overall, a marvelous experience."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place to chat with friends or work. I got the peach latte and it smelled and tasted great. Friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Got the 20oz drop of the day. Really nicely blended medium roast. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Love coming here with my papers and laptop to work and sip on some coffee. The place is very cute, the staff is friendly, and the coffee is wonderful. I have ordered a couple of breakfast sandwiches that were a bit burnt and tasted off, but I'm willing to try again."}
{"text":"In the midst of a busy Saturday on the South Side, Delanie's is a calm spot in the storm.  I stopped for a to-go cup so I could enjoy a non-snowy day walking around South Side while waiting for a group for lunch.

The barista was pleasant (and didn't show annoyance when I changed my order from \"for here\" to \"to go;\" though he hadn't actually poured anything, he did need to wash cups for us).  The atmosphere was calm even though it was semi-busy.  It looks like a great place to stay and work on your laptop or study with plenty of tables and chairs available.

The coffee, a Costa Rican that day I believe was very tasty.  I would have liked something a little deeper, but it was mellow and fresh (and not burned...ahem, you know who you are, chain coffee guys!)

I would love to try some of their lattes - the menu is plentiful and interesting.  I had a sample of a mocha brownie and would love a full version of their pastries, too."}
{"text":"What a great coffee shop and their state fair grilled cheese was to die for! Would never thought to put apples on a grilled cheese. Wonderful comfort food!"}
{"text":"Out of the five or six places I have tried, Delanie's is my favorite coffee in Pittsburgh by far. The prices are reasonable, the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable, the shop is cute/clean and even the food is good! What really impresses me is the passion with which the baristas talk  about coffee. They are totally nerdy about it (in the best way possible) and go out of their way to help you get the best cup possible. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop in at Delanie's--you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop find from Yelp. Was stuck on the south side for several hours this afternoon, and needed a place to get some work done. This spot was a little out of the way, but worth it for the friendly service, tasty chai latte, and most of all the eminently work-friendly upstairs seating area. It was quiet, comfortable, and not so crowded as to distract. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great place to stop while strolling around this cute hood. Tons of coffee and tea options and large stay cups. I'm a coffee snob, like it strong and black. The americano hit the spot. 2 shots in a small; as it should be. Got to watch some world cups too. Nice welcome to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great juice ! Coffee is really good and really cool environment! The best place in Pittsburgh for sure !"}
{"text":"About the best south side coffee. If it isn't busy, get a pour over. Well worth the wait. Great staff, great product."}
{"text":"Nice coffee drinks and a cute space. I picked up whole bean espresso, not sure who they use but seemed a touch oily/over roasted when I pulled a shot at home. Would like to try their soups."}
{"text":"FAVORITE place to study in Pittsburgh. The staff is phenomenal and the food and drinks are delicious. I strongly recommend the Parisian (a blended coffee drink with Nutella) or trying one of their customizable breakfast sandwiches. The atmosphere is great and when the weather is nice they open up the front windows so the tables are open to the street. Excellent people watching on Carson St."}
{"text":"Really cute! Would have loved to spend a little more time there while in town. I tried the alone Fog: Earl Grey, steamed milk and water. It was really good and perfect for the chilly day it was. The barista was really nice and gave us some great restaurant recommendations!"}
{"text":"Really good spot to study for a few hours! Got their hot chocolate which was ok, definitely not the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for coffee in the Burgh. A prime spot for college kids to get work done in peace and quiet. The menu is extensive and the baristas are very kind and willing to give you a recommendation. Wifi is available if you ask for the password. I must say- the black and white mocha is the best. Mmm."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee place in the south side. I really wanted to find a locally owned coffee spot but it was so hard to find someone who has a better white mocha than Starbucks. All of the workers are nice and have started to remember my order, which makes it a super plus! I love the local art hanging on the walls for sale and not to mention the fresh pressed juices !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent vibe, lots of light & artwork... friendly staff ...food & drinks are top notch.
They lose a star because they do not recycle"}
{"text":"Really neat place on Carson St. What I love about this place is that they have the COOLEST art hanging all over the venue. It was actually kinda hard for me to focus on my actual work, since I got so caught up in all of the amazing paintings everywhere. I got a hot tea here, which was really nice, nothing too crazy. Not too much seating here, and not many outlets, so not super ideal for working. They seem to have a lot of food here as well, which I didn't try, but it looked good!"}
{"text":"Went in to kill some time while waiting for a table at Fathead's, and ended up loving this place!  The upstairs seating area was quiet, with comfy chairs, and a cool exposed brick wall.  The staff was very friendly.  The coffee was on point!  I had a caramel latte that blew away anything I've ever had at a chain place, and most of the local places I've been to as well.  Will definitely stop back next time I'm on the South Side."}
{"text":"Until last year, I was a longtime South Side resident and could always count on a great cup of coffee from Delanie's. Tried their chai on my last visit and it was perfect warmer-uper on a chilly night. Also, kudos to this establishment for supporting, featuring, and promoting local artists!"}
{"text":"Thumbs down to Milkshake factory being closed for last day due to the  holidays but thumbs up for this great alternative! My daughter and I decided to check in here for a coffee and a latte. My daughter decided to go with what they call a sweetheart frozen latte with white chocolate and raspberry.  I opted for the brew of the day which was a Brazilian roast.

The place was packed with people and along the walls were various artwork for sale. They have an upstairs area to sit but since we were under time constraints we decided to stay downstairs and enjoy our drinks at a long bar stool. Sandwiches and a couple of sweets are also available for purchase as well as smoothies, hot chocolate, and juices.

My daughter really enjoyed her frozen latte. My coffee was a good medium blend. Was a bit piping hot that I burned my tongue a little. Still you get a lot of bang for your buck. Coffee was very good. Free WiFi is available here for the many I saw working on their laptops. They have a assortment of expressos to choose from.  Makes a great place to unwind while you're in the heart of Southside's business district."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, cool vibes, very friendly lively staff, amazing art, good jams who could ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"I walked in somewhat weary from my last coffee shop venture. I was blown away. New favorite coffee shop. Food is amazing, especially for such low prices. The atmosphere is welcoming and cheery, while still mellow enough to work or study. I'll Blvd returning again and again!!"}
{"text":"I like but don't LOVE this place. Most of their drinks seem pretty straightforward- good, but nothing knock-your-socks-off amazing. I like their chai tea latte. The store offers a lot of gluten free pastry options which is nice. All in all, Delanie's has a nice atmosphere. The biggest perk is probably the huge open window, great for feeling a summer breeze."}
{"text":"Nothing attracts college students like caffeine and free WiFi. It's definitely one of the more popular cafes in South Side. They have a huge selection of drinks from your traditional brewed coffee to frilly frappuccinos. My favorite is their black & gold latte which is one of their specialities. 

My biggest complaint has always been their ordering system. I've only been here a handful of times but one thing is always consistent - they always jack up my order! Nothing gets written down so the barista juggling 5 different orders from memory is bound to forget a detail or two. During my last visit, it took 3 attempts and over 20 minutes to get the order right. Someone get them a pen and a pad of paper."}
{"text":"What an A-DOR-ABLE place!  

From the outside you'd never know how big it is!  Once you step in you realize there's seating on the floor for a handful of people and then a cute little loft style area up above that probably seats around 25-30.  

The menu is pretty extensive for a coffee shop, with the norms being the espresso based drinks, chai (yay!) and teas.  But they also have a slew of smoothies.  They all looked amazing but I opted for the manager's choice, an amaretto latte.  I'm a sucker for almond, what can I say.  It was perfect to my specifications (skim and extra hot that it burns my tongue slightly).  A smoothie will be saved for another day...don't you worry!

I was interested to hear from chatting a bit with the manager that they're connected with Local.  They receive all their wraps freshly made from the restaurant down the street each morning.  The manager is also a pastry chef and makes delicious looking pastries (which I, sadly, did not partake in after eating a oh so bad for you Chinese lunch!).

I love when places have completely fresh food offerings.  It makes you feel better about purchasing them, in terms of freshness and just supporting local businesses.  I'm excited to make this a regular on my work day coffee shop rotation.  Added bonus, FREE WI F!  

OH, and I will be back for you pumpkin scone, be sure of that!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere tucked away in the South Side. Coffee is pretty good. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my time here! They have plenty of options that accommodate a variety of diets. The wifi is fast and it is a great place to stay and do work. I came with a group of girls and was comfortable staying here all day with yummy snacks every few hours. 

While my friend who comes here more often says that the staff is typically great, today was another story. There was one guy behind the counter who was truly rude...
He looked at me with absolute disdain. He answered my friendly questions as short as he possibly could. The only effort he put into our interaction was his determination to be as unhelpful as possible. 
To give you an idea, we were both so uncomfortable that my friend actually had to walk away and laugh. Later on, both the men's and women's bathroom ran out of toilet paper. My friend let him know, and he told the girls to use napkins. He didn't even check to see if there was more toilet paper in stock. I'm sure there was. This man. 

I don't say any of this to advise you not to come! We had a great time otherwise and honestly this provided some laughs. Writing this review was in part necessary to shed the severe discomfort of that situation and in part to let other Delanie customers know that they are not alone. Let your voices be heard! You deserve toilet paper. You deserve to know \"how do you make your smoothies.\" Don't let anyone make you feel otherwise!"}
{"text":"Matcha Green Tea in a coffee shop with my croissant sandwich (I chose egg, Swiss and spinach for $5) was a great way to start my day. The wait for sandwich was a bit delayed because the two man buns making food were being chatty and holding up service. Other than that, it's a cool place to chill out."}
{"text":"Delanie's is my new favorite coffee place, which says something because I have so many in Pittsburgh. A few times a week, I like to walk a few blocks and have a coffee at their nice cafe on Carson. 

The staff is always friendly.  The coffee is good, but the breakfast sandwiches are better. I love breakfast. I could eat brinner every night. That being said, their veggie, egg, and cheese sandwich is one of the freshest I've ever had. 

Be warned, a few of their frozen drinks taste more like milkshakes than your run-of-the-mill iced coffee. If you fancy a treat, try the \"turtle\", a sweet frozen concoction of peanut butter, chocolate, and caramel.

It's not a bad place for a meetup, a break, or just somewhere to read/work for awhile.  If you're a regular, it's worthwhile to join their loyalty program. You will quickly accumulate free drinks!"}
{"text":"Finally, I find a place with croissant breakfast sandwiches! For breakfast today, I drove a half hour to get a heart beat juice with: beet, orange, ginger, parsley and carrot. The juice was well balanced, cold pressed, unpasteurized and raw-although I didn't see an organic label. The breakfast sandwiches are create your own- I chose croissant, egg, sausage, roasted red pepper, onion, cheddar and spinach. The croissant was buttery, warm and flakey. I was very impressed with the quality, service and atmosphere. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little coffee shop and I love coming here! The staff has always been friendly and patient with me when I'm trying to figure out some kind of newly concocted coffee beverage to try for the day. Sometimes the seating is limited but I think it adds to the atmosphere and keeps it from getting crowded inside. Definitely the kind of place to come enjoy a nice latte and a book."}
