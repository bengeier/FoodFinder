{"text":"I had a really good time at the Favourites Dining Room. I won a free lunch for two courtesy of Mr. Will Wong and our experience was fantastic!    I took a friend and we were immediately seated at a large table right in front of the window and race track. The view was incredible! We had the best seats in the house. We then made our first visit to the buffet to see what was available.   The buffet had a meat station with a gentleman carving roast beef, tons of salads options, seafood, desserts and an omelette station. I decided to have an omelette, since I could customize it and make one according to my dietary restrictions. The chef was really friendly and he did a great job. My omelette was light, fluffy and scrumptious!  Allover this was a great experience. The food was exquisite and the service was outstanding.   I would definitely go back to enjoy watching another race!"}
{"text":"One of our sales guys is retiring in a couple weeks.  We had his retirement party at Favourites Dining Room at Woodbine Racetrack this afternoon. There were about 20 of us.  I've only there once before. Kyle came by when we first got there and explained how and where to bet.  The meal is a buffet.  The food was okay, nothing great.  Nothing wowed me.  It was fun because it was relaxing and a different place to host a retirement party."}
