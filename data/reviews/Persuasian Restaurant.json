{"text":"This might be my favorite Asian restaurant. Lots of Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Thai dishes to choose from. Good, clean food - doesn't leave you feeling sick like other Chinese food. I usually take out, but it's also fun to dine-in bc it's a small, intimate atmosphere and the staff is really friendly. Everything on the menu is great - you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"How this gets a 4.5 average on yelp is beyond me. It speaks to the lack of decent Asian food of any type in Charlotte. 

I'll start with the positives: service was good, the place was clean, all food was hot, and prices were quite reasonable for dinner. The negative: every item we ordered was devoid of any flavor. Steer clear of the Pad Thai and the basil stir fry (which had no basil). 

I really wanted to like this place since it's right around the corner from me, but I doubt I'll be persuaded to return."}
{"text":"I'm normally not that big a fan of Chinese food but me and my wife really liked the simple menu and the flavorful food.  They have good options for vegetarians too. I'll definitely visit the place again!"}
{"text":"Great variety of Asian food, absolutely love the Pho and Seaweed Salad! Awesome
Neighborhood restaurant with a great atmosphere and extremely nice employees. Nice weeknight takeout spots well, affordable and quick."}
{"text":"Persuasion was fast, friendly! We were to go but everything went very smoothly. Food was hot and was ready in 10 minutes on a weekday night.

The average: One thing I'd say is that the summer rolls were a bit plain. Very fresh with a touch of basil to differentiate, but without shrimp or seasonings they were all texture. The included peanut sauce didn't mesh with them, IMO. I'd also like their fried rice to be a little more exciting/better as I know day old rice is the best but this may have been a day and a half or maybe two. Very few veggies/egg.

The good: Our main courses, MuShu and a veggie stir fry, were delicious. The MuShu in particular was probably the best I've had in Charlotte though I'll admit I haven't tried a huge gamut. They included enough pancakes (thank god!) and the flavor was excellent even without the plum sauce.

The veggie stir fry was a bit plainer but honestly we also got the plainest sauce that wasn't my first choice. I think their other options would have fit the bill just right. Veggies were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Came into this tucked away spot around 7 on a Saturday night and was really impressed! Seemed like a really local-friendly place as the bartenders and waiters knew most of the patrons. Even to some first-timers, we felt right at home in the intimate dining room. To eat, we ordered Chicken Pho and orange chicken and it was really tasty! Came right out and the Pho add ons were really fresh! Good prices, good service and good food, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Staff is great. Service is fine.  We moved from Northern Virginia/DC and we have yet to find Chinese food in Charlotte that is \"traditional\". everything here is Americanized and the food even here at Persuasian was super sweet.  the hot and sour soup was good.  the sauces seemed to be loaded with molasses. a lot of over sweet flavors. the garden rolls bland. the sauces with the garden rolls  non descript. we are very picky vegetarian eaters and look for a lot of oomph and flavor in our veggies and tofu.  We do not like sweet, but more savory chinese flavors.."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and staff!!!  It's always been a great experience.  Simple - if you want good food come here!"}
{"text":"This place was not good. The fried rice was basically white rice with a little soy sauce on it. You couldn't even tell if it was fried rice or white rice. I got the Kung pao chicken and it had zero flavor. My friend got the basil Thai sauce with chicken and pork and said it was just alright. We also got the pork wontons in spicy peanut sauce. The sauce was so thick I felt like I was eating straight peanut butter.  Usually when I get Chinese I stuff myself till I am uncomfortable but the food was so bad I didn't want to eat anything after a few bites. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Ordered takeout ( 1 mile away )

Chicken really not chicken, fried skin in some red color sauce no crunch to it all

Broccoli was yellowish not green!
No flavor at all, not a hint of ginger or garlic

Stay clear of this place, it does not deserve 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place has the BEST PHO's which is a Vietnamese soup. If you haven't tried this place put it on your list to come try it out you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Clean, inviting,  and quality ingredients.   Service was also excellent.  However, in typical charlotte style...there was very little spice.  I feel like all restaurants in charlotte should have two options for each meal...bland charlotte style and authentic."}
{"text":"The only place that makes hot and sour soup and veggie egg rolls how I like it. Used to live very close but now I don't. Chi is very nice. Prices have went up after the remodel but the quality is there."}
{"text":"This place has solid pan-Asian offerings with fresh ingredients. Persuasian is now our \"go to\" Asian restaurant. They are consistently good in there execution of the food which seems to be the thing that trips up many places. The staff is attentive and friendly, the wine selection in very good and the beer selection is solid."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese for lunch and saw this place on yelp - decided to check it out and glad I did!

Really tasty food with some Vietnamese dishes as well. Had the spicy thai pork and chicken lettuce wraps and they were awesome! Steamed pork dumplings and pork fried rice also delicious, and the Szechuan dumplings were the perfect amount of spice - everything was super yummy.

Great and fast service so perfect for lunch - will def be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars
Pretty good, nothing amazing. Fast takeout. A bit over priced but if you don't mind, go for it"}
{"text":"My daughter and I happened upon this place on our Sunday walk and decided to stop in for lunch.

Opened only a few weeks ago.  Father/son team where Dad cooks in the kitchen and the son works up front.  I think they both came from Zen Fusion and now are out on their own.  

Ultra-friendly service from the son.  He spent time talking to us, finding our likes and tastes preferences and made recommendations based on that.  

As for the food...They have set the bar for Chinese food in Charlotte.  I ordered the Kung Pao vegetables and my daughter ordered lo mein noodles with shrimp, but plain otherwise.  They completely catered the dish to what she wanted.  When he saw me douce my plate in Sriracha (yes, it's on the table) he made a recommendation to next time let them know I like it spicy and his dad can use fresh chiles.  

The spring roll was made in house and the time commitment is worth the results.  Much better than places that just use frozen rolls.  I could have ordered an entire plate of spring rolls.  

My daughter tends to be a picky eater and normally I have to battle to get her to touch her food.  She almost cleared her plate.  The next day she even talked about how much she liked it.  

I can't say enough wonderful things about this place.  I'm so happy they opened and can't wait for many returns.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"My friend liked her meal! 

The garlic broccoli was so sweet I couldn't eat it. After I told the waitress, she said garlic = sweet in Asian cuisine. 


The guy at the bar was nice and offered to make me something else, but by that time my friend was done.

I thought about trying it again, but haven't gotten up the courage yet."}
{"text":"Love the Pad Thai- much different from what I'm used to! Very rich and saucy, plenty of vegetables and chicken. Last week tried the \"curry\" with chicken and was severely disappointed. It was basically a dry version of chicken Raman noodle- except WAY saltier. 
The service is awesome, so even though the curry is terrible, I'll definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent quality of food. The best Chinese around Charlotte, in my opinion. They have a very inviting and intimate bar. But the best thing about this little gem is actually the staff!"}
{"text":"I am so glad Dilworth finally has a decent Chinese spot.  This is a great mix of fresh modern but yet still typical Americanized Chinese food. Well worth an in store visit as well as take out."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Chi, Mae, and the rest of the staff make you feel like family. My wife children and I eat there at least twice a month, and continue to be amazed with the quality of the service and food.  They take great care to remember the small details and make everyone feel very special. The pho is light, yet hearty, and seems to warm your soul. The stirfry is perfectly cooked and allows the medley of the fresh ingredients to shine through. Whether you want a quick meal at the bar with lively conversation, or a sitdown meal with your family or significant other, you will not be disappointed with Persuasion."}
{"text":"I liked this place, the ambiance is clean and neat.  The waitstaff was distracted and needed a polish to etiquette in her verbal discourse with customers. 

The food was good and different in the presentation.  It was excellent!  I asked for shrimp fried rice.  The fried rice appeared toasted and the departure from my expectation was pleasing.  The shrimp and vegetables were perfectly prepared and I will return to order the meal again. 

All in all, it was a nice neighborhood lunch!"}
{"text":"This was literally the best delivery/take-out Phò I've ever eaten! They do it right!!! All the components come packaged separately. You put it all together and it is just amazing! Herbs, meat, broth, spices ....fantastic!!! Chicken lettuce wraps were equally delicious!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out last nite based on reviews. Big mistake. Singapore noodles tasted like plain noodles and cold -ugh!!essentially tasteless. Mu shoo pork same and very small portion, which ultimately was ok. No one wanted to eat the dish. Dumplings cold and hard. Broccoli was raw. No rice, again might have been not such a bad mistake based on other dishes. I've had \"bad\" Chinese food before but this takes the prize. TERRIBLE FOOD."}
{"text":"Some people have their hard food item that they can't find in Charlotte, bagels, pizza, philly cheese steak, you know the rants.  For me it's Chinese food.  Everywhere I went I was always like...... I am never eating Chinese food again!!!! (unless of course I was in China or something- insert silly face) Today I popped into Persuasian for lunch. I was greeted promptly by the server, she was super nice and attentive throughout lunch.  She told me her favorite was a couple of noodle dishes and the black bean sauce.  So I took her advice and ordered chicken with black bean sauce, you may also add three chicken wings for $1.50 to your lunch.  Can I get a hell yeah? 

My lunch was great, I tried my friend's noodle dish and it was delicious too!  I'm like, SOLD this will be my Chinese go to!

My lunch was $11 with wings and hot tea added.  I love when you find a little gem like this.

  ?????????????? (ch? le zhè dùn m?i wèi de fàn hòu, w h?n g?oxìng): \"After eating this delicious meal, I am happy\""}
{"text":"Friendly service, but the food was mediocre.  Nothing special.  Perhaps we ordered the wrong things, but there were 4 of us and none of us were satisfied.  Cute decor, I wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Stopped at this little restaurant coming back from a family trip from Orlando. What a great little find. Good was Fantastic. The service was great, and the atmosphere was really quaint. The curry Singapore noodles is a must try."}
{"text":"This was a pretty solid asian restaurant. The spring rolls and Vietnamese rolls were delish. I had the mooshu shrimp. It was so good. The service was top notch. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst fried rice I've ever had .... fried chicken was okay kind of disappointed . I definitely expected more after reading so many good reviews ... too expensive for the quality ."}
{"text":"It's been a minute and I've been here several times since my last review. I like their Wonton soup and egg rolls. Will always come to this joint for these two dishes.

They've improved their dishes but they're aight. 

I've been getting their wings and up until my last visit they were bomb. Crispy, juicy chicken. You used to get 6 regular sized wings for $6. For some reason mike other restaurants the chicken has grown. Like hormone growth looking wings. And this place.... it's now just 6 wing pieces. So not a whole wing and leg but three each of those pieces.

That sucks because I would get these joints and some donuts from joes... AND GO IN! 

No more of that. No more chasing chicken dishes. I'll just stick to the soup and egg rolls that I'm used to."}
{"text":"First time visit and I was pleased with the location, decor, cleanliness, and ambience.  Persuasion is a quaint neighborhood restaurant with a basic Chinese-american menu (fried wontons, sesame chicken, ubiquitous lunch special with white/fried rice, etc.).  My waiter, Chi, was enjoyable and engaging without becoming my buddy--she's a real asset.

I ordered the pho after I asked for a recommendation.  It was good but I prefer more umami so I amped it with hoison and siracchi sauce.  That helped bunches (I think they either don't use or lay low on palm sugar).  Either way, I'd order it again.

Nice little place but I would like to see more authentic Asian-inspired food, if only as a daily special.  I think the neighborhood is hip enough to expand our palettes!"}
{"text":"Went for take out. Wasn't expecting such a nice atmosphere. But it was great. The food didn't disappoint. It was quick and inexpensive. I will definitely come back and recommend it to my friends as well."}
{"text":"It's okay. 
They're fast (as in extremely fast) that's one reason why we order from here cause we'll get it as soon as we order our food. It always tastes like its reheated. 
Nothing we order is ever spicy enough, a child could eat it. 
So it's just okay."}
{"text":"If you like Chinese without the take out taste then this is the place for you!! I love the new space it looks great, and very Zen (pun intended).  All of the food items we got were good (Chicken lettuce wraps, pork wontons in peanut sauce, chicken kung pao, and moo shu chicken). I'm not sure anything stood out as amazing, but I will say Chinese is not my go to food. All of the food tasted fresh, not processed which is very important to us and the service was top notch. I definitely look forward to tasting some more of the menu in a future visit!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I love to start with the kung pao edamame, it is amazing!!! Also the general's tofu is great as well as the kung pao veggies as a side. Not to mention the customer service always goes above and beyond! They are so friendly and personable to everyone who walks in and make their regulars happy without fail. Highly recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Persuasian serves up solid Asian food and super service. 

I recently came to Persuasian for dinner on Saturday evening. The restaurant was quite busy and my group of 4 had to wait for about 15-20 minutes to be seated. The server felt bad that we had to wait so long and was SO nice -- the service here is top-notch. The space contains a cozy dining area and bar and has a low-key yet intimate vibe.

We started out with steamed pork dumplings and wonton soup for the table. The dumplings were delicious and the soup was piping hot and not excessively salty like other wonton soups I've had before. The entrees here are quite large, so we ordered 3 dishes to share between 4 people. The orange chicken was absolutely fabulous and I would definitely order this dish again! The Thai basil shrimp stir-fry was also delicious -- I especially loved the sauce. The ginger white wine stir-fry was solidly okay -- unfortunately the sauce wasn't very flavorful. My only other criticism was that some of the vegetables in the stir-fry dishes seemed undercooked. But overall, the food was delicious and I left feeling quite satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The couple of times I've been it has only had the fans going & no AC.  it does not make for an enjoyable experience.  The Fried Rice, spring rolls & Lo Mein have been excellent."}
{"text":"Three stars only because the crab Rangoon were amazing. The generals tso was bland and full of oil. Terrible."}
{"text":"For the lack of legit Chinese takeout restaurants in Charlotte, I have to say Persuasian really impressed me. My husband and I ordered takeout and got the Sesame chicken with broccoli. The chicken was cooked perfect, and not deep fried. The entree was loaded with broccoli and had the right about of sauce on it. On the other hand, my husband got the General's Chicken and thought it was delicious. The breading was light and didn't over power the chicken. Again, it was also served hot and fresh!

We also got an order of egg rolls and they were really delicious and a pretty good size. The food was fresh and still hot when I opened it when I got home. 

The only thing I didn't care for was their egg drop soup. It was a little too blah to me - not enough egg and more of a clearer broth. It was OK, nothing special. 

Also, if you order online via the Chow Now app, you will get 20% off your first order!"}
{"text":"If the show \"Cheers\" was ever a restaurant, it would be Persuasian. Even if you're not a regular, Joey, May, Chi and everyone else there will make you feel welcomed and makes you want to come back. 

I only been here for lunch, but they are in my weekly rotation... heavily. They have a mix of Chinese, Thai, & Vietnamese dishes on the menu. So you can be basic and get the basic Chinese dishes like fried rice, general chicken, sesame chicken, lo mein noodles etc. But don't be basic, try the other dishes they offer, since they also have Pad Thai noodles or pick a protein and get that stir fried in a Thai basil sauce. Or try out their Vietnamese pho with your pick of beef, chicken, tofu or shrimp. Honestly whatever way you go, you really can't go wrong..... hmmm, honestly, I got a confession. I've become basic myself while coming here for almost 2 years for lunch. I did try most of the lunch dishes and my go to is either beef pho on cold wet days like today. Or it's the chicken in spicy garlic sauce. I need to take off these uggs, trash my Starbucks, and throw down my scarf. The next time I come here, I will switch it up and try something new. So if you're in the dilworth/south end area stop by Persuasian for the food and stay for the conversation. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Get the chicken pho to go. Soup and fresh stuff. Great staff and neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"\"And we left with the feeling of having dinner in the warmth of someone's house.\"  

The restaurant situated amidst the neighborhood of Park Road ain't much of a fancy or fine fine restaurant. Stepping inside you always get the feeling of being inside someone's house - the restaurant is adorned with bookshelves and some subtle ornery show pieces. It's just a warm feeling to be in such an ambience. The only downside being the tables are small and so close together that a gentle around can end up in looking directly into someone else's face. Surprisingly enough the restaurant also accommodates a bar. 
The menu is as any other Asian restaurant - pho, lo mien and rice dishes nevertheless it has a section where you can customize your sauce and protein. There were only two staffs, one waiting tables and one at the bar. We ordered some custom sauces and rice and it didn't long for our food to reach us. The taste of the sauces is just something your tongues would please. The dishes are not to oily or watery. The quantity is apt and the not so expensive with a dinner for two with appetizers mind end up with 25-30$. If you are around Charlotte, you should definitely check out this place for the warmth of the good food."}
{"text":"Very new to Pho so I don't have anything to compare it to but I was at this restaurant twice this week. Yes! I like it a lot. The seaweed salad, well I could eat some all day. I like the healthy and light flavor of the pho. I have yet to try many other dishes but so far so good. The service is really good. Always attentive and polite. I will be going again probably very soon."}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant I visited coming here and now it has become my de-facto place for weekends. They serve the most amazing Singaporean noodles, my personal favorite.

More than food, drinks, you will fall in love with the people there, Chi, May, Jackie and Hector. They all are so welcoming, they are bound to become your friends. 

If you are in Charlotte, you have to visit this place once and you will keep coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Fantastically renovated spot with a new name and owner. Great for take out or dine in. Probably the best Chinese food in a casual, authentic atmosphere. If you live nearby, stop in or grab take out on your way home. You won't be disappointed with the food or service. The Chef in the kitchen knows what he is doing."}
{"text":"We decided to go out to eat after our air conditioner failed. To kill time waiting for the tech, we wanted to try a new place. We'd driven by a few times and honestly didn't know this place existed, so this one is all Yelp.

We arrived to find the place quiet. It is tastefully decorated for the most part, with a nice bookshelf and stylish touches, though they apparently didn't prime before painting. Atmosphere: OK.

We ordered off of their mercifully compact menu. It's straightforward and that is a 180 from most places that serve this kind of food. My wife ordered the moo shu pork and I had the General's spicy chicken. She said that the pork was among the best she's had and I found the chicken to be flavorful with a spicy note that comes in late. Both dishes were simple, but well-prepared, properly seasoned and very tasty.The food was hot, temperature-wise, but not so hot that it could not be eaten immediately, which is also refreshing.

It seems to be a place with a simple recipe: quality food, quick and simple with none of the sometimes-bizarre ethnic trappings. Service was very friendly and communicative. Will go here again for sit-down Chinese food. I want to try something off their hibachi."}
{"text":"From reading prior reviews I wish I tried dining in! Maybe my experience would have been different but unfortunately I opted for take out due to a long night of work. I ordered the general tso chicken entree and my fiancée ordered the sesame chicken entree. First thing I noticed was very little sauce to where the chicken basically looked like chicken tender bites. I've worked as a chef for over ten years and will always give places a try regardless of reviews. I just want to help someone out before they deal with the frustration my fiancée and I dealt with. The chicken was rock hard and and hard one of the most bizarre textures I've tasted. You can tell it was real chicken which is a plus but it tasted like they either par cook a bunch of chicken prior to the shift, cook a bunch and put them under heat lamps or they let it sit in the fryer for much longer then it should. I tried 3 bites and called it quits. My fiancée was a bit more hard headed and tried picking at hers which caused her to be violently sick the next two days having to call out of work. She called for a refund and the lady who answers the phone became a bodyguard when my fiancée asked for a refund. My fiancée was in tears after the lady hung up on her. At this point I am blown away that someone who runs a restaurant would let this happen because reputation/word of mouth is everything in a business. I called back and the lady proceeded to hang up on me a few times in a row. Toss in her telling me \"it's not her problem\" \"she doesn't have to do anything since we signed the credit card receipt\". After yet another call she handed the phone to the manager who was more then kind and immediately handled the situation offering a full refund. It's just disappointing because I try to give the benefit of the doubt and would have tried it again because the atmosphere inside is very homey but not at this point. It even upset me enough to make a Yelp account and post this. I hope no one else has to feel this way. It will always blow my mind why people who dislike people work in customer service. It only takes one bad employee who has no relation to the food to ruin it for someone."}
{"text":"Good place to get carry out or dine in. Better that Beijing on South Blvd for sure.  Descent food. You can find pho and your version of quick high scale Chinese. 
Friendly staff, good food, very small."}
{"text":"In my ongoing quest to find fantastic Chinese food in Charlotte, I thought I'd try this out after searching around on Yelp. 

I went for the lunch specials list and decided it's pretty difficult to screw up cashew chicken. It came with an egg roll and I opted for the brown rice. 

Egg roll: I got this to-go, so the egg roll was kinda soft and not crunchy by the time I got back to the office. I wasn't surprised, so not a problem. The container of duck sauce that came with it was quite tasty -- unfortunately the best flavor of the box it all came in. The egg roll itself had minimal flavor. Of course, it was hidden by the tasty sauce... 

Brown Rice: Is this stuff fried? I'm not quite sure why there looked to be tiny pieces of egg in it. It also didn't seem to be very brown. But, rice is rice and worked well with the food. 

Cashew Chicken: I wasn't quite sure why it looked so orange. Maybe that chicken had been soaking in the sauce for a while? But if that was the case, it should have had more flavor. There's a good variety of veggies and the portion of cashew chicken was plenty, but the flavor was missing. There was also a good layer of oil on top of the sauce at the bottom of the container my food was swimming in. Standard amount of broccoli. A few large mushroom halves. A few big chunks of green pepper. A handful of cabbage. A great amount of tender, thinly sliced chicken. How can such a combination be so devoid of flavor though? For a moment, I felt like everything was steamed and I was eating healthy... and then I saw the caoting of oil molesting the rest of the sauce. 

Fortune cookie: Crunchy. With a disappointing fortune: \"Focus in on the color yellow tomorrow for good luck!\" I can hardly wait until I have to pee in the morning!

Look, I've had worse, but I've had a lot better, too. I ate it, but am not in a rush to go back. If you don't mind bland, the ingredients all tasted fresh and were cooked right. If I were to go back, I might dump that egg roll sauce on top of it."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The lettuce wraps are amazing and the Pad Thai is to die for. Wonderfully personable service. Will definitely be revisiting this restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pad thai and the pork spring rolls. The pad thai was tasty. It had a lot of chicken in it and whole peanuts (instead of crushed). It wasn't spicy, which is fine for me, but if you want some heat you need to request it. One order was enough for two adults. It had broccoli in it, which is different. $10 is a good price and it was worth it. They are quick with their take out. I waited less than 10 minutes. 

As for the pork rolls, they weren't really worth it. $5 for two where other places give you four spring rolls for the same price. I get it they have meat in them, but they weren't that great. Next time I'll just get the veggie spring rolls. Online ordering was easy. It's pretty nice inside as well, even though the outside of the building is unassuming. Yelp asked if the place was romantic. I answered yes because it is cozy and the servers seem nice. It could definitely be a nice first date spot. 

I'm giving it 5 stars even though I didn't enjoy the pork rolls. First time ordering always comes with the caveat that you might not like what you order. That's on me, not the restaurant."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a go to Asian to go spot and this is mine.  They have a good variety of all Asian foods to it fills whatever you are in the mode for.  It is very affordable and always a crowd pleaser.  My favorites are the moo shu or the thai basil shrimp."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite new places to get take out. The food tastes...lighter than other Chinese restaurants. I don't know how to explain it or even if there is a true difference. I have to believe there is though because it tastes different.
I have always been satisfied by the price and the portions.
They also have a really friendly staff and don't seem to have \"strangers\" sitting at the bar area. What I mean to say is, if you decide to eat in and dine at the bar, you will probably find yourself engaged in conversation with the staff and other patrons. I've never tried, it's just my impression."}
{"text":"I was kind of wary of trying pho here because I've only ever had it at Vietnamese joints that are basically dedicated to pho. But BOY was I pleasantly surprised! There are no fancy options - only pho, straight up. The bowl comes with soup and rice noodles with flank steak and sliced meatballs. You can customize by asking for one or the other protein option, but the regular order comes with both. My favorite part is the broth. It's not heavily spiced. Just a nice, clean broth that's punching with strong flavor. 

Of course the regular accoutrements come with (sprouts, basil, jalapeno, etc.).

I enjoy it when I'm eating it. I think about it when I'm not. SO GOOD!

The service here is solid every time. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Great food - pho is amazing. They have Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese to choose from. Good drink prices too. Tucked away! I wish I had known about this neighborhood place the last 5 years I've lived here! It's a new go-to."}
{"text":"Best house Lo mein I've had since I've moved down here from New York. Fresh and delicious! My go to Chinese place!"}
{"text":"A solid neighborhood place.  The decorations are a bit odd but the service was top notch and our food was quite good (won ton soup, garlic broccoli, generals chicken).  We will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the sesame chicken (with fried rice) and steamed pork dumplings. All were just okay. Not much flavor. The sesame chicken had hardly any sauce so it was very dry the next day."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place after finding it here on Yelp. Unfortunately, we weren't too impressed. Craving some Chinese, we ordered pickup and eagerly drove over. Once we arrived, the wait was only a few minutes. The place wasn't packed for a Friday night, but it's small and intimate with a very nice atmosphere. Super excited for our meal, we drove 5 minutes home and began to chow down. The soups were good, but the chicken (sesame chicken, spicy General Tso's) was mushy and what disappointed me the most was the fried rice. It had absolutely no flavor :( 

I wanted to badly to like this place! Super bummed but I don't think we'll be coming back. Baoding is still #1 for us!"}
{"text":"I am am so glad that this place exists. I like the big brother restaurant Zen Asian Fusion too. That is an event. This is casual dining. I would love it if they increased their gluten free options and had a gluten free desert. Still the food is warm and good. Hardly ever had to wait to be seated and the prices are modest. The environment is comfortably informal though not really cushy. Lastly they let you browse and read the books in their decorative bookshelves. Can't take them home though. Still a good conversation starter to see which ones you know."}
{"text":"The whole family loves this place. The atmosphere, the food, the service and the owner. Shrimp and scallops pho, pad Thai and any dishes with the fresh mixed veggies is a sure thing. Best crab Rangoon we've ever had."}
{"text":"Chi Zhang is the owner of Persuasion but you don't need me to tell you that because he will most likely introduce himself as you get settled at your table. 

Persuasion has some of the best customer service of any restaurant I've ever been to. My boyfriend and I go at least once a week and since day 1 Chi and May made it a priority to know our names and get to know our likes and dislikes.

A few of my favorite dishes are the beef and/or tofu in spicy garlic sauce, and the chicken in ginger white wine sauce. The eggrolls are delicious! I also had the Pho one day and it was on par with any pho I've had at any Vietnamese restaurant in the area.

We love Persuasion and will continue to frequent there as guests!"}
{"text":"I may have found my go-to Asian restaurant. I sat at the bar, ordered a glass of wine and a take out order. I like that the house wines are good and every one is priced the same - makes it easy. I've been to many Asian restaurants that serve really bad wine. I felt very welcome by the staff.
My to-go order was Sa Cha Chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The Sa Cha Chicken had lots of vegetables, peanuts and was lightly sauced - very flavorful.
I will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Hi.  I give 3.5, but don't know how! Nice lunch-  we tried steamed dumplings. Tasty but when I asked if they were homemade, the wait person said. \" no \"... One of my pet peeves since we can all buy dumplings these days from Costco, HT, Trader Joe's etc. My friend and I shared shrimp with garlic sauce... Nice flavor overall, but shrimp had that frozen/ peel- n-eat taste and texture... Watery and bland, rather than rich and chewy.  This shrimp problem is way to common in our Queen City.   We also shared chicken with black bean sauce . Sauce was tangy and good - broccoli  was fresh and crunchy. The chicken was thinly sliced but texture/ taste not great. 

I like good chicken such as Ashley Farms' so maybe this is just typical chicken from mass- produced factory. I haven't bought a Purdue type product in years. Our taste buds adapt. 

Well I hope I will like this more in future! I'll try again... Brown rice was good...  So was  egg roll. Cute looking place with books on shelves!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from then twice now and have yet to be impressed. It takes no better than cheap food court Chinese food, but with the prices of a fancier restaurant. We ordered steamed dumplings, egg rolls, beef chow fun, and sesame chicken. The dumplings and egg rolls were decent. They weren't bad but they weren't anything special. The sesame chicken was just full of breading and dry chicken in the middle. I don't even remember seeing any sesame seeds to be honest. The beef chow fun was dry and the noodles were a lot thinner than they typically are in that dish. Overall, I was not impressed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Just went for first time. Planning to go to Zen (which we love) but thought of trying something new and closer.  So glad we did and imagine our surprise to find this is from the same owner as Zen!  Same good food (just the Asian side of menu) and great service in a smaller and more casual atmosphere.  Happy to have in neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. They are so nice. Like I just can even explain to you how nice everyone is there. You just have to go to understand. 

The food usually is amazing.  I use to always get the scallop Pad Thai but seems like they switched up their menu and now they offer a combo of shrimp and scallops and the pad Thai itself didnt seem to be the same quality as the past. I also enjoy their crab Rangoons.  Their General Chicken is still great  and it's still one of the best Asian places in the area."}
{"text":"This just became my go-to spot for Asian food in Charlotte. The service was impeccable! Staff were friendly and our food came out quickly. 

We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and steamed pork dumplings to start. The dumplings were okay; the sauce and filling both could have been more flavorful. The lettuce wraps shone in comparison though. It was a sizable and very flavorful appetizer. 

For an entrée I ordered the vegetarian spicy Kung Pao with tofu. It was a little spicy, perfect for my taste. There were lots of vegetables and it was a generous serving.

Overall, my husband and I were very pleased! our bill was less than $40, including the tip, which is rare for us. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants around. Would give it 5 stars but they do not deliver and it is a little pricey. Granted each time I come it is for dinner.

Starter always has to be the Crab Rangoon which is amazing! Homemade andcrispy but not burnt with plenty of crab.  So delicious.  I would also suggest the pork dumplings as well.

For entrees I go with the spicy generals chicken.  Highly recommend this dish because it is always crispy on the outside and not \"soggy\" like you will find sometimes.

My girlfriend always gets the pad Thai which is also some of the best you will find in Charlotte. I always have to get a few bites of her dish :)

Looking for great service and great Chinese food then look no more."}
{"text":"First time visiting for dinner on Sunday.  Very good chicken wings, have a lite Chinese flavoring that permeates to the meat with a crispy outside.  Awesome veggy rolls too.  Main course we tried the chicken, veggie saute with fried rice, the sauce was tasty and veggies crisp and fresh.  The fried rice was litely flavored- not heavily oily or filled with peas and carrots,  actually a nice compliment to the chicken and veggies.  The other dish was beef and broccoli in a spicy black bean sauce, and spicy it was!! The broccoli was crisp and fresh and sauce was nicely captured in the veggies- not soupy or overly cloing the flavor of the meat and veggies.  We had this served with brown rice which was very well cooked, again the flavor was allowed to peak through.  Very nice dinner all around, good food, nice cozy atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right near work so we brought home dinner the other night and it was delicious. Kung pao chicken and general tso's chicken both spicy and fantastic.  Soups are great, and the steamed dumplings are really yummy.  Prices are reasonable and worth it.  They have a great mix of options to choose from.  A hidden gem."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here from postmates and it's by far the worst Chinese takeout I've ever had. Chicken was splintery and the eggs rolls were wet and soggy. The general chicken tasted just like the orange chicken and the rice was flavorless. Basically inedible if you like good food."}
{"text":"Even though this place is in my neighborhood, I do not frequent it much which I need to change.

The staff is friendly and helpful and the food is great.  The menu consists of various asian dishes including Chinese, Vietnamese Pho, Hibachi and more.

In my visits here, I've had basil chicken and garlic chicken and both were spot on. My only complaint is when you ask for \"Make Me Cry\" spicy, you hope that it will. But as with most Chinese places I was disappointed with the spice level.  

But overall this is a great place. Friendly staff, affordable prices, and good quality food."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on here but we left this time pretty disappointed. Last time we were there, food was ok but not as good as in the past. Thought I would give it another chance since we have been eating from here for years. I knew as soon as my \"go to\" dish hit the table that it looked different. Nothing like it has tasted before-dry and way spicer than before. Wait staff was kind enough to let me order something else (after I was told that I should expect it to be a little spicy--I'm aware--I've been eating the same thing for a while). Second dish was basic pad thai because I figured it was an americanized version anyway and you couldn't screw that up. It was very boring and dry and the broccoli was way undercooked. The waitperson did tell me there was a new chef in the back. Maybe that's it---I hope they figure it out soon. The fried jalapeños were delish and the spring roll was good as well. I would hate for Persuasian to lose its edge in this market on this side of town. Based on other conversations I've had over the past couple of days, our experience is not unique. Hope they are not circling the drain! Here's to hoping yours is better."}
{"text":"One of the better chinese/asian food restaurants in Charlotte, and yes they serve alcohol!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at this place. Great take out service. When you walk in, there is always someone sitting at the bar having a very familiar conversation with the bartender or the owner. Food? Awesome, I'm hooked on the Pho. The menu says beef only, but just ask for chicken, if you want. The salad mix is to die for. This is the Cheers of Dilworth. I really love this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped  for lunch after business trip to Charlotte.
The food was great, very fresh vegetables. Try the chilled cucumber and summer rolls. Service and ambiance made it a great place. We will be back on next trip."}
{"text":"This is a cute quaint place to go for lunch or dinner.

I went for a work meeting and was highly impressed.  

The service was incredible.  Waters were brought out promptly.  I was told to get the spicy edamame and it was delicious.  I love when restaurants take a twist on a normal appetizer and add a little kick to it.

I ordered the basil chicken with no rice and extra veggies.  My food was wonderful and came out super fast.  The portions were very generous.  The flavors were really good.

At the end of the lunch, our check was brought out with fortune cookies.  This is always a nice touch.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"New to the neighb so we decided to try it for take out. As we waited for our food we had a glass of sake and chatted with the owner, Chi. We have tried the shrimp fried rice and pork curry noodles and were blown away by both the flavor and quality! Fresh and not greasy!"}
{"text":"The food was on point, the people couldn't have been friendlier, the atmosphere couldn't have been more relaxing. We got the pork spring rolls and hibachi and we made a great choice. I would definatley recommend this to a friend , no doubt about it. Must give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Slam Dunk (and you would never know it) - great food, customer service, and prices."}
{"text":"A decent restaurant that serves Americanized Asian fusion food.   The Thai Basil sauce used in the stir fry dish was dark, but not really salty. The Pho Noodle needs a better soup base ingredients to boost the flavor. This place has some unique decorations from the owner's persona collection. They have a good collection of red wines."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and quaint. The perfect place to dine with a loved one, kids or solo. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. The food is consistently fresh and good. Best of all, its a valued restaurant. I never feel that I over paid for my dining experience."}
{"text":"Out of towner and used an app to search asian nearby restaurants... walked in, had great service right off the bat. Quick order to table service, unbelievable crab rangoons and egg rolls. Best lo mein noodles I have ever had! The servers work real hard and were quick on refills and attentive to the table. Place has a really nice feel to it inside, very comforting and quaint."}
{"text":"My favorite Asian place in Charlotte. Fresh vegetables in food, quality of the meat is good, and friendly service. Like the ambience as well. Only downer: no outside seating."}
{"text":"I've dined in or order from Persuasian a few times. I really like it. I've had take out a couple times. Both occasions I went with an assortment of appetizers. I enjoyed the wontons, the pork dumplings, the chicken wings and the hot and sour soup. One cold afternoon, I stopped in and took a seat at the bar, which was crowded. Ordered their Pho. It hit the spot and filled me up. Decent selection of beers. Convenient and friendly."}
{"text":"Growing up eating pho for most of my life I was weary of trying it here. To my surprise it was excellent! I love the pho! I've eaten here many times and tried something new each time.  The black bean sauce is great. I like it with beef or shrimp personally. And the chef is kind as to leave out the bell peppers for me and put in extra broccoli. The bar has an excellent selection of wines. I enjoy both red and white and at $6-7 a glass, you can't beat that. The service is great, the price won't hurt your wallet, the atmosphere is relaxed and casual and I haven't had anything on the menu that I don't like. This is definitely a place to try. This is my new favorite spot to go to."}
{"text":"I live a mile away and can't believe it took me a year to try this place.

Persuasian an intimate, warm restaurant with a chill ambience. I sat at the bar and per the bartender's suggestion ordered the sautéed Thai Basil Shrimp. It was excellent with just enough of a kick of spicy from the chile that was included in prep. 

For dessert, the fried cheesecake is awesome  and unique, served with French vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It's a big helping - good for sweet tooths like me or to split between two people.

The clientele is what sets this place apart though. I came in at 8:30 on a Sunday night and there were regulars sitting at the bar, eating and drinking. It wasn't long until I was looped into conversations and felt like a regular myself. I met nearly all the staff on hand as well as all the patrons. Never have I felt more welcomed in a restaurant. I will be back - soon."}
{"text":"Okay, I don't even know where to start. Let's do this:

The food: I haven't left here unhappy once. Like, ever. 

The lettuce wraps with chicken? Delish. 

Vegetable fried rice? Incredibly solid and even better with soy sauce. I don't even like peas and I love their rice. On the reheat? Amazing. 

Singapore Curry Noodles? Hold their flavor well without being overpowering. 

Spicy General's Chicken? Best I've had in forever.

The Szechuan dumplings are always yummy. My cousin loves the steamed ones and they're good, but the fried ones are where it's at for me!

My favorite thing, though? They have created a Kung Pao edamame. I literally just ate it for dinner. The spice is perfect! 

The service: Even though the food is phenomenal, the service is still the best part of the experience by far. Chi, May and the rest of their staff will give up an experience you'll never forget. They're attentive, quick and absolutely hilarious. And they'll remember you the next time you come back. And the time after that, too.

Don't go anywhere else if you're in the area. You're doing yourself a disservice. You're not going to do better than Persuasian.

**If you really want to have some fun, try the spicy chilled cucumbers! If it sounds crazy, just trust me.**"}
{"text":"I'm a simple person, and simple things make me happy - such as... ordering in, sinking in to my couch, and binge watching a good show. For the longest time I've been in search of the perfect take out Chinese food, and I think I've finally found it friends!
Recently, we ordered in from Persuasion, and it absolutely hit the spot.
We got the summer rolls, lo mein noodles, a stir fry dish in garlic sauce, and also the lettuce wraps with shrimp.
The noodles were A+, the summer rolls and lettuce wraps were an A,
and the stir fry in garlic cause a B+. The sauce in my opinion, was a little on the blander side, which made it perfect for the kid, but I'll probably try a different one next time.
If you're still in search for a good casual asian restaurant, check them out. even if you've already found your favorite spot, persuasion is worth trying out."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. Where to start?

A perfect example of why you should be checking out a neighborhood restaurant. Once inside you'll find a very nice set-up. A perfectly sized bar with plenty of room to eat & drink.  We like to do that and make it a tapas-style event. On the floor the tables are nicely spaced with plenty of room to enjoy your meal and the overall decor is really inviting; it has a little bit of library or bookstore feel - in a good way! 

The menu is extensive and by now we've tried almost everything and each & every dish is tasty. You \"could\" skip the main courses and eat all night from the appetizer list and be happy (and full!).  I love the fried jalapenos. Try the Pho at lunch or the salt & pepper shrimp as an evening appetizer with a glass of cold chardonnay.  The wine and beer list is also wide-ranging and well priced. 

The staff are amazing. You will feel so welcome.

There is a link with the Zen Fusion restaurant and Peruasian has got the same magical appeal that will make you come back again and again. They've balanced great food, ambiance and customer service."}
{"text":"We're on the hunt for the best take out Chinese food that Charlotte has to offer. Now, I know that typically the \"best\" stuff comes from the hole in the wall type establishment, but we have broadened our horizons and trying to find \"the one.\" 

Persuasian is not \"the one\" for us though. An order of General Tsao Chicken and Tofu Vegetable with Fried Rice and a Spring Roll just wasn't what we were expecting. I'm not sure how to explain it, but nothing seemed right about our orders. The Spring Rolls were the best part IMO. They had a super crunchy texture and they packed with veggies. 

I think we will be taking our tour of take-out around the city before we come back to Persuasian.

*Nothing was wrong with the food, it's just nothing stood out. Nothing said, THIS IS THE PLACE. Sometimes the General Tsao packs a punch and it should, but it was just chicken with sauce. The Tofu was a little on the slimy side."}
{"text":"So, seeing the great reviews on Persuasian, and knowing the location is only a few minutes away, I was so excited to check it out. After two recent visits I wasn't as impressed as others, sorry. First visit was an early dinner so I just had the shrimp fried rice. Sadly, nothing to run back for. The rice was good, veggies okay, but I felt the shrimp was probabaly frozen. I wanted to give them another shot for an entree so went this past Thursday and ordered the vegetable egg roll, wonton soup and chicken with mixed veggies. The egg roll, one of the most bland egg rolls I have ever had. It was cabbage only with an overwhelming flavor of pepper and served with an absolutely extreme mustard sauce, ugh. Spit it out and passed on that one. The wonton soup had a good broth, however I felt it needed a little more flavor. And, the wontons, there was no pork inside, just raw wontons, another ugh! The chicken and veggies was good, finally a Chinese restaurant that serves fresh chicken. The veggies were good, but the brown sauce was a little greasy, and the bottom of my plate reflected that. Overall, things were good, but I did have higher hopes and wished  for a great place in Dilworth as we are very limited now."}
{"text":"Cannot believe my husband and I have lived in Dilworth for 4 years and NOT checked this place out. The food was quick, fresh and amazing. Love that you can pick your meat, pick your sauce and then BAM out comes a delish dinner. Their beer selection does not disappoint either."}
{"text":"We came here earlier tonight, Christmas Eve, as Persuasian was one of the few restaurants open and we've been meaning to come anyways. There were only a few tables open when we walked in but, luckily, we did not have to wait at 8:30p. I wasn't really a fan of our server, she wasn't as pleasant as I would have liked (I guess I'm excusing it, who wants to work on Christmas Eve) and she wasn't very attentive throughout our time there. In fact, another server had to take over the service for her, our actual server only came to pick up the bill. The other server was very nice and attentive. 

We ordered a bottle of pear sake, the chicken lettuce wraps, the Singaporean curry noodles, and a thai basil chicken entree. Our original server forgot to grab our sake bottle, I had to wave down the nice Asain server and have her grab it. The lettuce wraps came out quick and everything was fresh. The chicken itself had a good basic flavor but was kind of bland though, needed some spice and salt. Sadly this carried into the entrees as well. The Singaporean curry noodles we're my favorite but it needed more curry flavor and more spice. The thai basil chicken was too sweet for me. Total came to about $43, not too bad given the amount ordered. I did appreciate the freshness of the ingredients, props. Everything had a great crunch, including the veggies. 

All in all, it was a good meal. Kitchen staff, up the umphf in your dishes. Don't be afraid of seasoning!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a find.  I knew this restaurant opened recently in Dilworth/Sedgefield but I hadn't tried it I until yesterday.  I went in with no expectations and immediately loved the decor.  There's a nice wine bar, pretty tables and the owner, Chi (sp?) , was very nice and helpful,

The food was delicious..it was clean and fresh , not heavy and stir fry items were cooked in high quality oil.  I started with the sesame cold noodle, one of my favorites and theirs didn't disappoint.  I got several other dishes (I am vegan and there was plenty to choose from).  Each item I ordered was fantastic 

I ordered ours to go but after seeing the nice ambience I made a mental note to eat inside next time.  I never do this but the food was so good, I called the owner to tell him how much we enjoyed it.

My only regret is that I didn't try it sooner.  This is now among my list of top, local restaurants within walking distance of my neighborhood.

My recommendation is the next time you are in the mood for Asian food, give Persuasian a try.  You will not be disappointed!'"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place..emphasis on little. Note that the interior is pretty small, so at peak times I'd expect a wait--be open to sitting at the bar! The decor is whimsical with a bookcase and quirky little odds and ends to fill it. 

You cannot beat the lunch menu. For less than $10 you get an entree, egg roll and can add a soup or salad. Price is absolutely awesome and it's a big portion of food. I had leftovers! I love that with the sauteed entrees you have multiple choices in terms of both protein and the sauce it is cooked in. I recommend the white wine and ginger sauce if you're looking for something lighter. Food was fresh, tasty and HOT. Great quality.

They do have a full bar and a separate dinner menu to select from. If you're looking for sit-down Chinese food, make sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"I eat here often, mostly takeout, but I have never been disappointed in any meal that I have had from here. The vegetables are always fresh and the dishes are always plentiful and filling. I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Horrible taste
Fried rice looked like rice with some stale rice mixed 
I wonder why people.dont use veggies finely.chopped in fried rice,  soy sauce n vinegar 
General.chicken texture was good but tasteless"}
{"text":"Went to Persuasian last night and absolutely loved it. It's a small quaint place with maybe 15 tables in the restaurant. The decor is really warm and welcoming and it has a full bar in the corner which surprised me. When I arrived I was immediately seated and served by a very friendly waiter. It was quite obvious that the majority of the patrons were local neighborhood residents. The bartender would immediately greet regular patrons by name and it seemed like they were continuing conversations from their previous visits.

The food was was great! We ordered the crab rangoon and each had the pho (veggie and beef). It was incredible. I definitely plan to come back and trying other items on the menu."}
