{"text":"My favorite coffee place here in Glendale. Come here all the time when I can. They are super friendly and the coffee is amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while waiting in the area. Great little place had Cuban Coffee great atmosphere and staff 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, love the atmosphere and music and the Italian accents  cannot go wrong with the coffee and warmth here!"}
{"text":"Absolute loved this place! I arrived early on a Sunday, and it was pretty quiet BUT a couple of hours after the place lit up! The atmosphere got full of energy! Definitely a great place to relax, study and get some great coffee. I am a big black peach tea junkie- and I always try every coffee's shop tea and latte. Although this place did not have peach flavoring, I decided to try something else. I just tried their green tea, and to my surprise, it did not need any peach flavoring to make it taste how I like it! I am definitely coming back. I guess my only recommendation would be easily accessible outlets.  But other than that- it definitely is a must. The staff was super friendly, and I felt comfortable making \"special\" requests. ?"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after school, and it is a super nice and relaxed coffeehouse. The coffee here is great and so is the customer service! I like they have a live music set which makes it unique then your typical coffee shop. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is FABULOUS!! Most creative and amazing tasting coffees anywhere. They also have live music several nights a week and an open mic night. And you can eat great food and super reasonable (surprisingly so) prices.   I highly recommend this location for meet ups, remote working (free WiFi), and also study groups.   Try the house coffee special (I recommend iced) iced latte with desert pear, hisbiscus and spicy mango. I can't believe it was a great coffee drink!  It's close to Glendale Community College and GCU."}
{"text":"Super nice spot to come and do some work and relax... it took a veryyyyyyyy long time to get my soup so I probably won't get that again. However the Chai tea latte was everything"}
{"text":"I love this place. Is a local business with a extreme care of what they do. They use a exactly measure for every coffee's ingredient, for everything. Very meticulous work they got. Also they are very kind with the customers. I am not exaggerating."}
{"text":"CUTE SHOP. The owners are super nice! It's open and spacious. Got a ton of work done. Definitely coming back. It's got that homey coffee shop vibe that feels like a Central Perk"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, fun. Coffee on point, had the cold brew. Panini? Yes, please.  Sun Dried Tomato Pesto Panini nice and crispy with perfectly melted cheese. Nice menu options. Quaint place to stop to relax and forget there's traffic outside. Live music too."}
{"text":"What a special find in the heart of Glendale. I've been here twice and have liked what I've seen and experienced both times. Great local spot, clean, friendly and not crazy loud. I've had just a latte both times but they were well made with the perfect ratios to taste amazing. They also have music in the evening, although I haven't been there to experience it. Either way, I'm impressed with the service and overall appearance of the Coffee Club. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"The Turkey panini is so good! Cute shop! I love that places like this are springing up on the west side of town. Definitely cheaper than those other coffee places ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, cool vibe and super nice owner. Highly recommend! Tried the Carmel macchiato and it was delish."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, cozy atmosphere, and wonderful service. Can't complain. Some of the best coffee I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Trying this place out for the first time and I have to say, this is my favorite coffee spot on the west side so far. Clean modern design inside, delicious coffee, delicious food, nice staff, and moderately priced! WiFi, live music, etc. I do wish they had outlets/power to the tables, but they are limited to a few wall spot sitting areas. Overall, I would recommend this place, and will be coming here again and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Such a cute little coffee shop! Great coffee, I loved the atmosphere of it. I would definitely come back.   Side note: The staff seemed a little rude but maybe it was because she was completely alone and started to get overwhelmed, maybe? I could tell she was growing impatient with me ordering, it was just my first time there though."}
{"text":"I have discovered my new go-to spot! I ordered the smoked turkey and pesto panini and it had the perfect balance of ingredients. It wasn't overloaded/messy which made every bite enjoyable. The iced green tea was also refreshing. The customer service and inviting atmosphere made the meal even more pleasant. I'm glad this place is so close to my work (although I know my bank account may not always agree!). Stop by for a bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The coffee is FANTASTIC and the Belgian waffle is even better! There is live music on the weekends, and I don't know why I haven't been here before. I am definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great space, friendly owner and WiFi.  Turkey Panini is fresh and delicious.  Very great tasting coffee as well.  LIVE music and open Mic.  This place is great for relaxing, doing homework with a nice musical edge to it.  So glad I found it."}
{"text":"What a neat find. Was just looking for a place to get WiFi and have tea, but this place is awesome. Cool vibe and great iced tea. Fast WiFi too. I'll be back any time  in the area."}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee at a great price! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. Love the way they remodeled the space from the business it was before!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a small hole in the wall gem with friendly owners. First time here ordered a Chai Latte and Strawberry Smoothie, both were very good. Prices are very reasonable. The atmosphere is welcoming. Plus, live music is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Good coffee and simple but yummy sandwiches. This is a lovely place to stop in and do some studying or just to have a mellow peaceful moment with a delicious cup of coffee. The owner is also very sweet and attentive. Stop in and treat yourself!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a whim and because I'm exhausted with Starbucks...Very pleasantly surprised to find this place.  The atmosphere is nice and quiet, though the music is a little loud for me if I was trying to study. That being said, it's a coffee shop, not a library. I think they did a good job using the space with several larger tables and a couple high tops. It's a nice place to have a conversation and pass some time.  Coffee is good. I got a caramel macchiato and it was perfect. It wasn't too sweet and not so piping hot when I first got it that I couldn't take a nice sip. Prices are reasonable. They're a little cheaper than Starbucks for good quality and the added benefit of supporting a small business in the community.   I also got food; the Spicy European panini. First, it wasn't spicy unless you think mustard is spicy. But it did have a nice tang from the peppercinis and good flavor without being overpowering. I'd get it again.  Anyway, the service is nice and friendly. Very polite people and patient as I'm pretty indecisive. They gave me time to make a selection.   I'll be coming back with some of my friends.  Also, as I'm writing this, they're about to have live music, so I'll update after I see this happen.  UPDATE: live music is good. Musicians are varying in skill level, but pretty good sets."}
{"text":"Best tasting coffee I've had in awhile, and for a great price! The atmosphere of this place was really nice, and the customer service was fantastic. Saw that they had live music as well which is pretty neat. I had a panini paired with a side salad along with their specialty coffee, so yummy !! I would highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I am sooo glad that finally we have a good coffe place in Glendale !!!! I'm so tired of Starbucks! The coffee taste so good, love the customer service! I ordered a coffe latte and I'm in love with the taste. And the panini is sooo delicious."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop! Great place to read or just hang out and have a conversation. The owner was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has awesome coffee and customer service, I always am on the hunt for new coffee shops and this is defiantly a great find !"}
{"text":"I was driving down 51st when I saw Coffee Club, I was so excited to try a new coffee shop. And I will say, I have high expectations when it comes to coffee shops! And I'm happy to say that Coffee Club fulfilled all my hopes and dreams! Great coffee, nice music selection, and great service as well! Its a great place to meet a friend or to study! I'll definitely be returning! :D"}
{"text":"Spent a few hours here working and meeting with a co-worker. Such a great environment. The woman working was awesome and had a hometown feel. This is definitely a place to work/meet. They have the place set up for live music so I know I have to be back for a show sometime. I got a mocha and a roasted chicken panini. Bomb!! My buddy got a macchiato and almost cried it was so good. He even got a cold brew for the ride home. Give this spot a shot and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really friendly service. Cool vibe when you walk in. Modern design. The owners are very positive and helpful when deciding what you want to get"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Amazing music!!  Love the acoustics. Will be back for sure. Classics, and Pink Floyd!"}
{"text":"Cute place to study, free WiFi! Lots of table space and lots of options. Only one vegan option that I know of is the vegetable soup (which is less vegetable and more ramen but still delightful) I ordered a red eye for my coffee. They also offer board games for you to borrow."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while since I don't live too far & finally tried it today! It was a quiet Saturday morning & I had the New York panini with turkey & chips coupled with a medium mocha. The panini was delicious & the mocha was beautifully made (and also yummy). Next time I visit, I will try the Belgian waffles for sure.  The atmosphere here is good for meetings, catching up, working, and just relaxing. The music was soothing and the place was cozy. There's also free wifi so I'd definitely come back here to bring my laptop & do some work. The prices are reasonable and there's shared parking in the complex."}

{"text":"A great little coffee shop just starting out. Very nice atmosphere with live music playing on the night we stepped in. Support your local coffee shop in West Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a nice breakfast/lunch. European style paninis. An extensive menu with delicious treats."}
