{"text":"poutine is GREAT... burrito must try their pad thai... its probably the best pad thai in durham region... weiners is over priced though.... overall great place for quick good food... one only complaint i have for this place... it's one company... but one cashier for each food.... so if i want a burrito, hot dog and a poutine... i have to pay 3 separate times.. its very inconvenience.. not sure why they don't just have one cashier for all... (-1 star just because of that)"}
{"text":"Fries are great. Customer service is amazing. The vegetarian gravy tastes a bit off and can definitely get a better veggie poutine somewhere else. Great sizes though and reason prices. Store is a friendly environment and caters to a more hip and relaxed audience"}
{"text":"I like the idea of having the Smokes cafeteria style set up it's good for a group of people who can't decide on just one thing. You had the choice of poutine, burritos or hot dogs. All of which are amazing."}
{"text":"We came here on Jan 2nd. The service was speedy and very friendly. Got the double pork,and my husband had the Country style. Both were very good,and massive portions. Next time we will go for the snack size. Found it to be much more delicious then the liberty village store. Could be the liberty store is tired of serving all the downtown yuppies. This location was much better ."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this place! So many choices. I had the original and it was wonderful. My sister had the chicken bacon ranch and the chicken was a little rubbery. It was a great snack!!!"}
{"text":"It's okay ! Nothing special- a regular poutine with a heavy price

We arrived at around 8:00pm, the place was empty"}
{"text":"Today, Rudy provided my friend and I with exemplary service as busy as the place was getting for a Saturday dinner rush. He was busy behind the counter but was always ready to help and provide us with what we needed (my friend and I paid him many many visits at the counter. Oops! Thanks, bud. We're needy.) 

We got the meal-size and WOW! size bacon cheeseburger poutine. Toppings were plentyful, with fries a struggle to find underneath all of it. Upon poking into the fries though, the fries broke apart making it hard to scoop/fork up and eat. Thats the only reason why this place lost points. Other than that, a great experience every time."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Smoke's Poutinerie in Niagara Falls and Vaughan in the past and enjoyed their poutine. The Ajax location is fairly new and happens to be their global headquarters. It's also three restaurants in one, including Smoke's Burritorie and Smoke's Weinerie. It's set up like a food court, with separate counter and POS for each brand and a common seating area.

I went for the poutine and there are lots of choices. I chose the Bacon Cheeseburger Poutine, even though I've had it before. The fries came out of the kitchen and it was dressed with all the toppings at the front counter. The portion size was decent and it was served hot. It was a bit salty and maybe not quite as good as I remember, but not bad.

There is a counter with napkin dispensers, straws, and a whole bunch of pump dispensers with different sauces. Unfortunately, the first two I tried were empty so I settled for ketchup from an unlabeled squeeze bottle. I had to confirm the contents by smell and taste.

Of all the tables and seats available (roughly 40-ish by my count), my table was very wobbly. Oh well.

Was I expecting too much to think that the global headquarters of a successful restaurant chain representing three brands would have a near flawless flagship store at their HQ? Empty condiment containers? Wobbly tables? Really?"}
{"text":"As a food chain this place serves good poutine and has a large variety of poutines (and also burritos and hot dogs at this location). With that being said, in order to provide a wide variety of food, a lot of the toppings and ingredients are pre-made, frozen etc. For a fast food chain, this is fairly normal but if you're a foodie like me, this place might just fall short of your expectations. Especially since we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our food, which is quite a long wait for a \"fast\" food restaurant. 

I came here with a friend and I had the chicken peppercorn poutine with mushrooms in the \"traditional\" meal size which came out to $10.15 and my friend ordered the vegetarian rainbow for the same price. The customer service was good and they even have a counter with a variety of sauce options which is nice, but to me I would rather have something with more oomf. As a chain restaurant this place serves better poutine than a McDonalds for example, but the locations are sparse and scattered and not an easy food option for people who don't live close to one.

For these reasons, I give this establishment 3 stars. Great variety, but the \"chain\" element of the chain restaurant makes it a bit lacking since there was a long wait time and not many locations."}
{"text":"For YEARS I've been trying to get my hubby to try Smokes Poutinerie and finally, an occasion came where the timing was right! We stopped by on a Saturday while doing some errands to have some poutine before we got our shopping done.

I guess the head office is located right next door and this location has three counters, one for poutine, one for hot dogs and one for burritos, but only one counter is staffed at a time I guess. We checked out the menu and ended up ordering a Country Style for me and he got the Chicken Bacon Ranch poutine. 

So first thing - to the head office, please fix your terrible menu boards. Just as we were reading through poutines trying to decide what to order, the whole thing goes black and then a whole pile of red flannel plaid shows up. Don't do that - I'm here to look at the menu, not your logo, which covers every other surface.

It wasn't long of a wait for our food and there was a small line by the time we got our meal and sat down. The first time I had smokes was years ago downtown and every time I've gone to the location on Dundas (I think) its been a fantastic poutine experience. This wasn't to be the case here.

First of all - you're known for poutine. I want gravy, lots of it, and it needs to be HOT. If I wanted raw cheese curds on top of lukewarm fries then I'd order that. The whole point of a poutine is for the curds to get a little melty and stringy but still squeak against your teeth when you bite into it. Second of all, everything was lukewarm. The chicken wasn't hot, the bacon wasn't hot, the peas weren't hot, the fries weren't hot, the gravy wasn't hot.... and then, to my dismay, we see the people after us sit down with poutine containers that are STEAMING they're so hot. What gives???

The other thing I remember about smokes is their incredible gravy. The flavor jumped out of the box at you and this gravy was BOOOORINGGGGG. What happened to that lovely rosemary infused gravy I loved so much??

Very sad, I had such high hopes for my visit here - will not return to this Smokes location. If I'm craving poutine, I'll go to Philthy's in Whitby, which is much closer to home, and get it there."}
{"text":"Years ago, when I visited Ajax every other weekend, I stopped by this plaza and noticed Smokes Poutinerie. It wasn't open to the public.

Last month, I came by and noticed that it was open for business. I have never been to Smokes Poutinerie. I hadn't had lunch, so I went in.

It looked fairly new inside. I noticed that the menu had a meatball spaghetti burrito. It looked good.

I went up to the woman at the counter and indicated that I wanted the meatball spaghetti burrito. She replied that it wasn't available and that only custom burritos were accepted. Already, I was disappointed.

I then saw the country-style poutine. I asked if I could get a snack size of it. Nope, that's not available in that size. I could only get that in a meal size. Considering that I get tired of fries, I knew that going larger wasn't a good idea. However, I wanted to sample the peas and mushrooms, so I said yes.

A woman and I were waiting for our orders. We saw the same woman who had taken my order burn an entire batch of fries. We both knew that it was a bad sign and talked about food handling best practices, as we have both taken courses in the past.

As expected, there were way too many fries for my liking. They weren't tasty to begin with, let alone for an entire meal. I ended up eating the peas, mushrooms, cheese curds, caramelized onions, bacon, and whatever else was on there, and called it good. It was definitely not yummy poutine in my books. Luckily, I washed it down with a Diet Coke, which was good.

Sadly, I won't be coming back here. As much as I want to give the meatball spaghetti burrito a try, I could do a better job making it at home and knowing that it's available.

{"text":"I've been wanting to come here in the last couple of years but it was always in the process of being built and not yet opened. Finally, it opened by the time we visited the area again. We tried the Traditional Poutine and 
Hogtown Poutine. Both were ok but the Hogtown Poutine was slightly better because it had more toppings. It was a little disappointing because both poutines got cold fast. Had better Poutine at Costco. Service was friendly though. Think I'll try other places that have poutines next time."}
