{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch, and despite the huge line that took ten minutes to get through (it was Sunday, across from a church, at 12:15PM--ick), it just wasn't good.  At this establishment, you order at the counter, then they bring you your food.  The guy who took our order had to have us repeat our order three times just to get it right.  And it wasn't complex: I ordered a half and half combo, which is on the menu.  My BF ordered a full sandwich with a cup of soup.  Again, nothing strange about that.  We got our food relatively quickly, so that was nice.  But the food wasn't.  I got a dill chicken sandwich, which didn't have much flavor at all.  I also had a cup of chicken chili on the side -- again, just so so. BF got the Oven Roasted Turkey sandwich -- bland again.  His soup was a cream of broccoli, I think.  Forgettable, obviously.  At one point, in the middle of chewing, my BF stopped and proclaimed, \"This is kinda gross.\"    I concur.  The restaurant is very cafeteria-style.  No character to speak of.  The only nice thing was there was ample parking because it is in a Harris Teeter parking lot.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good, healthy food. Good variety of sandwiches, salads and wraps if you are looking for healthy options. Been here for lunch and breakfast and never had a problem and was always satisfied with our order. Fair prices, good staff."}
{"text":"Pimento cheese sandwich is out of this world!  Speedy lunch service although I recommend getting there a little early because parking can be a bit... tight.  One of my favorite lunch spots though!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, atmosphere is fast-foodish. I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Consider eating somewhere else.  We went here on a Saturday afternoon at lunch time, there were not a lot of people inside and that should have told us something.  I initially wanted to order the shrimp chipotle quesadilla, as this sounded good and unique.  Turns out they were out of shrimp!!! So I proceeded to order the 1/2 soup and sandwich thing, with the garden vegetable soup and tuna melt sandwich, with a side of macaroni and cheese.  When it arrived to the table, both were way smaller than I had anticipated they would be (i.e. smaller than Panera's 1/2 soup and sandwich for about the same price), and even more they were OUT of macaroni and cheese too.  I had also ordered a smoothie since they had this on special and asked for it without yogurt... of course they brought me the one with yogurt, and then I had to make sure that this didn't have any... THEN they took the smoothie with yogurt to another table and brought me the one without yogurt (which was not as full as the one WITH yogurt).  The setting is stiff, as are the seats, and overall this was not an enjoyable experience unfortunately as much as I wanted to like it.  The cashier seemed a little rude with us, and the only redeemable quality was that we got a chocolate chip cookie since they were out of macaroni and cheese.  Go elsewhere, this place does not deserve to be in business... such a good location for something better otherwise."}
{"text":"Dingy and musty.  Perhaps if they were open longer than 2 hours a day or weekends they could afford to keep their soda machine up.  In addition to soda machine being down, they were out of two different bottled sodas.  The sandwich I ordered with no mayo came coated in it.  And the staff was eating from behind the counter.  Truly disgusting, can't wait to see what they put in here after they go out of business!"}
{"text":"It's not that I hate Just Fresh, it's that I'm not head over heels in love with it. However, if I do go to a Just Fresh, it's definitely this location. I prefer to go for dinner since there is rarely anyone else in there. It's creepy yet comforting at the same time for somewhere in Dilworth to be dead. They're open to 8pm on the weeknights though so that could be the reason? They have a great selection of \"just fresh\" sandwiches, soups, salads, etc. Their mozzabella salad is one of my favorites out there and they have a good selection of vegetarian friendly items. Plus they offer a punch card for sandwiches and salads so when you get ten, you get a free one, who doesn't love that??  Free wifi too and quick!"}
{"text":"The food was stale, not fresh. My wife and I went here on Sunday for lunch. She had a cinnamon roll: dry and stale. I had the Little Red Rooster wrap; the wrapbread was stale and crunchy and very hard to chew. On the plus side, the facility is great. Plenty of seating, free Wi-Fi, and a nice large shaded outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I have not visited the one on East Blvd, but have at the Rivergate location. The place is incredibly clean and a great place to go for lunch. The staff is already really friendly, and they always get my order right. Perhaps the East Blvd location isn't as fabulous.   I recommend ALL the salads, though they have a rough time going easy on the dressing if you ask them to toss it with the salad. The turkey burger and oven sweet potato fries are great. This place is not as cheap as fast food, but it's still really good, and rather healthy."}
{"text":"Just Fresh was just what I needed for a quick bite to eat in the middle of the day. As part of the Queen City Tour break, Just Fresh was located in the shopping plaza we stopped in.   I ordered the Bellissimo hot wrap and my husband ordered a veggie sandwich. A side is included: fruit cup or potato salad (I think there were other choices, but those were what we picked). As I was eating my lunch I thought, \"This tastes...fresh, just fresh.\" I think that is how they got their name. It did the trick and I enjoyed it.  For something fast, fresh, and will not make you feel guilty about eating, try Just Fresh."}
{"text":"I was so bummed today after I went in for a smoothie. Their smoothies are delicious, but for some reason they had the machine taken down for the day at 3 in the afternoon.    The food:   The sandwiches are yummy and it's a good idea to get a smoothie with your sandwich if their machine hasn't been taken down."}
{"text":"Fresh, yes. The salads are much better than the sandwiches, in my opinion. Great place for lunch and if you can get nice weather, a great place to sit outside too. The staff was very friendly and helped with cleaning up tables after I ate and finished up a little laptop work."}
{"text":"Came here to use my free meal card from being double charged at the restaurant in river gate only to still be sitting here 14 minutes later waiting on my food that was supposed to be to go. Apparently the order was lost....double bad experiences..."}
{"text":"I have always loved Just Fresh. Yes, they may be a little pricey on some items, but their food is top quality and \"fresh.\" You can't go wrong with a combo at lunch-it's cheap and delicious! Conveniently located in Dilworth in the Harris Teeter parking lot."}
{"text":"Good sandwich place, great location right by Harris Teeter-convenient for meeting someone for lunch.  It's similar to a Panera or Crisp (which happens to be right across the street) and is perfect for healthier fare options."}
{"text":"A decent place to hang out, similar to Panera Bread or such. Power outlets available at the booths along the walls. Free wi-fi. Some seats outside overlook East Blvd if you want to watch the passers-by.  I found it to be quieter than Starbucks and I'm a fan of free refills on coffee. The chocolate chip with walnuts cookie was excellent.  The parking lot is rather tight and most of the spaces are for compacts. Which seems to stop no one from cramming their SUV in there."}
{"text":"Three stars?! I love this place. I go probably 3Xx a week. I've never had a bad experience. And yes- I am addicted to Just Fresh. Everyone there is always super friendly, and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the five-pointer wrap for breakfast and the Chicken Caprese for lunch. You will not go wrong with the Chicken Caprese."}
{"text":"Always a top choice when I am in Charlotte-which is frequently! The Godfather is my favorite, but it is hotter than a $12 stereo with the peppers. They have like 30 different kinds of chips, tasty cookies, fresh fruit, the best iced tea I've had at a deli and a great variety!  It's quick, healthy, and a decent value! You can't get much better! They need to open up some locations in SC! Until then, I'll hit it moat of the times I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This chain was kind of a fail. Not an epic fail, mind you. More like a mediocre, \"why the hell did I waste my money on this sub-par lunch\" fail.  I got a chicken salad salad. Service was 3.5 stars, they were happy to swap out a spinach base for the romaine. Salad didn't really taste like much. A bunch of random ingredients thrown haphazardly together in a massive portion with a huge side of bread. Sort of like eating at the Olive Garden: come for the crappy food, stay for the weight gain.  Yeah, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hmmm...........no. I definitely will not be returning here. Got kind of a wierd vibe walking through the door, there was a lack of cleanliness about the place that made me re-think getting in line. But I did. I noticed they had coffee smoothies, so I asked the guy behind the counter if those were available in decaf. Blank stare. I spoke up and asked again. Blank stare. And then...a shake of the head no. OKAY...looked around at the prepared foods and baked goods, none of which looked in the least bit appealing. At the risk of making a bad pun, the only thing Just Fresh about this place was the attitudes of the servers."}
{"text":"Oh NOOOOOO!  They no longer have my favorite sandwich \"Turkey in the Straw\".   HUGE AND EPIC Dissapointment.  I chose something similar as a back up....its the Little Red Rooster or something like that.  It's OK..... but its not the same.  Staff is always friendly.  Restaurant is always clean.  Well lit with lots of glass windows.  Super Large Patio with lots of chairs and tables with umbrellas to escape the sun."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick lunch. Food is fresh and portions are great. The dill chicken salad sandwich with pasta salad is always a sure bet"}
{"text":"Just Fresh seemed a bit stale to me.  This restaurant reminds me of McAlisters crossed with Panera and then cheapened somehow.  I was hoping it would be better since the guy I went with seemed smitten with the place but I have had better.  Granted, I am not a chain fan but even still, I expect more from a place called Just Fresh.  The food was not fresh by any means and the employees seemed to be just slogging through their shift."}
{"text":"Can't beat the daily specials! Went on Thursday for half sandwich, soup or salad combo. $6.48 for that deal including a drink. The portion was really big. I love the Mozzabella salad-mozzarella, Portabella's, roasted red peppers. I tried the  Turkey in the Straw sandwich for the first time which was awesome! Warm sandwich with turkey coleslaw and honey mustard. So good. I also love that they have powerade in their drink machine because I'm obsessed with it."}
{"text":"The manager here is a total idiot and customer service is last on his list.  I come here all the time and we were promised they would save 2 pair of eclipse glasses for us but, of course he didn't.  He just laughed it off as if customer service doesn't matter. They specifically said we will save 2 pairs since you guys come here all the time.  We even tried to buy them a couple days early but he would not let us even though they were sitting in his office.  In addition to this I have been wanting to buy a travel coffee mug but, they didn't have them in he store so he said he would pick them up from their storage unit and of course he never did.  When I asked about them again he said oh I forget and to this day he still hasn't picked them up from their storage unit.  This place was a much better place when the old manager was there.  This guy is awful.  On another note the best employee there is Martha. She truly is wonderful and her customer service skills are exemplary."}
{"text":"I've never been a just fresh fan but my director asked a favor to grab her lunch so I figured I'd try it, too. Glad I did.   I had three separate orders. I hate doing that to a cashier. But Jonna was amazing. She took her time with me and even made sure my change for each person was separated.   I got the Penny's Pig wrap without the lettuce and tomato. It was pretty tasty. Be warned if you don't like a little heat. The pimento cheese on it has a very nice kick!   I let the manager know how pleased i was with Jonna. He was pleasant, too, and gave me a catering menu and his card. Brandon, we just might use you for our next catered lunch because of the great service I received today!  The one and only reason I can't do 5 stars is that one order was missing a side in the bag. Other than that, the experience and food were very good!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my past two visits have been very disappointing.  The service appears to be very inconsistent, one day the staff is friendly and great, the other rude and almost annoyed. I have tried many of the soups, all pretty bland.  The chicken noodle soup, on my last visit, was thick noodles with one piece of chicken and NO flavor. The vegetable is missing a little flavor as well and the broccoli cheddar, where is the broccoli? Unlike other places, one I will not name, that serves amazing broccoli florets, Just Fresh serves the brocooli stems in a runny cheese sauce...I'll pass! As for the sandwhiches, definitely nothing to write home about.  And, one thing to note, both sandwiches I have tried were wrong.. So, if this is a to-go order, around lunch time, be sure to check your bag for the right sandwich."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly. The interior is standard, almost a little dated. The \"Just Fresh\" sigh looks cooler than the actual interior.  Unfortunately, today they were out of bananas so I was limited to 1/3 smoothie choices - back to the drawing board. As an alternative, I tried the Natalie's citrus beverages. It's freshly squeezed from a small family owned business in FL - not an issue because I love supporting small businesses. Plus the juices were delicious! Completely different flavor than orange juice in the local grocery stores. It has no preservatives, GMOs, or artificial flavors.  The dilemma is I'd been craving another great Green Smoothie they serve. It's only probably one of the reasons I eat there. They're food is \"fresh\" just not exciting. Today I'm giving the Cajun Club Salad a try. It's not bad!   Overall, I'm disappointed. I know meals are \"fresh\" here; however, the ingredients have to be in supply to fill the demand. I will just walk over to the Smoothie King in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite before a meeting and settled here by default. At first I thought the long line was trouble, but it moved along quickly as the staff knows what they're doing with the lunch crowd. Once I got my food, though, any relief went out the window. I know it's a simple sandwich/salad lunch spot but man, this was bad. I couldn't even finish my chicken \"gumbo.\" That's saying something for me. I love gumbo. The turkey sandwich filled me up, at least."}
