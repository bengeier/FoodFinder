{"text":"Splendido is splendid!  My boyfriend and I come in every season for the tasting menu and we always enjoy ourselves. I fact, we've never ordered a la carte and we probably should. From valet, the menu, service, pairings and everything in between it is impeccable.  They go above and beyond for their customers to the point that...  One time we cancelled our reservation because the main ingredient was truffles and we hate any type of mushroom. They called us back less than half an hour later to let us know that they made note of our dietary preference, said that mushrooms will always be substituted even without us asking and we came in for our original reservation. Talk about customer retention!  The next season, we came in and during our meal there was one course when I found a mushroom on my plate. We let the waiter know, he took my plate and went to the back. Shortly after, the HEAD CHEF came out to apologize and replaced it with something new, personally placing it onto the table. Amazing!  Another time, I insisted not to cancel even though I began to feel ill on the day of our dinner reservation. My sickness worsened in the middle of dinner, I managed to stick it out until desert and my boyfriend finally convinced me it was time to go home. They happily sent us home with our packed up desert and apologized if it was the food (it definitely wasn't the food)  We aren't crazy \"type a\" kind of people who have awful attitudes but we are a bit finicky when we spend a good chunk of cash and they never have a problem accommodating us!  How could anyone complain about such good service? I know I can't!"}
{"text":"Went to Splendido for dinner and it was an amazing experience! The service was spectacular.  They timed each course perfectly! We ordered from the normal menu, the food was amazing and the portions were surprisingly very large! Oh and thanks so much for the sample appetizer, desserts and parting gifts :)  Keep up the great work!  Definitely worth the price and I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends for dinner (it's very close to University of Toronto's business school) and we all opted for the multiple course tasting menu. I remember after the first three dishes thinking I would never be full given the tiny portions but after another three courses (we received at least 2-3 dishes courtesy of the chef) I knew I certainly would not go home hungry. Each dish was better than the other. I don't think this is a place you should judge via a Yelp review, rather you must try for yourself. Splendido does it all well- food, service and ambience."}
{"text":"Perfect experience. PERFECT! From the valeting of the car, to the extraordinary staff and service and outstanding presentation and taste of the food. Search as I might, I cannot find fault with my experience at Splendido."}
{"text":"One of the best meals i have ever had in my life.  They understand how to treat you and the quality that they need to present.  I was so ecstatic with the service and food that i had my bachelor party in the private dining room.  They definitely deliver at this place."}
{"text":"It was good but in no way did it blow my mind. For THAT amount of money you expect an experience a la Kaji, Bazaar @ the SLS in Beverly Hills or Eden at the Rimrock Resort in Banff. Solid but disappointing."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that this is my first review. I have tried many different restaurants and have always thought of writing a review which never happened. And here comes my experience at Splendido....it was so amazing that I simply feel like I had to commit my first review for it!  The food was amazing and definitely creative! It is obvious that the chef put a lot of thought into bringing out the very best taste of the food - whether it's the veal (that's cooked perfectly) with a few drops of vinegar and lemon puree on the side, or the foie gras parfait that synergizes multiple flavors.   The service was also one of the best I've seen. They kept finding new ways to impress and surprise us throughout the night.    Overall, it was an amazing experience and definitely a must try (or tries).  P.S. This is definitely not a budgted restaurant, but it's worth every single penny of it! :)"}
{"text":"It was my first year anniversary with my wife and the food and staff at Splendido made it a memorable one.    I happened to make a reservation for 6:30, but my prior plans ended early so we showed to see if they can accommodate us and they were happy to.  I have to say the service at this restaurant is top notch in the city.  They took our coats and escorted us to our tables.  Shortly after, our drink orders are taken and an amuse was delivered.  We had a pea-soup and accompanying it was something similar to latkas.  Already a good start to the night.  We ordered: Start: Seared Rougié Farm Foie Gras Second: Parmigiano Reggiano & Black Truffle Linguine Main: Roasted Halibut & Pork Belly 2nd Main: Yorkshire Pig Desert: Winter Berries  All dishes were superb, but the highlight of the night was Linguine.  They split the portion in two for us, but honestly we should have order 2 each.  The alfredo sauce was rich and creamy, but to top it off was the shave black truffles that just made it something else.  I can't stop thinking about it, my wife is getting jealous.  Our only complaint is that the pork was slightly over salted for our liking.  We happen to not salt our food too much.  So, this probably would be just perfect for most folks.  During dinner service our cutlery was changed each serving and I'm a bit of slob, so the were laying down new smaller cloths on top the table so that it doesn't look dirty and so that we don't get our clothes dirty.  Bonus:  I advised them that it was our anniversary so they gave us an additional desert dish compromising of peanut butter brownie, chocolate with a berry sauce in it, and a marsh-mellow like cake dusted with icing sugar.  In addition, they gave us an anniversary card from the staff Splendido.  On our way out they had our coats ready and cookies pre-packaged small boxes for us to take home.  I can't state just how great the staff was at Splendido.  I would recommend this to anyone celebrating a special occasion.  This experience is better than a michelin star restaurant Ive eaten at."}
{"text":"Winterliciousy goodness at Splendido! Can't think of anything witty it was that good.   Ah Winterlicious, the time for us plebes to go on the prowl either a) pretending we are classy b) relishing in our dirty plebeness at every opportunity aka \"Sorry server, is that DUCK CONFETTI, you said? I'm allergic to food colouring.\"  I turned to my friends at yelp for this one - and they rewarded my trust with delicious, delicious duck fat in a brick.   ATMOSPHERE  Classy! Five panel abstract on the wall marvellously ties in the side wall and unites the length of the resto. Sky high ceilings are airy and the lighting slightly dim, but classily so, so you can still see your food. Open seating with no booths, white tablecloths, the works. I didn't scope around the resto, but there were tables of four and two, with the potential to put the tables together for larger groups should you so desire.   Good for:  Impressing just about anyone with your excellent taste.  FOOD  Went with the $50.00 prix fix, and what booty we plundered!  First course of porchetta gribiche, parsley salad was simply the best ham I've ever had, tender and flavourful. Beautiful presentation all round. The garnish wasn't just random stuff to make it look nice. It was edible AND artistic at the same time. I also tried the truffled eggs. Delicious!   My main was confit duck pressé (a brick of decadent meeeeaaaat) with plum, sweet & sour turnip on top and a quaint pool of jus sanguin on the side.  A good portion too, not the size of a toonie. My first duck confit!   The conclusion was equally artistic in presentation and varied in flavour. Chocolate & Chili Pound Cake & Lime Jalapeno Sorbet. Yes, it is all with caps. Because it wasn't just a puck of cake and a sphere of sorbet. There were pieces of crisped sugar, different kinds, and a mysterious noodle of clear jelly and a creative drizzle of something sweet in a spiral. The sorbet was refreshing, the cake not too sweet or dense, the crisped sugar pieces adding texture and interest to the whole shebang.    SERVICE  I'm not used to being waited on with such aplomb. Took my coat, called me ma'am, used golden knives to shuffle my crumbs off the table with the skill of a court ninja (my classy cover blown! Arg!). They were swift clearing our plates without making us feel rushed. Their attitude overall was with the intent of providing even the plebes with a classy experience, and it worked. They patiently explained the particulars of the duck confit to me (cover blown again! Arg!). Also their commitment to providing a great experience was further evidenced through the provision of Splendido pamphlets and a customer feedback form.   LOCATION  Frankly, being a dirty suburbanite and it being cold, I drove. Bad idea. Right near Queen's Park and U of T, pedestrians leap into traffic like mad gazelles. Don't drive on this one at rush hour and DON\"T come down Avenue Road. Who knew it is completely non-linear? Now I do. Street parking available down Harbord, but it was jammed. Good luck!    OVERALL  Beautiful, amazing. If you can afford it, go already! Best Licious experience to date."}
{"text":"The Splendido staff made it hard to give it three stars but in the end they didn't deserve more than two.  The food was fantastic! Delivered at the proper time and proper temperature. Multiple staff delivered the mains and deserts so the table could all the have the food at the same time.  The problem, wine! After asking a server for the somiler to recommend a sparkling wine he arrived and said \"this is the sweetest sparkling we have, want it?\". There was no \"hi\" or \"hello\" just that question. BUT he did recommend a great wine.  The Champange was stored away from the table and we had to ask to get the glasses topped up every time and it wasn't always easy to flag someone down. When I asked to leave the bottle at the table they said:  \"Don't worry we will pay attention and keep the glasses full.\"   After ordering a red wine, we had the same problem with no access to the wine but having no one to fill up our glasses.  We did get the glasses filled up by asking everyone who walked by to 'find our wine and fill up our glasses'.  Finally, I asked the manager and fror the rest of the bottle we had really good service...but over all not a great night for a celebration dinner."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of high-end or fine dining...until I went here!  The service was SUPERB! (Thanks Ian). Very respectful, sincere, friendly, helpful, and skilled. The food was phenomenal. The variety was exciting.  The quality was exquisite.  A MUST REPEAT EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with everything about Splendido.   I had the jalapeno pasta, suckling pig and apple cobbler (to share). The pasta was really good, it's pretty spicy and the noodles are top notch. The suckling pig was undoubtedly the finest piece of pork I have ever tasted. It also comes with blood sausage, a sweet potato puree and some kind of pork rind like thing. I have only ever had blood sausage once before and found it to be revolting, but this was quite good. The cobbler was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe a bit too much topping and not enough filling for my tastes.   Food aside it's the service that's the best part about Splendido. People are taking your coat, offering your girlfriend a little bench for her purse, cleaning the crumbs off of your table, giving you helpful and insightful advice and offering to call you a cab home. The staff are excellent but are not stuffy in any way.   Which is also the nice thing about the space, it is not stuffy. It's nice but understated. I find sometimes in really nice restaurants you feel uncomfortable because you feel out of place but that is not the case at Splendido.   The only letdown is the washroom is nothing special. Given the attention to everything else I was expecting big things. I mean rust on your stainless steel soap dispensers, way to ruin an evening Splendido."}
{"text":"We went without expectations and had an absolutely spectacular time.  Chef has an incredible palate for umami and fish.  Its expensive but worth every penny...and the front of house service is...impeccable.  Rivals Alinea.  I would go back ...again and again"}
{"text":"I  love this place.  My #1 restaurant in Toronto.  The pasta is amazing, and pasta usually disappoints me.  The service is wonderful and the food has so much depth and thought put into it.  I can't wait until my next dinner at Splendido!!"}
{"text":"To say the least, it was very disappointing.   The Ribeye steak for two we got was completely burned on the outside. I tasted a mouth full of crunchy charcoal and it was not pleasant at all. After informing the waiter about the problem, they only offered to switch it with a NY striploin. Their excuse was that they ran out of Ribeyes. It was a complete lie because it was barely 7 pm and they served at least another 10 Ribeye dishes after I complained.   I dislike how dishonest they have treated the customers. If the restaurant fails to recognize the mistakes they've done and try to cheat their customers, I see no reason of them getting a high score on Yelp."}
{"text":"Very good food and atmosphere, romantic and all.  Good for a couple or double date."}
{"text":"You pay what you get. $45 for a starter, main course and dessert gets you mediocre food. Stay away from the mid-course soft shell taco. Only highlight of the meal was the foie gras parfait starter and Jilly-May's storm (a drink). I will not return again."}
{"text":"Truly incredible. 5 stars does not do it justice. Chef Victor Barry is a genius and it shows. We were a group of eight that had the extended tasting menu. Every single one of the 30+ courses and 'snacks' was incredible. You can't possibly be disappointed here.  Great ambience with elegant and beautiful decor, impeccable service, and a nice tucked-away location on Harbord Street."}
{"text":"Holy Shiite Muslim! All the other restaurants I've been to in TO are just foreplay compared to the major league, blow-your-load experience of Splendido. I gave Nota Bene 5 stars and I'd give Splendido 6 stars if I could. The S.O. took me here for my birthday last night and just about everything was memorable; from the earnest welcome of the valet parking dudes at the door, to the swish paper towels in the washroom, the kind that are so plush you could leave a handprint in them.  This kind of OCD attention to detail definitely carried over to the food. Each table got served addictively delicious COCKTAIL NIBBLES of: - fennel & red pepper grissini - to dip into the red pepper aioli - and luscious rosemary-marinated olives (that'll make converts out of you incomprehensible olive haters out there!)  FIRST COURSES Me: Chilled Ontario Peaches 'n Cream Corn Soup garnished with Prawn, Corn* and Tarragon Salad ($15). This dish was a love letter to the best of Ontario summer produce, hanging on to the last days of peaches-'n-cream corn \"with a Vulcan death grip.\" Crispy-crunchy freaks like me will love the ear-shattering contrast of the Parmesan croutons against the velvety texture of the broth--like the awesome crackle you get with Rice Krispies in milk.   The S.O: A primi portion of a pasta called Maltagliati with Tunisian Octopus*, Kalamata Olives*, Capers* & Preserved Lemon* ($15). If I wasn't too busy lapping up my soup, I would've reached over to steal more forkfuls of the impossibly tender octopus.   SECOND COURSES Me: Butter Poached Lobster**. I already had dibs on it when I was doing research on Splendido's menu online.  Just saying BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER makes me cream my pants. Last night, it was served with Chanterelle mushroom risotto. (Did the S.O. fax the chef a list entitled, \"Susan's Favorite Things to Eat\" cuz they were popping up all over the place like pop words on a pop video.) At $37 this is one of the priciest dishes on the menu but, hey, you only have your birthday once a year and lobster is never cheap. Verdict: Worth every last lovin' loonie.  The S.O: Beef Strip Loin Tagliata with New Farm Heirloom Tomato Salad*, Arugula* ($29).   DESSERT Me: Panna Cotta of Crème Fraîche & Madagascar Vanilla Bean with sous vide Niagara peach* and peach sorbet. This dessert was served in a small Mason jelly jar with a long-handled spoon**. Cute presentation aside, I inhaled this dish. It's a good thing the place got packed and had a nice buzz toward the end of our meal because it helped muffle the clanging of my spoon against the bottom of the jar as I attempted to scrape up the last bits. I don't have an enormous sweet tooth and I find most desserts to be too cloying but this was the perfect combination of not-too-sweet, creamy, fruity, AND crispy from the surprise flecks of meringue thrown in. Next time, forgo the spoon and just give me a fat straw to Hoover up that sh*t.  The S.O: Never eats dessert. Good, cuz I wasn't sharing.  WINE Excellent vintages by the glass including one of my faves, Vermentino from Sardinia, which I rarely see on LCBO-certified wine lists. By the glass is a misnomer because it comes in a very generous 5-ounce carafe** which is more than a glassful.  DECOR & CROWD Handsome teak paneling and tan leather chairs which say more \"serious business\" and less \"girls night out.\" The crowd was pretty mature that night. I think we were the only diners here under 40.   SERVICE Amazing. A team of well-choreographed servers tended to us, never missing a step. Our main guy was aware of what was in the dishes and how they were made. And because they knew it was my birthday, they gave me a birthday card signed by the chef, manager, and captain. Classy.  OTHER You can make reservations online at http://splendido.ca/reservations/  So, a VERY happy birthday to me. I love this place and will definitely go back after a month living on ramen so i can save up more loonies. _____________________________________ * Also on \"Susan's Favorite Things to Eat\" list ** See photo"}
{"text":"So apparently Splendido is changing owners this summer. I can only hope that the experience will stay the same, as the service is impeccable and the food on point.   The foie gras is world class, and the lobster and scallops main has the perfect amount of butter, avoiding the oily mess that you're left with in other high-end restaurants.  Reservations: 5-7 day advance recommended.  The Damage: ~140pp, pre-tax, tip, drinks  Extra Tid-bit: Nice view of the kitchen. Though glass partition makes it impossible to hear the action."}
{"text":"Just finished a disappointing service and meal. After coming  here once a year for years, something didn't add up. The staff were less attentive than before with less energy and waiter was defensive to any feedback we provided when he asked. Found out from the bus boy new ownership took over in Nov 2014. Food was boring, presentation odd, and dessert was a pile of blue cheese on a plate. I'd pay anyone money to see if they could finish it. This is not the same restaurant it used to be."}
{"text":"This place certainly lives up to its great reputation. We went there for my husband's birthday, and they couldn't have been more hospitable and charming. The food was fantastic, but it was the personalized service that really blew me away. The knowledgeable, attentive staff, the attention to detail, everything was exactly as a fine dining restaurant should be.   I once heard something about class that I think applies here - true 'class' isn't making sure everyone sees your superiority - it's the ability to make everyone around you feel truly comfortable in your presence and with themselves. I think Splendido's team accomplished that yesterday. I will definitely be going back, and often."}
{"text":"I called today to inquire about a reservation for 6 for Summerlicious. Not only did the staff LAUGH when I asked, but they rudely replied \"we don't do Summerlicious for parties over 4.\" So then I said okay, well we will just dine regularly there without the Summerlicious Menu. Again, I was laughed at where the person informed me how \"it's not close in price at all.\" The tone of the man's voice was disgusting and quite frankly, he was belittling me. My entire family will now never go."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm a biti tardy in reviewing this restaurant but I went here in August for my first year anniversary and would be remiss if I didn't put my two cents in, even if it has been over a month.  For dinner, my wife and I had the seasonal tasting menu with wine pairings which showcased heirloom tomatoes from Vickie's vegetables (a top Ontario vegetable farm and Brick Works staple).   In general all of the dishes (5 + three amuse bouches) were great and included a tomato gelee soup (which although remarkably fresh and clean tasting was probably my least favourite), a prawn with tomato confit, a roasted tomato and chorizo linguine with an exquisitely fried piece of calamari, a delicious seared sweetbread and smoked veal breast (read: brisket) duo and a panna cotta that was light and beautifully textured (and not even a bit gelatinous). I also give bonus points to the restaurant for letting me break one of the tasting menus to have the a la carte peach crumble dessert which was exceptional and served with possibly the purest and most delicious scoop of house made vanilla bean ice cream I've ever had.  Wine pairings (all Ontario) were spot on and very Beamsville bench heavy (with two separate Tawse offerings).    Service was exceptional with a wait staff that was present without being overbearing and a clear knowledge and love of food in general and the menu in particular. Gentlemen, your lady friends will also all be wowed by the personal purse cushions beside the seats. In short, no details are spared and you will feel like a million bucks being here.  So with all of that I would reserve one criticism for this restaurant, and it is a criticism that I feel is acceptable given the talent of the kitchen and the exceptionally high price point. In my opinion Splendido could and should be a more ambitious restaurant.   While everything we had was delicious, the menu is basically the application of expert technique to the highest quality local ingredients. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, it seems a bit of a waste that Splendido isn't adding a bit more to the global culinary movement.  Regardless, if you're looking to celebrate a very special occasion (or I guess if you're just a baller) you won't be disappointed by splurging on a meal at Splendido.   4.75/5"}
{"text":"My boyfriend picked this place for a special occasion dinner because of the great reviews. We weren't disappointed.  Service was excellent at this restaurant. The servers were very polite and explained all our dishes to us. Water glasses were always filled.   We were treated to a complementary snack right after we were seated. It was a shot of leek & potato soup with a cheese filled puff pastry. I went with the Prix Fixe menu, and my boyfriend ordered from the a la carte menu.  All the dishes were excellent. The first course was smoked PEI oyster - crispy potato chip and the fresh smoked oyster was an excellent combination. Second course was frog legs & snails - the snails were cooked spot on, frog legs were coated and fried. I thought the frog legs could be a little more flavorful though. Third course was a variety of pork \"tapas\"- the pork tenderloin wrapped in pancetta was superb. I'm usually not a big fan of pork, but this was the best pork I've ever had. There was also roasted pork belly (that literally melted in your mouth), and a few different sausages (I don't really care much about sausages, so meh). The sweet potato ice cream for dessert was very unique. It wasn't very sweet, but eaten with the chocolate coated popcorn and caramelized white chocolate was like a match made in heaven.   My boyfriend had the Smoked Pork Soup and the Cumbrae Farms Pastured Veal. The veal was pretty massive. He was too stuffed to order dessert. Then the server brought us come complementary dessert! Lychee marshmallows, dark chocolate, and raspberry macaroons!   Just when we thought it couldn't get better that this, on the way out of the restaurant, the manager (?) or owner (?) gave us two small boxes which had complementary homemade shortbread.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you want a great dinner for a special occasion, or just a nice date :)"}
{"text":"oh my god. what a disappointment. lets start with the fact that on Tuesdays they dont have the Valet service available... hence, my out of town guest couldnt find a place to park... (I told them I picked this restaurant because of their valet service... but who knew they dont work on Tuesdays... silly me). the service was the highlight of the dinner, indeed one of the best service in the city (if not the world). the waiter knew everything in the menu and explained it perfectly. everything else was very bad. the food wasnt anything special except the risotto and the portions were so small... the wine selection is nice, but not enough bottles under the 50$ price. hence, 3 people, ~450$ bill... and no Valet..."}
{"text":"SPLENDIDO!  It is truly spectacular there! I've been there for a couple of private parties in their private dining room downstairs in their wine cellar - its super! The space is warm and held our party of 20 people comfortably. The room has its own bar area and wait staff dedicated to it.  Food options: You can a la carte or their prix fixed menu - the chef is so flexible and accommodating. I've tried both menus and loved their food both times. The Halibut is perfectly cooked - so tender and well seasoned served over creamy corn. The strip loin was perfectly cooked to medium rare and cuts were terrific.   The foie gras and agnolotti were delicious starters  and the blueberry sorbet was a great dessert option to end a fabulous meals.  It is one of the best places in the city to host parties. The staff and service are impeccable and ever so accommodating."}
{"text":"Perfect experience from start to finish.   Servers that actually pay attention to you and serve accordingly are my favorite. We arrived, about 10 minutes past our reservation, and were seated at the bar to wait for our table. We ordered cocktails and got comfortable and the host let us finish our cocktails before bringing up to our table (which was great, considering we watched the couple before us get ushered to their table immediately, possibly because they were standing at the bar awkwardly).   At one point, my BF spilled his drink (on me) and before I even registered it in my brain that I was wet, a couple of servers were on the scene to clean me up and move us to another table. This was actually a blessing in disguise, because our second table was better.   It just got better from there. The food was perfection and while the wine list was pricey, it was perfect. The sommelier was buzzing around and I was eager to hear her input about wine pairings, but it turned out I picked the best wine for our meal already. I asked for her opinion on our second bottle and she was on point, it was perfection.   My favorite part of the meal? When we were too full to finish our second bottle of wine, and they packed it up in a bag, with 2 small boxes of shortbread cookies.   I will be back and will recommend it to anyone who will listen. It's by far one of my favorite restaurant experiences in the city."}
{"text":"I never went to the \"old\" Splendid so I can't really make a comparison, but I can say I was very impressed with the newly renovated version.  Decor-  modern, simple and very fresh feeling. There is an entire wall of preserves that the chef actually uses. very cool!  Food - DELICIOUS! Everyone I was with really enjoyed their meal!   Service - impeccable! Sometimes I find myself feeling thrown off by servers at  fancy restaurants. They can be a little intimidating, rude when you ask questions and pretty snobby. That is not the case at Splendido. They were all so friendly and extremely helpful!  Plus the fact that they were all gorgeous doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"I agree wholeheartedly with Jordan T - everything about the Splendido experience is impressive. From the quality of the food, to the calibre of the service, to the atmosphere in the dining room - it's really, really ridiculously good.  Sure, it's expensive but it's the kind of place where you get what you pay for - a great choice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious as I cannot afford the regular menu at what is recognized as one of Toronto's top restaurants. Great service, decor and pace. Food was great as expected.   Now, if only I can come here for the regular menu...."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was on the spot. The service was beyond exceptional. You get the sense of dining, not just eating. And what makes it great is that the servers truly care about the experience and take great pride in that. The food itself was top notch. My girlfriend and I went in for the pre-fixed menu and even though it wasn't cheap by any means, you get what you pay for. The roasted oyster on potato mash was extremely creamy. The foie gras was wonderfully prepared with a layer of cheese. The striploin was cooked to perfection and the accompanying sauce was exquisite. The dessert selection was also delicate but flavorful. This place is definitely ahead of the game and the best restaurant I've been to so far. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best part of being in Splendido is being in Splendido.   Smart looking room + excellent service/way too knowledgeable wait-staff + plus good but not the greatest food = a pretty good time.  Sure, it's pricey- but if you've got a special occasion or want a night out- you could do a lot worse.  Didn't see anyone in there- but the private dining space in the basement is beautiful - giant table, seating for 24, and surrounded by the wine cellar. Definitely a place where some big decisions go down.    Tried the 22oz boneless rib-eye Angus steak for 2.... it was VERY good. I would describe its tenderness having been akin to warm butter."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Splendido for a very long time... even way back when they still had an a la carte menu. I came here for Summerlicious as it is the only way I could afford to eat here =p  Regular menu is a steep $180 p/p  I'll be honest I had low expectations as I know SL Menus are often mediocre. This was not the case with Splendido ,  their food was MONEY every dish that came out was on point.  -Appetizer  Salmon sashimi served with an avocado cream, sesame and  rice cakes. I could eat a whole plate of those rice cakes, they were so goooood. -Main Salmon belly  served with mushrooms ad green onion. The skin was crispy while the meat was still rare hmmm it was so tender and juicy. -Dessert Blueberry and lemon curd with pistachio crumble. very refreshing not overly sweet, perfect way to finish our meal.  -Drinks $10 each The Salem and Manhattan were both nice and boozy no water down nonsense here. Will come back for Winterlicious!"}
{"text":"Splendido was simply splendid (heh). I came here for summerlicious dinner with one of my best gal pals, Sinyi, so her input will be part of this review as well.  First of, is this worth the price you pay? I'm going to say yes. Flavour-wise, their dishes are wonderful, multi-dimensional, and well thought out but not perfect. Hence the four stars, you see. But this is not why you come to this restaurant. Note: I have not tried their multi-course tasting menu so I cannot speak for it. Splendido is not just about food; it is about sitting down and being taken care of. Their service is professional and classy - don't expect your server to be cracking jokes and laughing. But sometimes that's what you want! And of course, their plating and presentation is to die for. Makes for some amazing instagram shots (yes, yes, judge away.) Some of it was a little sloppy but well-intended none the less. I ordered the salmon belly and it looked hilarious next to the amount of negative space on Sinyi's hangar steak plate.  Our favourite course, I think, would have to be dessert. We ordered the strawberry shortcake and blueberry + lemon curd. All modern interpretations, of course. Delicious, fresh and really just fabulous plating! So many little details. The small addition of those tiny pea shoot sprouts just add so much.  I went to the bathroom and noticed the cellar downstairs for private functions! As I washed my hands, I think I may have overheard a conversation I wasn't supposed to. So if you're going to book that space, just know that the things you say are audible from the ladies' room!   All in all, I'm very happy we chose this place and will definitely return next time."}
{"text":"My first fine dine since I moved to Toronto.  I arrived at 5pm and specifically chose an early dinner since I'm going alone. The waiters were very polite. They offered me some magazines to read, but it was too dark to read. Heck, it was even too dark to take photos of the food without flash.  For an italian restaurant, it tastes very french. The most italian on my tasting menu was the mushroom risotto. Even that was very french with the cheesy sauce. I wish that they serve warm bread, but the bread taste good nonetheless. There's a lot of play with temperature and texture. Such as the cold bread with the warm amuse bouche. The pork+scallop and the beef were memorable. Both played a lot with texture (they're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside). They served some kind of french muffin with terrine. The muffin was the best. It tasted like shokupan mixed with puff pastry. In other words, it was soft to the point that they fall apart when it's inside my mouth. The terrine was at room temperature, so it melted when I slathered it onto the muffin.  The most disappointing is the goat cheese and beet salad. It was too much after the creamy and cheesy mushroom risotto. I didn't really dig the dessert too. I was expecting for some kind of fruity dessert to cancel out all those creamy dishes, but I was presented with a salty and nutty dessert.  They gave me an extra of what they called brown bread butter (which taste like a regular shortbread to me) to take home. It was a nice gesture. I would definitely come back for their ala carte menu now that I know what to order."}
{"text":"I tried the summerlicious dinner menu at Splendido for $45. Had the beef tongue, sea bass and panna cotta. They were all delicious but the standout was the beef tongue. The sea bass was a little too minimal in flavor but it was very soft and well cooked. I also enjoyed the basil cucumber lemonade.  The location is somewhat random as it isn't near many other restaurants or shops - and the room itself doesn't have fancy designs or decor. However, the service was top-notch, friendly and efficient. My server was cheerful and predicted our needs before we knew them. The support staff who bring out the food could use some extra training on the menu items - most high end restaurants do a little better when delivering and explaining the dish to guests. They were fine here but almost near whispering basic descriptions \"this is the sea bass\".   I would definitely be back to try the regular menu, as the food was delicious and if the service is this excellent during summerlicious (which, let's face it, is a time when many restaurants will revert to factory style serving with more customers than they are used to), then I imagine the regular experience is superb.   A note about portion sizes - it is small, perhaps smaller than many other high end restaurants - I rather liked this because it allowed me to get through the entire menu without feeling too full, but I can see how it would feel inadequate to a hungry or larger person. As a point of reference, the panna cotta was slightly smaller in circumference than a hockey puck, perhaps closer to a loonie. Just something to consider before making your choice.   I've heard from friends that Splendido consistently has an excellent summerlicious/winterlicious menu, and it has delivered this year as well."}
{"text":"Wow! We heard that they were closing at the end of the year so we decided to book a table for our 16th anniversary.  For those who haven't been it's a 12 course tasting menu. We added the wine pairing for an additional cost. The menu does not list what the courses are so each is a surprise. What we had was amazing. From popcorn made in bacon fat and scallop powder to caviar, sashimi, venison and 2 desserts. Each paired with wines, saki, beer and cherry. At the end they give you a bottle of 12yr old El Dorado rum with thier own ginger cranberry mix. And yes you can have the whole bottle but good luck at that point! The service was excellent. The Chef,the sommelier all came by the table and they even gave us a happy anniversary card signed by everyone!  Not cheap but I feel we got great value for what we spent. Go before it closes!"}
{"text":"Ok, this review is only for Winterlicious, but if there was a magical 6th star I could give a restaurant, Splendido deserves it!  It was their first year participating in Winterlicious and it was definitely one of the best Winterlicous experiences I've ever had.  Splendido, well, I think i love you, so what am I so afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm not sure of a love there is no cure for. Well i think i love you - isn't that what life was made of? though it worries me to say, I've never felt this way.  The service is just out of this world outstanding. From the second you step in, the warm greetings, the staff takes your coat, pulls out your chair and everything is seemless.  It's neat that the waitstaff have black vests...and Levis... that's kind of awesome!  Our knowledgeable waiter answered all of our questions about the menu and cocktails. Service was perfect from ordering to delivery and throughout the meal. We had constant attention and the manager came by several times to ask us about our Winterlicous experience and to ensure that we were enjoying ourselves.  The food was surprisingly creative in terms of presentation.  The food is more four star but combined with the service our experience was exceptional.  Appetizer The porchetta was an unexpectedly huge portion. Soft, juicy, and salty.  A great start to the meal.  Main - Duck confit with plum sauce This is the first time I've had duck confit pressed into the form of a brick. The duck was flavorful and juicy with an Asian twist accompanied by sweet plum sauce.    We ordered the Polenta as a side.  Creamy with sauce, but not overly exciting.  I wish it was served with mushrooms or something else to give it more weight.  The brussel sprouts were not bad.  Crispy and super toasty brussel sprouts.  Dessert I had the Chocolate pound cake with a lime chili gelato. The presentation and flavours were very unexpected bold. It was a deconstructed chocolate cake with crispy chocolate bits, there were a lot of textures on the plate.  The gelato was weirdly icy and spicy!  I didn't love the dessert, but I liked how it was an adventurous surprise.  I can't wait to come back here to experience dinner or try their new brunch service rumored  to start in the near future.    And yes, valet here is a rip off.  :)"}
{"text":"A night of amazing indulgence.   The first series of dishes were raw fish all pared with sauces and flavours that sparkled.  A couple of vegetable dishes and only one meat dish - but possibly the best steak I've ever eaten.  Dessert to die for...even though I normally prefer cheese.  Wine pairings...well all good, all chosen perfectly for the dish.  Do I sound impressed? One of the best meals I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Totally over the top experience.  There are few restaurants in the world where so much thought goes into the pairing of ingredients not to mention the wines.  We did the tasting menu.  Started around 7:30, and I think we finally finished the dinner around 12am.  Memorable experience."}
{"text":"Gorgeous place, stunning food, meh service.  Everything we ordered created magic in our mouth, it was like a little party for our senses.  Service on the other hand was nothing compared to the taste of the food. We got our breadbasket after our appetizer, the food got dropped off while I was away in the washroom :/ we re-filled our wine all night, the server did not bother to check up on us all night.  All in all, the food was to die for but the service was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"New to the Winterlicious roster we just couldn't pass up a chance to try Splendido.   We've done winter/summerlicious a few times since moving to Toronto a few years ago with less than stellar results so thought we might be making a bad choice when we agreed to a 9:45pm reservation (the only time left on a Thursday night).   Luckily, the meal was delicious, the service was formal but not pretentious as others have criticized, the food was fantastic and overall we were very pleased with the experience.  If you want my opinion the scrambled egg starter was just okay. I thought it was a bit of a bold move as an appetizer and although it was paired with a delicious truffle sauce it just didn't do it for me.   The duck main course on the other hand, ooooo lala! This was tender, moist and full of delicious flavour. Also, I highly recommend dropping the extra $5 and splurging on the brussel sprout side. They were char boiled to perfection.  The cheese platter was no one's taste at the table but the chili, lime, chocolate cake, worth the visit. The chili was subtle but present, the lime was in gelato form and the chocolate cake was just decadent.  We left with full warm bellies and coupons for 20% off our next visit.  Overall Splendido is a place worthy of a Winter or Summer licious visit. Bravo Spendido. You've broken my trend of mediocre 'licious' experiences...now that that's out there, good luck getting a reservation the next time one of these events come around."}
{"text":"The best food I've ever eaten combined with outstanding service from all wait staff. Staff was also very knowledgable of items on the menu including the wine list. Considering the satisfaction I had after leaving here I'd gladly pay the bill. The experience of every aspect was fantastic."}
{"text":"Truly delicious!!!!  Service was wonderful and prompt.  The restaurant was constantly busy.  If you are dining alone or with just another friend, sitting at the bar tables by the window is not a bad idea - it's a little away from the maddening crowd too.  The country bread in their bread basket selection is one of the best breads I've had in a while.  Really crunchy but chewy and with a very nicely developed yeasty flavor.  The foie gras parfait is simply a slice of liver pate with a thick piece of toasted, buttery brioche and a little jar of macerated dates.  Very rich, luscious and tasty.  The special of the day - parpadelle with morels and English peas was as good as it gets.  Creamy and savory.  The butter-poached lobster on mascarpone risotto is also just as flavorful.  The garnish of raw pea shoots gave this heavier dish a touch of freshness.  The risotto was a bit too al dente in my opinion but had a very nice touch of tangy-ness that definitely complimented the butteriness of the dish well.  Overall, definitely a great place to have a special and delicious dinner."}
{"text":"I do not write negative reviews.  If I did not enjoy myself then I simply do not return.  What do I have to say about Splendido?  It's perfect, you will have a great time and love the food.  What do they serve?  They say High Quality, Seasonal, Locally Sourced, Family Farmed Products that have been Traditionally prepared.  The space is cozy, filled with a mix of couples, business people and some casual diners.  Service was prompt with servers clearly having a mandate to ensure every customer's needs are met.  The table was set with a small bowl of olives and your choice of 6 house made breads.  We asked for every type of bread as they all looked and smelled intoxicating.  One of the olive types they had was brought from Italy then cured in house and had a citrus taste.  It was so insanely good that I asked to buy a jar.  So what did we eat?       This is their Charcuterie platter and it was brilliant.  Items bottom left to right.  The White canelle was Berkshire Pork Fat to be used as a spread.  This spread is what butter aspires to be, so decadent.  House made avocado was good.  Chorizo was spicy and packed with flavour.  Spicy beans were, well, spicy!  The blood sausage seemed firm but was softer then I have ever had it and worked well as a spread.  The square white topped item was a Foie Gras Turine with a perfect texture and a light taste.  2 Parmesan breadsticks were bursting with a nutty flavor.  The most subtle prosciutto was next and I wish I had enough to wrap my body in it.  Spicy pickles.  Spicy salami and the last I cannot remember were also so buttery.   Foie Gras Parfait with a Rhubarb Purée, Elderberries & Crushed Walnuts - $19.  The parfait was served with a toasted brioche.  Foie Gras in its many versions is many times served with fruits and in this case the tart elderberries and the sour rhubarb complimented the richness of the Foie Gras perfectly.  This is one of the best dishes I have had this year.  Scallop, Lobster and Black Cod on a bed of Saffron Risotto served in a Cataplan.  It was one of their sharing plates and cost $36 each.  The risotto was cooked perfectly with every grain discernible and the seafood, well forget about it.  One note on the dedication to quality of this restaurant.  One of the scallops had 3 or 4 hard white stones inside of it.  This was clearly a natural phenomenon and not the fault of the restaurant.  I mentioned this to the server and within minutes the chef came out to investigate.  I showed him the pieces, he apologized and advised he would check with his suppliers.  He went into the back and 5 minutes later as we were almost licking the Cataplan clean of every morsel, he advised he would not charge us for the dish.  I might have paid double for that dish."}
{"text":"This place was very well recommended by a frend who I completelly trust when it comes to restaurant recommendations. However, this time he was not on. The food was good but nothing to write home about. When you factor in the prices, it is really not worth it. For that budget, there is no beating Auberge du Pommier."}
{"text":"***Splendido is an impressive fine dining restaurant that utilizes mostly Canadian produce to create a delicious, memorable and generous tasting menu***  On my recent Toronto trip, I was looking to try something local to the area so I opted for Splendido, which offers contemporary cuisine focusing on seasonal produce and local Canadian product. Splendido offers a tasting menu and it is exceptional; there is no doubting the team's talent as they excel at producing all different types of meat, seafood, pasta, and vegetable preparations.  The dinner started with a series of bites like sweet corn soup paired with a goat cheese gougere, a roe cone, an oyster with mignonette, a warm lobster bite, caviar paired with potato ice cream, an exceptional bite of crispy and salty salmon skin topped with smoked salmon, sweet and sour tamarind and jalapeno, and a warm corn croquette topped with truffle. It was one delicious canapé after another as Splendido definitely reaches the highs of some of the top U.S. restaurants producing fun, delicious and contrasting texture canapés like Quince and Providence.  More great presentations followed like a light and airy porcini crisp topped with mushroom puree. Very moist halibut was simply served with fresh herbs. Halibut can go dry very quickly, but the team here delivered a cod like experience. One of my favorite courses came next--smoked Ontario trout with cultured cream and pickled cipollini. The trout was amazingly moist with a medium rare center but still cooked enough so the fish easily flaked. The cipollini provided a sweet and tangy addition to the prominent smoked flavor of the fish.  The next course was obviously inspired by The French Laundry as it combined many elements of that restaurant's signature course--oysters (smoked here), chives, caviar, and a sabayon. The tapioca pearls were replaced with creamy potato puree and potato chips. Like that Thomas Keller course, this preparation was delicious.  A variety of beets came next including a hearty and potato-like golden beet and thinly sliced ruby red beets (the presentation was modern with light horseradish espuma and a dusting of spruce ash). An exceptional carrot course followed. The carrot was nicely charred so it was soft and sweet on the inside and smoky and crisp on the outside. The carrot was garnished with ginger and crunchy seeds. Creamy egg custard topped with shaved truffle followed.  One of my least favorite courses of the night came next--yellowtail wing topped with fermented black bean and lemon verbena. It was perfectly fine, but I felt the other fish courses were more memorable because of their simpler preparations.  The restaurant has an incredible attention to detail and it really comes across in their bread service, which featured a very hearty bread (soft on the inside with a thick and crunchy crust). The bread was served with a delicious foie gras butter.  The next course was spinach and ricotta agnolotti lightly bathed in an indulgent parmesan sauce and topped with fragrant truffle. The meat course was one of the best beef preparations I've had to date. While the garnishes like heirloom tomatoes, shaved parmesan and basil were all fine, the real star was an aged beef rib cap, which had an exceptional meaty flavor. The bark was amazing too as the fat around the edges was met with high heat, which turned it into a flavorful, smoky and crispy crust.  Given the generous variety of savory courses, it was no surprise that dessert was served as a series of courses including a refreshing gin and tonic dessert with gin espuma, cucumber sorbet, fragrant basil parfait, and an addictively sweet but also salty and savory nori crisp. The next dessert was strawberry panna cotta paired with strawberries, strawberry sorbet, and black sesame. Like the canapés that started dinner, the final sweets were bites like chocolate truffles, mignardises and a mini pecan pie.  Service was exceptional. The restaurant host/server was very polished and professional but also very friendly and welcoming. The barwoman was also very pleasant and, like the rest of the restaurant, showed a great attention to detail, which contributed to the restaurant's excellent beverage program.  Prices are high, but I do not know if I've been to another fine dining restaurant that has produced such a great variety of flavors and presentations utilizing premium ingredients.  Splendido is an excellent fine dining restaurant and a great way to experience the bounty of vegetables and seafood Canada offers. It is difficult for me to compare it to a U.S. restaurant since it excels at creating food that reminds me of Quince, The French Laundry, Saison, Providence, Manresa, Atera, Niche--all great restaurants but all very different. Splendido's ability to operate at that elite level while integrating Canadian produce makes it a must visit if love fine dining and find yourself in Toronto.  Nearby pay parking is available though expensive."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  My boyfriend and I came here for Summerlicious and at $45 per person, this was a steal considering the restaurant's normal prices.  We were forced to make an earlier dinner reservation just because the place had been booked up so quickly! But when we got there, we were greeted warmly and led to our table of which was very romantic.  My boyfriend had: - Perfect Hen's Egg - Hangar Steak - Gouda Cheese Dessert Plate  I had: - Pickeled Mackerel - Mediterranean Sea Bass - Strawberry Lemon Mille Feuille  The Perfect Hen's Egg was a soupy greeny liquidy concocture that definitely did not look appealing but was probably one of the best soupy-like puree appetizers we have had. It was very different but very good in the sense that I would have never tasted something like it before. I can't even explain it! It was good though, trust me!  My Pickeled Mackerel was good...and tasted pickled? Not much else to it.  The main dishes were both very good (although I don't eat beef, my boyfriend like it a lot). The skin on my Sea Bass was very crispy and the fish was flaky and so tender. The fish was a huge portion and the amount of sauce that came with it was just enough so that I was able to enjoy each piece of the fish with the sauce.   We normally love dessert cheese plates but the aged Gouda was too hard and so we couldn't finish it... we actually only had a small section of the entire block that we received. The Strawberry Lemon Mille Feuille was a little on the lemony, sour side so it wasn't my favourite.  All in all though, for the great service and for its food, I would come back and I would highly recommend visiting Splendido for Summerlicious or Winterlicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. My first time was for the Winterlicious 2015 Dinner ($45). My second time was on a regular tasting menu ($180).  This review will cover both experiences.  This place is definitely high-end so you should be willing to spend when coming here. The interior is actually not that fancy for a high-end place but the mood and atmosphere is.  TASTING MENU ($180) The overall experience was a hill. It was uphill (good) from start to mid, but then started going downhill after.  First thing they did when they sat us down was they gave a complimentary glass of sparkling wine. A win!  All the seafood courses were great. Vey fresh and flavourful, and they really gave the good stuff!  There was only 1 meat course and the meat was so small. I was very disappointed. I thought this was the course that would at least fill you up, but unfortunately no.  There were also 2 courses that were just veggies, which was also disappointing for me.  The desserts are where it really disappointed the most. - The macarons didn't have the chewy merangue. It just crumbled upon bite.  - The toasted mashmallows had a very rancid oil taste. And what was so bad about it was when we told the server about it, we were simply brushed off like we didn't know what we were eating. They just told us that they don't expect everyone to enjoy every dish. They didn't bother replacing it with something else, and took away the dish.  - The silver lining during dessert time was they provided a whole bottle of El Dorado Rum (12 years) to accompany the desserts. It's up to you if you want to finish the bottle or not, which totally did to make up for the bad ending.  I really expected top notch service, not a snobby one for such a high-end restaurant.   WINTERLICIOUS 2015 DINNER ($45) The overall experience was a disappointment. As this way my first time here and I heard so many things about how creative their dishes are (bordering molecular gastronomy), I didn't find anything special about this at all. To be honest, after this experience, I wasn't planning on coming back.  APPETIZER: Victor's Foie Gras Parfait - Apple, Celery, Raisin & Brioche - This was my favorite for the night in terms of the courses. The foie gras went amazingly well with the burnt bread that came with it. Mix that with the sweet flavors of apple and raisin, you really get a different levels of taste.  Lobster Mac & Cheese - with black truffle - It was good but not worth the supplement price since the lobster pieces weren't much  Duck Poutine - Irremarkable   MAIN: Smoked Pork Belly - Sweet Potato, Beet and Granola This was OK. It started out good, but it becomes too heavy and oily in the end.   DESSERT: Lemon Meringue On the Winterlicious website, they had posted a different dessert menu. So the one I really wanted wasn't actually being served. This was also irremarkable."}
{"text":"Splendido is probably one of the most underrated fine dining restaurants in Toronto. I had the tasting menu, which in my opinion, tops the best tasting menus in Toronto. The smoked oyster was particularly memorable, followed closely by the truffle risotto and venison dishes. The appetizers and main courses were among the best in the city, while the dessert dishes only fell short to the likes of Scaramouche and the now-defunct Colborne Lane. Service was also remarkable."}
{"text":"like a shooting star  :The Annex:  I don't 'fine dine' as much as I'd like because it's terribly costly. Not to mention that most of my friends who appreciate food snobbery (in all its ostentatious  glory) don't live in Toronto. That said, I do it enough.  I've tried Auberge, once, Canoe, once, Sotto, once...and so on and so on.  The exceptions to the \"once\" rule are what I consider the best, because I walk to the beat of my own drum.  Perhaps I just don't understand the rating systems or the opinions of arrogant know-it-alls who work for some publication, unless, of course, said know-it-all is Andrew Knowlton or Jeffrey Steingarten, my two critic crushes).   Splendido is such an exception. I have eaten there three times. My favourite thing on the menu is their lamb. It's always amazingly spectacular.  Generally I find it difficult to write about restaurants in this category because there is only so much one can say without sounding repetitive or pretentious. I have read enough reviews about Toronto's \"top dining destinations\" to know that reviews are often hoity-toity, difficult to understand and occasionally have an air about them - \"subtle and pleasing flavours...smoky and texturally appealing with a soft finish...lingers on the palette...\", etc.  I will keep mine as monosyllabic as possible.  Let me set the stage.  Last week a group of us gathered in the private dining room and prepared ourselves for pre-set menu 3.  Four courses and drinks.  Do keep in mind that the opinion expressed herein is a compilation of all of us.  Note that I was eating in the company of some serious foodies. They're all about Michelin Stars and Red Hats and other ranking systems I care nothing about.   For full details of menu itemsm visit my blog, but I don't think we need it here.  Each guest orders one item from each group. Amongst all of us, we pretty much covered the whole menu, save and except the Fall Greens Salad and Pappardelle. Personally I love pappardelle, but if I see bass on a menu I get tunnel-vision.  Service was excellent. Charming and relaxed instead of pompous and polite.  The canapés we had to start were stellar. The oysters blew my mind. I generally prefer my oysters plain but their apple-garlic mignonette was a perfect pairing.   The potato-leek soup with a rosemary biscuit and parmesan tuille - cheese baked into a chip - was warm, subtle and creamy.  Victor's Foie Gras Parfait was plentiful and served with a nice buttery brioche.   The linguine was rich and earthy.  The general consensus was that they could have been less generous with the truffle.  There was so much it was a bit overpowering.    I stole bites of the tenderloin where I could - it was amazing!  Both the tenderloin and bass were perfectly cooked.     The peanut-chocolate dessert was like a Peanut Butter Parfait that underwent an Extreme Makeover.    Everything at Splendido was amazing; beautifully plated, perfectly cooked, well-seasoned, and a nice mix of traditional flavours and contemporary ideas.  The average cost was about $200 per person, including wines and drinks.  Applying my system, was it worth the money. Absolutely.  If you have a special event, a special person, a special anything, invest in eating here.  Will I be going again? Yes, but not this year. I can only wrap my head around spending that much at one restaurant a year. It's how I stay accountable for the things I choose to spend money on.  Splendido has been a fixture on Toronto's fine dining scene for a long time. They focus on locally sourced, seasonal, high quality food. They have had a few changing of hands (the last time I went, in 2009, David Lee was the co-owner and Chef), but whether there are new faces front or back of house, the food and experience has remained consistent. Fine dining should start at Splendido...food heaven."}
{"text":"Recently went back to this restaurant for a complimentary dinner post Lincoln test drive. Food portions were small, but expected - since the meal was complimentary. However it was completely unexpected that our waiter was extremely inattentive and even rude. When we told him which drinks we wanted when he first come to get our order, he snapped back and said \"will we get the dinner order first then worry about drinks?\" And the drink did not come until after dessert. We flagged one of the guys that brought us the bread to ask about our drinks (since our waiter did not come back after he got our order, never asked how our meal went, ect), and when the drink was brought to us at last, no apology or anything. Not sure the bad service was because the meal was complimentary so the waiter thinks no tips would be earned or that waiter is just a bad waiter in general. We paid tips regardless."}
{"text":"What happened to this place??? We went back here...last being here many years ago...not only has the restaurant been renovated...into a bizarre, odd...and very non-elegant place...but everything we and our party had...from the nasty appetizers...to the bland and odd-taste infused mains...to the unappetizing (parfait served in a mason jar!) desserts...was    average at best...."}
{"text":"I've always walked by Splendido and thought, too rich for my blood.. And I still think that might be case but when a friend reserved a table for winterlicious, I figured it was worth checking out.  Upon arriving the service was impeccable. We had our coats taken and were seated immediately. The only thing I found off putting was the insisting that we put our bags on the stools rather than over the backs of our seats. I really don't like giving people easier access to my bag and I feel like it's easier to scoop up from a stool over grabbing it from over the back of my chair.. But maybe that's me.   Anyways on to the food. The disappointing thing for me was that because it was winterlicious, they only offered 3 bottles of wine. I had to insist on the full wine list. Once I got that bible, I was in heaven. They have marked up the bottles quite a bit but the quality is there. Also, to start things off right, I had one AMAZING Manhattan. Try it when you are there..   The winterlicious menu was great. I have the Sweet bread, the hangar steak and the cheese plate. All delicious and a great value for $45.   The atmosphere was cozy and inviting and I cannot wait for the day to be invited into the private dining room downstairs."}
{"text":"Have been there for two times. The first time was summerlicious, great price and tasty courses. The most recent visit we had the tasting menu. Really delicious and chef came out few times to check if we are satisfied. Very impressive dining experience.  The price is high, but definitely will come back for the next special celebration!"}
{"text":"This is such a \"go-to\" place when I want something a bit luxe that isn't fussy. I've been going to splendido on and off for quite a few years and I've never had a bad meal. the reason why it gets a 4 rather than a 5 is also because while dining at splendido is consistently excellent, the restaurant and the food there have never left one of those \"mind blowing\" moments for me. Perfect for a nice night out for a date or a special occasion though. One of my favourite go-to's."}
{"text":"Summerlicious @ Splendido is amazing value for what otherwise is an expensive restaurant.  Since this is probably flooding with summerlicious reviews I'll keep it short.  -Salmon sashimi is a hit.  The rice cakes were lovely. -I was hoping for the sea bass as I saw on the preview menu. This is actually salmon, but was cooked so perfectly there wasn't a hint of graininess. -Hanger steak is probably one of the best cuts, this was cooked to a perfect medium.  It comes with slices of fresh tomatoes and romesco which surprisingly compliment it.  Who would have thought. -The strawberries and cream & blueberry/lemon curd/pistachio crumbs are both delicious, not overly sweet, refreshing deserts.  We also had four cocktails (manhanttan and salem x2, both their summerlicious specials), but seriously contemplated a bottle of wine which was very reasonably priced at $45-60.  The regular tasting menu at Splendido is $180 pp.  Our 3 course meal and cocktails between two came to below that.  I'd suggest anyone who can get a summerlicious reservation here to so do!  The only gripe I had was we were forgotten early on and it took about 20 minutes before anyone served us - but service was otherwise excellent."}
{"text":"I have been lucky to dine at Splendido three times, with the last being the most memorable. It is too bad that Toronto doesn't have Michelin stars because Splendido would surely be on that list.  I had the fois gras starter which was simply sublime and then the chicken dinner as my main. The chicken was meant to be shared for two people, but I was happy that you could still get it for one. Everything was cooked to perfection and the frites were unbelievable. The dessert was the perfect ending to such a perfect meal. The ambience is great, very classy, romantic and pleasant. The staff are very attentive and they were quick to accommodate us, even last minute. Great amuse bouches and extensive wine menu.   I would highly recommend Splendido during Winterlicious as the quality is there, and definitely the best bang for your buck.  Update: Splendid is closing on December 31, 2015 and that is so, so sad."}
{"text":"Great ambience, impressive dinner.   Dinner: - Oysters: fresh and briny and they were all topped with various condiments- horseradish, wasabi prosecco parfait, green onions - Gnocchi with mushrooms: pillowy and delicious - Butter Poached Lobster with Jeruselum Artichokes: done perfectly; the lobster was delectable, but the artichokes were the surprise of the night- roasted perfectly and delicious - Roasted Mushroom: great accompaniment to the entree - Apple Cobbler: yummy but definitely not enough for 2 people and completely overpriced at $24.  - Ice cream Sandwich: TINY and also completely overpriced. Crazy. A klondike bar would have sufficed. the sandwich was so blah  Loved the appetizers and entree. The desserts were lame. Overpriced and not very good. I'd recommend walking to DT Bistro down the street for dessert  Service was snobbish and inconsistent. 2 of the servers were nice, the host was a snob and a couple of others were just weird.   Thank goodness this was a business dinner. Good meal, but definitely a tad overpriced"}
{"text":"I came here for summerlicous and it was surprisingly awsome!!!!  I tried lots of summerlicoui/winterlicous every year, most of time food were okay but not too impressed.   However Splendido just impressed me with their food.  We picked Salmon and beef tong as appetizer Main: pork and seabass  Appetizer were delicious and seabass were perfectly cooked and seasoned.   Desserts were okay.   Overall i were really happy i choose to go Splendido this year.  I will definately go back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"I have never written a review in my life but feel compelled to do so because of how wonderful this restaurant is. From the moment we walked in the door, the service was outstanding. They take your coats, offer a place to put your purse, and escort you to your seats in a timely manner. The flow/communication between servers was fantastic. I have never been so impressed by the level of detail for which they provide their customers, including acknowledgement of any dietary restrictions/allergies (call to reserve and they will ask these details beforehand). We had a wine sommelier consultation, a chef giving insights, and great/attentive servers throughout the night. Food was fantastic. The sashimi was to die for. I wish I could order this over and over again. Some dishes are a bit salty (agnolotti) and complex in presentation (could be simpler), but overall they had great attention to detail and wonderful flavour combinations. Atlantic Char was delicious (slightly salty sauces but tasty with the truffles); pork was very flavourful/creative. The black/white truffles are a must! They offer the option to halve your portions as well. Very accommodating for dietary restrictions (eg. vegetarian).  I would highly recommend. If we were to visit again, we'd try the steak (looked great) and truffle menu. Really great places for a special occasion. Love Splendido!"}
{"text":"Oh mahhhh gahhhh.  sooo tasty.  I heard about this place for a long time but never bothered to go just because I always feel like Italian food is an overpriced experience.  (Even though if you look at my reviews of Italian restos in Toronto they seem to be quite high...).    The Good: The food is incredible and the service is incredibly memorable and well-choreographed; knowledgeable.  I don't even want to say anything about the food because I want you to experience it w. completely your own expectations and get blown away just as every other yelpers has here.  The Hot&Cold The wine list is LARGE but kind of on the pricey side.  And not enough wines by the glass.   (The menu did have a few options but for some reason that night our waiter told us only a couple out of what was listed was available- he was more than helpful in trying to help us pick a wine out). I am a very firm believer that ANY good restaurant should have a wine list that has at least 5 reds, 5 whites and 2 sparklings by the glass that range evenly between 9-25$. And then an extensive wine list by region with 15-20% of the list below 70$; 60% of the list in the \"affordable\" to \"it's a treat\" range= 70-175ish; and then the rest in \"baller\" category that us several hundred to over the top 1000$s  (which is RIDIC, btw). The wine list had some good variances on price but skewed to the higher end.   When I say that this is the breakdown I'd like to see in ANY resto I mean even the high end places.   Regardless, they had a White Burgundy - two in fact.  and that is rare at any resto. (ps: White burgundies are the BEST as starters to wet the appetite or for cream/seafood based starters!).  The What? It's not BAD, per se...but this felt much  more like a French restaurant than an Italian one.  Which is probably why I enjoyed it so much.  The Tip: Go for the regular menu.  Tasting menus are always expensive and kind of disappoint at $$$ restos (or at least in my experience).   The Funny: Anyhow, the food here is incredible.  Like INCREDIBLE.  So incredible that I fought to pay the bill (I like to do that when I'm completely ultra satisfied with a meal- it makes me feel like my money is going to a good home.. or at least a tasty one).  As I was attempting to pull it out of my date's hand, the waiter came by and snapped at me in a friendly effeminate voice and said, \"ooh, girl- you best let him pay.  You're too pretty to pay for that meal.\" Note, I'm FAIRLY sure he was putting on a voice and not like..serious. But seriously, when waiters lie through the teeth to flatter you unnecessarily and it DOESN'T come across as sarcastic or fake?  THAT is grade A skill.   Try this place out- you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings as I write this review.  Splendido is still a splendid place to entertain business guests or enjoy a special occassion dinner, you would not get better service anywhere else, delivered with such finesse and proficiency.  However, the food on our recent visits didn't produce any \"wow\" moment.  Years ago when out of town visitors asked for a sampling of Toronto's finest dining, I would always put Splendido near top of the list.  I will probably hesitate more now...  I am still a fan, hoping to be wowed."}
{"text":"Great ambience and impeccable service.   We are not big drinkers and the waiter suggested a nice fruit spritzer.    The amuse bouche was delicious - a Butternut squash soup shooter and a fluffy pastry with butternut puree.  The complementary bread was also heavenly.  Surely a sign of good things to come!  Ordered the diver scallops and ravioli appetizer.  Scallops were delicious.  Ravioli stuffed with short rib was way too salty.  The chef apologized to us and took it off our bill.  Mains were lamb shoulder and sweetbreads and seabass.  Again lamb was a bit too salty.  The fish was delicious with a nice crispy skin and sweet flesh.  Veggies were sides that had to be ordered separately.  We opted out and there were a few veggies in the main albeit sparse.  This is one of those restaurants all about presentation, small portions, and flavours.  Absolutely great when they get it bang on and disappointing when they miss which they shouldn't when a main costs $38!!!  The ladies room was a surprising contrast to the restaurant.  Small, dirty, and no toilette paper!!!"}
{"text":"Last Friday was my birthday, and my wonderful SO treated me to a delicious dinner.  It's on the more expensive side, so appropriate for a special occasion.  The exterior didn't really impress me with its monolithic grey façade.  The arched doorway and windows helped...but it definitely stood out from the brick of the surrounding buildings.  Once I stepped inside though, all that changed.    One of the things I love about (most) fancy restaurants, besides the food, is the service.  You'll almost always find that these places have fantastic service, and Splendido was no different.  I was greeted by a friendly hostess who showed me to my seat and took my coat.  She even gave me a little stool for my purse.  (Side note - I love when restaurants have a way to help you with your purse, it can be very annoying if you have to hold it on your lap because it'll slide off the back of the chair.)  The interior was beautiful, I especially loved the wooden arch at the entrance near the bar.    We were offered a selection of three house-made breads.  I selected the focaccia and the rye, while my DC had the French white and the rye.  The rye was okay, but nothing special.  The focaccia though...this may well have been the best bread I've ever had in my life.  The seasoning, the soft texture...it was just amazing.  It was even slightly warm.  I wanted a whole loaf.  Apparently the French white was amazing as well, but I was so in love with my focaccia that I didn't even want to try it.  And believe me, I'm always in favour of trying something new, so that should tell you just how good it was.     None of the appetizers particularly appealed to us, so we went straight for the mains.  I ordered the Mediterranean sea bass with mussels, clams, and calamari.  He had the striploin and brisket with mushrooms and bone marrow jus.  We also ordered some tarragon heirloom carrots for the table.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I slightly preferred the accompanying seafood to the fish I had ordered, but that's just a personal preference.  It was all perfectly cooked and fantastically flavoured.    Their wine list was extensive and impressive, even for a wine novice like me - I was very curious what could make a bottle worth $6000, but stayed far away from that price point when selecting my glass.  Even with such a small comparative price tag, my glass of red was very good - and generous.  It wasn't just the third-of-a-glass pour that you would usually expect.  Instead, it was served from a decanter that essentially held two glasses, or at least one and a half.    For dessert, we shared the chocolate and caramel verrine, which was delicious and again a generous portion.  I would have had a little trouble finishing it on my own.  I have to mention too that our server brought out a little plate that held a flat butter cookie with Happy Birthday written in chocolate, a chocolate cookie, and a lit birthday candle.  He also presented me with a birthday card signed by the staff.  It was the elegant equivalent of the servers at a chain restaurant gathering to yell/sing happy birthday and giving you a piece of cake.  I definitely prefer this version.   All in all, it was a delicious meal in a beautiful restaurant with impressive service.  That says 5 stars to me."}
{"text":"From the get go at Splendido you can tell they're trying their damndest to adhere to a higher echelon of service and quality.  The maitre d' and wait staff look genuinely pleased to serve you and make your meal as special as can be.    The dining room is a nice open concept with a partial view of the kitchen.  Decor being smart and sophisticated without being stuffy.  My only knock is the horrid photo displays they have hanging on the walls.  They don't fit and look like they belong in a washroom hallway of the AGO.  For apps we ordered the Frois Gras parfait, Venison Tartare, Ramps, White  Asparagus, Rabbit Parpadelle, and were comp'd 2 Charcuterie boards with a variety of cured meats.  The Frois was melt in your mouth ridiculousness... it's wrapped in a thin layer of butter to enhance the richness of the Frois.  White Asparagus was well prepared with a well balanced flavour and crunch while still pleasantly soft.  For me the Tartare was disappointing.  I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it didn't have that punch of flavour I was hoping for.  The Parpadelle was EXCELLENT.  I kind've wish I ordered it again as my main, but I'll get to that later.  The noodles had an amazing texture and were perfectly cooked accompanying the delicious rabbit and buttery cream sauce.  As for the rest of the board - wow - a great variety of cuts and flavours to round out the prologue of our meal.  For my main I had difficulty deciding and eventually settled on the Free Range Chicken based on the waiter's recommendations.  I've always been curious as to how good chicken could really taste at a first class restaurant with classical training mixed with new age cooking techniques.. but is it better than my spicy big crunch at kfc?  To avoid being too wordy I'll just breakdown what the table ordered point form:  - Butter Poached Lobster w/ B.C. Wild Mushrooms & Mascarpone Risotto * Very fresh lobster, tasted good, but nothing special  - 24oz Boneless Black Angus Rib Steak, Roasted King Oyster Mushrooms, Ontario Green Asparagus Cognac & Peppercorn Sauce * Cooked to perfection, great flavour, thick cut, very juicy, accompanied the mushrooms and sauce very well.  - Steel Head Trout  * By far the BEST thing of the night. This trout is cured then cooked sous vide and then seared for a crispy texture.  This thing just packs a ton of hearty flavour and easily forced it's way into my list of favourite entrees.  - Lamb Shoulder * Very tender and robust flavours, didn't try very much of this, but what I did have, I was happy with.  - My Free Ranged Chicken * This was easily very disappointing for me. The chicken was moist but not juicy enough, and well.. it just tasted like chicken.  The part that was confit'd was nice, but for everyone to be raving about it? I'm convinced there's only a level of deliciousness chicken can attain and even then it's more or less the same.  You don't need to pay $24/per person for this.. but try for yourself.   Afterwards we ordered 4 cheeses, Chateau De Bourgogne, Cape Vessey, Stilton and I'd like to say.. Gouda? I can't remember the last but they were all pretty good but completely unnecessary seeing as I was getting pretty full. Isn't cheese more or less standard everywhere? My favourite of the 4 being the triple creme Chatueau.    For dessert we ordered Brioche Ice Cream sandwiches, Sorbet and Chocolate tarts.  My sandwich was cutesy and flavourful.  Good biscuit  to icecream ratio and not too heavy.  The sorbet was light, playful and refreshing while the chocolate tart was heavy, creamy and dangerous.  All pretty decent quality and a good way to end your meal.  All in all a pretty positive experience dining at Splendido.  Had the waiter not hyped the chicken so much I probably would've enjoyed it more.  A very hot spot to go in Toronto right now for fine dining, even more so since they got that great review in Toronto Life.  The meal was $800+ for 7 people, and would've been way more if we didn't get comp'd on a lot of the apps.  You get what you pay for though - simple food prepared and cooked really really well.  I would definitely recommend it for a that special occasion where you want to get dressed up and have a fancy meal downtown.  Get the trout,  it's that good."}
{"text":"Splendido for me was always the holy grail of restaurants in Toronto. Its' former self was big, glitzy and classy. Tasting menus consisting of 7 courses. Valet service for Porsche's and Maserati's outside on Harbord Street. Friends spread word that they employed an armada of servers to cater to your every whim. So ever since I outgrew my Casey's/Milestone's suburban novice dining phase, Splendido was always on the list for places to try yet I could never find an occasion big enough to merit a visit.   That is until last week when my special yelper friend Christine C decided to mark my last hurrah fancy pants meal in Toronto at the Harbord Street institution. We had singled it out from our shortlist of Sushi Kaji and Scarmouche but eventually settled upon Splendido. Alliterations anyone? And I'm happy to report it didn't disappoint, my maiden visit only served to ignite the sparks of a love affair with this elegant establishment.   I got off to rough start waiting for Christine at the bar for there were two obnoxious frat boy types whooping it up for no particular reason. Note to them: loudness or name dropping does not equate with class or status, got that! Now where were we? Once seated however, we served notice to our waiter (a charming, knowledgeable fella) that Splendido was the winnah of our dining research and that we had come to be wooed and dined over!   And so the party got its footing finally. Our first courses consisted of the foie gras parfait and the ginormous charcuterie board. The charcuterie board was one for the ages, at least 6 selections of cured prepared goodness. You had liver pate, bold venison tartar, whipped lardo, guianciale, crispy pigs ear, mustards, stewed fruit all placed strategically on a round wooden slab-not unlike the colours of a painter's palette! The foie gras parfait was silky and light and it came with toasted brioche and cherry preserves. Very nice way to enjoy this delicacy.   Moving on, we took a breather from our heavy starters to bask in the warm glow of the spacious, airy room taking a view of the drop lighting and the jars of preserved fruits and vegetables at the back. Is it me or has every local food establishment in Toronto employed this \"local house made\" decorating tip? Jars of canned goods are ubiquitous! I'm just sayin'. We sipped our glasses of our Tawse wines (part of their special wine flight program) and were told by our waiter to hold back on our chardonnay for the next course. The suckling pig and the lobster...errr okay! Only the next course was a surprise gift from chef Victor Barry in honour of the occasion: fresh ribbons of pasta with cream and topped with generous shavings of fragrant black truffles!! Sweet mother of Harbord! They had me at the truffles. Chef Barry wandered over during one his tours of the dining room and we were able to share a \"fist-bump\" with him as a show of our appreciation.   Mains were expertly prepared and equally tasty as the preceding courses. Christine chose the poached butter lobster served with chanterelle risotto and snow pea shoots while I enjoyed the sucking pig served with boudin noir. The suckling piggy is tender and comforting replete with a few bits of cracklings for textural contrast. I'm not crazy about blood sausage but Splendido's version was soft, palatable with hints of spice. Christine's dish was absolutely heavenly: buttery sweet chunks of lobster matched with perfectly cooked risotto.   Our tummies heaving with happiness, we took another brief break after our mains to chat with Carlo Catallo the sommelier and co-owner of Splendido. We kibitzed over the recent relaunch of Splendido, regional wine differences and the New York/Toronto dining scene. Like the rest of the staff at Splendido, he's engaging, warm, professional and thoroughly passionate about ensuring a great dining experience. To send us off, he personally delivered two glasses of Ontario late harvest Riesling as a memento of Ontario food and wine. Sweet!   We finish with a deconstructed lemon meringue pie: a pool of tart lemon custard with swirls of sweet meringue on top and a pastry disc on the bottom. Sweet but not cloying.   Meals at places like Splendido can seem excessive given the current economic climate but if you have to something to celebrate or bookmark they're very well worth it. It's exciting to walk into an establishment like Splendido and be transported into a place where food matters. All the more so when it's presented and prepared with such joy and expertise."}
{"text":"'Tis the season - and no I'm not talking about Christmas!  Every year around November, Toronto's restaurants start rolling out their truffle-laden dishes.  From the $100 dish of truffled pasta at Mistura to Café Boulud's extravagant $325 white truffle tasting dinner - \"truffles errwhere\" as fellow food blogger Carmen Yung puts it.  Since it had been some time since I last visited Splendido, I decided to check out their $85 black truffle tasting menu ($35 supplement for the foie + brioche dish).  Splurge and go for the whole nine yards; you won't regret it.  Your belly is always in good hands with chef Victor Barry, who took home the bronze at this year's Gold Medal Plates. We shared the tasting menu and it was plenty.  The evening starts out with an amuse-bouche of Lentils du Puy soup with a coriander chiffonade, crème fraîche and onion + chickpea bhajee.  Served in a shot glass, the soup was lipsmacking good and a great way to warm up from the outside chill.  Selections of breads included Country (my favorite), Rye and Potato which would come in handy later to sop up the egg yolk from the raviolo. But I digress...  The meal starts off with a warm Matsutake mushroom \"salad\" with sunchoke two-ways (roasted and puréed) with truffle snow (a little molecular gastronomy for ya) and garlic chips.  I loved the different textures that came into play with this dish and the nuttiness of the black truffles married well together.  The next course is the Rougié Farms seared foie gras + brioche with an Albufera sauce composed of chicken jus, Madeira and duck fat.  We take the sommelier up on his recommended pairing of Belem's 10 year-old Madeira and it is a beautiful pairing.  The buttery brioche sops up the sauce and is a great edible serving platform for the rich slab of foie.  This was definitely my favorite dish of the evening.  The foie is followed by the Egg Yolk Raviolo stuffed with Parmesan, Ricotta, spinach and nutmeg.  The egg yolk is cooked to a golden yellow and the server hesitates to remove our dish until we've sopped up all the goodness with some bread.  The raviolo was sprinkled with a generous sprinkling of truffles, but they play a secondary role here.  I think I would've much preferred the linguine with Parmesan and truffles (available for $22 off the regular dinner menu); the simplicity of ingredients allows the truffles to play more of a leading role.  The final dish from the tasting menu is a  Cumbrae Farms Rib Cap with roasted sweetbreads, cippolini & veal jus - a rich finish to an already indulgent meal.  The sweetbreads were cooked perfectly; with the mouthfeel of a creamy, deep-friend oyster.  As my dining companions taps out, I race for the finish line and order the Lemon Meringue for dessert; a deconstructed dish of toasted coconut and ube ice cream.  I pair this with Tawse's Cabernet Sauvignon Icewine.  The kitchen ends things on a sweet note with Orange + Beet Bonbons and Maple Syrup +and Brown Butter Marshmallows.  I can't say I was a fan of the almost-too-earthy taste of the bonbons, but the marshmallows made me want to start a bonfire and wedge these pillowy soft treats between Graham crackers and sing campfire songs.  Service throughout the evening suffered from the \"too many hands in the cookie jar\" syndrome as several servers tended to us. Service is seamless at first as the front of house staff weave in and out invisibly to clear our table after every course but then careless at times; two sides never arrive at our table and coffee arrives only after a gentle reminder and when dessert has been all but cleaned off the plate.  A very unusual experience for me as service is always impeccable.  The damage at the end of the day was about $250 all-in.  At the $85 price point for dishes crafted by one of the city's most talented chefs; it's a small price to pay."}
{"text":"The.food.doesn't.stop.coming in this place. The portion sizes are small (obviously to accommodate how many there are) but I was beyond stuffed. They had some really interesting dishes that I enjoyed and others I simply couldn't get into. The staff were great and this is a very intimate style of venue - not very many tables, spread out nicely. It's rare to find space in restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"I guss I had high hopes for this restaurant when I took my mom for Mother's Day.  With all the rave reviews, I expected excellent service, big portions and excellent food. I was slightly disappointed by all.   Upon arriving, we were seated in a quiet spot in the back.  Overall we were served quickly, and the food was okay, but nothing as spectacular. Here's my rundown.   Liked:  - stool for my purse  - drink menu first, then the food menu and immediately asking about water the moment we sat down  - friendly staff, and efficient service (in terms of speed)  - foie gras terrine with brioche (which my parents kept calling cake bread)  - very good with the rhubarb side and the perfectly toasted brioche $18  - the new vocab my parents learnt when we got out canapes with red pepper aioli and paprika  - the lamb shoulder (tender and flavourful) $38  - butter lobster risotto. perfection. but too small. it was creamy, and al dente $37  - sorbets for $10 (3 of them) My parents didn't really like how they were not really sorbet with ice, but more like a half melt fruit ice cream. I agree but I still liked it.   - flight of 4 wines (2oz each - $22) shared with my mom  because I don't drink that much, and it was a perfect size  - car and my jacket was ready as I was walking out the door without even asking   Did not like  - minimum price for a glass of wine was around $12 for 5oz  - $14 valet charge which I found out only when it was added to the bill.  for a restaurant like this, I would expect free valet from a resto like this. DO NOT PARK VALET (-1)  - bread was not warm  - being served by ten different people. little confusing.   - canapes were served, then taken away once, when I didn't get a chance to touch it. It was then taken away again before my main course arrived (-.5)  - they did not sweep after taking away the bread/apps even tho there were clearly crumbs everywhere (-.5) indonsistant, bc some of the reviews state that they were  - quite small portions. I expected bigger given some of these reviews.  - desserts are expensive ($12 for a tart)  overall, the service definately wasn't to par, especially for the amount I\"m paying per meal. They are trying, but I don't think the instruction is very good. the food is very good, but I expect a lot more for that kind of money."}
{"text":"A very fancy dining experience. Service was wonderful and the atmosphere is romantic. Quite expensive but worth it for a special night out."}
{"text":"If you are a Toronto foodie, and even if you are not, you would likely already know the history of this restaurant.   Not having dined at the 'old' Splendido, I'm only going to comment on it as is. The room is open with cool blue hues, and wood slats adding some warmth to the wide open space.  The wall of preserves which separates the kitchen from the dining room adds another dimension of colour and character to the restaurant. We were off to a good start when making the reservations since we had some last minute changes and advised them that would be bringing our own wine as well.  Polite and efficient, we were seated a nice round table, perfectly conducive to the lively conversation in our group. Let me start by saying this: The sommelier is useless.  He was cold and robotic, made no attempt to engage us at all and even disappeared without opening our 3rd bottle.  So what if we didn't order from their wine list. One would think that at $30 corkage, he'd have at least kept our glasses full.  Our server, while friendly and cheerful seemed to be pushing certain items. (I suspect that was by instruction more than her own volition). I must admit that the pappardale with truffles was unctuous and would definitely have been remiss had we not ordered it.  Pasta is pasta you say but I don't mind ordering a dish that special.  - I can count on two fingers the number of times I have had truffles so maybe that had something to do with it.   As for the other dishes - most of our table had the steak.  Two of us opted for the suckling pig - Crisy crackling draped over a blood pudding sausage and deliciously moist pork bits - so good!   The other sides that we ordered to share were middling at best (fries, mushrooms, collards) and not worth commenting on. As for dessert - sticky toffee pudding with rum raisin ice cream was really lovely with a nice hint of ginger and spices to round off a rich meal. I enjoyed the food at this restaurant but was not blown away by anything (except the truffled pappardale) and the spotty service at Splendido is a definite detraction."}
{"text":"I was here for Summerlicious 2015 last week. I had the salmon sashimi appetizer and it tasted very fresh and delicious. The rice cakes were amazing too - perfectly crispy on the outside with chewy centres.. I wish I had more of those! My main course was also salmon, and it literally melted in my mouth with every bite. However, the brussels sprouts were a bit too salty for my taste, but if I ate it with the salmon, it was much better. I was looking forward to the dessert the most, but it was a bit disappointing. The strawberries & cream seemed almost too simple - I'm not sure how to explain it, but I feel like I had to mix all the ingredients together before I could take a bite. It didn't taste bad, I just expected something more exciting. Overall, I would recommend this place for Summerlicious if you're looking to try a really expensive restaurant but don't want to pay full price. I think the menu is worth it!"}
{"text":"Four of us dined...and we all concluded it was a night of excellence.  The food was simply stunning. All the appetisers received compliments however the Crisp Asian Pork Belly salad was the unanimous choice as best on the night.  The  entrees were all mouth watering - the Scallops were simply outstanding. The Tortelloni was really good too. The sides of leek and brussel sprouts were tasty. We enjoyed a wonderful Australian Mitolo Shiraz which  complimented the food. The chef joined us during the night and warmly engaged in conservation which added to the nights atmosphere. An excellent restaurant and I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"It was my aunt's birthday last week so I decided to take her to Splendido on Saturday night.   On Friday morning, it dawned on me that I should probably get a reservation if I wanted to make this birthday dinner happen. Using OPEN TABLE, I was able to quickly do so. The reservation was made at nine o'clock in the morning and a representative from SBG called a few hours later to confirm. Convenience is key! Make sure to claim your spot in advance though. Being the last minute person that I am, by booking a day in advance, I was only left with the 5 PM slot.   To begin, I ordered a glass of the Sauvignon Blanc and the aunt ordered the Merlot. Both the aunt and I were content with our selections. We were able to later appreciate its pairing with our meals.  I ordered the Carnaroli Risotto, which was absolutely delicious! I love mushrooms and this risotto was packed with them. The texture of the rice was just right and there was ample of shaved cheese on top. From a glance, it doesn't look like a big portion; however, it is quite hearty and I was quite full when finished. The aunt ordered the Whole Wheat Linguine that had heaps of crab chunks in it.   For dessert, we ordered the Niagara Spy Apple Cobbler for two. The presentation of it was so unique [refer to photo]! It was not too sweet, which is always a good thing when it comes to dessert.  The service was great .... waiting staff knew the menu well and were quite professional. Our server was the epitome of handsome; the rest of the staff were all well-dressed in their SBG uniform.   Come here for a special occasion ... if you have an unemployed friend who wants to treat you here maybe suggest another establishment though.   Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"wow..! the best birthday meal ever..!  not only the food, but the service was impeccable..!  they even gave me little seat for my chanel which should not be hung on the back of the chair..! great job on the satisfying all expectations!"}
{"text":"I ended up here for my birthday and had the fall truffle menu which was absolutely delicious though I must say it might be a few years before I have another dish with truffles in it again.   This is a beautiful place with an excellent bar. The martinis are specially crafted and can be easily customized to meet one's taste preferences  So pretty much every dish I had had truffles in it. Everything was not merely delicious, but decadently so. The amuse bouche was an early surprise in the form of a squash soup in a shot glass followed by a tiny pastry. I had a ravioli, a dish with sweetbreads, a chocolate dessert, and some other things that I cannot recall not because the dishes were unmemorable but because at some point that evening, aided by the tasting wines and martini, I slipped into a blissful food coma.   Given that it was my birthday, I was brought a candle, card, and cookies at the end of the night by compliments of and signed by the chef. It was a nice touch.   In a nutshell: the dishes are artfully crafted and well thought out as are the drinks. The service is very fine; they pull out the stops from helping one in and out of her coat to bringing a side stool for one's purse.   The bill for two people each having a martini, a 4-5 course meal complete with accompanying wines, and an extra dessert was well into the $300s. But well worth it for a special occasion with a special person."}
{"text":"3.5 stars--- Visiting Toronto from Boston. Had high hopes based on yelp reviews... but ultimately I think Splendido thinks they are a lot more splendido than they really are. Food was very good, but portion size was underwhelming... even for haute cuisine standards, service was ok (friendly but took forever to get our food), ambiance was nice, but a tad over-priced and they had quite the pretentious attitude."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place where their menu changes every couple of days.  Decor is pretty modern that feels airy, not at all congested.  Service was pretty attentive, food came out a little slower however.  We each ordered an app and an entree, shared a dessert and the dinner was more then 2 hours long.  I didnt mind because I had no other plans, but it did take awhile.  The food: I ordered the butter poached lobster with peaches n cream/mint/tarragon/corn.  The lobster was just very slightly overcooked, but was delish.  The wifey had the foie gras parfait served with pistachio and blueberries, which was also rich and delicious.  The entree: I ordered the suckling pig which came with blood sausage, pork belly and other goodies.  I wish the suckling pig and pork belly portion was bigger!  The wifes entree was heavenly, a agnolotti with spinach/ricotta and black truffle.  Dessert was also pretty good as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone outsider or local.  Most of the people were dressed business casual."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago my husband and I were looking for somewhere to eat near my office. When the first, more affordable, place we tried had no tables free (no reservation on a Friday night, what was I thinking?!), we decided to try our luck at Splendido. While there were no tables available in the main dining room, there was a table for two near the front window. The food would be the same and they would \"try\" to ensure the service was the same. In short, the service was impeccable all evening. From the very beginning they got it right. I was asked if I had any food allergies as they were taking our coats (yes - gluten) and promptly brought our sparkling water. The waiter/sommelier was brilliant. He made recommendations throughout the night and was just a lot of fun to have around. There were a number of people serving us, but it was clear that he was the primary. Throughout the meal we let him offer suggestions on the wines and they were brilliant choices indeed. Not always on the menu, but always delicious. We started with cocktails and then the Charcuterie Board. While the meats were amazing - perhaps not the wisest choice when one can't have the bread. The fois gras was absolutely to die for! We followed that up with the steak for two, and fries substituted for the gnocchi. The steak was cooked to absolute perfection  and the fries were delicious. It also came with beautifully sauteed mushrooms. After the main we went for the cheese board. We selected three from the choice of 8 and were provided with the perfect wine to pair with it. Let me tell you - I STILL dream of the cheese I ate this night. It was pure, dairy heaven that tasted like caramel when paired with the fortified wine we were given. After this my husband had the chocolate tart and I had the sorbets. Which were also both brilliant. Yes, this place is expensive, and as our night went on we realized that we didn't know the prices for half of what we were ordering. However, when the bill came it wasn't nearly as high as I thought it would be, considering that we had cocktails, appetizers, a main, cheese, dessert, drinks with each course and espressos afterward. I find it interesting that there is so much talk of portion size in these reviews. The portions here were completely reasonable given that they intend for you to have multiple courses. Besides, since when was the quality of GOOD food measured on portion size?!  Anyway, I would give this place way more than 5 stars if I could.  It's the perfect night out when you're prepared to splurge."}
{"text":"One of the best culinary experiences! We order one tasting menu and one regular menu so we would get the best of both worlds of trying all the variety while get bigger portions of the most popular dishes. It was a great decision because the tasting menu was a must-try for the full dining experience. Every dish was plated skillfully and cooked perfectly. I don't think there was a thing we didn't like out of 20 combined dishes we got (around 20 between the 2 of us, there were so many I lost count lol)  My favorite dish was the black truffle egg yolk ravioli which was an extra add on but SO WORTH IT!! Such generous portions of black truffle and the ravioli was cooked perfectly with the egg still yolky and deliciously seasoned.  Definitely a place for special occasions as the whole dining experience lasted for 3.5 hours and is could be quite pricey if you have add-ons (option to add cavier or black truffle ravioli).   Finally the service was excellent. The staff was so tentative and helpful. They even wrote us a card for our anniversary! Overall wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"The service here is bar-none the best in TO. If you want to dine to impress, definitely worth going. The food however takes a back-seat and isn't going to blow anyone away. Overall experience is top-notch but I'm partial to food before flash."}
{"text":"The tasting menu is exquisite. It's definitely for the adventurous and I would dare say more mature palate. The 7 courses offer the full diversity in exotic Canadian fare. My taste buds savored the Dungeness Crab Salad and I could have had 7 servings of the Poached Nova Scotia Lobster, and the Wild Digby Scallops were were sweet and delicate with a touch of apple and walnut. I could walk you thru a few of my less favorites (I'm just not a connoisseur of foie gras or boudin noir) But ultimate this meal was wonderfully extravagant. On a side note we chose to pair each course with wines from Canada and I'm not sure if I would do that again.  Altho it was fun to sample the wide variety I did not find them too drinkable.  They say to allow at least 2.5 hours to fully indulge in the meal and we did.  A totally pampering experience."}
{"text":"I was really unimpressed with this restaurant. I advised my waiter that I am lactose intolerant and he said that was completely fine, that we would still have an incredible dining experience. Everything I was served was minus dairy, and had nothing substituted. When dairy is a staple in a meal, taking it out does not make it \"just as good\". Their bread that the waiter raved about was not good. The fois was full of cream and made me sick, and was not even good. One substitution for me was steamed corn, and when I sent it back I got nothing in return. The steak was way over cooked, medium well, and I was not asked how I like it so I didn't finish. I left hungry paying a $450 bill. Needless to say, I will not be back. I compare this to George in Toronto, which is actually less expensive, and they are not even in the same world. The server disappointed by not resolving the situation. I usually tip 20% and feel uncomfortable doing less! but he didn't do anything when I said the food was not good and explained the situation to the manager. He didn't even come by my table, let alone say anything.   Really too bad because it's the type of place I should like. Save you time and money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The perfect anniversary dinner.  Don't let the nondescript exterior fool you.  Excellent food and service.  Everything we had was honestly amazing, down to the complimentary cheese-filled pastry and shot of chilled soup to start the meal and the mini-dessert at the end.  And on our way out, the hostess chased us down to give us some shortbread cookies for the road.  My wife and I both agree that this was one of our favorite meals together.  Look forward to returning our next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is not going to be a raving review and I really wanted to love this place but am honestly a little disappointed. The best part of dining at Splendido is the beautifully set bar and dining area with soothing art work on the walls, complimenting textures and subtle colors. A+ on the first complimentary corn soup taste in a shot glass and even the Gazpacho was pretty tasty even though quite different from an authentic spanish Gazpacho but that is fine. The best dish was the 2nd course Pasta even though it was listed as a Risotto: Carnaroli Risotto, Peaches'n'Cream Corn Black Truffle & Parmigiano Reggiano, really really delicious all three bites of it:) Then the main courses unfortunately nothing special including the disappointing Yukon potato side of frites....mediocre in texture and kinda blah in flavor. I had the Halibut, the veggies and sauce splatter it was served with struck me as an attempt of a 5star dish but with the first bites it left me rather unimpressed. I am only so incredibly picky because we're talking about a top tier priced restaurant that is clearly trying to swim with the big fish...the moral of my review: it's OVERPRICED for what you get. The wine mark ups were also outrageous as we own some of those bottle at home $40-60 but they charge about 3 times the price. 2nd disappointment or failed expectations were the attempted consideration of special occasion, well we were celebrating our wedding anniversary but nothing was done to highlight our \"special occasion\", it's fine but then don't ask and do nothing with the answer we give you?!  Then I went to the restroom, OMG, you claim to be this upscale restaurant and then your toilet seats look like a bulldog was left hungry and chewed it up??? 2stars for the running water.....zero for elegance or lack of. The Lobster menue probably would have been a more stimulating experience but neither my husband or I thought a full menu with only Lobster sounded appealing.... Overall 3 Stars in my book, potential for more YES but still in training to live up to the set expectations...$$$$......For special occasion go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my one Toronto must when I visit.  My wife and I love this restaurant.  We are greeted like old friends and treated like royalty.  The food is superb and the wine recommendations are perfect.  Victor (owner/chef) makes rue to stop by say hello and ask what you've ordered or how you enjoyed the meal.  And any special needs are graciously accommodated. In short, we love Splendido."}
{"text":"The most incredible dining experience I've ever had. Right from the Valet on the street to the well-timed service, this restaurant is the epitome of fine dining without pretension.  As you walk in you are greeted like a VIP by the Maitre d', or owner of the restaurant and offered a glass of Champagne from the menu.  We had ours at the bar, while perusing the extensive Bordeaux list. The bartender was as knowledgeable as any Sommelier I've spoken with and was patient and friendly while helping us select a bottle. Then- with panache, the Maitre d' fetched the chosen bottle and decanted it immediately so it would be at its peak in time for our main course.  It was time to move into the dining room. Splendido works as a team, with all staff at your service at all times. Our lead waiter Adly was perhaps the most charming fellow we've ever had in any restaurant. His knowledge of the menu and pride in the restaurant was infectious and set the tone for an incredible evening.   Here were some food highlights:  Mid-Course Gnocchi: Melts in your mouth, my long-passed Italian Grandmother in Heaven would have been beaming from ear-to-ear.  First Course Scallops: My fiancée told me they were prepared to perfection and the truffle oil added the 'extra something' that sent her taste buds soaring.  Main Course Lamb: A perfect medium-rare, and complimented perfectly by our bottle of Chat. Haut-Marbuzet (2003), served in beautiful Bordeaux stems. This Lamb was our favourite dish of the evening, well-accompanied by the Monforte Ricotta & Spinach Tortellone.  The restaurant also offers a tasting menu, but we chose À la carte and were completely satisfied by the timing of our custom-made four-course meal.  Thanks for reading my review. I would recommend this restaurant above all others in Toronto for an intimate, romantic and adventurous culinary experience. Cheers."}
{"text":"One of the most memorable meals I have had in the city (and certainly ranks up there in my all-time list).  Ambiance was unbelievable and the service was impeccable (the server actually made note of an offhand comment by one member of our group about creme brulee and tried to see if the chef could make it especially for her).  The meal is expensive, without a doubt, but you truly get what you pay for.  The lamb dish I ordered was heavenly, but so was just about everything we ordered.  If you have a special occasion or want to impress out of town guests, you will be hard pressed to do better than Splendido.  Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"To start off, I ate here as a guest at a wedding reception. Wedding reception good is usually always standard/average, I've come to expect that. But the food that Splendido served was above that standard. The main I got was a steak and it was thoroughly enjoyable. Service was also great.  Despite this experience, I don't know if I would come back. Prices might be a little too steep than my ideal."}
{"text":"It's great when you really love a restaurant but when a restaurant really loves you back it's a whole different ballgame. Splendido put a big heart on for my sister Yelper, Deanna and myself and showed us some big time loving. Deanna had chosen Splendido as her swan song high end restaurant before embarking stateside so we set off for Harbord Street with big anticipation. Chatting up our waiter Deanna let him know that Splendido was her choice (she was flipping back and forth between Sushi Kaji & Scaramouche) and that we came to eat!   I never thought I'd ever say this but I actually think I found a Charcuterie Board that I liked better than my most beloved Black Hoof. Served up on a large piece of petrified wood the Splendido Charcuterie board is un-fucking-believable. Please excuse the vernacular, it is just difficult to put it any other way. The board could easily be shared by two people as an app. It's loaded with everything from Foie Gras parfait mousse, several types of house cured meats, macerated cherries, venison tartar, chicken liver pate, Lardo (or something akin to it), bread sticks wrapped in porcetta, poached plum and apple and on and on. This board has colour, texture, it's got sweetness, it's got savoury happening and it's got some bite with spice.   For mains I chose the Butter Lobster with chanterelle & mascarpone Risotto and Dea selected the Yorkshire Suckling Pig.   We opted for the wine flights to accompany our food. Tawse Winery was the featured wines and the flight included 4 different glasses (the flight is priced at $26) which said 2 ounce pours. So let the love begin...because they were very generous pours. Our waiter brought the first two (a Chardonnay and a Sauv. Blanc) and suggested to us to \"save\" the Chardonnay and as it turns out there was a wonderful reason for this. The waiter surprised us with a course of one of the most amazing pastas I've ever eaten. It was fresh Tagliatelle covered in shavings of Tartufi. Our nostrils were absolutely overwhelmed by the aromatic scent of the mushroom as he put the plates down. He told us that Chef/Owner Victor Barry had sent them out for us to benchmark this special occasion.  We washed down our pasta with the honey coloured Tawse chardonnay. Oh Splendido, you really know how to show a couple of girls a good time.   Mains were stellar. Crackling pigs ear to be crunched and beautiful fresh lobster meat to be worshipped. The risotto was was an absolute thing of beauty. It was smooth and silky, kissed by mascarpone and flavour enhanced by the chanterelles.   We finished off the evening with the Lemon Meringue dessert. It was sweet and tart at the same time (much like us!) and was a lip smacker. So just when we thought we'd seen all the love we can handle, Carlo Catallo, the owner, who had already stopped by our table to chat wines, stopped by one more time, with some gorgeous late harvest Riesling in tow to enhance our dessert moment. He wanted to make sure we finished up our Splendido experience on a happy and positive note. Boy, this guy is one sweet talker.   What a night. The chef stopped by to ask us about the pasta and of course we fawned over him as if he was Brad Pitt. I left my heart on Harbord Street that night with a memory of simply one of the best dining experiences I've had the good fortune to indulge in.   My last words about Splendido would be that while it may seem pricey, you can indulge and enjoy some of their deliciousness by just sitting up at the bar, imbibing in one of their fantastic cocktails and ordering up a Charcuterie board for two.  Then again, you might get lucky as Dea and I did, having the restaurant comp us the pasta and the dessert wine.  Absolute class all the way.    Splendido, until we meet again...ti amo."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service - and over the  Winterlicious season too, so bonus stars for them!   They served the best winterlicious meal this season - hands down.  The food was brilliantly prepared, and their attention to the finer details was obvious in the dishes they brought to our table.    Though all dishes were great, the highlights were definitely their porchetta and duck confit.  The porchetta was done so perfectly, the flavours were so abundant and the texture was spot on.  The duck confit was delicious.  It wasn't a whole piece of duck, rather it was confit duck pressed into a rectangular piece.  The meat was so tender.  Service was extremely attentive, creating a non-pretentious and very inviting environment.    I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Splendido is a classic restaurant that has never failed to deliver for me. It's a great option for a special occasion where you don't want to fight a crowd to get a table/reservation, but still want great food and service with a little something something. They always go the extra mile, especially if you let them in on the occasion."}
{"text":"Wow! Splendido did not disappoint! My husband went for our anniversary dinner and they really put on a great meal.   The service was timely and friendly. The food was amazing. We had (amuse) a cold split pea soup with a goat cheese \"puff\" (I can't recall the actual name) AND a smoked oyster on a potato foam with a mini chip on top. Both complimentary. For our \"app\" we split the egg yolk raviolo, again amazing. We decided to split our main course which was chicken and gnocchi with a thai basil crispy chicken thigh salad. We cleaned our plates. Again, we split the strawberry Mille-feuille and we also given complimentary sweets that consisted of a rhubarb bon bon, salted chocolate cake and a mocha marshmallow. It was seriously an amazing meal and to top it off the wine was great and on our way out the gave us a wee box filed with short bread cookies and a card for our anniversary. If you are looking for a special night out we would really suggest you try Splendido! It is as the name says, splendido!"}
{"text":"Rest in peace. Have only been twice but both times i was blown away by how amazing food can be and how far from REALLY GOOD FOOD my daily diet was."}
{"text":"This place is not cheap, so if pricing is in any way a factor when you choose where to dine out, avoid this place. Splendido is where international foodies, CEOs, and Hollywood types come when they are looking for a Michelin star calibre meal. And when it comes to creating unforgettable dining experiences, this place delivers.   The key here is: there is no à la cart option. This place is for serious food lovers who die for tasting menus. If you go, it is because you appreciate creativity in food and would rather have several morsels that stimulate your taste buds in different ways than have a typical \"appetizer - main - dessert\" type of rhythm to your night.   Service is world class as well. Very knowledgable sommelier (Ellen Jakobsmeier) who genuinely cares that each bite of your meal is accompanied by a wine you enjoy.   And rumours abound of a 'secret' menu for friends of the kitchen...hoping to become one someday."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets.  They were able to find one (just one left) table for 4 for 9pm. We ate until 12:30.  Four of us had the tasting menu, and 3 had wine pairings.  I had a food-allergy, and they accommodated it in the tasting menu.  There were some 18 to 20 courses / amuse-bouche  / extras, all excellent to fine. They wrapped it up with a ginger mix and left a bottle of rum at the table so we could \"dilute as we pleased\" :)  For the tasting menu most dishes were excellent, rest were good, and only 2 sort of 'average' (did not care for grilled fava bean with the parmesan broth). But no stinkers.  The wine pairing was VERY GOOD to EXCELLENT and went with the dishes. Some pairings were excellent and really magnified the experience. No wine pairing was weak.  Staff is very professional, sort of formal, but in a very playful and fun way. Could hardly be better.  A shout-out to Arthur Bond! \"Have Some Madeira M'Dear!\"  Most importantly, my guests had a fantastic time!  One remarked it was the best meal they ever ate! (and they've traveled the world).  Highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Oh geez dont get sucked into going here.  Cocktails start at $17.00 - my Prosecco and St Germaine was $22.  Food was bizarre to say the least.  I have no idea how the description Italian goes next to this restaurant.  The menu was off the wall weird and TOTALLY OVERPRICED.  My veal chop, which was ok, was $55.00- oh come on!  My friend had a Pork belly dish that was served in a half circle on her dish and presented her with one biteful pieces of different parts of the pig- bacon, pork belly, pate, ears, etc.  Service from the bar lacked a lot- took 1/2 hour to get a drink.  Go elsewhere........there's a ton of places in Toronto to eat."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner.  I've been to the \"old\" Splendido a few times previously, and always enjoyed it.  Our visit this time was flawless.  There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said in the many glowing reviews.  Well maybe one thing:  Be careful when ordering the fois gras parfait appetizer.  You'll dream about it weeks later and wake up gnawing on your own arm."}
{"text":"Splendido is simply the best restaurant Canada has to offer.  The cooking here is top notch - amongst the best you'll have in North America.  It exceeds all 1* restaurants in NA, and many 2*'s.  It is easily the top candidate for a Michelin star in Canada.  The tasting menu is now upwards of 15 courses, and the service is excellent.  Staff is friendly and accommodating, and the Chef will often visit tables to ensure they are having an enjoyable experience.  You should go here as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and had an amazing dinner. We had the summer tasting menu w/ wine pairing. In addition to the courses listed on the tasting menu the chef put together a few extra surprise dishes and appetizers - really a great touch! Service was very attentive and the chef even came by a couple times to bring out dishes and check on us. Overall probably the best meal I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"** Unposted review from 2011 that I just noticed in my \"Drafts\" **  The service here was excellent.  It's a full team effort for every table.  Every server, runner, chef came to our table at least once, during our meal.  We were looking forward to a lobster dish (poached lobster, lobster risotto), but none were available.  We went with the chef's tasting menu and wine pairings:  Corn Bavarois (2010 Fielding Estate Pinot Gris) Roasted Sea Scallop with Pork Belly (2010 Fielding Reisling) Corn & Forntina Agnolotti (2009 Hidden Beach Chardonnay) Squab (2007 Pearl Morissette Pinot Noir) Blueberry Lemon Curd (Maker's Mark Bourbon Sour)  The Corn Bavarois was a great start: light, creamy, and a little sweatness balanced with radish and a touch of chili.  The scallops, combined with pork belly were outstanding balanced with the sweatness of apricots and starchiness of the polenta.  The agnolotti was a nice pasta, but it was a little overkill with the corn.  The truffles didn't compliment the sweatness of the corn, as I had hoped.  (Also, we noticed a variation in the how well each bite of agnolotti was cooked.)  The squab, although cooked wonderfully, seemed to lack the creativity that was given to each of the other courses.  Finally, dessert was a nice finish.  Creative, different.  A surprisingly wonderful, yet simple, journey for the palate.  Very nice way to finish the evening."}
{"text":"Been to 3 Michelin 3-starred restaurants and this place is definitely up there. Must try in Toronto."}
{"text":"In search of a romantic and fancy joint to take my wife for her birthday dinner, Splendido was at the top of many a list.  I won't go into detail about what we had (because it was months ago and I have a lousy memory), but service, food, ambiance, etc. were all top notch. I didn't feel ripped off, and we had a great time.  I shall return."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Toronto (and likely Canada), hands down.  I've come here with colleagues and parents alike and each time the following rules apply: - Impeccable service (almost over the top) - Impressive wine list and sommelier suggestions - Unbelievable food - in the right portions - Out of this world dessert and coffee  Honestly, I can't find better adjectives to define this place...   FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS: - Oysters - Gnocchi - Dorset Lamb - Artichokes to share (side dish) - Chocolate ganache for dessert. You won't regret it.  Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"I was taken to Splendido again this past week for a birthday celebration.    This restaurant is simply incredible.    We were fortunate enough to get to enjoy the blood sausage a second time -- I'm still waiting for them to bring the Elk carpaccio back.   The foie gras (make sure ask for extra brioche) is consistently excellent.   Our servers brought us out a round of complimentary soups, which I will describe as unbelievable because didn't pay attention when they were delivered to our table.   The lamb three-ways over the bed of spicy & sweet roasted red peppers and striploin & brisket with wild mushrooms were delicious.   I know a lot of people like to debate what is the best restaurant in Toronto.  Splendido hands down has that crown."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Not only was the food phenomenal but the service was exceptional as well."}
{"text":"My summerlicious lunch was my second visit here, the first being a regular dinner last year.  This gave me a chance to see the kitchen at work under different conditions.   Splendido deserves recognition for participating in the summer (and winterlicious) promos, which would be called \"restaurant week\" in other cities (3-course meal for $25 at lunch and $45 at dinner).   I tried much of the promo menu options. Everything tasted amazing, but the portions were such that if you are used to a big midday meal, you may want to supplement (and there were some choices available for $8: frites, green beans, and one other). I started with a salmon sashimi, then black truffle agnolotti as my main (delicious, but only 8 small half-raviolis as a main was a little small). The other option, a sea bass, was equally good (and equally small). Lots of flavor and meticulous plating - works of art.   The Desserts reminded me how one shouldn't fixate on menu descriptions in fancy restaurants (what sounds like a side turns out to be a dot from a squeeze bottle). The panna cotta portion of that dessert was the size of a twoonie. Same with the apricot mousse, so don't stress much over the dessert choices, they are all fine.   Everything came with lots of herbs or greens and decoration, so it is absolutely worth it for the theatre and quality, but just don't skip breakfast if you go for summerlicious lunch.  2015 edit: happened to be in area, and just popped in to see if I could dine at bar. It happened to be summerlicious time again, so I got the $45 dinner with a Manhattan cocktail for $10. My impressions from the last review still hold true. The foie stater on this menu in 2015 is an absolute must. The mains are not as impressive as the \"killer app(etizer)\", and don't ask me why they'd want to highlight the small portion of steak by pressing it all up to the side of the plate (see picture). Still amazing presentation and service from my friendly bartender."}
{"text":"Definitely knew that this place had a certain positive vibe, hence booked a table without further ado. The restaurant is located within convenient walking distance of the spadina subway station. The place was moderately busy on a Friday evening. The amuse bouche to kick off the evening was a chilled pea soup with warm gruyere puffs. I had the basil bourbon lemonade cocktail but I would not order it again and my wife had a chianti wine which she quite enjoyed. The restaurant interior is very spacious and tables are well separated from each other, there is also art that adorns the walls which is a nice touch. I only enjoyed the rosemary potato bread from their bread service offering.   We had the following dishes from their menu * Scallop ceviche - very refreshing and packed a lot of flavors, I think the ramp oil adds an interesting dimension not to mention much needed vibrant color :)  * Egg yolk raviolo - This is supposedly the chef's signature dish and it did not disappoint - my only complaint was that there was only 1 piece of it which made sharing tricky :)  * Risotto - intense flavors but just having returned from a trip to italy we did not appreciate the novelty of the dish.  * Sugar snap pea - very creative and we could taste the pea all through. I really admire chefs who take seasonal ingredients and put interesting spins on it.  Service was very friendly and some of their recommendations were spot on! I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion!!"}
{"text":"As I entered Splendido, the GM, Jeff greeted me with \"you must be Ellen\". After that and for the next 3 1/2 hours, I was made to feel like a welcomed friend and not some visitor to a new city. I chose the longer tasting menu, and everything was delicious and creative. Splendido's sommelier was delightful.   Bottom line: Splendido would be the restaurant to which I will return when I visit Toronto again.   I chose the 10 course menu (even though I had promised myself to go with the 5 course menu after a very delicious and filling unplanned lunch at Khao San Road). I was asked whether I had any allergies, to which I said I had no allergies, but requested no sweetbreads, rabbit or olives (really hate olives).   Snacks: cornet (be careful, it leaks on the table from its stand requiring (not by me) a napkin being placed on the table to cover the stain); salmon cracker; oyster; prawn; scallop.   Smoked oyster, potato and chive (did not get the caviar supplement).   Green asparagus, pickled egg yolk, oyster espuma and lemon (the most creative egg in shell presentation).   White asparagus, preserved lemon, morels and creme fraiche.   Bolero carrots, ginger, coriander seed and pumpkin oil.   Victor's foie gras parfait, rhubarb, pistachio and brioche.   Pickled trout, ramps, cultured cream and fennel.   Beet dish (not listed on the restaurant's menu and didn't take notes).   Scallop (think it had black olives). Least favorite dish. This was a substitution for the sweetbreads dish.   Rib eye cap (my favorite beef cut), cipollini, porcini mushroom, sweet onion purée and veal jus.   Perrier Robert cheese. (Adore soft/runny cow's milk cheese)  White asparagus and white chocolate mousse, candied lemon, goat cheese and goat yogurt sorbet (only shaped liked asparagus).   Petit fours.   I chose a 1/2 bottle of Reichsgraff Von Kesselstatt 2001 Auslese from Mosel that paired beautifully with my meal."}
{"text":"Wow, the food and service were amazing. The decor and ambience were excellent. We would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Dare I give Splendido a moderate rating at the risk of Foodie-Nazis dismissing my palate all together?  When it comes down to it, I think honesty is the best policy.  To put matters in perspective, I had VERY high hopes for this restaurant before I stepped foot in it.  We arrived before our reservation time, so we had a seat at the bar and ordered a few cocktails.  I saw that the bartender was very skilled and meticulous with what she was making.  Since my boyfriend was driving, I asked her to whip up something virgin for him.  She made a ginger beer from scratch and even used a foam machine to mimic bear foam.  I ordered the Summer Solstice which was a concoction of lychee, cucumber, and what have you.  After I tasted the drinks, I was slightly puzzled.  After that display of professional bartending, which was fun to watch, the drinks did not measure up to the show.  My cocktail tasted like a flat Soho and sprite and the ginger beer was a little on the vinegery side.  Even though I was taken aback, I was still thoroughly excited about the meal ahead.    We ordered the quail stuffed with foie gras, egg yolk raviolo, and the fish and chips platter for two.  Our waiter returned 10 minutes after we ordered to tell us that they had ran out of fish and they could substitute for another type but it wouldn't be the same preparation, to which we agreed.  This was unusual but completely understandable; my boyfriend was slightly let down because he wanted to see what a $60 plate of fish and chips would look like presentation-wise.    When the quail stuffed with foie gras arrived, we were (how can I put this) a little shocked.  We both had our own interpretation of the plate which were very crude.  These are descriptions I'd never thought I'd use on the presentation of a reputable high end restaurant; I will not share them here because I don't want to offend anyone.  (The picture that I uploaded on Yelp is very well-angled.)  The horror aside, I could see the motif behind the plating.  There were a lot of artistic techniques used like brushing, splashing, and spacing.  If it were a painting, I would comment on the contrast of flow and harsh blotches on the canvas.  Unfortunately, it was my appetizer and it is even less fortunate that the sauce is deep red with a few pieces of brown medallions placed randomly around the centre.  The quail itself was okay but there was very minimal foie gras taste.  I must say that with such bold plating, the taste was very subtle.    After the appetizer, the egg yolk raviolo arrived on a clean plate.  The stark contract in plating from the previous dish could not be more evident.  The raviolo itself looked very rustic and delicious.  When I cut into it, the egg yolk just oozed out into the plate.  Perfect.  It was the highlight of the night.   Then, our modified version of the fish and chips arrived.  There were two perfectly sautéed fillets of sea bass with tartar sauce flavoured butter. It was good but neither exciting nor mind blowing.  The best thing about this dish for me was the side of peas; it was so simple yet the freshness of the peas really spoke for itself.  There is nothing bad I can say about it but I didn't have that \"gasp, OMG\" moment which is what I would expect from a restaurant like Splendido.  The raviolo was great but it was still an appetizer.  How can a movie be good if the best scene happened in the first half-hour?  Okay.  This review has dragged on long enough; time to sum things up.  Despite some unexpected turns, I still think that Splendido is a top notch restaurant.  The ambience is perfect and the service is amazing.  Even though the food did not exceed my expectations, it was still good compared to 80% of what's out there.  When ordering, get something you're really in the mood for rather than focusing on the ingredients. I think this restaurant is good for going with someone you're not too familiar with or family members because of its fine dining atmosphere and relatively \"safe\" flavours."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and the wine list is great. I would definitely go for The Menu rather than The Tasting. I like to eat a lot of hearty food rather than just appetizers. The range of flavours was spectacular but I find that the chefs favourite ingredient was salt. So if you are sensitive to salt I would suggest letting the waiter know. Overall it was a very nice fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Clearly those bambinos and bambinas responsible for naming the restaurant had set the bar pretty high from themselves, and perform to that expectation they did.  A nice way to start was with breadsticks and a dip. Though the breadsticks were fancy, you couldn't tell. Their home baked caraway sourdough bread was good. The warmed olives was a nice touch. Nothing too impressive so far.  \"Arriving early at Splendido means you have the opportunity to try the specials that normally sell out later on in the evening.\" To take advantage of this opportunity, the special had to be ordered! Gnocchi with spot prawns brought in live from BC (which didn't seem so exotic since I live there now). It was perferct. Done up in lemon and some sort of exotic liquor that I forget, all of the different flavours stood out. The gnocchi was quite plain but it was plain gnocchi done perfectly. The spot prawns were cooked perfectly so that their soft and delicate texture still remained. It was perfect.  Next was the butter poached lobster. The first couple of bites were absolutely divine. The butter shone through the lobster nicely. The bed of risotto on which it was laid was perfectly al dente. I'm not big on carbs but I was able to appreciate at least some of the risotto. I couldn't finish it, but I think this was due to my lack of experience with lobster. I don't think I like it that much. The dish was absolutely beautiful, the claw was removed perfectly, as was the tail. It was delicious, but from this experience I realized that I'd prefer mammal meat over lobster.  Some price points to note is that the food is quite expensive but within reason for food of this calibre. The wine is overpriced. The white wine we got was $23 per glass and it didn't blow me away. They also charge for water, which they call Q-Water. What does the Q stand for you ponder (as I did)? Well, what do you think? Well, you're right, that's exactly it. Quality! It seemed a bit dorky to have carafes labeled with Q's which stood for \"quality water\" and then charge for water but I guess it goes through some filtration process. It was good water! Relative to the rest, $3 per person for water that they never let get empty was reasonable. I think you're paying more for the efficient water service rather than the water itself. All in all, compared to the free water at other restaurants, this type of attention is definitely appreciated.  Dessert seemed to be overpriced and nothing on the menu really tickled my fancy so that was skipped. I still wonder that if I tried dessert if I would've thought it overpriced, as the rest of the menu is expensive but it was impressive.  The atmosphere was lovely. Clean lines with a little more traditional flare, done properly though. The music was great. Rarely am I ever impressed by the music in a restaurant, but this one definitely set the mood just right with the music. Nothing romantic, but more like contemporary lounge music.  Overall, a great experience with delicious food and a good atmosphere. I look forward to going back and trying the rest of the menu items."}
{"text":"Full review blogged, a few highlight dishes below:  Victor's Foie Gras Parfait with Lennox Farms Rhubarb Confit, Black Truffle Coulis, Walnut Crumble:  Course six was the first item we would receive from the nightly menu/tasting and whether it was because I specifically requested it when the chef originally offered to cook for us I really cannot be sure, but served in a sized down portion these ethereal cubes of whipped liver topped with vanilla and rhubarb gels were outstanding.  Creamy and robust with the foie itself sourced from Quebec's Rougie and nicely complimented by each ingredient on the plate I particularly loved the manner in which the foie acted as a vehicle to the aromatics of both the vanilla and the truffle while I saved the small baton of brioche for mopping up the rhubarb and walnuts - a delectable nut butter and jelly chaser.  Alaskan King Crab Chawanmushi, Pork Belly, Pickled Kombu, Dashi:  The midway point of the meal would see my favorite course of the evening literally \"swimming\" in umami.  Described as steamed king crab and grilled pork belly atop egg custard in a rich stock of bonito and kombu this inspired dish was as sweet as it was savory and as \"comfort\" as it was complex.  Additionally benefitted by a tableside show where our server poured hot water in a serving bowl studded with river stones, sea shells, seaweed, coriander, and ginger root to release the essence of the sea this was perhaps as 'perfect' a composition as I've had in 2012.  Gaspesie Whelk and George's Bank Sea Scallop with Parsley Puree, Confit Garlic, Fingerling Potato, King Oyster Mushroom:  Having mentioned to another friend that I found Daniel Humm's use of blacks and deep greens both bold and beautiful at Eleven Madison Park only a few weeks prior I was pleasantly surprised when Chef Barry presented this dish to us with an ample discussion of the sourcing, sustainability, and fishing of the whelks.  Generally thought to be a tough 'throw away' item but in this case slow poached to a texture and flavor not dissimilar from burgundy escargot I particularly enjoyed the manner in which the briny gastropods were balanced by a caramelized scallop, gold and violet potatoes, plus herbal notes of garlic, parsley, black olive, and squid ink all present but not overwhelming.  Cumbrae Farms Free Range Guinea Hen, BC Spot Prawn, Edamame Puree, Nori Vinaigrette:  Temporarily reassured by the agnolotti that she would be able to finish the meal our final savory, course eleven, arrived in a substantially larger portion than the aforementioned pasta and much to my delight it featured one of my favorite proteins in two forms - a sous vide breast and a confit of leg along with another duo, that of a fresh BC spot prawn and spot prawn mousse along with briny nori and shellfish emulsion, corn 'powder,' and both whole and pureed edamame.  Tender and moist, pure and fresh, a 'surf n' turf' in both the proteins and the vegetation - yet another sophisticated course from a kitchen firing on all cylinders.  Maple Syrup Smoked Ice Cream, Shortbread, Almond, Cotton Candy:  Described by Barry as a dish inspired by a meal at Alinea our final course of the evening would arrive in a large bowl and while I cannot say the presentation was up to par with what is coming out of Achatz's kitchen, the flavors and the textures were certainly close.  Beginning first with a rich brown butter gateaux and subsequently adding layers of taste and texture including the profoundly smoky yet sweet ice cream, maldon sea salt, toasted almonds, maple cream, crumbled short bread cookies, and finally maple cotton candy compressed into a meringue this sundae was all the flavors I associate with breakfast dressed up and served at dinner - a concept I'd recently seen at both Publican and Per Se and would love to see more of in the future.  The Verdict:  Even in the finest of fine dining establishments it is rare that a meal with ten or more courses consistently wows, changes pace, and merges modernist technique with locavore sensibility without missing a beat, but on March 30th of 2012 Chef Victor Barry and his team did exactly that at Splendido.  Shortly after the meal Heather would call it \"the most incredible eating experience of my life\" and while I've been fortunate enough to dine at a handful of restaurants that turned out equal or better experiences I can honestly say that I walked out of Splendido that evening as happy as I've been with a restaurant experience in a very long time.  Yes I admit I am gushing and yes I admit we were apparently \"known\" to the house but I was certainly not privy to this knowledge walking in the door and while I cannot guarantee that anyone's experience will be quite like ours I can say without hesitation that this is a world class kitchen turning out world class food."}
{"text":"4.0. Nice setting, smiling waitresses. Original menu, good presentation. As expected relatively small portions and pricy, but good quality ingredients. Mixing ingredients, tastes and textures is always risky and when the result is good it's to be commended. However, one lacks the woaaah effect, because all ingredients are mixed and merged at a same level. At the end you are not sure whether you ate a toffee cake with a mango (or ginger?) mousse and a vanilla (really, was it rhum raisins?) ice cream, or  a ginger (or mango?) mousse with a small toffee cake and vanilla ice cream etc Each is good but none is really blowing your mind or exhausted by the others. They indeed gently \"compete\" with each other; There is no dominant flavor or ingredient. Which can be good, depending on your expectations and personnal preferences."}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant a long time ago, so this review may not be very applicable.  Also, I know that they deserve more than 3 stars.  Good, then let them prove it...  Sure, this is one of the better restaurants in Toronto.  And granted, the steak main was excellent.  But the tomato salad appetizer was humiliating.  It was 4 slices of tomatoes of different colours, with some dressing.   I kid you not."}
{"text":"Uneven service really hurts this rating. I arrived for a 6:15pm reservation within a group of four. There were only 2 other tables filled at the time. Service initially seemed like it would be okay. Servers pulled chairs for seating and placed napkins on laps. However, there was a major lull between seating and being asked for our drink order, then another major lull before our appetizer then entree orders were taken.  To drink, I simply ordered ginger ale which took a while to receive. I didn't finish it right away, but my empty glass remained that way for the rest of the evening. I didn't want any more, but servers collected my dining mates' empty wine and cocktail glasses and refilled them a few times while they ignored my empty glass and never asked if I wanted more.  Two of my dining mates ordered the tasting menu while I and another ordered a la carte. We've done this a few times at other restaurants without incident. Yet, here, flow seemed to exponentially fall apart as it got later and later. Time between dishes for all of us got worse as the evening progressed. Service seemed scarce. Though I've never seen \"dining time allowance\" before, it's listed on their website as 2.5 hours. Due to what seemed like a lack of a kitchen expeditor, we remained there for 4 hours.  Food was good to great. To start, I ordered \"Victor's Foie Gras Parfait\" (Lennox Farms Rhubarb Confit, Black Truffle Coulis, Walnut Crumble). It was excellent. The portion was just right and the foie gras parfait remained bright in taste and never lumbering. For my entree, I had the \"Cumbrae Farms Rabbit Saddle\" (Ontario Flieschnacka, Glazed Heirloom Carrot and Mustard Greens), which was good, but could have used a little more acid in some component of the dish.  It's a shame that despite good food quality, the reason I won't dine here again is because of poor overall service."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place to dine.    The tasting menu is very expensive.  If you pair it with wine, the price gets pretty ludicrous.  However, it was definitely a dining experience that I would recommend to those who can afford it.  The service and decor are pretty typical for a place like this.  Everything is done elegantly and simply.  The food, in all honesty, i cannot recall what i ate.  But everything and i mean everything was cooked to perfection and amazingly.    Definitely a different experience than nota bene (same head chef)"}
{"text":"Splendido really deserves 4.5 stars, but it's hard to give it 5 stars when frankly, it just isn't as good as the top restaurants in most other cities. That said, after coming here a few times, I can say this is one of the very, very few places in Toronto that \"gets it\" -- spectacular, oftentimes fun, food, and service to match, right down to having your coat ready for you *before* you get to the door. Not nearly as stuffy or pretentious as you might expect."}
{"text":"Splendido! Oh-my-God! I'm in love...   I was here for my anniversary last weekend, and ordered the Fall Truffle menu with the wine flight. The menu was (you guessed it!) truffle themed, so I had the great privilege of trying fresh white truffles for the first time.   Everything they served me was superb... the pine mushroom and truffle salad with jerusalem artichoke puree, the white truffle tagliatelle, the seared fois gras with brioche, the truffled, roasted chicken (and i don't usually go for chicken at restaurants.. but it was perfectly done,and so, so flavourful). For dessert, the chocolate tart was like Snickers on steroids.   No doubt about it, this place is expensive. But it's worth it, every penny, if you really love food. Splendido is about as good as dining gets."}
{"text":"We had its more expensive version of the tasting menu.  There were two, one was $120 a person, another was $170 a person.  The \"cheaper\" one offered about 5-6 dishes with more substantial portion, while the other one had close to 20 courses, but with only a bite size for each.  We went away with each person spending about $300 after wine and tips.    The dishes were phenomenal, though after 3 hours of dining, we were kind of a exhausted.  The wait staff was very helpful as they constantly changing our plate, but at the beginning the main waiter/butler was actually not very attentive (he disappeared for about 10 to 15 minutes before he resurfaced... and we also found him a bit difficult to understand).    The place didn't look fancy from outside, and the inside was very clean and minimalist.  There was a group of about 10 women celebrating for something, so it was a bit loud from their laughter and chatter, but overall the environment was actually pretty relaxed and laid back (waiters were dark blue jeans, so no official dress code, but don't show up with flip flops and tan tops either).  At any rate, this is definitely a place for special occasions... and be prepared to spend a few hours to enjoy the good food."}
{"text":"Splendido = Bellisimo = Estupendo!!  As this was a work event, obviously the dollar wasn't an issue so all of us went ALL OUT!!   We had a table for 10+ set up in the wine cellar (which if you ask me, that's why this resto did not get a 5-star rating). Wine cellar = controlled temperature, fair enough, but not for dinner guests.... Did I forget to mention that it is a DEAD ZONE (i.e.: absolutely ZERO mobile reception). I guess it'd be great to go for people who hate those joined-to-hip-with-mobile-device-people\".  As a started I had a foie gras partfait.... which was quite parfait I could tell you. Followed by a lobster risotto with..... (wait for it)...... (drum roll)...... WHITE TRUFFLES (which cost twice as much as black truffles!!!!!! IT WAS DEEEEELICIOUS!!!!! After that, I should call it quits and just enjoy a nice café au Grand Marnier, but no!! People want to ruin my waistline by ordering a nice apple crumble with ice cream =P Let's just say I dint hate that idea per se!!!!  Given that we were right in the wine cellar, suffice to say that drinking was just of convenience...... I honestly lost track how many glasses of wine I downed that night =P   BTW being a sparkling water nut, I was thrilled to find out that they had installed their own water filtration system that transform tab water into clean flat or bubbly water!!! Tho the system isn't exactly my favorite (which is Vivreau if you ask for my opinion), I'm just glad they invested in the proper measures for their clients and the environment. For that, I salute you!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and a gastronomical delight! Inside, the restaurant was hip and the new owners have paid attention to all of the important details - down to little stools for women's purses. The servers did not let your water glass or wine glass ever reach near empty (in fact, I think this is the most liquid I have ever consumed in one sitting). Course after course, everything was prepared to perfection. I would highly recommend the items prepared on the Wood Burning Grill, the raspberry espuma oysters, and the cheese selection - yum! I love that everything came from local farms and the wait staff were very knowledgeable about the food and where it came from. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I enjoy seeking out great eating experiences, high and low, especially when traveling.  This past week my husband and I visited Toronto, and were told that Splendido was the restaurant to try.  It is under new ownership and just recently reopened after a sophisticated makeover.  The interior is all light wood, cream walls, pretty light fixtures and in the back a row of preserves that we had fun trying to name.   I was treating hubby as he had just taken the NY bar, and so I let him decide how much we would splurge and went along with it.  He was definitely in a splurgey mood, and we really enjoyed ourselves. Firstly, I'd like to commend the waitstaff for being so superior.  Never have I seen such a flow, such a team effort.  We probably had between three or four people who took various drink orders or brought us items, yet they all seemed to know everything we'd mentioned to others, and they worked together as one unit - knowledgeable, friendly and courteous.  Our main waiter had actually blended the very cocktail we started out with.  He seemed very interested in getting our opinions on absolutely everything and we loved his spirit. To start, I ordered the Toronto wine tasting but asked that they bring them one at a time.  This way it was like a wine pairing.  I started off with a lovely Riesling that complimented our oysters beautifully.  The oysters themselves were served with three accompaniments, each more delicious.  I never wanted the briny sea taste to leave my mouth.  But, I had to forge on!  To truffled pasta! This was a special as the chef had just bought some incredible summer truffles.  The truffle was shaved all over the top of the linguine and it was absolutely divine heaven on a plate.  I ate this with my second wine, a chardonnay.  We also ordered the chilled pea soup with lobster as an appetizer and although this was very good, we ordered extra bread just to sop up every drop of the truffle sauce. For main courses, my husband ordered the veal chop while I ordered the halibut.  Both were excellent and I loved sneaking bites of the veal with my glass of Pinot Noir.  This was a particularly fabulous glass of Pinot from Tawes winery that I would recommend as absolutely incredible.  My tasting ended with a glass of Cabernet Franc which was good but not nearly as excellent as the Pinot Noir.  We ended with a cheese course and special late harvest riesling.   I would recommend this as a superior dining experience, from the service to the food to all of the little details that made it so special.  They even gave me a little bench for my purse so that I didn't have to put it on the floor!"}
