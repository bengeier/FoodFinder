{"text":"I had been craving a cheeseburger for a month until I stopped into Joe's Wings and Burgers today. My first impression was that the owners, Joe and Jocelyn, are very sweet and welcoming people. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries both were made in front of me and Jocelyn and Joe offered me gravy. The bun was also toasted and tasty which is important to meAll the food was really delicious - I could really tell that the ingredients used were fresh. The fries were also perfectly crispy and golden.The owners put a lot of care into the preparation of the food and this restaurant and it really shows. I will be back for sure. Thanks for the comforting meal!

Update: For those of you who have been waiting for Joe's to re-open, it opened today for business :)"}
{"text":"Such a delicious meal at this newly opened family owned burger and wings joint. Had a tasty cheeseburger and shared a gravy drenched, cheesy poutine with the wife. They make a delicious homemade iced tea that you can refill for free. Would highly recommend this place. Owners are incredibly friendly and warm!"}
{"text":"Great food and people.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood!  

Food is fresh and made to order.  On 2 separate visits, had Cheeseburger, Fries, Poutine, and Wings.  Very reasonably priced.  Great service -- the owners are very mindful about how the food is packed when customers do takeout, to ensure best taste/texture by the time you get home.  

Now each time I go, I will struggle deciding between having the burgers or wings!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood gem.  Tasty burgers and the nicest people.  The poutine is legit!  Give it a try sometime."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Got the cheese burgers and poutine. The burgers were definitely meaty and succulent on fresh white buns. Cooked almost perfectly. 

The real star of the show was the poutine though which we almost got as an after thought. The fries were perfectly cooked. Done all the way through with a nice crispy exterior. The gravy was some of the best I've ever Had. The cheese , the curds and fries just combined to form the most delicious  meledy of flavours.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So we were planning on going somewhere else for dinner but then I stumbled upon the reviews of this place and decided we had to go here instead. For those of you who are drivers, the street parking is free on week nights after 6pm. There is a lot of construction in the area right now with road repairs so we had to park a block West. 

We came in and the two guys working were amazing, super helpful and very welcoming. There's no table service but the one guy brought everything over to us, it wasn't very busy. I think the construction in the area may be reeking havoc on business. 

We ordered 18 wings (6 hot, 6 terriyaki, and 6 garlic parmesan), a bacon cheese burger, and a poutine. So the wings were okay, not the best I've had but still good; I liked the texture of them, nicely deep fried until they were crispy. I really enjoy a spicy, dry rub cajin, these would've been amazing with a dry rub cajin flavour. I do also want to mention, the hot isn't really spicy at all, the terriyaki is similar to a honey garlic, and the garlic parmesan had a nice flavour. 

The poutine was really good, the gravy had a good flavour but it was thinner than I'm used to. The fries themselves were amazing; again, I wished I had a spicy cajin flavouring for these (I like everything spicy). The highlight of the meal was the burger. It was perfectly prepared, the flavours all worked together, the bacon was crispy. Next time I think we will just order 2 burgers and fries. The iced tea is sweeter than I normally take it (I don't usually use very much sugar) but it was really good, and for $.99! 

So you're probably wondering why a 5 star review. Between the pricing and quality of food and the AMAZING service we received, this place is a strong 4.5; we will definitely be back. I highly recommend you give these guys a shot. They've only been around for a little less than a year, support the small business owners!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. The place is closed, and I'm pretty sure it's not the holiday. With all the mail on the floor it looks like they have been closed a while"}
{"text":"Amaaaaazing cheeseburger and poutine combo! Definitely recommend it! Parmesan wings were delicious (had the right crisp texture to it)! Also, I highly recommend getting the homemade ice tea. Can't go wrong with unlimited refills! Last but not least, the owners are amazing! They are very friendly and welcoming and just want to make sure you are taken care of!"}
{"text":"Great new burger and wings place in our neighbourhood. Awesome homemade burgers (great buns!)  and fab fries. Don't forget to try their coffee too, excellent."}
{"text":"I'm pretty excited this place is here. Nice little burger joint in my area. 

My husband picked some burgers up for dinner today with wings and poutine. The burgers were standard but delicious. I enjoyed them a lot. The poutine was also very good. My husband said the wings weren't the best he'd ever had but he still enjoyed them. All reasonably priced as well. 

I'm sure we will be back more than once."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best fast food burger in town. Super friendly service and excellent salads. I go all the time and they never disappoint! Go now!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend decided to check out this place after seeing positive things on Yelp. My Gf ordered the 10 piece wings with fries and gravy and ice tea, I ordered the Cheese burger, poutine and 6 piece wings. I get my poutine in a bowl and there was so much gravy in the bowl it looked like poutine soup, the sauce on the wings was so thin that it didn't stick on the wings all the sauce went to the bottom of the dish. We were so disappointed and would not recommend it to are friends at the moment which is a shame because we like giving are hard earned cash to the small local businesses instead of Big corporate chain restaurants. If you want something tasty for burger or wings for burgers try Mommas Boys burger or No Bull Burger for wings stick to wild wings"}
