{"text":"We LOVE this place! We have had take-out, lunch, dinner and celebration dinner here. The service is great. The food is good and the price is great!

We are from SoCa; sushi is an important part of our life. My son, 8, has been a fan of spicy tuna hand rolls since he was 5. This is the place he chooses the most to celebrate. And yes, he has been to the other \"high\" end places. I like it the most because this is where we are treated well and fed royally."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the crunchy, spicy tuna roll.  The Cowboy roll was good too: tuna, salmon, and shrimp.  

The service was quick and personable, with a downscale decore.  Its clean,  and tasteful inside, but a long, long way from hip and trendy like most other sushi places you see around Madison.

I recommend stopping by if you are out and looking for something quick and easy."}
{"text":"It's a good deal for the price:
lunch - $6+
dinner - $7-13

And of course, for this price, you have to accept that it is not the most authentic Japanese food you will have. 

However, service is good. They provide complimentary edamame appetizer for dinner orders, where as most places charge you for that.

Nice interior decor for a restaurant like this. I'd say it's a place for a quick bite or light dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. reasonable value for the dollar. My Wife and I split a sushi combo. Two chef's rolls, two hand rolls, and two pc sushi. All were tasty, included generous salad, and house (miso like?) soup."}
{"text":"Food - I had the hibachi chicken lunch special, which comes with miso soup and a choice of either soda or california roll. I went with the california roll of course, and the 4pc was done on the spot, not something from a fridge. The hibachi chicken was pretty OK, had to put a bit of extra soy sauce to make the flavor come out. I thought the sushi roll was better, next time when I come here I will definitely try out the sushi menu.

Price - this place has the best priced sushi I've seen anywhere in Madison, if you're wanting some value sushi, this is THE place. For the lunch special it was only 7-9$, depending on what you get.

Service - the waitress (probably owner as well) of the place was so friendly, friend and I thought we'd be coming back. He became a fan of the place instantly. When we were there, it was only us in the entire place, so if you like it quiet when you eat, this is a good choice. I really liked the interior decoration, gave us a very casual and relaxing atmosphere to chat and enjoy food.

Overall - I'd be coming back, maybe even for takeouts whenever I'm craving sushi, because the price is just way better than the stuff you'll find on State St."}
