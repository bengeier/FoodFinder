{"text":"Me and my sister was just looking around prospect to see where we can eat and saw this new Japanese joint.  When I realized this place was a sushi buffet, I was thrilled and quite reluctant at the same time. I'm a sushi lover, and the worst place you can eat sushi is at a buffet restaurant. Why you ask? Cuz most of them are just sitting there for a long time so its no longer fresh and the rice quality is poor that when you freakin dip it into your sauce soy, they just crumble and float away.   Anyhow, the look inside is pretty nice. Staff were so friendly and accommodating. So what's the verdict on the sushi? All I can say is I am quite impressed by it. Its not the greatest sushi I've ever had... but good,decent. I mean hello? Unlimited sushi for $15.99... chow down!  It's no buffet-sushi-cheap-quality, the sushi they have could be on the same level as any other Japanese restaurants in town. The crabs were OK, but at least it was moist and it ain't dry.   What I like about this place as well is that they have a regular menu that offers Japanese and other Asian dishes. Of course, this, you have to pay. We only got one item from the menu and that's the gyoza for our appetizer. All I can say is wow. Possibly the best gyoza I've ever had! I love how its moisture and quite crispy on the outside, not to mention the sauce is a killer! Love it!   Overall its a great place. Highly recommend for sushi lovers :)"}
{"text":"I just ate the best sushi of my life and speaking as a Chicago native who has eaten sushi her entire life that is saying something.  The buffet is 17.95 just under 21$ with a soda. They won't have liquor till next week so I can't comment on that. The sushi though was amazingly fresh, I asked and it is driven in from Chicago but since the Sous Chef wasn't in I wasn't able to confirm that it is flown in but it tastes like it has to be. I raved about the quality of food and service to the hostess/manager and mentioned that the only thing missing was octopus. Her response was to check to see if they had any so she could offer it to me for free, when she found out it they were out she asked if there was anything else I wanted to try.  The sushi wasn't just the normal selection of handrolls. They had a large selection of maki like dragon rolls and spider rolls. They also had a large selection of sashimi and a tuna with peppercorns and sauce that was good enough to make you cry. I ate about 15 pieces with only a few duplicates and enjoyed every one. There worst I could say is that I like my spicy tuna spicier.  The service was amazing as well, our drinks were not allowed to get less then half empty before the waiter was offering to refill. They didn't hover but they didn't ensure that we never wanted for anything. When I went up for dessert which was on small plates the waiter rushed up to help me carry them because I was having a hard time juggling the plates with my cane. He also made sure to offer me fresh fruit and plated it himself before carrying to back to my table.  I didn't order off their menu but watching plates being brought out I could tell that they plated them beautifully with Japanese touches like vegetable flowers. I also asked the man with his son near us how they enjoyed their food since they had said they didn't like sushi. They raved about the goyozas and teriyaki chicken.  All in all it wasn't just a meal it was an experience and one that for under 25$ I will be repeating again soon."}
{"text":"I came here for the buffet and this place is good but.... I have my reservations.  The GOOD: endless sashimi, a wide variety of sushi, oysters on the half shell, crab legs, shrimp cocktail and edamame. They are probably the freshest you can find in Champaign.  They have deep-fried sushi, spicy tuna and ones with sweet potato and imitation crab.  The crab legs are well-stocked and quickly replaced.  The presentation is pretty with drizzled teriyaki sauce and vegetable garnishes. The place is clean and they offer long plates of pickled ginger, sliced melon, pineapple, mushrooms and fruit salad.  They have three types of mousse cake, strawberry, tangerine and coconut which they replace every 10 minutes.  The HUGE \"BUT\":.... I called the day before I came and they said the price was $15.95 for the weekend buffet and they serve dinner all-day.  However when we got there they changed the price \"just that morning\" to $17.95.  I fell for the bait-and-switch. It's only a few bucks but still.... tricky, tricky.  They tended to run out of oysters and drinks are not included.  Conclusions:  The food was of decent quality and the best was the sashimi.  But their price-changing tactics off-set me and you need a little patience as you wait for the chefs to crank out more sushi.  This might be a good option if you LOVE sushi and want to stuff your face. It's a head above compared to other asian buffets in the area.  Only if they offered free soft drinks, miso soup or some seaweed salad to go along with the buffet, I would feel like I could come back again.  In any case I'd order from the menu because it will be less expensive and they won't suddenly change the price on you."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the chance to dine here again.  I was pleased to see the sushi rolls were marked, but think they can do better with their little \"signs\".  There was plenty of sushi this time around.  I think this place is an awesome value for fresh sushi.  For two drinks, the buffet and tip came out to $50.  Pretty good if you ask me since I know we ate more than our share at the buffet.  The service is top notch in this place, our drinks never went empty and plates were cleared promptly.  If I could bump up my rating to 4.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"I actually found out from the Champaign Taste Blog review they don't serve drinks, but they do have free miso soup with the buffet, but you have to ask them for it. I guess they don't automatically give it to people since not everyone likes it.   One other update is that they did raise the price another dollar since I went, so I think it's 11.95 for lunch (weekdays) and 16.95 for dinner.  And I've been seeing a lot of varied reivews for this, but I'm telling you that it's pretty key to try and get there early in the dinner hours for the buffet...there's a difference to what's set out there early/later, especially if you want some sashimi/nigiri sushi. And take advantage of ordering rolls from the chefs as well!! All in all, I keep my rating and will have to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"I am glad it's closed, so I can now share the news that this place gave my husband and I violent food poisoning.   It really did suck, I promise."}
{"text":"Ok, so Sushi 1: Willpower 0.  I couldn't take it any longer!  I just had to eat here.  I was obviously very careful not to eat any raw fish (bacteria and pregnancy issues and all) but was delighted with the variety of things that I could eat.  The iced shrimp and cocktail sauce were divine; not a hint of seafoody unfreshness, and the same with the crab legs.  They were serving a tinier species of crab along with the normal crab legs and they were quite tasty too.    Lots of the rolls included cooked crab, cooked shrimp, and I'm pretty sure cooked eel as well, which was fantastic for me.  They also had a large assortment of veggie only rolls, all of which I can eat, and lots of beautiful sushi with shiny salmon, white fish and tuna, but alas, I'll have to wait till the baby is born to indulge in that delight.  (I'm so happy I actually came to eat here now instead of waiting so that I could enjoy it and also give Kaiyo's a proper review having actually eaten there.)  Also, when we peeked in the first visit when we didn't eat, there was much less variety (it was 1, maybe 1:30 PM on a Saturday), so maybe try and target the place during peak hours.  (But don't let off hours stop you- the sushi still looked fresh even though there was less, and I've heard that you can make requests :)  The buffet comes with Miso soup (which was probably some of the more salty and flavorful miso soups that I have had) and finished with a delightful little plate of chocolate ice cream and fruit.  The service was attentive, but I suspect that they are mainly there to service customers ordering off the menu as there did not seem to be much knowledge of the sushi from the server we had.  He served his purpose well though as dishes were cleared promptly, drinks were refilled when appropriate and soup and dessert were brought out when we asked.    From spying on the other tables, the menu items also looked tasty, but with the price of the buffet, if you like sushi or seafood even moderately, you would be foolish not to partake.  The weekend buffet price is $16/person, but I would say that, even though I can't eat that much with all the room the baby is taking up inside, I probably packed away about $50 worth of food.  How do I figure that?  I ate about 14 shrimp (so maybe $16 worth of shrimp cocktail at any decent restaurant), $12 crab (about the price for crab at  another seafood restaurant), $5 desert/soup would be a steal and at least $18 sushi if it was $1/piece like Kofusion (except higher quality here.)  I'm honestly amazed that they are able to make a profit here considering their offerings and their cheap pricing.  They must be banking on non-sushi eaters who order off-menu (though those prices were pretty cheap too - almost all entrees were less than $11.)    We ate the buffet, so didn't notice any delays, but the host apologized profusely to us on the way out for any waits, so I'm guessing there must have been a back-up of some sort in the kitchen for customers not eating the buffet (but I don't know for sure.)  They do not serve liquor yet as their license hasn't been processed yet, but it sounded like it was coming soon.  The restrooms were clean as was the rest of the restaurant.  The buffet was well-kept and clean and they had a nice little selection of fruit and steamed asparagus and edamame at the back end of the buffet.  Kaiyo's - you deserve an A+..."}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty good, still a great value--the lunch price is only $10.95.  Plus, they started putting labels over the various types of sushi so you know what kind you're getting.  Also, I think they are trying to be a little more creative with their rolls.  The green mousse-like dessert is not that great though.  It is kind of flavorless."}
{"text":"Sad to report that Kaiyo has closed. The sign on the door says they are reconstructing, to reopen soon under a different name."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, I've eaten at the best of the best from NY to LA, SF to Chicago and it simply doesn't get any better than Kaiyo for sushi.  An endless array of fresh sushi, sashimi, creative rolls, crab legs, shrimp, oysters and now they've added about 10 delicious hot food offerings.  All for under $20 per person.  And it really is all you can eat - - and I can eat a LOT of this wonderful food.  They now serve a number of lovely sakes too and are adding even more to the restaurant side.    The buffet side is clean, crisp and friendly.  You can watch the chefs prepare their signature rolls.  Everything is very FRESH - the buffet platters change every 10 or 15 minutes.  If you don't know what something is, there is a chef right there to answer your questions.    The restaurant side is beautifully decorated and comfortable.  Service is fast and the staff is professional and helpful.     Prices are well below every other sushi / japanese place in town and no other restaurant comes close to the quality.     This place is the best deal in town.  Great food, excellent service, lovely ambiance and prices too low to believe."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a daughter of a Sushi Chef so, yeah, have a good idea on what's good sushi.  quality of the fish used in the sushi and sashimi was good but the chefs who were making the sushi put too much rice in the rolls so I felt like eating rice rolls, not sushi rolls. Also, 90% of sushi rolls served were tuna (the cheap tuna) or salmon. so if that's your fav fish, go for it. There was sashimi but very competative and once gone, took them forever to get more.  crabs legs were small and little too salty for me. oyster, too scared to try.  A lot of stuff was not on their buffet and had to be ordered separately (charged separetly too) so to actually have a very satisfying  meal there, you need to pay buffet price + more."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi in Champaign? Really? OMGGG!  That's how I felt when I first found out about this place.  I went there with a couple of friends when the price was still $15.99. The sushi buffet was obviously the main attraction, so I didn't really bother looking at the menu. The buffet looked great. Lots of good quality crab legs (which I'm allergic to) and delicious looking rolls. The sushi was good, not great, as expected. There was a lot of variety but at the same time they don't really taste all that different. The sashimi portion was somewhat pathetic because it ran out within 10 seconds each time they refilled it. The dessert was actually quite decent for a buffet. What did I like? The seaweed salad and... I don't really know actually. Quantity was by far the best attraction. I ate more than what I paid for.  Looking back, was it worth it? yes. But now that the price is $17.99, wouldn't it be better to spend that money and buy 2 rolls at a regular sushi place?"}
{"text":"Sushi. Buffet. Sushi... Buffet??  Okay, those two words don't really go together in my mind.  Especially not in Champaign.  But you know what?  I liked this place.  Now, I'm not gonna claim that this is the best sushi I've ever had.  It's not.  But it's pretty good, at least as good or better than the other places in the area.  There were plenty of maki options available, as well as nigiri and sashimi.  It all tasted fresh, and many (though not all) of the rolls were labeled with the ingredients listed.  Crab legs were okay, oysters were a little bleh, but I was happy with just about everything else.  The interior was nicely decorated without giving me the try-too-hard vibe I get at KoFusion.  Also, our waitress was prompt and very sweet.  Yeah, $17.95 is more money than I like to spend on dinner, but this is ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI we're talking about.  Anywhere else in the country that price would be doubled.  Just be sure to eat $18 worth of seafood (not too difficult) and you're golden."}
{"text":"I will say that the unsalted edemame was not expected or appreciated. A friend who lived in Japan says unsalted is the default, but isn't the way I prefer. The crab legs were not great either, but crab legs are not what brought me to this buffet, it was the opportunity to eat an irresponsible amount of sushi and then be able to complain about it on the Internet if they asked me to exercise even a bit of discretion. They did not interrupt my my unrestrained gluttony. I appreciated this at the time, but I wonder how they sleep at night watching gastronomic self destruction shift after shift.  I thought the sushi was pretty good. I went in the afternoon (paying dinner buffet price) on the weekend. The selection was pretty good, and every time I returned, there was more stuff. It really surprised me that they had sashimi, which was well cut. They had a good variety of sashimi, and only one was strong (but I dont remember ... maybe the hamachi?). The rolls were rolled well, too.  As for freshness, only what I think was the hamachi was maybe off. I am sure it depends on when you go. I tipped the guys working the buffet (as well as my server) because I thought they were good enough to warrant it.  The service was friendly. I thought it was weird that drinks come in massive beer steins, which do not exactly mesh with the contemporary Asian fusion decor, which is classy and understated.  There was a group there (I think it was somebody's birthday or engagement or something) and it was clear that this is a good place for a group of people to go.  If you want to eat a lot of sushi, or want to go to a restaurant with a variety of Asian dishes, plus a lot of sushi that is not expensive, this is a good choice. I wish it wasn't in bumblefuck South Kankakee, and I hope that the location doesn't deep-six the place, but I will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it while it lasted. Weekday lunch specials were great. Dinners/weekend overpriced.  But they are no more. Drove past today and they were closed ... And selling off their equipment."}
