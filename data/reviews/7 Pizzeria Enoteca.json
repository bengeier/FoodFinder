{"text":"I will agree with others that the atmosphere and decor in this place is great!  The beet salad is delicious as well.

But, there were two things that really bugged me:

The waiter was incredible unfriendly.  I don't know if he was \"too cool\" for us or what it was, but he didn't smile once or even introduce himself at the start.  

The pizza crust was thin but ridiculously hard to cut (pizza came uncut and we shared it) and had definite burnt sections.  It was so much work to eat that I wouldn't order it again - or rush back...."}
{"text":"I love this authentic Italian restaurant it is one of the best Italian restaurants I have eaten at. The pizza and pasta are amazing so is the tiramisu. I also love the Caesar salad, I am looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at 7 and we were really looking forward to it. When we arrived on Saturday, they told us there is a 40 min wait (or less) and took our phone number so that they can call us when the table is free. They don't take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays yet. We didn't know where else to go to wait, so the hostess suggested the Green Bean Coffee Shop (which is owned by the same owner). Good idea from a marketing point of view :) We went there and got some tea, because it was cold out. We were hungry though and they only had sweet stuff available. So finally they called us and told us the table was ready. We got sited at a really cozy table next to the wall. It was a bit chilly inside, but not too bad. The waiter took our orders and brought us some bread. Bread arrived on a plate drizzled with some olive oil and sprinkled with a bit of salt (I think). We got grilled calamari for an appetizer, but they ran out of calamari and gave us octopus instead, which was much better! It was very tender and grilled to perfection! For our mains we got a sausage pizza (which my friend said was really good), a buffalo mozzarella pizza (which was also delicious - I tried a piece!) and a Matteo pizza. I was really looking forward to that pizza, because everyone in the reviews suggested it. I believe it was supposed to be drizzled with honey or something like that, but on the menu it didn't say that and even though the pizza was good, because of the pecorino cheese, it was a bit too salty! Next time I would go with the buffalo mozzarella one. The crust I thought was delicious, a bit on a doughy side though, but still very good. They put a lot of toppings on top of the pizza (the prosciutto was delicious and not salty). The menu is not huge, but they say they change it up from time to time. The place itself is very cozy. I would probably come back again and share the buffalo mozzarella pizza (the whole pizza is too big for one person I find (which is never a bad thing : ))."}
{"text":"Fabulous resto in the town of Oakville known for great spots to dine. Traditional Napoli pizza (thin crunchy crust). The fig/proscuitto pizza is a definite must try. Pasta sauces are rich and well flavoured. Attentive, knowledgeable staff on a night that was very busy. Great wine list."}
{"text":"Most of our family lives outside of Canada, but every summer we make a point to have a meal together at 7 Enoteca at least once every two weeks....tonight was to be the first meal there this summer...sadly, it's also going to be our last. 

The service was appalling, despite our server trying to sort things out, the rest of the people working there, including the hostess and the manager were awful. We found a bug in our salad....we found multiple bugs in our salad. We were a pretty big group so we had ordered three orders of the salad...and upon showing our server the salad, we were told that they wouldn't charge us for the salad....and then our bill charged us for 2/3 of the salads??

Basically, their standards have severely fallen. Poor management, poor hygiene, and additionally, they didn't want to accommodate our order for my four year old nephew...we just wanted them to take the sausage off the pizza...which led to a 5-minute lecture on their restaurant's \"concept.\" We're willing to pay what Yelp refers to as three dollar signs....so why should we care about your concept? In the past, they have always been willing to accommodate a slightly modified order for the kids in our party (there's only 2 of them, and only one of the even eats solids)."}
{"text":"I would like to put 1 star for the business. 
 We were misleading by the place fancy look from outside , so we decided to share a pizza ( all of 4 of us are pizza lovers).
Pizza quality was not great at all . Our friends are Italian so they ( and we) ate quite amount of pizza from wood burning ovens, and I should say pizza in 7 was very soggy, and the dough reminded me of rubber. 

The service actually was OK, not excellent but not rude.

While waiting for our deserts I went to the bathroom and ... I saw a huge creature crawling on the bathroom floor. If it was summer time I would explain it to myself that it crawled from outside but in January!!! Oh My!   I was so terrified! I was just speechless! I decided not to mention it to my boyfriend and our friends because their mood after 7 food experience was already not great."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch.  Totally beautiful interior but that was pretty much about it.  The hostess and wait staff were COMPLETELY inattentive.  Arrived there after the first few in our party got there earlier to get a table.  Staff was talking amongst themselves and didn't even greet us OR give us menus when we found our table.  The food took an inordinate amount of time to come to the table.  They brag that their pizza oven cooks pizza in 90 seconds so not sure why we waited over 40 minutes for our pizzas. IT WASN'T THAT BUSY in there.  
They have a decent menu and their pizza is alright.   I have to say the rest of their offerings were VERY under seasoned.  Pizzeria Libretto still KILLS that place hands down.  If you are desperate for some neopolitan style pizza then try the place but come with low expectations.  Honestly, it's pretty lackluster overall and it's STILL worth the drive to Toronto to hit up Pizzeria Libretto for far superior food AND importantly quality service."}
{"text":"Amazing and pricey!

The pizzas are authentic thin crust in every way. They taste incredible and are made.in the stone burning oven inside the restaurant. Ordered two different pizzas called Carne (meats) and the other one had sliced prosciutto and  basil on it. Both tasked remarkable.

We started with a salami and cheese sample that was also good and pricey. Three of the four items were things i had tried before but the last cheese was unique and very good. 

Get the red pepper spread with the sampler. 

Overall the restaurant is beautiful inside and out. Tables, chairs, imported Italian ingredients all make a difference. 

I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very tasty, but so pricey that I am likely to take my business elsewhere.

With prices of pizzas well into the $20+ range, there is some serious margin being made here.  What really puts me off, though, is the wine pricing.  If I recall correctly, there was not one bottle of wine under $60 or $65 dollars.  To me, that is just disrespectful of a customer's money.  Call it a bit of arrogance.  Add the fact that this place does not take reservations, and I get the feeling that they feel a little too \"special\" for my taste.  If the cost of a meal is irrelevant to you, come and enjoy this place, as the food itself was very good.  Me,  I'll take my business to some other place that offers a bit more value."}
{"text":"This place is great, it has a good vibe, service is good and the food is excellent. Decoration is great and it has a very nice patio. I had the mascarpone cheese and prosciutto pizza and it was excellent. We were 6 people and we ordered a bottle of red wine."}
{"text":"Lunch. Noon. Not crowded at first. Overall food and service were just okay. Serving of pasta bolognese was TINY but tasted very good. No offer of parmesan or pepper or bread. Appetizer of warm olives came WITH the mains and we had to ask for it. Olives should come with pits. These were over salted and were mostly pitted. Pizza was soggy and charred at the same time. They give you an enormous steak knife to cut it and it was still almost impossible, consequently I had to drag/cut each piece, losing toppings all over the plate. Toppings were sparse except for the prosciutto which was ample and delicious. For a $20 pizza, they had to justify that somehow! Would not return. I make better pizza at home. Lastly this is a very small restaurant with low ceilings and low lighting. It is extremely noisy. Bring your reading glasses!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Oakville! I hadn't been in a while but after a particularly challenging week, figured I'd head over for some comfort food. I generally eat very healthy and don't consider this a place with many healthy options. My favourite wine, Pescaja was introduced to me by a server here and my favourite app (prosciutto wrapped roasted figs) was my go-to. The server I had was the one who told me about the wine. I was sad to find out that they no longer had the wine. She suggested alternatives and even let me sample 4 types to find one I liked! Also I was told my app was sold out, so to my dismay ordered a charcuterie platter (which is still phenomenal!) Turned out there was one of the apps left and she got it for me! 

I love the food, service and atmosphere in this place! It's not a place to go to conduct business, as it's dark inside and bustling with activity, but it's a great date location/place to catch up with great friends over good food and wine."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is dark and comfy and unique.  I have always received quite good service.  I would say the no reservation policy is just brutal, but I get it.  When its busy here it is jammed and loud and lively, so if you are looking for quiet and intimate, maybe not your spot.  The food has NEVER disappointed, beautiful and fresh.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"(This was)Neopolitan style pizza at it's best!

Finally a pizzeria in Southern Ontario that can compete with some of the greats in NYC. (and better than anything in Toronto!)

We started off with a salumi sampler, it had 3 kinds of meat, bread and some pickled veggies.  All were top quality.  It was just enough for the two of us to get our appetites really going.

Then came the pizzas.  We actually prefer to judge pizza on a basic pie.  That really shows off the quality of the pizza without hiding behind other flavours.  My wife had the marinara and I had the margherita.

The first big plus is the cheese on the margherita is not just fresh mozzarella but mozzarella di bufala.  Which is made from the milk of the Asian Water Buffalo.  It's more mild and lighter than the cows milk version.

The pizza was nicely charred and perfectly cooked in the pizza oven that was built on site by Stefano Ferrara himself.  From reading \"Slice\" having Stefano build the oven on site is a big deal.

The balance of flavours was fantastic.  The sweetness of the tomatoes, the light creamy clouds of cheese and the nice bit of saltiness from the crust, it's perfection.  It's obvious they let their dough rest and age before use.  I've eaten at to many pizzerias that use young dough and end up tasteless.  7 gets it right and allows the dough to ferment to develop a great flavour.  

I've been saying for a couple years now that Oakville needs a great Neopolitan pizzeria.  Someone was listening :)


*** EDIT December 29, 2012 ***


It's sad that I have to edit my review of what was once a great place.

My latest visit was on December 8, and it might have been my last.  It was an embarrassing experience that night as we were with some friends to whom we have raved about 7.

They don't take reservations, so we had close to a 45 minute wait for our table, this was expected and acceptable.  It was from here the night went down hill.

Once we were seated, absolutely no one came to our table.  No order taking, no menus, not even water.  I really mean no one came to our table.  The restaurant was busy that night, but not so busy that the wait staff seemed to think it's ok just to stand around the small kitchen/pizza oven area having some conversations to themselves while patrons sit in the dining room unattended.

So we flag down the hostess, to let her know of our disappointment of waiting so long, and to get a server over here immediately.

The manager comes over and apologizes.  She then takes our order herself.  Then tries and sell us a bottle of wine!  She has some nerve to do that, after hearing our complaints.  She should have offered us a round on the house as a gesture.  

So we order.  Appetizers were ok at best, but one of our friends octopus was horribly over cooked and rubbery.  The timing was quite off though as they did not come all at the same time and half of us were almost done by the time I got my carpaccio caesar.

Now our pizzas finally show up.  The first one was a carne which was weird because no one ordered it.  The waiter had the nerve (see the theme here about the staff) to ask if we were sure we did not order it.  He takes it back.  But it's not gone for long though as a couple minutes later another server brings the same pizza back.  So again we explain that it's not ours.  I then see them try unsuccessfully to deliver that pie to a couple different tables.

So now we get our our correct pizzas.  Someone doesn't know how to run a pizza oven was working that night.  A true Neopolitan pizza should have some blistering and charring but these were horribly over done.  Just this side of burnt and very dried out.  There was no where near enough sauce as the crust took up a good third of the pizza.

I'll hold myself back here as I don't want this to seem like a rant.  But 7 has gone horribly down hill.  The service was never good but I can't believe just how bad it has become.  Now it seems the food is beginning to suffer as well.

Even though I live just 15 minutes from 7, I think I'll just go back to driving back to Toronto to go to Libretto."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are quite authentic.  Really like them.  The place has a very cozy atmosphere and a nice rustic feel.  Service was excellent.  Kids are not allowed on weekend nights and they do not take reservations at all.  
The only part I I don't like is the price.  I think the pizzas are priced quite compared to similar establishments around GTA. For example a some margarita was $18 which usually is around $12/13 at other places.  Also,  each additional topping is $3 extra ( meat topping might be more)  I had asked for a margharita pizza with augula and I was charged $21. That was a bit turn off for me for sure."}
{"text":"Food:
We had mussels, the quail, a pasta dish, and a warm crepe. Our visit was a couple months ago and im not sure the menu has been changed or not. 
Most our food was alright, nothing bad but nothing outstanding. The warm crepe was very good though.

Service:
Very friendly but super slow."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my friend. The food is great, with lots of flavor and good presentation, though everything is a bit pricey. The ambience is cool, the decor is stylish and fun. The staff is friendly, but not attentive. My friend and I had to wait, waive, ask other servers and, still, no signs of our waitress with our orders, with the check, with the credit card slip. I would come back and would recommend it because of the food, but for the price charged, service should be more on the spot."}
{"text":"We left our number on their wait list and after about an hour we got the blessed call, \"We have your table!\".  So two couples and two little ones ran on over and we crammed our group into a orange booth.  

*It's loud, really loud.  It was hard to talk to each other during dinner without shouting.
  
*It's not for kids.  No high chairs, boosters, it's not family dining.  It's for couples, small groups of friends, dates, etc.   

*It ain't that cheap. 

*The pizza is delicious, but the apps are equally as delicious.  Especially the stuffed figs with marscapone.  YUM! 

*Service was great.  I know other yelpers complained about the service, but everyone we dealt with had a huge smile on their faces and our waitress was fab and patient with our little ones telling us right off the bat she has two children too.  

So go with your friends, have some wine, delicious cheese and prosciutto, a pizza or two and be happy you didn't have to drive downtown for a decent slice of pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, we went on a Wednesday and it was quite busy, but we got a table without reservation.  Atmosphere is great - very nice music and great decor.  In the summer it would be nicer to sit outside, as it is a little louder inside. We had already eaten, so just ordered some food to share - a pizza and the shrimp pepperconi.  The shrimp was cooked just right, grilled to perfection.  The pizza was the verdura, excellent.  What makes the food even tastier is that the ingredients are very fresh.  I believe the spring mix and fresh greens they add to the plates are actually cut fresh from growing plants in the kitchen.  This place is definitely worth trying, if you're looking for a nice place to chill and lounge."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for pizza in Oakville. I have been to the restaurant twice now. Great atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and apps after work with a couple of co-workers, it was early - around 5pm and restaurant had around 10 guests. Seated right away by a pleasant young lady, excellent waiter (excellent wine recommendation), nice apps. Nice ambiance upon entering - cozy (fireplace made for warmth) and inviting. Problem was that the owner (I've lived in Oakville all my life and quite familiar with the local businesses that have come and gone over the years) was conducting his business at a table in the middle of the restaurant - 2 laptops up, cell phones,spreadsheets, very loud talking at times, gesturing certain staff members over to his table, cell phones going off!! We found it difficult to just sit back and relax and chat after our long day at work and completely ruined the lovely ambiance of the restaurant itself. Let's not get too big for our britches as there are many restaurants in the area that offer wonderful food, service and ambiance. Very rude, inconsiderate and Unprofessional behaviour! Perhaps you should consider a \"staff room\" when you conduct your business, in the future!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Margherita pizza was good. The problem was with the servers recommendations for wine and beer. 

My group was inquiring about the difference between a couple $50 bottles when the server recommended something else that we might like if we liked one of the bottles we were asking about which we had before. Fine. Great. I asked about an Italian beer like Moretti and she said they had something Italian that I might like more. Great. 

We had the wine and I drank the beer and when the bill came the bottle was $125 and the beer was $21. Wow. Just wow. We were asking about wines in the $50 range and she brought us a bottle that was almost triple that. And the beer. Its \"imported\" she said. Well so is Moretti and you can get one in most places for $6. 

Shame on us for not inquiring about the prices but more of a shame on her for pulling that one on us without warning about the price tags."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are into wine AND pizza! However the other drinks such as cocktails are pathetic; abnormally overloaded with ice. A very cool ambience, perfect for night outs, would have been better if there wasn't a fire place burning all the time even in summer and hence boiling everyone inside, though it's probably part of the interior design."}
{"text":"Star rating is based on the pizza crust. This is the closest you will find to a true Naples style crust. The ingredients in the various pizzas are decidedly North American but that's not a bad thing. We spoke to the pizza chef and it tuns out that he I from just outside Naples ( by Pompeii) an has been here for 6 months. 
The ambience is very cozy with the low ceilings and open fireplaces. Obviously the wood-fire pizza oven adds to the charm. It seems more of a Fall/Winter place than a spring/summer. The room was full (Saturday nite) and the tables looked pretty tight but that wasn't an issue as we sat at the \"chefs table\" to watch the preparation prior to deciding what to order. 
The staff seemed eager to help and more than once popped by to asked if everything was okay. Based on the previous reviews I was waiting for something negative but that wasn't our experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food wine and everything about this place is nice. Even the price is nice. I had the pizza and beef carpaccio and a Caesar salad and a bottle of wine for under a 100. Will be coming back vary soon"}
{"text":"Love it, all good, pricey but that's ok here.... It's Oakville!  Awesome pizza and good vino!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous lunch here last week...the Lobster Risotto was amazing! I meant to take a photo but that went out of my mind completely when the risotto arrived with the big juicy pieces of lobster sitting on top! I also had the selection of 3 Salume...delicious with their lovely bread. I love the decor and atmosphere here...looking forward to the expansion with double the seating."}
{"text":"The mix of great food vs rarely a hit and often a miss service, makes 7 the place you hate to love or hate.  The breakdown: 
Food, 5 stars. Never question the beauty, plating, sourcing, preparation, or taste of the food.  
Service 1-5 stars depending who you get but only one person there is a 5 star everyone else is 3 or less. They charge too much and have too good a fare to have this mood swing of service.   
Decor and ambiance 5 stars, beware the cow skin bar and copious leather furnishings will be nightmarish to a vegan. 
  
The pizza in their Italian imported brick made fireplace is exceptional, all the appetizers are gorgeously crafted and delicious, the hot pickled vegetables are like nothing you have experienced before, and the olives generous and made in house (the process is interesting, impress your guests by having your server detail the crafting of the warm olive app).  The mains are filling and well balanced.  Seafood is the highlight at the restaurant and outshines the pizza possibly.  
If you get lucky and have great service, a mid sized wait and the food are worth it, the experience will be phenomenal. 

Without alcohol, app + entree + tip  $65pp, 
They do not accept reservations so forget about weekend evenings unless you are prepared for a significant, standing wait in the surrounding courtyard."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere great service great selection great wine all make for a place that you need come and check out I promise you won't leave disappointed. 

When you have finally settled in and have taken a look at that mouth watering menu I encourage you to order the figs wrapped with prosciutto and the grilled octopus while you start to sip and enjoy a glass of IGT Bianco you will quickly think wow what a great decision you made to come and eat here. Once you have finished enjoying those delicious starters you are now ready to move on to the most enticing part of the menu the PIZZA selection. Do get yourself a margarita do get your self the Mateo and take it a step further and indulge with an order of sorenttina your guests will thank you later... this is a place that must be visited and must be visited often!!"}
{"text":"It's a fancy restaurant. Love the vibe and atmosphere. There's a fireplace in the restaurant. How cozy is that! My friends and I were happy to dine there. The food is good. We had risotto, seafood pasta, which is not on the menu, a veal pizza and some appetizers. The dishes were perfectly seasoned. We enjoyed them. Btw, they don't take reservations, so come in early, otherwise you'd expect a long line in winter."}
{"text":"The food is good but pricey. I was disappointed with the service as the waiter forgot to take my drink order initially.  When I told another waiter to order drinks, it took them another 10 mins to finally come to take my order."}
{"text":"Always great food and authentic fresh flavours 
The staff is great but you could get unlucky and occasionally get one who is slightly pretentious
We will keep coming back regardless since the food is phenomenal
If you order get pizza ask them for a portion of chilly paste... you will experience heaven right here on earth"}
{"text":"Have come to this restaurant a few times and will no longer be returning for any more experiences. Had two waiters and neither could remember orders, were not served drinks, the attitude was rude and no suggestions were made for food items not being available or for wines not being available. The food that came out was over salted and sadly the menu items are no longer good."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Oakville. If it wasn't for our lovely neighbors that took us here, most likely I'd see us never hitting this spot. The environment reminds me of an new school Chicago pizza joint, upscale with eclectic furnishings, open concept kitchen, and awesome wait staff that treat you like regulars. This might be because of the prices, yikes. I would have given this place a five- however the prices are what gouged me on it. The food was amazing, we had a pizza with egg yolk, some cheese plate, and calamari paired with some red wine. It ran us pretty deep, but I still remember the taste of the pizza, which might make me come back! WHOO! Man that food was \"rememberable.\" Unfortunately, this place is really busy, loud and bussling so it's hard to concentrate on your conversations with others. But it's a nice place to relax after a long work week, have a couple drinks, and eat some delish pizza."}
{"text":"Finding a classy and good restaurant to enjoy with out 5 and 6 year old can be a challenge but with there amazing pasta and pizza the kids just gobble it up. We also enjoy their amazing wine menu."}
{"text":"Got the funghi pizza. The crust is delicious, but the mushrooms at not as aromatic/tasty as I hoped. Nice lil patio good lil lunch spot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this restaurant except for their prices. It's a bit over the top. $24 for a pizza that only serves two people max is highway robbery, but it's absolutely delicious and authentic Italian from my experiences all over Italy. Mateo is my favourite!

All of their appitizers are good as are their other main dishes from what my friends have told me. 

Their wait staff could be a little more professional. The restaurant is busy and their is often a wait which can be long. The hostesses always look so flustered and act annoyed. They should be trained to know how to manage it - it's their job. I have never had an issue with the wait staff, I do think they could be a little more attentive given the prices people are paying. 

The atmosphere is beautiful. It has the feeling of an old Italian restaurant tucked away in a little village or town, yet upscale. The famous pizza oven is on full display. They have a few tables outside, but it's not the most relaxing place. Families with children often hang out and play in town square and look at the fountain, so forewarning, you dinner conversation may be overpowered by screaming children! 

Overall I will continue to go to this restaurant as a treat for celebrations because the food is just that good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and to meet acquaintances. I and generally satisfied with the restaurant. It's location it's superb and we had a good view of the Christmas tree just outside on the plaza. However I have one serious complaint about the service. When I opened the door I didn't know it's doesn't close automatically, so I walked in and waited to be seated. The waiter completely disregarded us and walked straight to the door between me and my friend to closeI said \"oh I'm sorry. I didn't know that it doesn't close\". HE GAVE ME A DIRTY LOOK AND SAID \"YOU'D BETTER BE SORRY\". He then told us that the 2 rows of table were not available for us even thought they were completely empty except for one family sitting at the very back. We seated and another waiter came to answer our questions and took our orders for drinks. It started to get busier and we waved to order our appetizer. He came and we told him what we want and he listened. Then he simply said \"I will get your server to help you\" and left. He was VERY RUDE to us throughout the entire meal for no apparent reason and I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE COMPLAINED AND DEMANDED AN APOLOGY if we were not with our guests. All the other servers were super nice and the food was incomparable. I would return again for the food, but never for the treatment I got."}
{"text":"On a Thursday night this place was pretty busy.  Service is friendly and feels genuine which goes a long way to make you feel like they care about making you happy.

A nice selection of apps, big pizza list, and some pasta and fish and meat.  I loved the charcuterie board.  The prosciutto wrapped figs were great as was the great selection of cheeses and meats.  

I ordered the roasted fish daily special which was good with a charred lemon to squeeze on top.  The sides of roasted brussel sprouts and potatoes were simple and plain.  The pizzas are the stars as the crust was excellent as was the toppings.  The Roma and the carne pizzas were both delicious.

5 star service and 4 star food.  Definitely a great place to frequent!"}
{"text":"Confused by time. I go in n place look very nice . Decorate nice smell nice nice ppl . Any way i ask for cappucino n marghrittas pizza . I wait a long time 40 mins for it all. I get it an it cold n taste like store buy ingredient . I was upset . He tell me not to worry an put back in . Cristina with a c or k cann not remmeber was oriental girl who bring out now burnt pizza was very rude . It taste like thin cardboard she tell me she bring cappucino she bring coffee with two cream n sugar . Heard good thing but did not hav good time may be will try again . - mario (ps sorry for spellin english not first language)"}
{"text":"Been here several times, and whilst my wallet is a bit lighter, I have always been satisfied.  

Have only ever had the pizzas as the entree, and I've never had a disappointment.  I recommend the Matteo. 

Ambiance is great, and waitstaff professional and friendly.  Quite noisy (in a good way), and thus not that conducive to a quiet romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Service exceptional. Great ambiance. I feel like I'm in a restaurant in Italy. Fresh ingredients. Pizza has lots of good quality toppings. Kids had Marinara pizza.  I had the scallop risotto with puréed spinach. Small portion but filling.  Mushroom pizza had lots of mushrooms and same with prosciutto pizza. I would definitely come back. Would give it a 4.5."}
{"text":"\"A-OK\" summarizes my experience tonight fairly well.

Came in Sunday 7pm with a small group and was seated immediately inside. The layout/seating is interesting - place is dimly lit so more of a romantic vibe. Most of the seats are wooden chairs so that could be uncomfortable for some (bothered a friend of mine). 

The pizzas are thin crust and made in wood ovens. I ordered the Margherita pizza ($20) and found it to be roughly the same quality as Goodfella's in Streetsville. It was a bit bland and I tasted the crust/dough more than any tomato sauce or cheese.

I'll note that a friend ordered a lobster pasta and the portion was much smaller than we anticipated - the dish looked like an appetizer. She did say it tasted great though."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing, I couldn't remember the name of the pizza place my dad had recommended. Turned out it was directly across from this one. It's got a very different look and layout inside, a bit dark and unfriendly to tall people! Interesting none the less. The best part of the experience was that the waiter was really very nice and attentive. I kind of felt bad for him because I was hangry lol and there were like no veggie options. We ended up getting a pizza without the meat (note this doesn't change the price, so you are paying extra for meat you're not having). The pizza was 24 plus tax. It looked amazing and tasted... SO bland!! It had cherry tomatoes, cheese, garlic and arugula. All I could taste was the tart tomatoes, the crust was soggy in the middle within five minutes and the outside was so chewy I couldn't cut through it with the heavy duty knife they give you.
I haven't gone to the other place yet but one can only assume it will be better than this! So if you're torn between the two maybe this will help make the choice easier."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Oakville! The service and staff are friendly and the ambiance is perfect."}
{"text":"The service here has greatly improved since the first time we came here. We have been back so many times since and the food never disappoints. 

 I will say that our server Devon was amazing!!! She remembered us and I never had to ask for a thing, she was so attentive! If my water ran out she was already at the table refilling it or asking if we needed anything. Also the greeter Kristina is equally fantastic, if it weren't for those two employees I would second guess the service here, but thanks to them they redeemed this note worthy restaurant. Still one of my favourite spots in Oakville."}
{"text":"I guess I'm gonna go against the common opinions here and say that I was not terribly impressed.  At all.

Me and the GF strolled in around 8pm on a weeknight and were pretty excited to try the place. 

I've eaten a fair share of wood fired pizzas in my day and it's definitely one of my favorite things. This place does a very good job on the pizzas and if I was reviewing ONLY the pizza I'd give it 4 stars. 

Unfortunately, for reasons I cannot understand, they hired an incredibly pretentious and rude male head bartender slash server whom I'd personally like to punch in the face. 

We get seated at a crappy table right near the kitchen doors and wine rack which we did not complain about and tried to be positive about it because it gave one of us a view of the pizza makers and pizza ovens which was fine.

It wasn't until the idiot behind the bar came to take our order that it all went downhill. 

I ordered a beer for myself , and since my girlfriend was driving and it was a hot day she decided to only ask for ice water. This male bartender clearly couldn't get it through his thick skull because he was almost to the point of trying to force my GF to order an alcoholic beverage. We asked for ice water, he asked us if we were sure. Are you kidding me? Of course I'm sure. He comes back with my beer and her water and AGAIN tells her to please consider trying something else. It made her so uncomfortable she ordered a beer just to please this guy which I ended up drinking 3 quarters of.  I should mention they only have 2 kinds of beer: Birra Moretti and some weird looking aged beer out of the wine cellar he desperately tried to up sell us. No chance buddy. 

When he comes around to get our food order, I mention we are just going to split one of their spicy shrimp appetizers and AGAIN he tries to push her into ordering something for herself. I remind him that one app is fine for us to split and this guy has the nerve to almost roll his eyes and sigh under his breath as if we are a bunch of cheap riff raff or something.  He is honestly lucky he caught me on a forgiving day because anybody who knows me knows I have a short fuse for this stuff. I would not hesitate to ask him if he's got some kind of problem with us but I held my tongue. 

App comes out , it's 3 average sized shrimps (probably 7-10 count in shrimp sizes) that are tasty but definitely not worth anywhere near the $14.99 price tag. 

Pizzas were pretty great, good char and a good chew to the crust , and delivered by the pizza maker himself which was a nice touch and was 20 times more friendly than the jackass who served us all night.  I ordered the traditional margherita (my all time favorite) and the GF ordered the 4-mushroom pizza. We each split them and were thoroughly enjoyed by both of us. 

Ordered a tira misu for desert served in a mason jar which was so so.  Nothing special.

Server comes and drops our bill on the table without so much as asking us how the food was or telling us his name or anything at all

Being a good sport I politely paid and we left but I can't help but stress this guy is lucky he caught me on a good day. He's gonna take that attitude with the wrong people one day and it's gonna bite him and their business both in the ass.

4 stars for the pizza
3 stars for the atmosphere
2 stars for value
1 star for service

Don't care if you strongly disagree.  This was our experience and I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody for as long as they've got that guy working the bar and serving tables

further edited this a couple minutes later to remove a few choice words, don't want this review to get deleted."}
{"text":"A friend was in town from Calgary and was there the other night with her in laws. She had a really good experience with them, so she recommended this place for dinner.  It was average Italian food, and a bit over priced compared to other downtown Italian restaurants like Terroni's etc...  The decor and restaurant was nice, good place for a date night. We had a wonderful waiter, it's nice to see experienced professional waiters at restaurants, especially one with wine knowledge."}
{"text":"The best restaurants have the perfect ambiance and great food. 7 has a nice ambiance. Went here for a late night dessert and coffee and it was warm (fake fireplace is one of the better ones) and service was good. But we weren't allowed to sit at a nice table near the fire because one of the staff was working on a computer at the next table. The place was nearly empty. Why a staff member doing accounting had to sit at one of the best tables and not allow us to sit at the table beside it, seemed shallow. 

Went back for dinner, because of the environment and was not thrilled at the food. Pizza (while claiming they have the only pizza oven of its kind) was soggy and wet in the middle. It was the Sorrentina pizza. My daughter had the squid ink pasta which she said was ok, except for appetizer portion (at the full entire price). 

If you're looking for a nice ambiance for some drinks or dessert, it's a good place. If you're looking for great pizza, there are many better places. And if you're looking for a good selection of Pastas, you will be disappointed. 

Pros - ambiance, service (when not busy), location
Cons - just OK food, small portions, mainly pizza"}
{"text":"No value for the money. We ordered two soups and one pizza. The soup was 2 oz only (I am not exaggerating) - you could barely find veggies or sauce in it and it costs $6. It was not spiced at all. The pizza we ordered was their fungi pizza. The pizza dough was lacking flavor and was very greasy although the pizza was cooked in a fire wood oven. I would not recommend the pizza either. 
Overall the restaurant presentation was beautiful but the food not good at all.
The server was welcoming but did not do the extra steps of offering pepper or spices.
The blue water bottles were greasy and gross."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and I've had a very good experience in each time. The service was always incredibly good. The food is fresh and delicious. The menu is not overwhelming but enough. I love the pizza crust. Their pizzas have very brave ingredients like shishito peppers. For a perfect dinner for two, I recommend to start with an appetizer and continue with two different entrees in order to try different food."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and it was busy, like we expected. Regardless, we were seated right away. The waitress was very friendly and she gave some helpful suggestions to accommodate our vegetarian diet. We ended up having a veggie pizza which I can't remember the name of. We both loved it. The dough was the right amount of chewy and everything tasted so fresh! Even the goat cheese was amazing. For dessert, we got a sort of chocolate and almond ice cream cake and it was delicious. We devoured it and would've got more if we weren't already so full.

The atmosphere was also really nice. I loved the low ceilings and the rustic look. I read that it's supposed to look like an authentic Italian restaurant and from the little I know of Italy, I feel they did a good job. Overall I was very happy that we decided to venture to Oakville for pizza."}
{"text":"I came when this place first opened years ago and had an unmemorable experience. I went back for a second time last night and will never go back again. The atmosphere is beautiful, the food was \"meh\" but the service was absolutely awful. The server started by talking down the special to us saying \"you aren't going to order it anyway\". Glad he knew us so well after sitting for 15 minutes and being completely ignored by him while the rest of the restaurant was dead. The menu had a whopping 4 glasses of red by the glass, and 2 were not available. When I commented on how expensive a $380 bottle of wine was the waiter looked down at me and said that \"no, $380 is in fact not expensive\". I'm not sure what planet he lives on but I don't see why someone would want to order an $380 bottle of wine with mediocre pizza. To each his own but at least offer a wine menu that has selection you actually have in stock. My friend told me that when she called ahead a few weeks ago to say she was on her way with her husband and son, they told her that kids under 12 were not welcome after 6pm. If it's a liquor license thing I understand no one under 19 but for a restaurant to refuse a 10 year old at 6pm is ridiculous.  Aren't we all over snotty high end restaurants?  This is 2018. I am happy to pay for quality food and top notch service but I have no desire to be talked down to and treated less then. Places like this give Oakville a bad reputation in my opinion. I would skip this restaurant for one of the dozens of others willing to treat their customers with some respect."}
{"text":"We luckily arrived a few minutes before six on a Thursday night and thus offered one of the best tables in the house, a mini-booth (think The Riv in 60's Vegas) by the window that was perched above the main restaurant floor.

The service received from Brad was amongst the best we have received anywhere in the GTA. Friendly, responsive but not intrusive. The warmed olives were nice but on the salty side but happily the sweet beet appetizer was a perfect compliment to it.

My Papardelle was was just ok as it was really more a bowl filled with ground beef than a pasta dish (I would reverse the proportions). My wife's pizza was excellent featuring what may be the tastiest crust out there.

We'll be back."}

VIBE 
I went here for a friend's birthday party and I must say, I wish there was a restaurant like it in Toronto (but know I'd probably never get a seat there. Let's liken this to Enoteca Sociale). 

Vivek's review is spot on. It's a signage is subtle and I will copy and paste his direction which helped me immensely: It's on the east side of Town Square, closeby Soontorn Bahn Thai and the Green Beanery. Look for the number 7 on the door handles. 

The decor in here is gorgeous. Amazing Italian tiling, marble counters with cowhide underneath and a pop of comfortable orange chairs at the bar. I love how you can sit at the other counter in the back and watch the guys make pizza (and a few women were flirting with the Ed Hardy-wielding-pizza-dough-making guy in the back. They were a bit snarky when they saw me taking a photo. Please. It's like they had never seen someone take a photo in a restaurant before like I was an alien. SIT DOWN.) 

The staff in here are ahem, easy on the eyes. That said, I felt like they were a bit tad serious but our table was one of thirteen and for a place that is as small and intimate as this not suitable. I'm glad I got to experience but I would never, ever take a group of more than four here unless you are prepared to have a three to four hour meal. 

Even so, because of the wait and the fact that we were pretty much taking up one quarter of the restaurant we were ushered over to the bar before our bill came. It was a bit of a mess and although we had no problems and understood the situation, it was a bit awkward purely because of the smallness of the place. 

On top of that, their POS doesn't divide bills so it was very disorganized at the end of the night. Unfortunately, my friend got double billed which was disappointing since she left such a big tip for the great job that they did. 

That said with the crowds that they were dealing with and our large group, they did a phenomenal job and the food never suffered. 

But because of a crowded and busy Saturday night, we didn't get as much attention as we would have liked. 

But if you are not patient, do not come here because you will need it! 

I ATE 
A lot of us got a few of the same items and to spare you this long review, I'll cover what I had and other highlights of tastes. 

IN the appetizer category. the octopus was divine. I could have sopped up that sauce all night. Delish!  My friend had the shrimp and it was well cooked. They're not huge portions but nice to share with friends. 

Rapini was a side and not as spicy as I anticipated. Great compliment to our pizza. 

As advised, I ordered the Matteo pizza. I'd hate to say it but this pizza knocks Pizzeria Libretto off the pizza map and purely because of the crust. They have the thin vs crispy and not too floury crust DOWN. It's like a SIT DOWN mention to the pizzerias in Toronto. They know what they're doing. The portion of prosciutto on the 'za was very generous and to add marscapone cheese for a bit of a sweet kick amongst the salty? Please. Bestill my heart. But 0.2 points knocked off to the guy wearing the Ed Hardy T-shirt.

WE DRANK
The Syrah for $10 is labelled light, but it had tons of flavour and was great value. I also had the Montepulciano and it was fantastic but honestly, I think I preferred the Syrah! They don't have a cocktail list yet and they're working on it. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Don't go here with a big group. They don't take reservations either (we were lucky and informed them in advance we would be coming regardless). 

Otherwise, a full five stars for a date place or at the pizza counter in the back with a few friends. It is the perfect third date place. 

Go early on a weekend. It fills up fast. 

And yes, get the Matteo."}
{"text":"Now that is a good pizza! Thanks Michelle for your great yelp review and also for encouraging me to join you in oakville to experience this wonderful meal. 

The 2 of us started off our Thursday evening meal at 6pm. As soon as I walked in I was welcomed with smiles and great service. They do have a patio but not many seats so we grabbed a table inside near a window. We couldn't decide which wine to get (they have a great list!) so they let us sample both the Barolo and the valpolicella ripasso. We went with the ripasso for 15 dollars for the glass. 

Started off with the prosciutto wrapped figs which comes with bread, cheese and a nice jam for $18. Then I ordered the marguerita pizza which was AMAZING. They import their 00 flour from Naples and boy was it worth the trek. The crust was beautifully soft. The combination of mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, and EVOO made me feel like I was back in Italy!

We left around 8 and it was busy and loud! Definitely the place to be. Everyone seemed to be really enjoying themselves. 

Check this place out. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The Place is beautiful.  Whoever the designer is knows how to transform small spaces into roomy, elegant, functional WOW factor restaurants.  Cow skin lined wall? omg.  Marble EVERYWHERE.  The ceilings are curved so it feels as though you are in some small village eatery.  The servers are very attentive even after a long day and the place is bustling with life. I love everything about it.  including the fact that salad and pizza greens are clipped fresh from their roots for each entree!
Yum yum yum.  I dont even like pizza. This is the best pizza i've ever had in my life and against my will, i've eaten a lot of pizza..... and if it is here that I get to have more, i'll gladly succumb"}
{"text":"If you come here you will enjoy any pizza. They are thin and crispy and have the right amount of toppings.  Also the price point is very fair :) lovely to sit on the patio in the summer"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant knowing that the reviews from this site and others are VERY polarized.  You either love it or hate it.  I'll be the first to admit that I've never had authentic Napolean pizza from Italy.  I've had Pizza e Pazzi in downtown Toronto and I loved their pies.  Pizza e Pazzi is AVPN approved so I believe they're as authentic I'm going to get outside of Naples.  I'm going to compare 7 to them.

I'm going to warn you, this review will have the theme of 'over' and 'under'.  There's usually 3 key things that I look at a restaurant... food, service, and environment.  I'll start off by saying the environment would not stick out if plunked in the middle of the trendy King St West or Liberty Village.  It's made for 'beautiful people who have infinite money and love to eat '.  It's a small space that is done very nicely.  In a small cavern underground space, they used strategic dim lighting and tons of marble to make this place very nice.  I like how they showcase the Ferrara oven.  Supposedly it's a HUGE deal to have one of these ovens.  Personally, I think it really makes the place.  Like others have said, it's not easy to find the place... no kidding.  I didn't even think it was the restaurant but thankfully a reviewer below commented on the door handles being the number '7'.  That clued us in. There's only one small drawback to this restaurant space and that's the noise level.  Even with only 80% of the tables filled, the noise level made if kinda difficult to hear each other speak.  Sounds really bounce everywhere and I would say with the music, people chattering and yelling, the noise level can be overwhelming.

The service here is top notch.  I was expecting some pompous 'too cool' jerk to serve us but I was pleasantly surprised on this young woman who has the perfect idea of service.  If anything, she was the highlight of our meal.  The moment we sat down to the moment we got up, she was always attentive (but not hovering or overwhelming) and knew exactly what we wanted before we even asked.  She gave us water without asking, she knew we could handle heat so she gave us the spicy pepperino to us before we commented on a condiment, and she knew how to translate what we wanted to the dishes they had.  She was very informed on all the dishes and was able to recommend items.  Her service places her well above and above her peers.  Warm and friendly while still being professional.  She deserves an overwhelming 5 stars.

The food... oh god.  For $80 (2 apps and 2 pizzas), I walked out thinking... that was so not worth it.  Compared to Pizza e Pazzi, this paled in comparison on a few levels.  The flavours were underwhelming for me.  My app (seafood salad) was described as being light and refreshing.  Light is right... light on flavour and food.  With several sprigs of snow pea leaves on top, the seafood salad consisted of 1 shrimp, 5 tiny long neck clams (with 2 being empty), and 3 mussels.  That is $18.  Nothing was rubbery but the seafood was essentially just chilled chewy pieces.  They had no flavour.  The most flavourful piece was the half sliced radishes that sat beside a lemon wedge.  There was maybe also 1/4 of a celery stick that was sliced up.  That added a nice crunch factor but for a $18 salad, I expected much more.  My dining partner had much more flavourful app (Wild Boar sausage for $12) but his was overcooked.  It was a pretty darn dry sausage.  Thankfully he had a bit of sauce on the side to somehow make it edible.

Up next came the supposed star of the restaurant, the pies.  They were so underdone.  I look at blogs and other people's pictures on this restaurant and our pies did not look the same at all.  The crust was a pale blonde colour with zero char.  The undercarriage was similar and if anything, it really felt underdone.  Since it didn't feel fully cooked to me, the dough was definitely had too much chew and it wasn't easy to cut or eat compared to Pizza e Pazzi.  As for flavours, the Matteo was served to my dining mate and it was significantly better than mine.  His proscuitto didn't overwhelm the pizza.  It added to it.  The marscapone was a nice touch where it complimented the salty proscuitto.  It supposedly has a lemon flavour but we didn't taste it.  We did taste the garlic and that added a nice component to the pie.  At least his had flavour whereas mine was an embarressment.  My partner asked I was accidentally served a bianco pizza or the margherita without the sauce.  I ordered the vegetarian Ventura and it was supposed to have heirloom grape tomato, roasted pepper, sweet caramelized onion, and artichoke pieces.  I had maybe 1.5 grape tomato? 3 small blobs of onions.  I didn't see any peppers and 2 leaves of artichokes.  Like before, zero flavour and complete disappoint.  Flavours, texture, and crust was all underwhelming.

Overall, I cannot recommend this restaurant. Go to Pizza e Pazzi instead for great pizza!"}
{"text":"Had a solid meal here, albeit pricey. I loved my mushroom pizza - the Matteo and margherita pizzas also got rave reviews from the others at my table. The atmosphere really added to the experience too - it was dim, cozy, and romantic!

My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that our waiter disregarded my serious nut allergy. I later contacted the manager and received an apology. Knowing that they took actions to rectify this issue, I will (cautiously) dine here again in the future!"}
{"text":"I was just going to copy/paste Vivek and Richies' reviews, but I might get flagged and backlisted, so I just have to write my own version....

Thanks Melanie C for organizing the UYE which gave me an excuse to travel across town to Oakville... and 7 Pizzeria Enoteca is well worth the trip.

The staffs here are amazing: friendly and accommodating. I got confused about the meet up time and got here early (for a change), but the wait staff took great care of me and made me feel right at home.

I just love the Pizza Making Bar area, you can chit chat with the nice gentlemen that made your pizza and just looking at the wood burning oven made me feel warm and fuzzy.....

Get The Matteo!! It has just a more complex flavour with the cheese, lemon, honey, saltiness of Parma and the tartness of baby arugala. Btw, that was my pizza which I gracefully shared it with others.....

The Seafood Linguine was quite good too. Egg noodle was cooked al dente and with huge scallops and shrimps..! 

Tiramisu and cookies made a happy ending to our evening......especially it was complimentary from our nice pizza chef... :)

I'll be back! I want The Matteo all for myself, NO Sharing!!"}
{"text":"7 Pizzeria Enoteca (or 'The 7' for the cool kids) is a brand spanking new Italian restaurant in downtown Oakville. It's on the east side of Town Square, closeby Soontorn Bahn Thai and the Green Beanery. I hope it doesn't show my age too much that I remember when this place was an ice cream parlour called What's The Scoop. Iced creams cost a nickel back then, but the only way downtown was by cablecar or oxcart. \"Ox to the square?\" kids would ask each other. Someone would invariably get typhoid along the way. Wow, those were different times.
 
Anyway, what a happening place this is. It's a bit cavelike in The 7, with low vaulted ceilings and modest lighting. They don't take reservations here, but with a little finagling, hovering and just plain charms-manship our group snagged a spot as two trios around the corner of the bar. We had full view of the authentic wood-burning pizza oven (built on site over four days by a craftsman flown in from Naples) and their pizzaiolos kept us roundly entertained while spinning pies.

A clipboard offers a wide selection of wines, mostly red from what I could see. They also have a smart drink list featuring classic cocktails like a Manhattan, Sazerac (with Rye and Absinthe), Negroni, etc. There is grappa also if you're feeling suicidal. From their variety of appetizers I ordered the grilled octopus. It was cooked well and served with a tasty white bean salsa. 

Let's talk pizza. They range from about $12-20 for a personal-sized pie. They have classics like your margherita, or multi-cheese deals, and a few really creative assemblages as well. The pizzas are cooked in no time in their oven, on a super thin and crispy crust. If you want them cut you have to ask, but they are happy to oblige. We shared a few slices among us, and I really enjoyed everything I ate. My favorite had to be the Matteo: it was covered with arugula and tasted faintly of honey. But seriously, not a bad slice to be had. The ingredients are locally sourced where possible. Try the salami; we tried some uncooked pieces and they were melting in our mouths. On a hot pizza it's even better.

On top of all this was their phenomenal service. A group of six is kind of unwieldy for this restaurant (especially *our* group of six), but they managed us with aplomb. Plying us with a few complimentary tiramisus didn't hurt either. Town Square is turning into quite the destination for eats. I shall return.

Obligatory Title Pun: This place is no SEVEN day wonder.

Menu Readability: Elegant.

Need to mention: They will validate your parking if you park underground.

What this place teaches me about myself: I've written a lot of reviews. This is my five-hundreth one!"}
{"text":"Went last week. Great place for the typical Oakville mangia cake crowd, but for an italian - forget about it ! $18 for a margherita is very very expensive even in the best pizeria's in little Italy (NY) or even Milano for that matter. The other problem is the sauce on their pizza, it's not fresh deep Maranzanno's, Canned pomodori they press through the passata.

Good date night ambiance, but for a belly satisfying meal at a respectable price....forget about it ! Really...lascia stare !"}
