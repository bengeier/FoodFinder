{"text":"Awesome California Burritos!!!!   Best local place for a burrito"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this location.  The Carne Asada in anything is wonderful because try get their meet daily right down the street.  Bean Nd cheese burrito with Carne Asada.  Their 4 specials are well priced and leave you full."}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because their carne asada burrito was good. BUT, I'm never coming back here again. 1st of all, the price on their drive-thru menu is different from the window price - which was more, of course. 2nd, they don't do any substitutions in a burrito; paid $2 more because I \"added\" beans & cheese. 3rd, the lady at the drive-thru didn't warn me it would be more $ for my \"added\" items and didn't really care that the prices were different on their drive-thru menu. All she said was \"the owner said he updated the prices\" - no real apology or any accommodations for their misled menu."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Humbertos for a long time. Today the Tripas burro had a disgusting taste and smelled terrible. I called, and the girl that answers said that they had not sold a Tripas burrito today, as if I was lying about my purchase. I told I was just there not too long ago, so she asked the cook and he confirm with her that he had made the buritto. She then tried to argue that the tripas where just prep today, and that they are fresh. My main reason for calling was to let them know that they were not good, and to not serve them to somebody else. She wanted me to bring it back in right away so they could examine it themselves. I told her that I would bring it back tomorrow, as it was already late and an inconvenience to make the 15 min drive back there.  She said they need it to inspect it tonight. So we brought it back... and first thing they did was smell it whole backing away from it. That just confirm that the tripas where not fresh and were old and disgusting. I ended up getting a refund, but didn't even get an apology for the inconvenience. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. They got my order wrong then they started talking about me in Spanish not realizing that I speak Spanish. $7 burrito was the size of a taco bell burrito. I've lived in El Mirage for the past 14 years and have been coming to this spot and the one on thunderbird for years. This was definitely the last time."}
{"text":"Its a little yellow building, a hole in the wall type of eatery, not much to look at, but it give that Mexican - mom & pop character.  I've been here many, many times. Great food, great price. I love their Carne Asada burrito - Zee best. Wife always like their Chili Rolleno combo. it is not fine dinning, but for the money, its hard to beat.   very good food for decent price."}
{"text":"Been back to this place many, many times. Food is always good, Cheap and plenty (giant potion).  I see one or two people give this place a one star, I just can't imagine how anybody not liking this place. unless its a jealous competitor."}
{"text":"Delicious! The ceviche tostada and carne asada tacos are my favorite. Very clean environment, the staff are always friendly. Anything you eat will be worth it."}
{"text":"I love their food. There are a few different things I get from here and it's always hard to pick just one but I know I can barely eat one of anything. Good portions. Reasonably priced. Great food. Very nice location. I only go to this Humberto's now."}
{"text":"greasier than most taco shops.  prices a lil steeper but there is more flavor.  the staff had trouble getting my order correct."}
{"text":"So done with this place I live down the street and go at least once a week and every time I go in something doesn't come out right tonight I asked for a side of sour cream and of course it's forgotten so I pull back to the window to have 2 employees  look at me and walk away. Way to lose a customer over a side of sour cream and 2 employees that couldn't care less"}
{"text":"Was really craving some carnitas burrito so webt and tried this place out Food was ok but they put more lettuce than anything else. My busband got the carne asada fries and we love those.  The place didn't look too clean though. I think they need to pay more attention to the cleanness.  Overall it was good."}
{"text":"Little pricey but the carne Asada burrito is amazing. I don't care for the breakfast burrito since it has French fries in place of dices potatoes but other than that it is amazing."}
{"text":"Typical cheap Mexican food, nothing to ride home about! Wish they didn't get rid of BEEF rolled tacos, chicken rolled tacos turned us off from this \"chain\" resturant."}
{"text":"Don't let the location detour you! Everyone here is so friendly and the food is excellent! The asada  (steak) is very tasty and never fatty or chewy. We have tried several menu items and Humberto's never disappoints!! They serve generous portions whether you eat in or take out. My husband even tried the ceviche and thought it was as good as what we had in Mexico. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The prices are not updated on the menus pics I posted but are still reasonable for what you get. Food is great!!"}
{"text":"We were overcharged for our meal, didn't get what we ordered. Best part of meal was the quesadilla. No water you have to purchase drinks.   The tables were filthy, and I had to ask to have table clean . A young boy showed up and partially cleaned it, had to ask to have it redone. Garbage cans were over filled.  And it just had a nasty filthy vibe. I won't come back . Too many good places to eat mexican that are clean."}
{"text":"Good carne Asada in El Mirage? I guess it is possible because Humberto's delivered in a good way during a recent visit in this outpost of a town. There was not one piece of grizzle or fat in the entire two tacos, which already is a good start. I do like my carne a bit thinner, but this version, despite needing some extra chewing, was still quite tasty. The tacos were loaded to the brim with meat and just a dusting of guacamole and a splash of pico. They gave you red and green sauce on the side, both of which were on the mild side. Only other small issue is that they need to double-wrap the tacos because we had a taco malfunction halfway through numero uno. Regardless, at $2.80 per taco, these puppies aren't worth a special trip here, but if your in the area, you will be happy with your order."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food I especially like the hard tacos and their menudo. I recommend this place plus the employees are super nice"}
{"text":"tip: if ordering in the drive thru - either there is no speaker system or it's out of order - when the person wearing an apron walks up to the side of the menu and stares into your car that means \"Hi, can I take your order\" There was a few seconds of awkward silence and wondering WTH this person was looking in the car for before we figured out she was there to take our order :)  Since moving to the west valley from southern CA we've been itchin' to find a replacement for Alberto's or Taco San Pedro. Humberto's reminds me of awesome hole in the wall type Mexican food, but unfortunately still leaves something to be desired.  With that said here's info on what we had: If you're from So Cal and have had Northgate's shrimp ceviche Humberto's comes awfully close.  Verdict - Ceviche - good. Cheese quesadilla - cheesy - did the job Nachos - good  If you've been out late partying it up and need to satisfy the munchies monster Humberto's should do."}
{"text":"We were looking for a taco truck and found this funny little place. The food was good and the service was friendly. As previously stated the speaker doesn't work so you order, pay and get your good from one window. We ordered rolled tacos, beef and chicken tacos. The rolled ones were smothered in guacamole and cheese. Add some of the red or verde sauce for a little extra pizazz. The beef taco was shredded, the chicken was phenomenal. We'd highly recommend it. From the outside the place looks a little sketch, but sometimes those are the best places."}
{"text":"Just keep on going past this place because their food is an antidote for poisoning. I stopped by their drive up window & asked for a ground beef Taco salad & was told they don't serve them. This man opened a door on the side of the building and took my order. So I asked for a steak Borito with sour cream & avocado. It never happened! What they gave me was a very salty serving of dried out over cooked gristle. Tasted terrible - I hated it! Are these people nuts to serve this crap? It's like eating dog kibble! Doesn't Arizona have food inspectors to protect the public I want my money back!!! I feed my dogs better food than this."}
{"text":"so fucking pissed off right now !!!! so fucking hungry asked my daughter to stop here and grab us something to eat first of all there was no rice left so all we had was 2 chese enchiladas ****** we asked for no lettuce just cheese  and get home and there is more fucking lettuce that anything else*******. what a fucked night this has been and now no fucking dinner"}
{"text":"This is probably  the 20th time I have gotten  menudo here and the 20th  timeI have not been dissapointed. It is consistently  delicious  and I will be back again for #21 times soon.Why you say , the broth ,the tripe,the seasoning,  the hominy, the extra ingredients, the bowl,the spoon,I do not know but it is simply the best."}
{"text":"Nice people , prices great, love the salsa bar very clean, plenty of parking even for a big truck, green chili burrito kicks ass! I take the wife and kids , they love it."}
{"text":"Love them. Better than filibertos. Also love their homemade lemonade. Their carne asada burrito is one of the better ones I've ever had. The meat isn't dry like other places."}
{"text":"Drive by this place everyday on my way to work, figured I would try it out. Big language barrier, Asked If I could have an egg and chili verde burrito. He kept on telling me it's a machaca burrito. After about 5 mins of trying to understand each other, and I was begining to run late for work. I drove off with my machaca burrito. It was good, not bad at all. But not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"They can't seem to get your order right. Even when you order in Spanish because that's all they seem to speak. Definitely not worth the money. I recommend you you drive over to 107th and Grand and eat at the Filibertos. I ordered a carne asada burrito with no pico and with cheese. I got the complete opposite."}
{"text":"This is some pretty solid Mexican food. The restaurant was very clean, the staff was nice and we enjoyed our meals. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the chicken enchiladas my kids had bean burritos. I tried the carne asada burrito and it was very good! I kinda wish I would have had that. My enchiladas were good but his burrito was mmmmm!! They have a very big selection of drinks to choose from. Only thing I would have liked more is a salsa bar."}
{"text":"Maria took our call on Christmas Eve and agreed to cater our small party for the next day with us picking up the food. They loaded it for us when we got there, and were very nice. Excellent value for the money, and outstanding food."}
{"text":"Humberto's is wayyyy more than a taco shop.  This is our go to mexican food place if we don't want to wait to be seated and spend $70 for 3 or 4 meals at a sit down restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, you can sit in Humberto's, but we usually get it to go.  We have sampled about a third of the huge menu and every dish is very authentic Mexican food.  When we first went there it was for lunch and it was packed.  There were three or four landscaping trucks parked outside....that tells you a lot.   You have to try the shrimp cocktail  For $11 you get enough shrimp for 3 or 4 people.  No joke.  Everything else on the menu is 7 or 8 bucks and quite a meal.  The sauces are to die for.  The only item that was not amazing, and it was still real good, are the fish tacos.  They were just ok, not bad, but ok.  I am not kidding, everything else is amazing.  Please give them a try."}
{"text":"I usually love their food but I got enchiladas and asked for no lettuce because I personally don't like it in or around my food and the entire enchilada box is covered in lettuce  it's very annoying when you ask for something to be left off of your food and it's purposely put on not only a small amount but the whole box takes up a whole head of lettuce ?"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, almost approaching the splendid offerings of a taco truck. If you're ever feeling the temptation to grab some fast food while in the area, go here instead. It'll cost about the same and you'll be much happier."}
{"text":"Why don't you throw more lettuce in there. Guess the lettuce is cheaper than the food to put in the box."}
{"text":"It's ok not great not bad. Fast service and cheap prices. It's cheap enough not to be to disappointed. I think it's 24 hours to."}
{"text":"Very very good! Love the food! It's always made when ordered and always has just enough toppings. Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"I love this taco shop! The service is always good and the food is great! The beef tacos and carne wear a are excellent, as are the rolled tacos. Their guacamole is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food and the people are friendly.  Seems like a family affair which I like.  It looks like the place is newly re-decorated.  The kitchen and the dining area are very clean.  They have hit sauce in bottles if you dine in, which I really like.  The bean and cheese burrito is fantastic! They actually add some flavor ro their beans.  The potato egg and cheese is great also.  They use real potatoes instead of chopped up french fries.  The family lives this place and its a regular spot for us.  I would definitely give it a try.  Dont let the size of the place or location scare you off."}
{"text":"I think every review so far is right on, but I always assume the grease is suppose to be on this kind of food :) It is one of the better drive through 24 hour places, especially here in the NW side of the valley.  I chose it over Fil's.  The horchata isn't too syrupy, the beef hard shell tacos are awesome, the quesadilla is good, the bean and cheese burrito is awesome, and the hot sauces are the bomb diggity! Every time we drive through, the staff talks it up (or even sings and dances) with us."}
{"text":"Great little taco shop in El Mirage.  Everything cooked to order.  Recommend the Machaca and Carne Asada!"}
{"text":"When I need my Carne Asada taco fix, this is my go to place!   Always friendly, quick, reasonably priced & the quality of their carne asada tacos is right on :) Plus, I like that they don't charge me for extra lime to squeeze onto my tacos, lol"}
{"text":"Ok. So.... Being a Latina and living in AZ all my life, I know some good Mexican food when I see it/eat it. This place USED to taste good a few years ago, Well not so much of good food this time from My husband and I's experience. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, aka enchilada style. First off, I don't think the cashier understood too well, however, she was polite and seemed like she did, anyway, didn't get it wet when my order was served,  but they fixed it at \"no charge\". Long story short, my beans didn't have any flavor and didn't taste \"fresh\", the enchilada sauce tasted as if it was from a can, my husbands fish tacos were soggy, no flavor, and chewy (batter). The red and green Chili/salsa was good though...I had to pour it on my food to give it flavor. Overall I felt it was a waste of money. Very disappointed :-("}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get hangover or late night meals. The carne asada fries and super nachos are incredible when you need to fill your stomach. Nothing healthy about either plate but the meat is tender and fresh. The only thing I dislike about this place is the wait for the food and sometimes the place is dirty with no clean tables to sit at."}
{"text":"Shitiest place ever!! I don't know how people can eat this \"mexican\" food. What a disgrace. I guess you get what you pay for;diarrhea."}
{"text":"Awesome Carne Asada tacos!! Really tasty.   Nice charbroiled steak and fast and friendly service. Can't go wrong. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"UGH!  Utter Disgust.  I recently moved to the Phoenix/West Valley area and as I'm driving around, looking for somewhere to eat, I see this hole-in-the-wall mexican drive-thru on the side of the road. Most of the best mexican food is found in some of the dirtiest, grimiest spots so I was all for tryin this place out... so I pull into the drive-thru and theres a guy standing outside, next to the menu, just staring at me. It takes me a minute to realize that he's going to be taking my order. That shoulda been a red flag but I ignored it, ordered my food and pulled up to the window. Waited a good 20 minutes... grrreeeeaaaat...... finally get my food (carne asada burrito & adobada fries) and I drive home. By the time I get home (about 10 minutes away), I pick  up my bag and theres a PUDDLE of grease sitting at the bottom of the bag. It literally had to be about 3/4 to a full CUP of grease!! SO GROSS! But i'm STARVING and i'm definitely not going to drive all the way back. So, I get rid of as much grease as possible and I eat the food. I had the fries. My wife had the burrito. Aside from the grease bomb that had exploded on my meal, I guess the food wasnt TOO horrible. Definitely not as good at Federico's or Filiberto's... but not HORRIBLE...  The next day, at work, I get this INTENSE stomach pain and knots in my belly. I end up having to leave work early because it hurts so bad. I ended up vomiting VIOLENTLY for the next 24 hours.   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Their carne asada is awesome any way you get it! Quesadilla, burrito, fries!! Also the guacamole is creamy & delicious!!"}
{"text":"If you were sitting next to Zimm and David while they ate at Humberto's, here's what you'd have heard:  Zimm and David turn away from the counter. Sitting down at the nearest table, Zimm says \"I felt good the moment I saw our order relayed to the kitchen, and the cook gave us two big thumbs up.\"  Sipping the large cup of horchata passed across the counter, Zimm assesses, \"Mmmm. This is pretty good. It's the best milk I've ever had.\"  After filling up a styrofoam cup at the soda fountain, David takes a sip. \"I think that they let a lot of extra syrup run from the soda machine. I'm a Dr. Pepper man, but had to go with this thick Coke.  Zimm reads the sign above the large metal oven, \"Look at that. 'Welcome to the Great Taste of H.' That's a nice greeting.\"  \"I wish this place was right next to our office.\" David realizes that he hasn't even tasted the food yet, but that sign was enough.  Zimm shakes his head as his eyes pan over to the kitchen. Zimm announces \"Oh, I see it! It's coming.\"  David asks, \"Are they large?\"  Zimm's eyes stay wide.  Moments later, their table fills with plates of food.  Zimm says, \"Only paper plates and plastic utensils.\"  \"The sign of a restaurant trying to save money on not paying a dishwasher hourly. Keeping those prices low,\" says David.  We start shoveling it down. It's a lot of food.  Zimm says, \"For real though, the same ingredients as everywhere else, but this just tastes really good.\"  David coughs, \"I think it's the extra oil. You look at the rolls of tortilla, and they've got that soft grey drench of oil.\"  Another bite and Zimm agrees, \"I'm liking this! Actually, I think the key here too is green peppers and chiles. Maybe some onions. All sorts of good stuff. That's something you don't see everyday in a classic chimi.\"  David adds, \"And this chicken. Not shredded chicken, like usual. But we've got pebbles of chicken. Little nuggets inside.\"  \"I'm glad I didn't order an extra fish taco,\" Zimm says.  David takes his last bite, \"Yeah, that was a mistake. But I like that white sauce.\"  They get up from their table to head out. The plates are empty.  David reminisces, \"If I lived here, I'd definitely be stopping in every morning for those $2.99 breakfast burritos.\"  Zimm says, \"Yeah, it's not even hard to make it before 10am.\"  A woman walks through the front door, passing them. The cashier's voice from behind the counter greets her, \"Oh, hello! How are you? Welcome back! How's the family?\"  Zimm smiles, \"This is a new restaurant, but they've already got those return customers. That's some enthusiasm you wouldn't have seen in a real fancy restaurant.\""}
{"text":"Such good food and such a nice cook and cashier (depending on who you get), it's too bad that it's smack dab in the middle of one of the most ghetto cities in all of Arizona. El Mirage is responsible for housing some of the dirtiest crudest people I've ever had the displeasure of coming across. On a side note, $7 for an egg, potato and cheese burrito?!!!! That is just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and had nevertheless visited before. Drive thru speaker wasn't working so a lady with a nonchalant attitude neither friendly neither rude came out to take my order. I got the taco enchilada combo and as there was no description thought there was meat inside the enchilada... my bad it was cheese and a horchata. Didn't take long to get, the horchata was bomb very rico and sweet. But the food... ehhh mostly cheese. The rice was bland but the beans where good. The beef inside the taco was fried way to hard and I didn't get a receipt so after giving her a $20 spot I got 9 bucks and some change back. Yeah needless to say will spend my money on Filberto's where I was originally going."}
{"text":"This place is my fave hole in the all kind of place for drive thru. The prices are ok the food is good n quick service. The carna asada fries are super delish, torta combo also n the rolled tacos are exceptional. They do charge for extra sauce but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Talk to anyone who enjoys Mexican food and has lived in El Mirage for some time and you'll here time and time again that this is the place to go for good Mexican food.  Unfortunately it seems like their carne asadas have been smaller than they used to be (still a meal of a burrito).   Everyone I've talked to says to go to the location on Grand Ave. for the old huge carne asadas.  Tip: Try the CARNE ASADA FRIES but make sure you eat them while they're warm!!"}
{"text":"The location is pretty sketchy but the food is always good. The meat is never fatty and chewy like some other places. Chicken is always flavorful and not dry. The best of the 'bertos in the area."}
{"text":"I would give 2 stars, but the lady at the drive thru window was super nice.  I had never been here before and thought I'd try it out. I ordered a bean & cheese burrito with sour cream, which is my staple for any bertos type place. I was really disappointed. It seemed like they made a bean burrito then poured milk into it. Burrito soup wrapped in a tortilla. I would expect sour cream and the beans to be thick enough to not be liquid. I dono, maybe they have meat dishes that are good, but I'm vegetarian so this was the only thing I would try here and will not be back. I'll keep Riva's as my go to mexican restaurant. Also, there was no speaker on the drive thru menu, so you just drive up to the window and order there."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant not far from Surprise Ball field.  Horchata was too sweet, carne asada was pretty bland but it was high quality meat.  The chile relleno was quite impressive!  The chicken sope was decent but the masa was a little too firm to cut through without a knife.  Got our food very quickly.  Disappointed there weren't chips and salsa...I felt like I got half a Mexican dinner.  :). This was average Mexican taqueria to me...but I'm spoiled in California."}
{"text":"I've had the chicken tacos and a carne asada burrito, both times with rice, what an awesome meal. There about as close to what I'm accustomed to, growing up in Chicago. They do not have the \"fast food\" taste of other places, it's like mamma just brought you a nice hot dinner, go there see for yourself you will not be disappointed, and you don't even have to get out of car, e-z on off from Grand."}
{"text":"Humberto's has the best Menudo. I have always preferred white Menudo because the red chili had always altered the taste, until I tried Humberto's Menudo. It is soooooo good!!! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried the carne asada Torta today and it was pretty good. Good place if you're looking for a true inexpensive Mexican food restaurant in El Mirage. Very clean with friendly staff."}
{"text":"let me start by saying we did not feel welcome by the cashier the whole time we were there.  the food really wasn't much better.  I got the flying saucer with chicken and husband got a breakfast burrito.  his burrito was suppose to have potatoes which turned out to be french fries (not a good thing).  the shell on the flying saucer was dripping with grease but the chicken on it was ok.  they somehow ran out of rice so to make up for it I ask for chips and salsa.  Salsa was probably the worse I've gotten.  the red one was basically enchilada sauce and green one had little flavor and watery.  the refried bean were extremely salty.  Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries! The greatest invention since sliced bread."}
