{"text":"Shoushin is excellent in both service and food. Having recently visited Japan (Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto), it is very comparable to the fresh and sweetness of the quality of fish there. Shoushin is one of the few restaurants in Toronto where you can experience the true essence of sushi and sashimi as part of omakase dining.  What to expect?  You'll be greeted politely once you step into the restaurant where they take your coats, and you'll immediately feel relaxed in it's quiet ambiance and use of natural wood and stone.  At the sushi bar, which only seats about 12 people, you'll be able to see chef Jackie and his sous chefs delicately make the items for the omakase of your choice delicately. Sitting at the sushi bar makes the experience, so be sure to request for this when making your reservation.  Most of the ingredients are flown in from various places, which means 2 things. First, freshness is guaranteed. Secondly, this is probably why it's also pricey for your omakase. I would suggest getting the Yuri or Sakura sets, then adding an extra few pieces if your appetite allows.  This is my second time there, and I would definitely go back. However, I'd save it for special occasions since it is quite expensive."}
{"text":"First time coming to this sushi restaurant and it was amazing. I recently travelled to tokyo and ate at a michelin star sushi restaurant and its no comparison to this restaurant. Chef Jackie paired abalone, cavier and uni on one of the dishes we had and it was amazing! I loved everything that we ordered and it truly was an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Went with a bunch of friends awhile back. I agree with many of the reviews here. It is good not the best in Toronto. In fact, for their price point, I would prefer Zen and Yasu.  We tried both the $80 and the $100 menu. $80 does not include sashimi and the hand roll which I think the it's completely overpriced for what you get. They should charge the $80 for the $100 menu.   Aside from price, the quality of the fish / sashimi is not the best. The toro had some residual when I had it and the urchin was not very sweet. The sushi is decent and looks very nice but the chefs are simply not experienced enough. They look very inexperienced and was not consistent.  The dinner was way too long as we have to wait for the main chef.   I feel like they got potential, not fully ready / perfected to be able to charge the price they charge."}
{"text":"One of the best Omakase in Toronto! Good environment, good food quality, good service with very reasonable price! Keep it up Chef Jackie! Loved what you served!"}
{"text":"Had their omakase for a friend's birthday. it was really good. there's an assortment of sushi. I liked the different side small dishes they have but thought it was just a little too small. less sushi pieces compared to zen (which i preferred better). customer service was attentive.  they also partnered with butter avenue for their dessert but i think their in-house one was even better. would come back again but for a special occasion only."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - Please don't take me wrong!  I do like Shoushin though I don't love it.  My husband and I both had the omakase A ($80) and thought it offered decent but not outstanding value for money.  Everything was fresh and delicious but somehow failed to wow us.    Service is awesome!  Our servers are extremely attentive and our tea cups were constantly refilled.  The hinoki cypress sushi bar and platforms are so beautifully zen!    They didn't have liquor license when we went last week.  So if sipping sake with your meal is important to you, inquire when making reservations.  Dinner options: Omakase A $80 Omakase B $120 Omakase C $250 For an extra $4, you can upgrade their standard dessert (red bean jelly with matcha sauce) to a black sesame puff. Recommended.  Honestly, I have trouble understanding their pricing structure.  IMO, a resto that charges 80/120 per person is highly unlikely to be the same one charging $250. The latter ambitiously pushes the range of Hashimoto which offers authentic kaiseki!  What you get by paying $250 for omakase C is that you get an additional wagyu course plus some upgraded sushi over omakase B.  In Japan, a decent wagyu feast fetches $120 up.  So paying a $130 increment for a single wagyu course really doesn't make sense to me.  Upgrading from omakase A to B, the difference is $40 for a sashimi course.  Again this is a little bizarre!  I'd much prefer to go to Sushi Kaji @$150 per person.  In short, if my friends invite me to Shoushin, I'd be pleased to visit Jackie again.  But I'll stick with omakase A.  If it's my call, then I'll most likely suggest Yasu or Zen.  In Toronto, we've got plenty of good choices at the $80-$100 and the $120-$150 ranges!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Shoushin, after hearing good things about it from fellow sushi enthusiasts. They offer a Tokyo-style Omakase dinning experience which is a set menu with varying degrees of premium fish depending on the set menu you choose.  We all selected the Sakura option which includes two appetizers, premium sashimi, soup, premium sushi with hand roll, and dessert.  we started with a suvee duck breast appetizer garnished with horseradish and mustard, the flavors were mild and complimented the natural duck flavor nicely.  We then had a premium sashimi platter that had flounder, shrimp, scallops and lean bluefin tuna. Served with real wasabi, micro greens and a shiso leaf (japanese basil). Everything was fresh, the textures and flavours were perfect. If you have never had fresh real wasabi or shiso before you are missing out.   The second appetizer was a light tempura shrimp cake and a roasted corn infused tofu cake.  The shrimp cake tasted exactly as awesome as one would expect. But the true star of the dish was the corn infused tofu. I know what you're thinking Tofu? Really? But, it had a silky custard texture and an umami about it that I was not expecting but was pleasantly surprised to find.   Next we had a clear broth with shrimp, snow peas, shiitake mushrooms, and soba noodles. The warmth and flavors of the broth were really good and set up the next course nicely.  The sushi course was next, eleven pieces of premium sushi followed by a hand roll, served and presented individually by the sushi chef. The fish selection changes seasonally, and I can't remember every fish that was served, but all were delicious. The sushi rice was the best I've ever tasted, perfectly seasoned and cooked to an almost aldente consistency.  And finally the dessert, we had the choice of a butternut squash creme brulee, jelly matcha green tea, or sorbet with sake jelly. The chefs choice was the creme brulee, which everyone opted for, but I thought the matcha jelly sounded pretty good. My dessert was visually very pleasing and tasted good, simple and very familiar flavours of green tea, red bean and grass jelly.   Overall experience at Shoushin was awesome, service was exceptional, the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. I thought I knew what premium sushi should taste like after eating at Zen and Toshi Ryoriten, but how wrong was I. Now that I know what sushi can taste like, it will be hard to eat sushi anywhere else."}
{"text":"Got the Yuri omakase set. Costs $150. For what we got, not very worth it. Had 9 piece sushi, 6 piece sashimi and several small appetizers and a dessert. Service was also slow. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Shoushin for dinner with my boyfriend and I have been to almost all the top notch places in the city. I would like to start by saying the food was amazing. Simple, clean and super fresh. Aside from the food, the chef Jackie had an arrogance to him that disappointed me. He was a bit snobby and when I asked about a certain fish his responses were very patronizing. I prefer him to not talk.   Hope this was helpful."}
{"text":"First, I want to thank Jackie Lin and his team for making our anniversary dinner feel so special. Everything was perfect.  Entering Shoushin, you feel like you have been transported to a zen world. I immediately felt at ease.   Decor:The decor is clean simple lines, modern, delicate. You could tell there was a lot of attention to detail. Light natural wood is the theme here.   Service: Servers were polite, and very attentive. As soon as you get up to use the bathroom, they move your chair for you. They fold your napkin. My cup was always filled with tea. As soon as you look up, a server would be ready to help.  Food: This is the highlight! Sooo good! Fish was so fresh and tasty. This place serves traditional sushi in every sense, BUT, the genius is the skill, and knowledge in balancing ingredients to bring out the best flavours. For example smoked king fish. So flavourful and bold. Uni wrapped in sweet shrimp laced with sea salt and lime juice. omg! so good. It's an explosion of flavours.  Jackie does a good job of creating surprise with each sushi bite. He knows how to bring out the best flavour in each fish. He takes the time to converse with his clientele to understand what type of flavour profile they like. Dinner execution was perfect! Timing of each sushi is just right. Enough time for you to contemplate the flavours. Neither too rushed or too slow. Casual conversation with Jackie makes the dining experience fun.  Tip: Sit at the bar for best experience.  The Funny Stuff: a visit to the bathroom is a must! lol..They have the Japanese toilet seats that self cleans and all that jazz. There is a remote on the wall to control the toilet functions. Too complicated. My husband ended up spending more time in the bathroom than necessary coz he was studying the remote! Jackie asked me \"Is he ok in there?\"  hahaaa..  This place is definitely a treat. Great for special occasions. It is pretty pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Food was great , service was terrific  However for an omakase in Toronto be prepared to shell out a days worth of your salary , it's on the high end ~200-300/person"}
{"text":"Its my 4th time at Shoushin and it's still one of my favorite sushi restaurants in town. This restaurant is more like a 4 and a half stars.  Took off the half star due to the lack of facility for babies and wheelchairs.   The Owner was once employed at Zen restaurant (now located at Woodbine and 14th) and now finally get to open his own. Shoushin only features omakase, which are set courses and it ranges from $80-$250 depends on portions and type of sushi/sashimi grade. Normally comes with 2 appetizers, soup, and a variety of sushi or sashimi. Staffs are extremely nice and knowledgeable with their products. An elegant modern decor with a touch of Jap culture. To keep the authenticity they encourage you to eat sushi with your hands, no soya or wasabi required as it is embedded within. I would recommend this restaurant if you want to have that experience and don't mind the high price. :)"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my birthday dinner. I would say this is by far the best japanese restaurant in town. The restaurant has a zen like atmosphere, and similar to sushi-ya in Japan. The guests are welcomed to engage in conversation with the chefs, and the best part is: u can tell the chef what u like to eat and what not to eat. Haha. (Of course, the chefs can speak english). On to the food and drinks, I had lots of sushi and everyone of them are highlights for the the night, and they are served one at a time. Lots of the fish came from Japan. The drinks served by the restaurants are also one of the best ones in town too (Champagne, white wines and sake). * (By chance, if u have no idea of what the fishes are, I posted pictures for your references)  Sushi from the day 1)Ika 2)Shima Aji 3)Sayori 4)Kinmedai 5)Chutoro 6 and 7)different cuts of toro 8)Kohada 9)Kawahagi 10)Mirugai 11)Awabi 12)Japanese Uni 13)Mutsu 14)saba 15)Ika Ino 16)Aka ebi 17)Hotate Uni 18)Botan ebi 19)Anago 20 and beyond) a la carte  Drinks 1)2006 Piper-Heidsieck Brut 2)Domaine Servin Chablis 2014 3)Japanese craft beer 4)Kubota Senju Sake"}
{"text":"We live in the hood.  It took a couple months for me to write this review.  Been eyeing this place secretively work behind that BIG GREY wall for months.  I thought:  Will this be our new go-to omakase place?  We booked a reservation for Friday night the first month it was open, at one of the tables instead of the bar.  I was very excited.  But, ultimately, disappointed.  I was hoping for so much more for that price point.  I understand that the rent is expensive and there are few seats.  The waitstaff are really polite.  One does not speak English well and is too quiet to be heard.  One is friendly, but does not know his japanese food very well.  The female  waitress incorrectly explained one dish.  The timing of food was the worst offender.  The longest wait time between two dishes was about 40 min.  Since we were not at the bar, we were forgotten and did not have the entertainment of the chef.  (I definitely recommend sitting at the bar ONLY.)  The appetizers were all served room temperature (on purpose or by mistake, I do not know), and not memorable.  The selection of tuna was great, but the rest of the sushi did not impress.  I would have loved the option to order more a la carte (especially the chu-toro).  The first group of nigiri we received used a noticeably different batch of shari from the second group of nigiri we received.  The first was quite hard.  The second was proper texture, but fell apart.  As I picked up a piece a bunch of rice bitlets were left stuck on the plate.  The shari was also more salty and less sweet than my personal preference.  I opted for the black sesame puff (an upgrade fee was not disclosed)  and my husband ordered the jelly for dessert.  The special beer we wanted to order was soldout.  So we asked for the sake menu again to choose something else.  The waiter never came back to ask what our decision was, so we opted to drink just the tea we had.  Some of the seats require you to take off your shoes, and wear their house slippers  (this can be kind of gross when you think about it).  I did not wear the slippers and I was FREEZING my tootsies.  The draft from the front door clears right under the tables where your feet are.  The table beside us ordered the $250 omakase.  It did not seem worth it.  That is more than I paid for Alinea, where I was both stuffed and impressed by their impeccable service.  If they were priced at $65/100/150...it would be more appropriate.  Another note:  the special wood imported from Japan has a light fragrance that permeates all the food.  This can be a pro or con, depending on your preference."}
{"text":"Very similar to Zen restaurant, but not as good.  I got omakase B, $120/pp.  Zen's appetizers and desserts are better.  Sushi and sashimi are similar, but Zen gives you 4 extra sushi pieces.  The value isn't worth the price.  Customer service is great though!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend to Shoushin for his birthday. If you want to enhance your omakase experience, I highly recommend to request to be seated at the chefs' table - reservation is a must.   We opted for the Sakura menu which was priced at $160 per person. Menu consisted of appetizer (1), premium sashimi, appetizer (2), soup, premium sushi, handroll, and dessert. Love the fact that each day, they serve unique dishes by chef's choice depending on the freshness and quality. Food was simply amazing from start to end. We really enjoyed the intimate dining experience. It was also interactive as the chef (was so happy that we had Jackie) would explain each dish being served to us.   This was my boyfriend's first time trying omakase and he loved it! Dinner plan was a success! It definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"$100 for 9 pieces of sushi and a mouthful of other food, no thanks.  The atmosphere made it feel like we were in a library, needing to take off our shoes was less than charming (particularly since the interior design wasn't inspired and didn't feel like I was entering a special space to need to make special accommodations), and the taste of the food lingered until the next day.  To each his/her own but this one is not for me."}
{"text":"Ex-sous chef from Zen, Jackie opened up his own restaurant Shoushin and we were fortunate enough to make reservations on his first day of business.   The restaurant is truly one of a kind and can only be described as elegant. It is beautiful from floor to ceiling with pieces specifically imported from Japan (sushi bar - made of fine Japanese hinoki, only one of two sushi restaurants sporting this exquisite Japanese cypress in North America). There is so much attention to details from the decor to the food.   We ordered the omakase B and it was more than enough. The fish cannot be any fresher as it is imported often. We savoured each piece Jackie put in front of us. We loved every dish, from the appetizer to dessert. They do not serve the traditional miso soup but a hamagri bonito soup which was amazing. The dessert was definitely a highlight of the meal. I absolutely adore the black sesame cream puff pastry. The texture was perfect with strong black sesame flavour. Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Chef Jackie does great stuff with his sushi. I love the way he prepares his sushi rice and the plethora of ingredients he uses like marlin, firefly squid, and gizzard shad.   The kind waitress explained to me that there were four main course menus to choose from -- Ume ($80), Yuri ($130), Sakura ($160), and Kiku ($250). I went with the Sakura, which came with multiple appetizers like refreshing sashimi and aji tataki before the sushi, I also ordered from their excellent beer menu and got one of their Hitachino Nest Amber Ale beers. Excellent!  The service staff always served with a smile and my tea was consistently refilled throughout the evening without me having to ask. I will say that this is definitely a slower dining experience since I was there for around 2 hours. But when you go to an omakase restaurant like this I actually think that this is a feature and not a mark against the restaurant. After all, we spend so much of our usual days being busy and rushed for everything -- good food is an opportunity to relax this requirement we've placed on our lives and to let it go and enjoy the flow.   Highlights of the meal included intensely flavourful Kohada (Gizzard Shad), meaty Kuruma Ebi (Shrimp) from Argentina, and smoked toro (tuna belly) which brought to mind smoky bacon or ham before letting loose elegant fatty flavour.   Reservations are definitely required and this is not a restaurant most people would go to every week. But if you have taste for marvellous sushi and you need a place to celebrate a special occasion, this is definitely it.   I love all sushi, but there is something about the intimate experience of omakase at the counter that gets me every time. I would say that Zen is my favourite restaurant in all of Canada, but Shoushin is quickly catching up. Looking forward to going back many times in the future to see how Chef Jackie further develops his menu!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I came here for dinner* We really enjoyed all the sushi (we did the $160 each Omakase). Certain pieces where still surprising although they were all traditional sushi but certainly were very well picked by chef Jackie. The atmosphere is slightly more formal but for the location and the piece by piece service, it was worth it. I must say, I am also a big fan of Zen and would highly recommend both. I definitely recommend only reserve for sushi bar and not table for the full Omakase experience. Best for smaller parties and not the best restaurant for kids."}
{"text":"We finally made it out to Shoushin for their omakase.  We had read about it in the local community paper and online.  Having had omakases at other restaurants we were eager to try here.  I made a reservation within the week we wanted to come but unfortunately was too late to get a bar seat to watch the sushi action.  Upon entering the staff and everyone is extremely courteous and welcoming.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable and wasn't robotic or anything he had personality and was a nice guy to chat with.  He was very pleasant and very professional.    We opted for the Kiku $250 omakase that included the wagyu beef and caviar.  All the the dishes were excellently presented and tasted as good as they looked.    Standout dishes were the wagyu which we had done both ways, grilled and sukiyaki.  Both were very good, melt in your mouth and unique flavours.  We felt it was worth the money.  The caviar and toro and uni was also extremely delicious and stood out.    The sushi and sashimi were very fresh and nice.  We always love the fatty tunas.    Dessert the butternut squash creme brûlée was very unique and delicious!  Not too sweet and I'm not really a creme brûlée person!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"After being privileged to enjoy some of the best sushi in the world, all over the world, I would like to give my review of this new Toronto restaurant.  First of all, I must say it is absolutely beautiful! The sushi bar and the entire interior of the place is gorgeous! It's awesome and offers a wonderful experience.  The service is very kind and friendly, the experience is engaging and just overall wonderful.  The food is top-notch. The menu doesn't really tell you what you're getting but you will receive a wonderful meal at every step. Everything is delicious and well thought-out before it comes to your plate.  I would like to note that I had first thought of giving it 4/5 stars because for the ~ $250 meal for one person (with Sake), I wanted something fancy. Yet when I had the meal I realized it wasn't necessary. At that price in some of the best restaurants in the world, it was similar.  This is very hard for me. I have one absolute favourite restaurant in Toronto that I always call 5/5 stars. Shoushin is so close to it that I have trouble judging.  All I will say is that Shoushin is amazing in every possible way, but there are others with dishes that may be better, or may be an overall less expensive experience for a similar quality, but overall, Shoushin is great.  Basically, visit them! You may never have a meal like it again in your life.  I recommend you try the best food in the world and Shoushin is one of those places."}
{"text":"Food = 4*, but the value/pricing takes this down a star.  To me, the gold standard of sushi/Japanese in Toronto is Sushi Kaji, bar none.  I came with my parents, and we had 3 different omakase meals ($80, $130, $160).  Ultimately, we had 3 palettes, 3 meals, and yet, our feeling of the experience was the same.  Food was somewhere between ok and good, but the value of the experience fell short of the price paid.  Simply put, if you're looking for the best omakase in town, Kaji wins in a landslide.  The pricing is similar as well, and I found myself fuller there as well.  A shame because this place is closer to my parents' house."}
{"text":"It's a very great place for tasting omakase. I went there last year with my boyfriend, and we tried Sakura menu for dinner. The service was pretty nice as well as their food, and they took care of every customer's special request really well. The chef was friendly, talkative, and professional. With the elegent and comfortable dinning environment, we spent a romantic night together."}
{"text":"The disclosure here is that I had dinner on the third day they were open for business.   I had dinner at ex-sous chef from Zen, Chef Jackie Lin's restaurant on Wednesday night as my birthday dinner. I've been anticipating the open of his restaurant for a long time ever since he left Zen Restaurant in pursuit to open his new establishment.   Located at Yonge and Lawrence, it's in a swanky area. You can find street parking right at Yonge or if you want to save a couple bucks, drive into the residential areas and you can park for free.   Inside decor is beautiful. They've used special wood and the details are minimalistic and clean. Very bright open space. About fourteen seats at the sushi bar. Ten seats in a semi private area and about three tables for 2 that I recall.   Onto the food. The appetizer in the Omakase B was a cooked fish and it was way over cooked. I did mention it and Chef Jackie was accommodating so I appreciated that detail. Again, it was only the restaurants third day for business so the kitchen staff is not all there yet.   The sashimi part of the course was average. Unfortunately I didn't think it was anything special which my boyfriend and I thought was a major disappointment. They use fresh real wasabi.   Miso soup with clams was great. Way better than the miso soup served at zen, that is for sure.   Onto the sushi. This was what I was really looking forward to. It's 11 pieces and there's a lot of emphasis on tuna. Five different ways that sushi is delivered and truly spectacular cuts. He uses premium fish and his cuts are generous. Way thicker than the other higher end Japanese restaurants in the city. The incredibly disappointing part of the evening was the rice. In a truly outstanding omakase experience, the sushi rice is just as important as the fish, if not more important. Jackie was trained in Tokyo and his style of rice was less vinegar and less sweet. He focuses on salt. I'm unsure if the city of Toronto is ready for Tokyo style sushi. It's personally not for me but my boyfriend thought it was alright.   Towards the later part of the opening, they ran out of rice. So clearly they are still in their early days of operation and these kinks will be figured out soon.  Beyond the rice however, the tuna, medium tuna, otoro, and torched toro were memorable. The uni from Boston was fantastic. Jackie has the best sea eel in Toronto.   We had a piece of Saba mackerel with kelp on top. This wasn't part of the omakase experience so you'll have to order a la carte. Get this.   The tomago was a little sweeter than Zen. It wasn't better or worse than Zen. Just a little sweeter. I love tomago and enjoyed it here thoroughly. Order the tomago as sashimi without the rice. This is the only way to enjoy this : )   For desserts, we had the red bean curd with matcha. This was okay. For an additional four dollars, on top of the omakase price, we were also able to order the black sesame pastry dessert (I forget the name). I was a little confused as to why I had to pay extra for the dessert, but I didn't care too much. The dessert was good but not mind blowing.   Service was good. The servers were attentive and always made sure I had tea in my cup. Really enjoyed this detail so kudos to them.   I was sitting at the end of the sushi bar near the sink so I didn't have much of a conversation with the chef which I was looking forward to. Kind of get shafted so if you make a reservation, specifically request to be in the middle so you can enjoy all the action.   Again, this restaurant review is based on its third day of operations. I believe it has the potential to be 4.5-5.0 but right now, I have to stick to my 4.0 rating. The rice was my biggest peeve of the day - rice didn't have enough seasoning. The best part about this place was the cut of the fish on the sushi. Super thick and fresh.   Zen is still my favourite restaurant. But time will tell... Best of luck to Chef Jackie."}
{"text":"I would recommend everyone try the caviar cup. IT IS AWESOME! We ordered an extra one after. Great experience"}
{"text":"One of my best sushi experiences in Toronto! The waiter knows exactly what the dishes is and explain the dishes clearly.  All the sushi are fresh and my favourite one is uni so cream and sweet!   I definitely will come back later to try their Kiku menu and order one more pieces o"}
{"text":"Able to get a seat on the first opening night. On the night, the restaurant offer 3 Omakase menus with different pricing and we picked the $120 and the $250 dollar one.  The other reviewer has already included pictures for the sushi and the menus so the pictures will speak to itself...  In short, the sushi was excellent, the fish is fresh and the choice of ingredient including seaweed, wasabi, and sushi rice are the finest; well, at least taste like the finest in my opinion! I would recommend the $120 menu as it includes appetizer, sashimi, sushi, soup, and dessert. I think it has the best value when comparing to the $250 menu.  Oh, and the dessert - black sesame cream puff is a must try in my opinion if you can only pick one of the two being offered! If you are going with your other half, then pick one of each and you both can share! :)  The first night shows there are still some minor bumps to iron out in terms of service flow but are all forgivable as being the first night. I am sure it will get better and I will definitely come back. So the 5 stars I am giving here are all for the food being served and services rating is not included because this is the first night after all. I will omit service this time. This concludes my first review in yelp! :)"}
{"text":"Food- Everything was made with care but personally I felt some of the rolls had too much wasabi and it made me tear up a few times. Fish was really fresh and my favourite was the fatty tuna.   Ambiance- Simply beautiful  Service- The service was beyond extraordinary and I would come back just for the service. They were REALLY attentive and explained everything perfectly.  Value-  A little more than other omakase."}
{"text":"We arrived a little before 8 p.m. and we were greeted warmly by the staff.  The lady at the front bowed very deeply upon welcoming us.  After we told her the reservation name, she took our coats and then we were led to our table near the back of the restaurant.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to get a table at the hinoki sushi bar where the sushi chefs could be seen making the sushi right in front of you but we still had a private and intimate dinner where we sat.  The interior was very modern yet still contained elements of tranquility and peacefulness.  We chose the Ume Omakase for our first time here at Shoushin which was like a introductory omakase menu for the restaurant.  Shoushin also offered three other omakase menus for those who want to try sashimi, wagyu beef, caviar, and other even more delicate offerings.  Those would be good for future visits and for those who like to splurge a lot on a single meal!    We also had the sake pairing too.  Shoushin serves Tokyo-style sushi where the fish is flown in fresh so don't expect to see the same menu day-to-day here or even week-to-week.  The service that night was excellent and our server was very patient and professional when serving us.  He explained every dish thoroughly.  We started off with our first sake pairing of the night with our appetizers.  This was a light citrusy taste that actually went really went with the first appetizer which were fried scallops with some cashews, spinach, and seaweed.  This was a very delicate appetizer.  I liked the scallop.  I believe this was flown in from Hokkaido, Japan!  The second appetizer was a little dumpling made with soy milk skin with a piece of lobster inside and actual soy milk.  I liked the detail of this appetizer too.  I could have had another little dumpling in a heartbeat.  A strip of sea kelp tied up the dumpling.  The snap peas were so crunchy and the mushrooms and carrot were fresh.  We liked the sweet bonito broth that came with this dish too.    The almond paste tofu soup was one of the highlights of the night.  I know it was just soup but this tofu was incredibly delicious!  This would be a must-try for me. The taste of the almond paste was so smooth and strong.  There were pieces of crunchy bonito in the soup too.  After the appetizers and soup, we received a small box with a folded wet napkin in it.  Our server informed us that the upcoming sushi pieces were best eaten by hand and had sticky rice.  Thus, the convenient little box of a folded wet napkin with a dedicated area for finger-washing was most appropriate.  Our first plate of sushi arrived with three pieces.  One of them was a striped jack.  I liked this one the best since it was just a tad fishy-tasting and tasted memorable.  I wasn't as impressed with the second one and the third one was similar to the second one in taste.    The sake that we had with the sushi dishes also went really well with the raw seafood.  I found that the taste of the Ki-Ippon 180 sake changed a bit after each sushi.  It went from light tasting to semi sweet to light again.  The second plate of sushi arrived also with three pieces.  There was a smoked sushi piece that was so chewy and unique.  We both liked this one.  Surprisingly, the otoro wasn't my favourite here.  We finished off the sushi course with shrimp and scallop.  Each of the sushi were brushed with sushi soy sauce and this was especially apparent with the scallop sushi.  The shrimp sushi was so fresh and the piece was so large.  I liked this one.  The scallop sushi wasn't as fresh and sweet-tasting as I expected.  I've had raw scallop before that tasted very sweet.  This one tasted a little bitter to the both of us and we weren't sure why...  Next up, we had a maki set with tamago as a pre-dessert.  I absolutely loved the maki rolls.  It looked so simple but it was assembled with delicious Japanese rice (I had been raving about their sushi rice all night actually) and the raw fish was so soft.  It was a really, really delicious maki roll!  The tamago was also really good.  It was fluffy with a tad of sweetness in it.    We finished off our omakase with a choice of three desserts: matcha pudding, sweet potato crème brûlée, and sorbet.  The matcha pudding was topped with a small piece of apricot and a white mochi.  The matcha taste in the topping of the pudding was truly authentic and delicious!    The sweet potato crème brûlée was truly a unique dessert.  The hard caramel top was slightly sweet and you could taste the sweet potato in the grainy custard base.    By the time we left and paid the bill, the restaurant was pretty much ours.  The other guests had already left and the staff made sure that we left the restaurant with as much respect and warmth as when we arrived.  All of the staff bowed deeply to us; definitely a sign of respect in Japan for the guests.  Even when we had exited the restaurant, one of the staff stood by the doorway and bowed again."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and it was much better than I expect. I've been to a couple other omakase restaurants before but this place, definitely holds a spot in my heart. We were running late to our reservations due to traffic but they kindly waited for us. I was recommended to come here simply for their automated toilets. Haha, so of course, first thing I had to do was check out their self cleaning toilets that heated up, gave me that Japan feel.   Upon entering you will be greeted and asked for your jacket. Then the lovely staff will guide you to your seats. We decided to seat at the sushi bar, the staff even kindly pulled out the seat for us. For the ladies, they provide you with a basket where you could put your purse in underneath your chair which made it more convenient.   Aside from the environment, the staff here are very kind and attentive. Always paying close attention to their customers, from filling up tea/water to even wiping down the table every time you make a mess (like dropping a grain of rice or dropping soy sauce).   Finally for the best part, the food!! Our meal was prepared by chef Tsuyoshi Yoshinaga. They have 4 omakase meal plans ranging from $80-$250. We decided to go for the second one (Yuri - $130). Our first appetizer was tofu skin with dried shrimp, nice an light. Then we had our sashimi, which included one of their special fish from Japan and fresh (not frozen) scallop from Hokkaido, Japan paired with hotaru ika (firefly squid). Our second appetizer was sesame grilled black cod with asparagus. Next we had fish soup, which was so good, it literally melted in your mouth. After that our sushi meal began. First we had fluke, Japanese cuttlefish, aji (horse mackerel), lean bluefin tuna, toro, toro marinated in soy sauce, ebi (cooked shrimp), torched ichi (golden ice snapper) and uni from Boston  Then we were handed a toro handroll which was delicious!! Finally for dessert, an egg roll and your own choice of dessert, I decided to get their citrus sobert to conclude our meal.   Overall experience, amazing!! I normally go to Zen, which is where Chef Jackie Lin previously worked at and learned from but Shoushin was definitely worth the drive and visit."}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful experience.  A small restaurant with beautiful interior design that only seats a few people. I assume that is so that they can give you a lot of individual attention. I went for an annoversary date and we were very impressed. A lovely ambiance and the food was delicious. We did omakase B version, for $120 each. We got soup, two appetizers, a plate of super fresh sashimi then 10 or so pieces of sushi, handed us to us by the chef one at a time. It was a three hour experience so be prayed for that. Plenty of street parking on Yonge street. Not much dessert selection. I didn't like the dessert (green tea tiramisu) but my boyfriend quite liked it. We absolutely will return."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Restaurant is small and cozy, akin to some of the best sushi restaurants in Japan. Food is great. Will certainly return."}
{"text":"We went here for my bf's  birthday.  Great place with great food and service. Everything was carefully explained. Each piece was fresh and delicious. we ordered the kikyo  for $220 and the yuzu for $130 meals for variety. Usually there are times I don't  like but they made everything so well that I honestly can't find fault. Service was spot on. Drinks were refilled without ever being requested. I have been to several omakase places before but this is my new favorite spot. Servers are pleasant. Chefs make good conversation."}
{"text":"Great service, sake and fresh food. The server was very knowledgeable on sale. This place is a treat for special Occasions."}
{"text":"Omakase is expensive.  However, it is a nice treat to yourself once in a while, or at least once in a lifetime.  I had omakase over 10 times when I traveled in Japan.  I even tried two of the Michelin 2-star omakase restaurants in Tokyo two years ago.  Shoushin is the first omakase restaurant I tried in Toronto.  I did have a very good experience and it was especially enjoyable with my foodie partner, Jennifer K. ^^  It was absolutely a five stars experience to the service, food, interior decoration and atmosphere.  To their service, I would say it is even better than what I received in the Michelin 2-star restaurants I tried in Tokyo.   Shoushin offers excellent and high-class friendly service from greeting you at entrance, coat check, pulling your chair to be seated to even pulling your chair when you are standing up to your way to washroom.  The serving staff, the chef including the owner/head chef of Shoushin explained clearly to us of all the food we were served.    We picked the less expensive set to start with, but all sushi and fishes were so fresh that we were treasuring every single bite.   Even the two appetizers and soup to start with were done amazingly good.  They were quite a sense of taste enjoyment.  The desserts were not impressive but they were not bad at all.  I will definitely go again for a special occasion.  Remember to make reservation ahead of time and request to sit at sushi bar for more enjoyment!"}
{"text":"Another place that my wife and I have been looking for an excuse to try. We've been fans of Kaji in the past but I think Shoushin comes as a close second.   We had the Sakura menu and ordered the martini glass toro caviar on the side (that was a bit pricier). The fish were excellent , fresh and well prepared by Chef Jacky. Service was exceptional with servers being extra attentive. A great experience for an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5/5  I had the $160 omakase. It was good, but I expected more.  Ie. One of the courses was a deep fried scallop. I feel it's not good use of a fresh scallop; it would be better seared or raw. My favorite course was the Sashimi which included my favorite fish - Stripe Jack. Out of the sushi course, I enjoyed the Argentina Shrimp, Tuna handroll, and Russian Uni. I would give 4 stars for the raw fish and 3 stars for the cooked courses.   Ambiance (4.5/5): I loved the space - light wood, modern and clean feel similar to the restaurants I visited in Japan. I sat at the counter and it was very comfortable and intimate. I always enjoy watching the sushi chefs. However, there was one very large fly & a smaller fly buzzing around during the meal."}
{"text":"Before anything else, a couple of tips:  - Sit at the counter. I know it's not conducive to a 'date atmosphere', but it was a pleasure watching the chefs slice the fish. You also get a lengthier explanation of things.  - They recommend eating the sushi with your hands and without dunking it in soy sauce. I know this may make some uncomfortable but I would definitely recommend it. Not adding soy sauce just let's you appreciate the fresh taste of the sushi. And the benefit of eating with your hands? This may sound a bit weird but it actually makes you acutely aware of how the taste of chopsticks 'ruins' the sushi. I guess it's kinda like those places where you eat in the dark and become hyper sensitive to the taste of the food. Here, eating with your hands gives the sushi a more 'pure' and clean taste (irony not intended hehe). Try it out!  With that said, I agree with much of what's been posted here and don't really have much to add: - The quality of the food is top notch. I got the sakura course (where most of the sushi was from Japan) while my husband got the seasonal Canada 150 menu (where many of the ingredients were from Canada). While both menus were sourced from opposite sides of the world, both were thoughtfully put together. And the food was flat out fresh - you can really taste the difference from other omakases and is worth the extra $. - The interiors are beautiful wood, the noise level is appropriately quiet without being stiff, and the staff are quick to serve without hovering or stifling the experience.  If you're willing to spend, would definitely recommend Shoushin's omakase."}
{"text":"Exquisite. Shoushin is both theatre and dining experience. Watching the sushi masterfully crafted in front of you is fascinating. Dishes are served in thoughtful order and provide a symphony of pure, clean flavours. The highest quality fish in Toronto. We preferred this to the two Michelin-started sushi restaurants we visited in Tokyo."}
{"text":"We opt for omakase B which comes with an app, sashimi, sushi and dessert.  The app came with a shrimp fritter which wasn't crispy at all.  It was oily as well.  The sashimi was just regular grade fish, nothing special about it.  I should probably get the omakase A instead.  The sushi has many variety.  It all depends on what they have each day so it will vary each day.  To me it wasn't good value for what i paid for but ymmv depending on the fish that they receive.  I would recommend you sit at the sushi bar for some interaction with the chef."}
{"text":"Went here for a anniversary dinner.  Overall, it was good, but expensive for what you get.  We had the Sakura omakase. The fish was fresh and the staff were attentive and friendly.   I have had omakase at several restaurants and I would say this was average. Not bad, not amazing. I know their style is simple but authentic and I would say they do deliver on that. However, for the price ($160 plus tax/tip per person), it is up to you if you feel it is worth it.  Personally, I expected a bit more.  The atmosphere is nice. Modern and casual. Our waiter and the sushi chefs were very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"I rarely give five star reviews -- but Shoushin fully deserves these top marks. We went for a special occasion and, hence, didn't mind the hefty price tag that came with a multi-course omakase and sake. In fact, given that what Shoushin does is not really available anywhere else in Toronto, the experience is well worth it.  A few general observations:  first, the restaurant is gorgeous. Beautiful design from the linen ceiling to the bar, to the angles and lighting that make  shotgun style commercial space on an odd part of Yonge Street (north of Lawrence) breathtaking.  The atmosphere is very calm and sen, which helped make the three hour dining experience relaxing and special.  Second, the wait staff were wonderful. They carefully checked -- and re-checked - dietary issues (one of our party of four has celiac disease), and lovingly explained the provenance of each piece of fish served, each type of sake, etc.  Third, there are different levels of omakase, and we opted for the \"sakura\" at $160 per person. The only real advantage of the \"kiku,\" for a further hundred dollars was wagyu beef and caviar.  The cheaper \"yuri,\" seemed not to make sense given what was on offer. In any vase, the sakura did not disappoint and provided the perfect amount of food  [there was also a special Canada 150 menu that highlighted domestic ingredients].  The sashimi was outstanding, each and every  piece, with the scallop, mackerel, and shrimp absolutely perfect.  A wonderful dashi based soup -- so light but so packed with flavour -- punctuated the close of the sashimi and the start if the sushi.  The highlight here, and really of the whole meal, were the three tuna pieces: back, belly, and fatty belly.  Fun to have them in succession and superb with the junmai sake we had moved on to at that point.  A handroll with a side Tamagoyaki rounded things out before a desert choice (we opted for macha jelly and butternut squash creme brule, both exquisite).  Cannot wait to return, but given the price point it will have to be another very special occasion. This is a gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place that I have ever been to. The servers were very attentive. They lit a candle for us to celebrate our special occasion. The food is phenomenal! Every piece of fish was very well cut, well seasoned / unseasoned, and had the right freshness. The chefs, especially Chef Jackie Lin, were super friendly. Chef Jackie Lin along with his staff was very patient and willing to explain every dish with us. It is not only about the food. The whole experience was excellent.  Also if you want to get the full Omakase experience, I highly recommend that you book the sushi counter so that you can witness the entire sushi making process"}
{"text":"Came here on June 30 and it was a fantastic meal, even if the food coming out was a little slow. The service was very attentive however. The restaurant was just busy and it was about 1.5 hours for the meal.  We ordered the $160 omakase with the sake pairing ($60).    Unfortunately we were seated at the end of the sushi bar rather than the middle of it; I would have liked to see how they worked but it was ok.  Hmm. Not sure what else to say - the food was great; the rice was ok.  I'm no sure if you are supposed to notice every single grain but that was how it felt :). I think I would prefer it a smidge more cooked but at least it wasn't mushy. Oh, the sake pairing was delicious."}
{"text":"First experience with Omakase and it was amazing. I decided to make a reservation for this place to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and they made note of this which made it even more special.   My boyfriend and I were sat by the bar as requested. For a Sunday evening, almost the entire bar was full and there were only a couple of seats available. Remember to make a reservation, which can be done online and they will call you confirm your reservation.   We chose the Yuri menu which is $130.00 per person and we felt it had a good variety of sushi and sashimi to fulfill the experience of Omakase. The sushi here was fresh and the best I've had. My boyfriend agreed that the sushi here was very fresh and enjoyed it a lot.   The servers here were very discreet, polite and always very kind in explaining each dish. I was very impressed by this and it was a refreshing feeling. It was lovely to see Chef Jackie do what he does best close up and it made it a more enjoyable experience.   At the end of our meal when we chose our desserts, the server even remembered to put a candle on my boyfriends dessert to celebrate his birthday. Everyone was also so kind in wishing him Happy Birthday as we were leaving as well. What a wonderful experience! I honestly wouldn't mind coming back here as the food here is excellent."}
{"text":"My favourite omakase in town! Jackie the main chef and the owner is so professional and knows his job.  Will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"After hearing such rave on this restaurant to try out their omakase experience, my boyfriend decided to make a reservation to try out their omakase kiku for our anniversary dinner. Right from coming into the door of the resturant, I was charmed by the polished interior as well as the lovely hostess that welcomed and seated us nicely, it was also a sweet touch that they wished us a happy anniversary.   It was an awesome experience to watch the chef and cooks cut and prepare the sushi as well as the other dishes so eloquently while sitting at the table top. Every dish presented to us was explained and presented simply but beautifully... however, I'm sad to say that the amount and taste of the food we got did not match it's price as I found everything to be rather mediocre, especially for $250pp. Sure the fish was fresh where one can taste the vast diffrence in comparison to an all you can eat... but was each person worth $250 - not in my opinion. By the end of the meal, both my bf and I were still rather hungry... we actually went out and grabbed a light bite at Timmy's   My disappointment grew when we got to the point of our course in tasting the various nigiri; I was fairly overwhelmed with the amount of wasabi I was receiving in the nigiri that I couldn't feel my tongue! My bf kindly told the head chef (Jackie) to reduce the amount of wasabi for me for our next nigiri, but instead he mixed up my nigiri with his, to where I received such an overwhelming burn that I began to hiccup! I personally told chef Jackie that I truly don't like wasabi with my nigiri, but he insisted that nigiri is meant to be eaten with wasabi! As a weak Asian, I was bawling on the inside as my mouth burned!   The highlight of the resturant for me was NOT the food, but to actually experience the bidet toilet in the washroom!! It was rather quite exciting for me to see the bidet as I ran off to the washroom to rinse my mouth from the burn of the wasabi!   Overall, the service and experience was nice. But the food just didn't cut it for me as I wasn't floored by it with the expectations my bf and I had in mind, and with the price tag for each person, we did not find it worth it. We were truly disappointed."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of chef Jacky and was excited to visit his new spot. Book in advance to eat at the bar. The courses were all delicious as usual but my favourite part is always after when we ask Jacky to recommend some favourites and we explore new tastes and creations. The price ticket is definitely on the higher end (usually $80+ a person when I go) but it is 100% worth it. Prepare to eat slow and enjoy the pieces as they come."}
{"text":"First time trying Omakase here in Toronto. I was very impressed with the decoration, service was really excellent and attentive, and food was superb. The price may be steep for many who frequent AYCE or normal Jap restaurants in town, but the quality is much better. I've tried omakase in other parts in the world and this is not as expensive as those. Don't expect to be full from their first two course selections. I still had room for food after my omakase with sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of traditional, high-quality omakase nigiri. My review is geared towards like-minded diners.  I had omakase B: a couple of apps + sashimi + 10 pieces of nigiri + hand roll. The nigiri is comparable in flavour and umami to Yasu and Zen, but a step below JaBistro for me. The rice broke apart easily in my mouth, but I found the texture of the rice oddly hard. The toro hand roll was great. Seaweed that's crispy, flavourful, and doesn't stick.   Bonus points for providing a yubifuki (small finger-cloth used to clean your fingers between nigiri). This is the only place in Toronto I've been offered one."}
{"text":"How does a new restaurant with a young, talented former sous-chef and so much potential, become so remarkably irrelevant in such a short time? The answer is simple, actually.   When an owner/chef begins to believe that he is a rockstar, deserving of accolades and unconditional affection, but hasn't earned it, doesn't appreciate it, and worst of all- shows disdain for the very people lining his pockets every day, the writing is on the wall.  The decor- Bauhaus chic- but we've seen this before.  The waitstaff and hostess- pleasant, but fearful of  their leader, barely out of diapers with a napoleonic complex  The food- good. But typical Tokyo style, nothing evolutionary or revolutionary.  The value- don't get me started.  Our Chef/Owner clearly doesn't know his neighborhood or clientele.   Over priced.  But how do I possibly explain our overall experience? Jackie Lin, who was just a gleam in his parents eye when I started eating sushi, picked the wrong brother when he began his 7PM seating by teaching me a condescending lesson about how to eat my sashimi.  I requested No Rice in order to respect my wife's gluten free diet. The restaurant was happy to oblige.  Chef Lin must of been the last to know because he began a nervous attack on both of us, saying how he never does this, and we should have been told so, building his tiny sashimi morsels angrily and serving the full selection of omakase bites on a singular dish, unabashedly throwing it in our faces like a dog getting his morning water bowl.  My wife wanted to yell at him.  I quietly asked her to allow Mr. Lin to think about his actions and make up for the poor display. But he didn't.   I actually think he believed we had never been to an omakase experience or visited a tasting menu before.  The passive insults kept coming.  I held it together.  \"Would you order pasta without the pasta?\"  \"I carefully selected this fish to pair with my rice!\"  \"You should have ordered the a'la carte\". Lin was completely thrown off his game by our simple request.  He couldn't concentrate.  His final dish to us was a tuna hand roll put together in haste, devoid of flavor, garnish or effort. We had to take it out of his hand because he refused to plate it.  I think I know what Lin's problem is.  He's young. Merely 31, with very little experience catering to a demographic of experienced and discerning taste.  He lacks the customer skills that compatriots Mitsuhiro Kaji, Yasuhisa Ouchi and several others (we are lucky in this great city) have to handle the ferociously different and eclectic palates and array of customers that will inevitably step into his establishment.  Here's some advise, Jackie:  Drop the bourgeois attitude (you're not Rob Gentile or Grant Van Gameron yet).  Learn how to smile and appreciate the $250 we just dropped for 9 pieces of sushi and a couple of vodka sodas.  Stop assuming you're the smartest guy in the room- you're just not. You haven't been on this planet long enough.  Lastly, take my word on this- and I know what I'm talking about, having seen restaurants come and go weekly in this fickle, unadulterated foody town:  If you are trying to cater to the young-only, interweb generation and jetset crowd of new money and limited epicurean tastes- you are doing a great job of feeding them your kool-aid. But sooner rather than later, these same kids will be discovering sushi mastery worldwide, coming back to this fair city and realizing how one-dimensional this restaurant really is. Either change the attitude, or lower your prices.  One of these measures should help you weather the storm that is this business.  Sorry about the review- but somebody had to."}
{"text":"I'm sure many will complain about the cost but there are only a handful of sushi restaurants on this level in Toronto. We ordered the$160 set course each. When we were asked if we had any allergies I asked if it was possible to not have mackerel as it's typically not my favorite fish. The waiter convinced is to give it a go and I have to agree it was the best mackerel I have ever had. There isn't even a close second.   I found the service and attention was perfect. The attention to detail and quality of the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Shoushin definitely deserves a 5 star rating from my experience. Came here for my birthday and was pleasantly surprised at pretty much everything at the restaurant. This starts with your entry to how the staff greets you, to the moment you leave with not only a full belly but also an appreciation for great service.  There is no parking lot; street parking is your friend here. Either that, or park in the neighborhood and walk to the restaurant. Not too much of a walk. Plus, there's lots to see on Yonge St.  The decor is very clean, not too fancy, but very neat and comfortable. Nothing too flashy here so you can focus on the food that's being made in front of you. It's also nicely lit, so you can see what you're eating, and take some amazing pictures. There's not too much seating here, hence reservations are needed. Staff are friendly, right from the door to your seat, and back out again. Do not expect this restaurant to be an Izakaya style restaurant. And you will know this as soon as you enter the door. You are pleasantly greeted (not a screaming 'WELCOME') as soon as you enter; the host will welcome and bring you to your seat and introduce the menu for you, one item at a time, and the differences in each of the sets. The 'set' menu, which is basically three to four sets containing the chef's choice of sushi/dishes for you that night, all come in price-ascending order. Naturally, the higher the menu set, the more dishes you'll get.   The chefs are entertaining and friendly. The ones we met that night were native to Japan so they had a lot of knowledge (and interesting stories) to share with us. With each 'creation', they will brief you on where the fish is from, what flavour it holds, the texture, what it pairs well with, etc. etc. Every dish is (as cheesy as it sounds) a piece of art, so charge your phones! The flavours are delicate yet flavourful, and the level of service offered just adds to the experience.  Because the dishes are different from time to time, it's hard to pinpoint one and talk about the pros and cons. One thing that's consistent is their rice; the building blocks of sushi. Soft, warm, and oh so good... you might be tempted to just order a plain bowl of rice here.  For some, it might seem strange at first having to stare at the chef making your dinner a few feet in front of you for the entire night, but they are friendly and social which will naturally put you into a conversation. The best is when you can laugh together.  At the end of the night, you wouldn't realize the amount of time that has passed, or the number of dishes that you have consumed. And, although you're literally only eating one piece at a time, you still manage to be satisfied with not only the food, but the EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Was quite excited to try this place knowing the chef from Zen moved here opening his own restaurant. I came here with my brother and we both ordered the 6 course Omakase for $120. The set came with 2 appetizers, a sashimi platter, soup, 9 pieces of sushi, a handroll, tamago, and dessert. First appetizer were some veggies and a piece of black cod - seared nicely, soft and almost melts in your mouth.  I personally did not like the soup - it wasn't the typical miso soup, and it came with a duck meat ball. The second appetizer was a dumpling stuffed with lobster meat and scallops, served with king mushroom and green peas. I found the scallops a little too over cooked, but that's just me being sightly picky. I think this dish lacked a little flavor. Sashimi and Sushi were both good. The fish was really fresh and served at the right temperature. I find most of their fish had a minty taste to it - i feel like they may have marinated their fish with the mint leaf? I personally don't like the minty taste so it wasn't much of my liking. I didn't like how they didn't serve any soya sauce. The soya sauce was already brushed on the sushi, but there were some dishes where I rarely had any on it. I like how they provided a small cloth to clean your fingers after eating sushi with your hands. Eating sushi with your hands is the traditional way, so it's nice that they encourage you to use your hands. The toro handroll was really good. I love how the seaweed was nice and crispy.  The tamago was sweet - tasted good. The dessert was a earl matcha green tea pudding. I like how it wasn't sweet - the only sweetness came from the red bean sauce on top of the pudding, and there was a puree of tea powder giving it a slight taste of bitterness.  Overall I really enjoyed my meal. However, I do prefer Yasu or JaBistro's as portions are larger and for less too. My brother wasn't full after today's meal. Service was good. My cup was always filled with water - bonus points for that :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last few months. The 1st time was in June. I was extremely impressed with the service, quality & amount of food. It was the best! I've been to all the top sushi restaurants in Toronto & I was impressed. I would rate it 5 stars.    The 2nd time I went was in October.  I was expecting it to be as good as the 1st time but was disappointed. The cooked food was disappointing. Lacked flavour & nothing special. The sushi was very fresh & melted in ur mouth. Delicious. Dessert was nothing special as well. A bad way to end what's supposed to be a great experience. After this experience I would rate it 3.5 stars. I was going to take my friend here for her birthday but now I'm thinking of taking her to Yasu."}
{"text":"High Level  Toronto, ON. $80+. Omakase only. Date of visit: November 25, 2016 ?Recommended.  I have spoken at length about Toronto's sushi frontier on my site. It's not exactly rocket science, but it certainly bears repeating: take a metropolis of almost 5 million people, mix in one of the world's most diverse populations, add the economic hub of a country on the rise, and immediately the market becomes ripe for high end restaurants. Unfortunately, beyond a few options (like Yasu or Sushi Kaji), I've found Toronto lacking for the type of high-quality, sushi-centric options that now dot other cities in North America. For that reason, just the very idea of Shoushin - the only Omakase-focused sushi restaurant in North Toronto - was a welcome one. And the results have matched my hypothesis: In just its first year of existence, Shoushin has already made a significant imprint on the Japanese food scene in Toronto and across Canada, highlighted by a sterling review in The Globe and Mail (that's Canada's national newspaper).   All of that is moot unless the restaurant actually delivers; fortunately, Shoushin does. The sushi is hand-delivered (see what I did there?) and prepared by the itamae, Chef Jackie Lin, in the Edomae style. If you're not familiar with that term - though it's becoming more well-known - it refers to preparing and treating the neta (aka fish or other toppings) methodically to elevate the flavours. Originally, when the term was coined in the 19th century in Tokyo, the purpose of treating the fish was to maintain freshness. In fact, Edomae loosely refers to Tokyo Bay, which is where the fish was primarily sourced from and eaten with a ball of rice. Many of the world's best sushi restaurants serve sushi in that method, which is great because I've had enough cowboys serving me toppings of tomatoes and salad cream to last a lifetime.  The Food  Shoushin offers four distinct Omakase options, a trend which I've noticed far more frequently among sushi restaurants. Having four options benefits appeals to a more diverse group of customers, while still retaining the traditional Omakase spirit of trusting the chef with the details. My choice was the Sakura, which won't (and shouldn't) mean anything to you; just note that if you want the good stuff, you'll want to choose the Sakura or Kiku options. \"Mr. Sushi Legend, what do you mean by the good stuff?\" Well...random stranger... the good stuff is Chef Lin's premium nigiri zushi, featuring strictly wild fish, sourced mostly from Tokyo.   Kama Toro (pictured above), the supremely fatty part of the tuna's collar, was sublimely cut and prepared and a personal highlight. I was also impressed with the knife skills of the chef; look at the different cuts of the fish below - and how they vary - from the lengthy Buri (adult wild yellowtail) to the rounded Chu Toro (medium fatty tuna). Other highlights included a soft Anago (saltwater eel) and tender Tako (Octopus).  A somewhat random aside: I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the sashimi appetizer (pictured below), featuring Tako, Amaebi (sweet shrimp), katsuo (bonito) and hotate. Shoushin doesn't skimp on the portion size, but still treats the fish prior to serving; the result is one of the best dishes of the night. ?  The Atmosphere  One of my favourite aspects of my visit to Shoushin was the space itself. The sushi bar is beautiful, crafted from light Hinoki wood, and untreated with varnish. Part of it is seated with chairs, but for the more adventurous and traditional of you, there is a portion where patrons remove their shoes. Adjacent is a no-shoes table area (for those of you with families) - I haven't experienced it myself, but judging by how hard it is to make reservations, I'd imagine the sushi at the tables is as good as at the bar.  As for service, Shoushin delivers in both quantity and quality. Though there are a number of staff working, there are clear roles: you won't see the same person pouring you water as serving your food. And I couldn't picture a more polite and knowledgeable group; clearly, the training methods have been successful."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my wife's b day.  When we arrived, the hostess immediately greeted my wife with a \"happy birthday\" which was a nice touch.  We sat at the bar and went with the Sakura Omakase option.  Before I comment on the omakase exprience, let me tell you that their tea pouring game is ON POINT!! You will never have to take more than 3 sips of your tea before someone comes rushing in to refill your cup without being too intrusive which was definitely nice.  On to the omakase exprience.  The sushi chef was nice but it was really hard to understand what he was saying when it came time to explain  what he was serving and no, I'm not talking about Chef Jackie Lin.  We felt bad always having to ask have him to repeat himself or clarify what he was saying so we just mainly nodded and say \"thank you\" most of the time.  There were about 17 dishes or so including dessert.  Everything was good but for the price we were paying, I was expecting much more. What cheesed me the most was that all they did to celebrate my wife's b day at the end was sticking a little candle next to our dessert which was already part of the Sakura Omakase option.  Nothing \"extra\".  I wasn't hoping for a full size birthday cake with the works but come on, for the price people were paying to celebrate a special occasion, maybe a little additional treat or something no?   Overall, service was impeccable, restaurant was clean , but I guess where it fell short was the taste.  It just didn't live up to our expectation for that price point hence the mediocre rating.  Sorry Shoushin, but your tea pouring game is the best I've experienced so far in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Omakase experience at Shoushin. I would suggest going for the Ume ($80) if it is your first time here at Shoushin and just want to have a taste of what they offers.  I do love the diversity of their menu: they serves both cook food and sushi. The cooked food is interesting and love the plating. The plates/bowls they used are all so pretty and unique! Almost all the nigiri sushi are prepared by Chef Jackie which I appreciate but it was kind of stressful/funny when I saw him running across the sushi counter.   Beer, Sake and wine menu has some interesting items. A little pricey but the sake sampler is a great value!  The service is top notch here. The staff all so well trained and fully understand the menu. Always polite, discreet and anticipate your need.   Shoushin is worth the experience especially you enjoy Japanese food. I don't know if I would have spend $250 on a Kiku meal. But I was quite happy even with the Ume."}
{"text":"Went back again for a anniversary dinner. This time the experience was still very wonderful. The staff and service were fantastic. Our server from our last visit actually remembered us and greeted us. Though comparing to our last visit the selection of fish seemed a little less impressive. But that could be due to starvation on my end. Quick tip always eat at the bar if you want the full experience. But for a more intimate private dinner they have tables available for 2 or 4 and I believe there is a private room as well. I truly feel this is one of my favorite omakase spot and will definitely will be returning :)"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant does not worth the price they are asking. Comparing to Yasu, the taste and chef's skill are not on the same level I think."}
{"text":"Chef Jackie Lin.  Yes, he is the ex-chef at Zen at their old location, and now he has opened his own restaurant - Shoushin.  In midtown Toronto, Shoushin provides a choice between three omakase options. The difference between the three? Omakase A does not come with sashimi as do course B and C. The difference between B and C... Omakase C comes with Wagyu beef, whereas A and B does not.  I chose Omakase B for my first dinner here at Shoushin - the FIRST TIME EVER!  So let's begin! We were seated right in front of Jackie - which I found to be pretty awesome! So first course - appetizers!  My favourite was the lobster and vegetable tempura! And for the first time...I tried corn tempura! Pieces of corn battered and fried! As weird as this may sound to you...it was AMAZING! The next dish was sashimi - chu-toro, maguro, hirame, and exceptionally delicious scallop - with freshly-grated wasabi. And clam miso agedashi soup to finish off the appetizers!  Next came my favourite part of the omakase - sushi which includes but not limited to: toro, sea eel, seabream with plum, sayuri, sea urchin, and a very interesting wheat straw smoked toro. Each piece, reflecting the chef's passion, was made and served - piece at a time. So delicious! The flavour and the uniqueness of each piece - amazing and well worth the price! We ordered extra pieces just because that's what we do - toro, uni, and squid and caviar!  Lastly. Dessert. We ordered one of each. A red bean and black sesame pudding, and a black sesame cream puff. The presentation and flavour were great. It was perfect as it was not too sweet.  I would definitely recommend Shoushin. Chef Jackie Lin is super passionate about the food he creates. It was a unique and amazing experience."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place since it opened last October, but finally had the chance to check it out with a group of awesome sushi lovers! We ordered and the sakura omakase menu and it was a memorable experience. The only downside is that we weren't able to sit at the sushi bar due to our large group, to fully enjoy the whole experience.  We were personally greeted by Head Chef and Owner Chef Jackie Lin, and he shared his concept and design behind Shoushin - an art gallery within a restaurant. Everything from the interior decor to the tableware was all creatively inspired by Chef Jackie Lin's philosophy of elevating one's sushi experience beyond the palate, and reintroducing traditional Tokyo-style sushi, known in Japan as edomae.  This place is definitely worth checking out if you're a die-hard sushi lover, a fan of Chef Jackie Lin, or want to take your special some out on a fancy date night."}
{"text":"Damn... 4/5? tough crowd! This restaurant definitely deserves a 5/5 in my book. My husband and I have been to every Omakase in the city (Kaji, Yasu, Zen, Japango, Jabistro, etc...) and we find Shoushin perfect and by far the best (from their selection of fish to their sushi rice to even the real wasabi root used)! Every time I take a sip of water, someone is refilling it. I brought my entire travel group here and everyone was so impressed! If you enjoy real sushi - go here! :)"}
