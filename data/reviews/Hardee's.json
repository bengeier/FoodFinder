{"text":"My family and I stopped in on Monday 3-14-2016 around 4:00 pm and after we stopped there my bank card was compromised. The person who stole my card number tried to use it at places in Gastonia. Lucky for me my bank realized it was not at places I normally would be at and blocked it. So I will never go there again. Apparently their help is not honest."}
{"text":"The best breakfast sandwiches, just tried the philly cheesesteak with a fresh baked bun.  So delish !  This is my favorite location.  Always very good food."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's a filthy and horribly managed restaurant. When these burger joints get management right, there will be success stories like Chick-fil-A. The owners of these franchise operations think cutting is the way to get more $ in their pockets. Yes! In a small way! But if your business is consumer alluring and not consumer repulsive, that's when the growth potential really talks money"}
{"text":"I love hardees food even tho I know it's terrible for me! But damn are the burgers sooooo good.   I only gave a 1 star cause the drive thru is awful.  Awful awful awful.  Did I mention awful??? So I tried to go in and order and skip the drive thru, still awful.  God forbid you go at lunch or dinner time.  Plan on a long long long wait.  But burgers are excellent!!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS excellent customer service at this location. Every single time my husband and I go the employees are always so friendly - I love it! Also, best fast food burgers out there. I wish there were other locations in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"This place is filthy. Great place for doing heroin in the bathroom. I don't have anything else to say about it. Brevity is the soul of wit, but Yelp says my review is too short."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon. nobody in front of us. we gave our order then just sat and waited.... we asked twice to see if anyone was there only to be asked for our order again....then we had to pull over and wait for our food.........15 mins so far and counting...... wow"}
{"text":"This place has no customer service skills what so ever! Every time I go here, I get attitude. I have no idea why.  They all act like they can't stand their job.  And Nancy the manager is rude too, so why wouldnt the employees have attitude? I never do this,  but I had to call corporate on their attitude. I really give this place zero stars!! And don't get the chicken sandwich,  they all insist they only have one type of chicken,  so you will pay for the big filet, but get the little cheap one."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service,  extremely slow.  Don't waste your money or time here. Go to another location if possible."}
{"text":"I wish that I would have known about this place sooner.  I have only been here twice since I only discovered it last month.  I had the turkey burger with fries and a chocolate malt the first time and I had the Frisco with onion rings and soda the second time.  I love this place!  Everything I ate from here was golden.  I can now say that I'm a Hardee's fan."}
{"text":"The Middleton Hardee's just renovated.  They got rid of the wood paneling and switched to a trendy red/black color scheme.  It is much more pleasing to the eye, but I was still sad when I found out.  Now I go to Perkin's for my old-person decor fix.  Thankfully, the outside of the restaurant still looks like your typical run-down fast food eatery!  Also, the new fresh-fried chicken strips they've introduced are orders of magnitude better than the old ones, which tasted like they had been fried in a factory, frozen, and then microwaved for five seconds before being served.  Nothing in fast food is ever fresh, but these new chicken strips do a passable impersonation of it."}
{"text":"I love the Hand breaded chicken strips!!! Always fresh food, gotta have it"}
{"text":"The best Hardee's hands down that I have ever been to. They are so friendly and their food... Oh their food... It looks like the menu, carefully put together, and super fresh.   Would recommend this to the discerning fast food diner looking for quality with a smile!"}
{"text":"We were the only car who drove through and it took ages to get our food.  Slowest Hardees I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"This is a pretty bad place.  There were flies, HUGE houseflies flying around!  And yikes! The lemon slices were half dried too.  The cashier wasn't really efficient.  She was yelling my order to the cooks in the back, so it was really loud.  I wasn't impressed with the speed of service, and the lady couldn't find our table, despite the number being displayed.  Just have people pick up at the counter please.  The food was pretty salty, and I didn't get any lettuce and tomato on my burger... Just meh overall."}
{"text":"Hardee's is about a mile from highway 72.  Bathrooms are awful, no paper towels in ladies room. One stall was out of toilet paper. Men's room does not even have a paper towel dispenser.  The Oreo ice cream cookies were unavailable because they had not hardened up yet because the freezer door does not close completely!  Staff yells to each other a lot.  Our fries (which were on the receipt) did not arrive with our order, we had to ask for them.  The grilled chicken club was good."}
{"text":"OMG. I purchased the third pound thick Burger...what an amazing sandwich. This is what a hamburger should taste and look like. No more Wendy's, BK or McDonald's for this Burger lover. My next visit will have pictures."}
{"text":"Look at my BURNT sandwich. I wouldn't serve this to my Rottweiler. What's happening in the food industry. Everybody is entitled to be paid there worth, so tell me the reason they have this person on the grill"}
{"text":"Probably the most successful drive through place in belmont. Of all others this one still hasn't made a mistake to our orders yet. Good job."}
{"text":"The service was great. The young lady at the drive-through window was very competent and friendly. However the stores appearance was lightweight disgusting. Had that off odor of not clean. Parking lot have matzoh degree. Also did you hear my order correctly. I ordered a quarter pound they gave me a 1/3 pound. The moonshine burger is excellent."}
{"text":"I normally don't review a fast food joint simply because, well, let's face it, it's a fast food joint. But after driving all the way out here to get a fat juicy burger and some yummy delicious fries and being shorted, I felt I had to say something. 1. Slow service. About ten to twelve minutes for an order for 2. Mind you, nobody else was dining in. I did however hear the employee behind the counter yell out that he had a 6 minute wait time on drive through.   2. A handful of fries. This was the same amount of fries for a small/regular order, and a medium order. Both orders had the same small handful of fries.   3. No help. Seriously? I saw three people working there the entire time. And I use the term \"working\" lightly. One gentleman behind the counter was running around doing what the other two fell short on.   The food itself was well prepared and tasted great. Hence the 2 stars, but the service itself could use some improvement. Possibly one more set of hands or a properly trained and motivated staff would help greatly."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Not sure who making the food but FIRE them ASAP... I order the big hot and ham, I didn't look at the food til I got home and I was PISSED at what I saw. Which prompt me to get in my car at 11:30pm to get my money back. I rejected the offer of a new sandwich just because I wasn't sure what I was going to get the second time. This one bad experiences, made me open my eyes and to never eat there again."}
{"text":"I went for the crisp chicken sandwich on my way home from work and was very disappointed.  When I got home I see this small, dark, overcooked chicken breast on a large bun.  It was not the nice plump and juicy chicken the picture displayed.  Luckily there was a survey attached to  the bottom of my receipt and I let it be known.    I couldn't say how anything else was but the chicken sandwich was less than average."}
{"text":"Huge difference in service today than on thursday noon. Thursday was great -5 stars, but today saturday horrible!! Lady yelling in kitchen, we had to wait a long time for our items to be served (almost 30 min)! On top of that they missed  the cheddar fries which we had to remind to get. The guy told us he would get them that they were being done. 10 min later my wife stood up and went to the front to get which they did right on the spot. Horrible on saturdays!"}
{"text":"Food is good, speed is good when there are few people in the restaurant and drive-thru, staff is moderately friendly. Most of the tables looked clean."}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service!!!! I visited on 6/5/14,I will never visit this place again. The drive-thur cashier was rude and when I reported her to the manager/owner he was just as rude. I got a refund and left."}
{"text":"What happened to fast food.  15 minutes in line this AM to get a biscuit.  Ridiculous!  Lesson learned.  Not even fresh after waiting!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Multiple times I've walked in to order food, and there was no one around.    When I do get a chance to order food, it takes no less than 30 minutes from time of order to the time I walk out of the door.  And I thought the Taco Bell was slow."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service. The cashier was taking my order, when her fat bitch white trash manager keep sticking her nose in interrupting her.   Then all the sodas were empty just coming out like water and the big sweet tea was empty, only the unsweetened tea had anything in it. The dining room was a disaster so filthy, the whole time I was there, all I heard was the white trash manager complaining and being rude to the customers. They need to fire the shift leader or whatever she is Asap!!"}
{"text":"For a fast food it is great. The staff was friendly and so nice.  The place is always  very clean."}
{"text":"This is a Millvale treasure.  Delicious food, great value.  I bought the $5 box with a double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries, Coke, and a cookie.  It came hot and the fries were placed in the box, without a bag!  Great touch!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast twice, about 3 months apart. Today was one of those times. Drive through was busy and VERY slow. Would have been quicker to go inside, maybe. Got home and I had a burnt, rubbery tasting chicken biscuit with only half of a biscuit!!!! Hash rounds were more grease than potato. This location is terribly gross. Twice was enough for me to never go back. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Staff is pretty good.  On occasion they tend to not fully cook the biscuits which makes for a ruined breakfast sandwich.  However, its Hardee's and its wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Delicious . .. affordable charbroiled burgers! It's been such a long time since I went to Hardee's it was such a treat. They offer regular fries and curly fries too!   They offer a slider box deal for seven bucks which includes a cookie!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten at Hardee's.  I've been to Hardee's twice. Once was waaay back in 2008 or so, when I went in and ordered some chicken tenders. They told me they were out of chicken tenders (?) so I'd have to order something else. Pass. I've been avoiding it ever since.  Yesterday, boyfriend and friends wanted Hardee's. I figured it was time to let bygones be bygones, so I went to Hardee's and ordered the three-chicken-tender combo basket with curly fries and a drink. The girl behind the counter was efficient but rushed, which is kind of what I expect from fast food employees, so I'm not really fazed by that. My friends were already seated and served, so I filled my beverage and sat with them. I made sure my number was prominently displayed near the edge of the table, as directed.  Boyfriend finishes eating basically as soon as I sit down. This is normal.  Friend A finishes his burger about five minutes later. Still no sign of my food.  Friend B finishes her meal. By now it's been ten minutes. Hmm.  I notice that people who were three spots behind me in line have been served and have FINISHED at this point.  I check my receipt. It's been fifteen minutes. My friends need to get back to work. I flag down the next passing employee, who happens to be the manager. I ask him what had happened to my food. Manager disappears, comes back three or so minutes later. Apparently the person who put my tenders in to cook forgot to set a timer (??) and they burned, so rest assured, they were going to make me new ones and they should be ready in another five minutes or so.  No.  I tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund. He was sincere and apologetic, which I appreciate, but at this point I had been in the restaurant for over a half an hour with no food. I'm patient for the most part, but there was no offer to comp the meal, just.. \"Hey, keep waiting and we might feed you in another few minutes. Maybe!\" I understand that they may have been understaffed and that it was the lunch rush, but how no one noticed that one order wasn't filled for 15 + minutes just boggles my mind. I took the money from my refund and went next door to Taco Bell, where I was served terrible but tasty food very promptly and with much kindness. I really love the Taco Bell on Neil. It's clean, friendly, and the girl who works the register during lunch is awesome. I even make substitutions and deletions to my order, and they have NEVER gotten it wrong. So, the moral of this story, in short - save your time and money by skipping Hardee's and go next door to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"There is no way to give a negative star, worst fast food experience I have ever had. They bring disfuction to a whole new level, waited for 45 minute for my food and they were only 3 people in there and know one in the Drive thru. I watched a hand full of people come, not get waited on and turn around and walk out. They just completely ignored them. Dirty beyond belief, if the Board of health walked in they would close them down.  Quite frankly they should be shut down"}
{"text":"Nelson, was that the Hardee's on Bradley?  We had some bad cleanliness issues there years ago. I cruised by there because it was close & it looked closed so I went to the Neil St location (I had a coupon for the \"moonshine\" bbq). That also had only one car...this is a litltle after 4 pm. But I went in. The shop was clean & the staff were polite but not overly so. I've been meaning to try the burgers they feature on their ads & thought it was tasty. The sauce was sticky but that's why God created napkins.  I like that they fries were cut unpeeled. So-so but ok. Good fast food at a good price."}
{"text":"I just went through the drive through and ordered a hot ham and cheese and a side salad.  I asked for ranch dressing.  The drive through wait was longer than I had expected but not the worst.  I get to the window and I pay for my order and I hear the lady at the window specifically ask the person who handed her the bag if there was ranch dressing in it and a fork and the person told her yes.  She said she was just checking to be sure they were there.  I get back to the office and yes there is a plastic fork but no, there is NOT any dressing.  Clearly the person lied about putting it in the bag.  Sadly, that makes my review even worse because now I am eating a salad with no dressing and quite frankly I don't think it's very good this way!!  Aside from not having any dressing the salad itself is warm.  I prefer a crisp cold salad like most people.  However, the ring of onion on it is very hot.  Whew!!  The hot ham and cheese is the same old hot ham and cheese they have been serving for years and I still like it."}
{"text":"This place is really a good place to eat.  The  place is empty but the food is good and reasonable priced.   Pilar was simply awesome today in providing service.  She was very cheerful and easy to talk with and she treated us well."}
{"text":"These guys could go to four stars very easily. They just have to show the GAF a little. That's all. Here's the deal with this one; they have no customers. Ever. I've been here three or four times and have never seen another customer at the same time I was there. That doesn't say much for them subconsciously of course but I know the food (for fast food burgers and fries) is the best like it's sister company Carls Jr....loved me some Carl's Jr when I was stationed in San Diego years ago.   Pros:  -the place is clean (it's empty) -there are no lines (it's empty) -their menu is great (I love CJ already)  Cons:  -disinterested staff (it's empty) -orders are wrong all the time.  -slow service (they may be turning on the stovetops and fryers as someone approaches) -food quality varies (again may have to do with little practice)  I'll try them again (and probably again) but they have to tighten it up or move closer to where they can get business...or advertise more...."}
{"text":"Their chicken tenders are off the hook .  I only drive through and I've found the service to be consistently good."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Their spicy chicken sandwiches are GREAT. Do not eat their bleu cheese burgers though. They're ridiculously bad. The only problem with ALL the food is that it's a little greasy."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago Hardees gave me the worst experience I've ever had from ANYWHERE, and I will never go back!!! It was about 40 mins until closing time. I went through the drive through & the first thing the cashier said was \"What chu want.\" In my order, I asked for onion rings instead of fries. He said \"We out those.\" K, Whatever. Pull up to the window & asked him if they were really out, or if it's because it will take a long time to turn the fryer back on. The young black man said \"What the fuck you think\" and walked off. Wow!! I couldn't believe what I heard. 20 MINUTES LATER, srill no food. They didnt even bring our drinks out, not even when I asked them to!! If I could have drove off I would have, but I already paid. I tried to get their attention at the window multiple times but they ignored us the whole time so I had no choice but to wait. So I grabbed the bag and went home, pretty mad. Opened my food and it was ALL wrong. It's not at ALL what I ordered. This was no mistake! There was NO ONE inside the resturant and NO ONE in the drive through. How did this happen? I called up there PISSED and they kept picking it up and HANGING up the phone!!! But that didn't stop me, I KEPT calling until someone answered. I called 37 TIMES Y'ALL. I have screenshots too, lol. Eventually a woman answered and I asked to speak to a manager, but she was the one who picked it up. I told her exactly what happened and she DENYED EVERYTHING and said I was lying!!!! All of it! The man cussing, the running out of onion rings, the 20 min wait, me asking him to give me my drinks, the ignoring me at the window, about the calls, and EVEN THE FOOD! I told her \"I still have the food right in front of me right now. I will take pictures or I can bring it back. Either way, you're refunding my money or fixing it. We will see who is lying here.\" She started CUSSING ME OUT!!! She said \"Listen b****h, there was no reason for you to be rude and disrespectful when no one here did anything wrong. You don't know who you're f*****g with\" Omg I started flipping. I can't recite the whole conversation here, but it WASN'T PROFESSIONAL at ALL. She started crying on the phone with me and broke down, talking about how everyone of her employees just quit on her all at once, and that it was very stressful and blah blah. I interrupted and asked if I can get my food fixed before they closed. She quickly stopped crying (meaning it was a fake cry) & said No, to come back tomorrow and speak to the person who owns the place. (Andy) So I hung up, even more mad because now its late, everything is closed, and I dont have any food to eat. So I called back the next day and it was same manager. She said \"Oh, Andy was only here for an hour today. Call back tomorrow.\" This went on for DAYS until one day I finally reached the owner. She was also rude and didn't want to hear anything about my experiance!!! She said she needed my receipt in order to get my food. But they never gave me one, they NEVER give out receipts, ever. I wonder why!! I told her I have pictures and recordings of my conversations with the manager, after that she was being VERY nice then. Got my food and some EXTREAMLY dirty looks that day. Never again!!!! The people who work there are TRASH and because of that I will never go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food (their burgers are seriously the best fast-food burgers)! The service here is fine, the prices are a bit high, and this location is nice and quiet. All-in-all, an okay place, especially considering it's fast food."}
{"text":"Always perfectly cooked food and always a friendly face at the order counter. I recommend the frisco burger or frisco breakfast sandwich. Delish!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for Hardee's ?!?  It's no Culver's by a long shot but that Thick Burger was damn tasty !   I don't know if the restaurant was clean but the drive thru service was good."}
{"text":"Hardee's has great food!   They offer great breakfast food like the Loaded Omelet Biscuit, a omelet with crumbled sausage, bacon, ham and cheddar cheese stacked on a buttermilk biscuit. Texas Toast Breakfast sandwiches, your choice of sausage, bacon or ham stacked with egg & cheese on Texas toast. A cinnamon raisin biscuit, a baked cinnamon raisin biscuit topped with icing. They also offer breakfast bowls, biscuit sandwiches, croissant sandwiches with your choice of bacon, ham or sausage and much more.   They also have great burgers! You can get them in 1/3 lb, 1/4 lb a 2/3 lb versions like the Grilled Cheese Bacon Thickburger, a charbroiled burger covered with bacon, melted Swiss and American cheese, and mayo on grilled sourdough bread.   Your other 1/3 lb burger choices are the Cheeseburger Thickburger, the Original Thickburger, the Mushroom 'N' Swiss Thickburger, the Bacon Cheese Thickburger and the Low Carb Thickburger.   1/4 lb burger choices are the Grilled Cheese Bacon Thickburger and the Little Thickburger. They also offer a 2/3 lb. Monster Thickburger as well!   They also offer fried chicken, chicken tenders, chicken and fish sandwiches and kid's meals.   Be sure to save room for dessert! They offer ice cream malts and shakes in berry, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry!"}
{"text":"You know this location must be good because there is almost always a line around breakfast time. The line moves pretty quickly most of the time! I love their Bacon and Egg Platter which comes with eggs, two pieces of bacon, hash browns, a biscuit, and (yummy) gravy! Their biscuit n' gravy is one of my faves for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The food at this Hardee's is not bad, but I always go through their drive-thru and their service is horrible!   I have ordered different things and they're usually decent with the time it takes, but literally every single time I have gone through their drive through they have handed me my drink dripping wet with overflowed soda, and always without a straw....and they just hand it to me and shut the window. Such a simple thing they make a pain.  Today, I felt compelled to write this review because i ordered from their taco/burrito menu and it took about 15 minutes to get my food in the drive-thru. Plus, they committed the drink offense.....again!  They took 10 minutes to hand me a sloppy wet drink cup with overflowed coke spilled all over it, with no straw and then I sat there for 5 more minutes before I got my food.  The sad thing is, the people are always nice and the food is decent. If it weren't for that I would never go back. I am sure it's a problem with management just not instilling things in the employees and it is sad because I like the food and the chain.  If they can fix the service at this location it would probably do a lot more business.  Please fix your service. Your food is different enough from McDonald's and BK to keep me wanting the food, but the service makes me go MUCH less often than I would if it was better."}
{"text":"This is the slowest restaurant ever! Words cannot express how slow they are and to be called a fast food restaurant is a total disgrace to all fast food restaurants in America. The food is hot however when you get it but it takes almost an hour to get it. If you can avoid this restaurant please avoid this restaurant. Unless you are not in a rush and all you have is time on your hands. Please don't go there thinking you're going to get a quick meal during your lunch break, it would never happen!"}
{"text":"Twice on weekend did not open on time.had to go to waffle house. Unreliable no more will drive to go to jack in the box tried again much better must have changed management"}
{"text":"Came here, utilized the drive thru.. food came out fast and order was correct. The food was.. well, fast food. No complaints but also nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I ordered bacon eggs and cheese combo and received a sausage biscuit instead. I'm trying to call but the phone number isn't going through. I'm at work now so I can't go return it. Update your contact number."}
{"text":"This was the worst Hardee's I've ever been to. Both my father and I went and we hated it. I will never go here again and I suggest you do not either.  The food was soggy and disgusting. My father and I got two different $5 All-star Boxes and they were both terrible. I understand that advertising isn't accurate at all, but the burgers were small and soggy. The buns were droopy. The fries were both burn and undercooked at the same time. The only good thing was the onion rings, who were only average with more batter than onion.  The employees were horrible. The woman who took our order didn't even seem to be listening to us. At one point, I walked up to ask for dipping sauce and the employee acted like she couldn't believe I was bothering her. After all of that, we had to go and get our own meals from the counter, despite the promise of delivery to our table.  I have no idea what the Red Burrito food would be like, but based on the Hardee's food, it would give you food-poisoning worst than any stereotypical dirty Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Always excellent customer service from Mo and his crew.  He is incredibly polite and a wonderful manager to deal with if anything ever goes wrong at their site."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Hardee's on Vine St. The place is always cleen. The service is quick and on point. I really love the thick burger and the Frisco Burger in particular."}
{"text":"The first thing I will say about this place: Excellent and polite service. The second thing is that the food is always hot and tasty. However, I look at this place as more of a fast food restaurant. Instead of fast food prices, they tend to charge a good bit more than the average fast food. Don't get me wrong, it's totally worth every penny, but that would be literally my only complaint. Everything else is spot on."}
{"text":"Why does Hardee's get such a bad rap?  The Hardee's/Carl's Jr. Thickburger El Diablo features Jalapeno Poppers, sliced jalapenos, habanero sauce, bacon and pepper jack cheese with a  1/2 or  lb. patty served on a fresh baked bun.  I got the  lb version at my local Hardee's for $5.99.   The Thickburger El Diablo had a lot going on. It definitely brought the heat. The habanero sauce didn't seem particularly spicy when I tasted it independently but as I ate, I noticed it building up. The Jalapeno Poppers and sliced jalapenos lent another level of heat to the burger as well as providing some nice texture. The Poppers added a bit of crunch but, as Q pointed out in his review of them, weren't satisfyingly gooey. It would have made for a messier sandwich but I think it would have been a good trade off. The sliced jalapeños were moist, plentiful, and flavorful. No complaints.  Of the four spicy ingredients the sandwich boasts, the pepper jack cheese was the least prominent. The cheesiness on the burger came more from the Jalapeño Poppers, while the slice of pepper jack took a backseat. The bacon also didn't stand out consistently. It seemed like an afterthought on my burger and wasn't even present on a large portion of it. The large beef patty proved to be the dominant meat and luckily Hardee's burgers feature good seasoning and grilled taste.  Overall, Hardee's Thickburger El Diablo delivered what it promised but didn't quite live up to my expectations. I was looking forward to this sandwich, but nothing about it makes me want to go back and get another one."}
{"text":"Breakfast is about the only food that my wife and I get here. I like the bacon/egg/cheese biscuits and my wife likes the cinnamon raisin biscuits. When you order the cinnamon raisin biscuits, be prepared to wait. The last time I ordered them, they told me to pull around to the front of the store and they'd bring them out when they were ready. It's not a huge deal as I don't mind waiting for fresh food.   I waited about 10 minutes and no one came out. I parked the car and went inside to check on the status of the cinnamon raisin biscuits. Apparently they had forgotten about me. Not sure how that happens as they didn't seem incredibly busy at this time. They did apologize and then handed over the biscuits.  Other fast food places have systems in place for when you have to wait. Culvers gives you a little number that you put on your window and they bring the food out to you. McDonald's even has special parking spots for folks to park while waiting for their food. Hardee's needs to institute something like this to improve their efficiency and keep customers happy."}
{"text":"Had to come back and give another star because this time service was much faster. Maybe because there were no school aged employees this time, not sure. Food is still awesome for fast food. Will be back."}
{"text":"Im surprised to see the negative reviews. Just had a great experience but maybe that's because it's not during rush time and we ate in. The food was just as ordered and delivered quickly. The restaurant was as close to spotless as you'll find in fast food."}
{"text":"Yeah so... not sure why I stopped here. Road grub, get what you can get. Unfortunately, I chose Hardee's.   So we'll start with the good. The lady working the mic was great and honestly seems to be the only person there that cares. She corrected the order and did other people's job on top of her own. If it wasn't for her, I'm not sure I would have gotten anything.   So when I pulled up to the window I felt I was conducting a drug transaction. Dude was on the phone, looked around grabbed the money and disappeared. Thankfully a minute later he returned with my card and receipt. This is where his job stopped.   I honestly gave it two stars because all the prior reviews were only one. I also have two stars because the food was actually fresh. Believe it or not. However, I still regret going, I want be going back again.   There are plenty of other quick rip places around. Do yourself a favor and go there."}
{"text":"Slowest fast food place I ever been too. Drive thru takes forever, and then you get to the front and they ask you to park and wait."}
{"text":"Hardee's! Right over here in Lake County! The service was great and the place was spotless. Of course the food is the best of all the fast food places around. While we went for dinner this time, the breakfast stuff here is awesome."}
{"text":"SO... Apparently asking them to customize breakfast is too much for the girl at the drive thru to handle! At 9:30 am I ordered the special 2 bacon/egg/ cheese biscuits and a hash brown. Pretty simple, but I ask for no cheese on the sandwich and for fresh hash browns. This is where the problem/ attitude starts. She says then why did you order BEC if you don't want cheese? Because it's on sale Ms. Smarty pants! Then she proceeds to tell me throw hash browns are on a timer and that they are fresh. So you're telling me you can't cook some right now? No, they fresh. LOL yeah right. I have never had so many problems before I decided I couldn't do it and pulled out of line and went to Burger King!!!!  I really wish Yelp would let you give places ZERO STARS because Hardee's on Neil would be at the top... well bottom of the list."}
{"text":"Wow!! This is the friendliest Hardee's or fast food for that fact I have EVER been to. The guy working the counter has been there 20 years (I over heard him talking to another table). He talked to us when we were ordering as well as when we were leaving. I loved all the locals sitting around chatting on what they were going to be doing. (We were the youngest in there by at least 30 years) If I need to stop again while on the road, I will go out of my way to stop here!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for your food ... Seriously 20 minutes?!!  Staff were friendly and apologized but the wait was inexcusable.  On a more positive note the Texas BBQ half pound thickburger was delicious."}
{"text":"Out of sugar and drink counter was nasty and unclean. Get past that and you get a good meal with hot fresh coffee."}
{"text":"This is the slowest restaurant you'll find in Harrisburg. Not only is the service slow, food is not prepared as you paid for it.   Update. I don't know why I keep coming here except it is close to my home. They never get the order correct. Take out is a mistake because you get home and it's the wrong order. This is pitiful service coming from a national food restaurant.  One of these days I will learn my lesson and quit frequenting this restaurant"}
{"text":"Omg. Is this really a drive through?  More like a stop and wait and wait and wait. 11 min wait to be precise!  All that wait and the food sucks and was cold.  What exactly did I wait for?  Certainly not for you to cook hot food. Never again."}
{"text":"A Millvale treasure. I'm always curious as to how / why this delicious fast food eatery exist in our little town. I mean. There's literally no other Hardee's in the greater Pittsburgh area. Like. Why is it there? Is it part of some greater conspiracy? Who knows.   Breakfast sandwiches are litttttttt"}
{"text":"When you're talking fast food burgers, Hardee's probably has the best.  This location also offers some daily specials that make it an even better deal (sometimes it can feel a bit pricey).  Breakfast here is also a win when compared to other fast food options.    The place itself does have a bit of a dirty feel to it, though and the employees are mostly younger teens who are just there doing as little as possible.  The fries are nothing special.  My suggestion?  Get a Thickburger to go."}
{"text":"treated like crap here. called corporate and never heard back.  never again will I eat at Hardee's"}
{"text":"Driving down from Chicago, this was the first stop in my pursuit of the Cinnamon n' Raisin biscuit. I kinda thank the good Lord that there are no Hardee's around me anymore because I would definitely weight at least twice my size. The key is to go for breakfast. Nothing can beat the Loaded Biscuits with Gravy and tater tots and then throw in the Cinnamon Biscuit for good measure.  Despite the signs, this location is not off the highway. You're driving at least a couple miles into town. And the service is friendly but not exactly fast here either. But definitely a good place to stop and grab a somewhat quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Filthy bathrooms, dirty floors. The staff did not bring us our full order, then complained when we asked that they go back and get the rest of the food we payed for."}
{"text":"Don't understand why anyone would eat here. The food was dry and cold. There are so many places to get a good burger why settle for this."}
{"text":"Had the big roast beef. It was surprisingly really good. Great bun! One of the best fast food meals I've had. The staff was very nice and energetic."}
{"text":"Okay, my review sums it all up in a text that I sent to my boyfriend several hours after eating a Frisco Burger w/o tomato, small order of curly fries and a small diet coke. Text message: \"Don't tell anyone but I ate at Hardee's today and it was like real restaurant quality. Well just the food part. I didn't eat it all b/c 1) I couldn't and 2) I wanted some for later.\"  I was driving while eating it and I kept saying out loud how good the burger was. Mind you, I was totally alone. And I didn't go in the restaurant but it looked clean from the drive-thru window and that woman who took my order did a better than average job. I was kind of put off by their prices but it was totally worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The staff at the Monticello Hardee's is pleasant, and the food is typical for the chain. But why, oh why does this location seem to be the absolute slowest Hardee's on the planet?"}
{"text":"This Hardee's recently remodeled. Inside seems more modern and feels more clean now. I've always received fresh food here, they've apologized when it's taken too long. I love Hardee's burgers, they beat McDonalds, Burger King, and Culver's. Yes I said Culvers. I love there Frisco burgers yum.... I don't know of any other Hardee's in Dane county except for this one."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! I check in like I normally do on the Hardee's app to get my points and now was at 1100 however the girl at the register was so rude and refuse to take it saying she need the paper coupon, ah hello it's a Hardee's app and it says give to agent at register to use the code and she said I don't know how to do that and \"my drawer ain't gonna be short!\" Insert rude attitude! The worst I never had a problem with this in the past. Also when I asked the coke zero was out she said we ain't got any. If they had run out wouldn't just put a sign up? Nope just to lazy to change it. As well no napkins in dining room at all!"}
{"text":"I used to work here way back in the day they have some good food just the biscuits are very thick with dough laugh out loud. They got good food but with constipation afterwards"}
{"text":"Ate at Hardee's for the first time since the mid-1980's.  It doesn't exist in the Northeast and in SoCal it's called Carl's Jr.  I went because I had a coupon for 'buy 1 get 1 free' \"double wide\" tacos.  The food was pretty decent and the people working there were relatively normal.  It was a little bit colder than we would've liked since the A/C was blowing despite the cold spell we were having for the past few days.  Overall not bad.  I got another coupon in the mail today so we'll see how the next visit goes."}
{"text":"Amazing service and super friendly people.  The breakfast was good, just like it is at any other Hardee's.  The people working, especially one older gentleman, was overly nice.  He even came through and checked on everybody to see how their meal was.  What other fast food joint do you get that at?"}
{"text":"Bathrooms were very nasty and needed cleaned.  There wasn't very many customers in the cafe!  The employees were very nice and told us to have a great day as we walked out because the restrooms were to nasty for us to eat."}
{"text":"This place lost 3 stars as soon as I ketchup, Heinz. Or so they advertise. This was almost water. So if it is the best they sure water it down a lot. It should be shut down for just this reason. It list another star having to hear the manager yelling non-stop in the back. While walking around chopping on a burger. She also would rather finish her conversation then wait on the people trying to order. They kept a star because my order came fast, the burger was warm and dry. But I got a whole order of onion rings in my combo and they we're hot and fresh. Just to bad I had nothing to dip them in. Next time I won't something to eat in the area it will be Waffle House next door for sure."}
{"text":"I haven't been inside having always used the drive-thru. There isn't a smooth entrance from the road and you could probably mess up your suspension if you hit it hard. It's a sharp turn up to the drive-thru speaker, so I'm always a little further from the speaker than I'd like.  Having gone through these trifles, but keen observations, the service is good and the burgers are great. Well worth the trouble of navigating this weird, old lot."}
{"text":"This hardees is good because nobody is ever there. They always give you a bunch of sauce and the little things. Some places like to give you one packet at a time. This place will hand you a bag full of honey mustard, ranch and other stuff. The chicken tenders and the thick burgers are really really good. I like this place a lot. It's far from professional customer service and stuff but it's not rude. You won't get a \"how are you\" you'll get a \"You can order now\" I suggest the drive through because it's quick and nobody is ever in line. It's better than some of the alternatives in this area. Especially fast food. It's far from perfect but just don't go in with high expectations. You'll be fine. I know when your looking at a fast food place on Yelp you mostly want to know if it is clean or not. I haven't been inside, but there are bathrooms in the area it's right next to a shopping center."}
{"text":"Very slow service. I waited 12 minutes in the drive thru and this tends to be the norm for this place. Staff is friendly and they do apologize for the wait. Nonetheless it gets old waiting for so long for fast food. Quality of food is standard although some food is only lukewarm when you get it."}
{"text":"I could vomit on a stale bun and have better taste than the garbage here."}
{"text":"went into this unit today at app 8:40 , one couple was standing still waiting for their food, after I ordered I waited and waited, I finally told them to just keep it, I had to go. At that time I was told it was ready, I got it, and it was not what i had ordered, I gave it back and just left, Not worth me waiting to get my money back. They need to make sure the guest inside are taken care of as good as they do the drive thru"}
{"text":"Horrible wait in the drive-thru for food, discourteous staff. Have never had a positive experience at this Hardee's so I can't even rate the food."}
{"text":"Same delicious burgers; the Monticello harders employees are SUPER nice and bring food out to your table.  It's our #1 fast food pick in Monticello."}
{"text":"love the burgers but they do not love me  , tummy ache every time!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to another Hardee's.  I have tried the crispy chicken sandwich twice and it looks like something that was way you over cooked and is as flat as a pancake. Way over fried and to be honest I had to even question how long it had been sitting there. Had the manager make another one it came out the same way. Definitely nothing like the picture. My six-year-old would not even eat it. Tried again tonight thought maybe I'd get the charbroiled chicken sandwich. Dear God don't. I don't know why it was red but I can tell you it was horrible. There is a Hardee's two exits up going northbound go there. I have eaten there plenty of times at lunch and it's hot and they are good."}
{"text":"An original left in a town of razed buildings. Hardee's biscuits remain unsurpassed.  Early morning is the regular retirees there for hot coffee, breakfast fair and story swapped.  True pulse of a slower almost forgotten time. Now I want a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit."}
{"text":"This location offers good food and seems rather clean compared to other locations I have been to.  You can't go wrong with a Frisco Breakfast Sandwich for a quick cheap breakfast while on the run.  I reccommend this location if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Feels darn good to find a Hardee's near me! They are the #1 fast food joint, ya dig?! If yinzers got COUNTRY HAM on that breakfast menu I would be there daily. It must be a southern thang, but it needs to catch on 'cross 'Merica already.   During my few (soon to be many) trips here,  I have been greeted by a friendly face and pleasant service. Heck, if they had a bar I would try to live here."}
{"text":"My first visit to Hardee's I had a burger and fries....bleh, to say the least. I was a little hesitant to return and actually if my husband didn't haven't a hankering for it....I wouldn't have been there. But it's his road food of choice. However this visit made me a fan. I ordered the chicken tenders and onion rings. Both of my items were fresh and hot. The chicken tenders were delicious!!! We stopped there on the way to our destination. The chicken tenders were SO delicious I wanted some on our return. Hardee's redeemed themselves with those chicken tenders in my book."}
{"text":"Hardee's in Madison is kind of a tradition for my family whenever we drive through town.  We do not have a Hardee's where we live so it is kind of a treat for us.  Simply put, the food is better than Mc Donalds and the deals are comparable.  The service is not quite as quick but your food is fresher when you get it."}
{"text":"Place order at drive thru. Repeated it twice, order was read back and on the display screen. Get back to work and what do you know. The two things I asked for not to be on my Burger, yup you guessed it. For the amount of time I waited in line, the three times the order was repeated, and confirmed, this is unexceptable. Will not be returning for lunch."}
{"text":"My first time at a Hardee's and I have mixed feelings. I think I had the original thick burger. It was tasty! Perfect ratios of toppings and the patty was great. I got regular fries but I wish I had gotten the curly fries. Two complaints: 1. Hard to eat the burger, it was kind of falling apart because of how they set it down in the box after they assembled it and 2. that my burger was kind of sweet, which I was not crazy about. I'm not sure if it was the pickles, or one of the sauces on it, or what, but it really brought the experience down a few notches. I would probably return to try the chicken or maybe another burger that I will hopefully like better. Until then, my review stays at 3 stars."}
{"text":"You mean: HELLUVA Burger?  Hardees has the BEST burger of all the fast food chains, and arguably one of the best in the entire burger industry.    Little Thickburger is the best your money can buy.  The MEAT: Black Angus.  The PREP: Freshly Charbroiled to order The LBS: Heavy enough to put a triple quarter pounder at McD's to shame. The FIXINS: Cheese, Lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup and a pickle on a toasted sesame seed bun. The SERVICE: Impeccable:  What other fast food chain actually walks over to your table to ask, 'How's everything here?\" The TASTE: Sublime The QUALITY: Consistently consistent.  If you haven't tried Hardees, for fear of the unknown, for fear of not liking it as much as the BIG and ULTRA FAMOUS chains, you don't know what you're missing.    But then again, that leaves more HARDEES for me!"}
{"text":"Above average fast food burger, 4 for 4 deal can't be beat. The inside was clean and workers were nice. I'll be returning"}
{"text":"Only because 0 isn't an option. Rudest, most incompetent employees anywhere! AND slowest ever! Hardee's is the worst. How do they stay in business?!"}
{"text":"I ordered an Egg and Cheese Biscuit combo. I don't eat pork. My order was correct on the screen and the drive through person confirmed it at the pick up window.  I didn't check my order until I arrived at work. They gave me a bacon and cheese biscuit with no egg! After peeling off the pork bacon I was left with a biscuit and cheese. I tried calling the phone number listed but it is no longer in service."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday with my son and parents. The staff were very nice and friendly, the food was fast and very good and the restaurant clean. I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today. Two things. I waited 20 minutes to get my food from the time I pulled up to the time I left the restaurant in the Drive-Thru. The cashier was rude. The restaurant has two combos both marked as number 2. One is a chicken strip combo and one is a burger combo. The confusion of the two meals let the cashier to being rude having snarky reply and I got very frustrated. Food is good restaurant is closed otherwise I would never go back."}
{"text":"I am so glad they have the fish sandwich and fish tacos back. The fish tacos are delicious.  You can get two fish tacos for 3.33. What I like about its fish tacos and fish sandwich, they are not fried. They are charboiled. Usually when I go the service is good. The staffs I encounter are friendly. If you are in the hurry to get back to work during lunch time, I wouldn't recommend it. The service can be slowed during lunch time. If you like fish please try the fish sandwich and tacos."}
{"text":"The customer service here sucks,along with the food. I ordered 2 fish sandwiches the only thing good on it was the lettuce, The fish was grease, hard on one side ,soft on the other side.This was about 3:30pm.the cashier who took my order was about as friends as a feral cat. When my food was ready another cashier put the bag on the counter and said 2 fish sandwiches? Yes. Here you go . No come back enjoy your food nothing. Wow"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and when I talked to the manager she apologized but you can tell she didn't care."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after a family gathering earlier in the day.  It was approximately 5:30 on a Sunday afternoon.  We were the only people in the place.  I haven't eaten at a Hardee's in years as they are not anywhere near our home.  I ordered the chicken sandwich and my hubby had the chicken tenders.  Food was absolutely delicious.  Hot and fresh.  Our server brought the food to our table, and then checked back to make sure we had everything we needed.  Restaurant was spotless (a pet peeve of mine), and the staff were cleaning the back area as we ate.  We will stop here again."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. Been sitting in the drive through for 30 minutes. Should have gone to Las Pupusas Deli."}
{"text":"This was one of the better fast food meals I've had. My husband and I both had the $4 meal: a double cheeseburger, spicy chicken sandwich, fries, and drink for 4 bucks. The man working the counter was about 1000 times more friendly and competent than at most fast food joints. They have a ton of fountain drink choices. Also, they bring the food to your table for dining in which is nice, so you're not awkwardly lingering by the counter. All of the food was hot, fresh, and tasty. Plus, a very clean restroom. Wish there were more Hardee's around Pittsburgh, and I'll definitely return to this one!"}
{"text":"Love Hardee's! Not sure if I like lunch or breakfast better  always awesome food. Service isn't bad either"}
{"text":"With having a very long day already and a very long day ahead of us because we are driving to Georgia for vacation. My family and I decided to stop by Hardees here in Madison east for dinner. We do have a camper attached to our truck. We parked alongside the edge close to the exit  (there are 2 or 3 more entrances and exits to this parking lot) and when we enter we were greeted by horrible customer service.. If we were just asked to move it would of been one thing. However when we entered we were yelled at by 2 different people to move. They wouldn't even let into the door without yelling at us because we are to close to the entrance. it's a huge lot with 2 or 3 other entrances. we simply wanted to grab food to go but was turned down. again, they wouldn't even let us in the door. with this type of customer service I will never be returning even though I live down the street. The customer service here on how to treat a guest was horrible. The thing though is I am a manager of a different store. I deal with how customer service works all the time. this wasn't it."}
{"text":"People there seems to hate life. Guess its my fault for trying to order food.... Do not try to order food here, they get mad at you and yell they feel like screaming."}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid.  You can't blame the staff - it looked like there were only three people working in the entire place, but that's not my fault - is it?  The restaurant looked, and felt, dirty and unkempt.  As an example, on the six tables near me - five of the napkin dispensers were empty.   The drink-top dispenser was empty.  Food particles lay all over the floor, and many of the tables had not been cleaned.  I ordered a chicken bowl, which was comprised mostly of cheese and rice.  You could have counted the chicken bits on one hand.  When someone brought my order to me (keeping in mind it's in a bowl) there was no utensils to eat it with.  IF there was I place for me to pick these items up myself, I'd understand that... but no.  They came from behind the service counter, so the girl just dropped the ball there.  The guy dining with me was never served his lunch, he had to go hunting after it.    There were nine people in line when I came in, and ten in line when I left. Service was slow and the cashier that I had to deal with seemed annoyed by my being there.  Yeah, it's fast food, and you have to make some allowances there.  But in this case it wasn't fast, and it was just barely food."}
{"text":"Hardee's just can't compete with the better tasting fast food places like Jimmy Johns, Chipotle, etc, let alone McDonalds which has at least invested money in their restaurants to keep them modern looking. Everything at this Hardee's looks like it would have back in the 90's. Same menu too."}
{"text":"Friendliest employees ever, and those hamburgers are fantastic!  Food quality is what I'd expect at a good sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to wait 30 mins for your food, this is the place to be at. Food is decent compared to other hardees. Love waiting so long for fast food. Also, there were only 2 cars ahead of me. Keep up the good work. Lol"}
{"text":"they dissaper fast since carl jr. took over"}
{"text":"I came here three times, but the third time I left without ordering. They have super slow service. Even if you are the only car in the drive thru, you are still going to be waiting 30 minutes for a burger. They are just as slow when you order inside. The manager is rude- overheard him screaming at employees when I went in the restaurant to order. The language I overheard was inappropriate and abusive, so I walked out. I don't want to give my business  to a place where the employees are treated like that. The floor was dirty, too. Not sure how they stay open since they have horrible service, dirty restaurant, and a crazy manager. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Don't go there after 8 pm unless you don't mind microwaved food that is still cold in center and tough and chewy. They don't bother to make tea when they are out so plan on drinking water if you are avoiding sodas. They have comment cards but I couldn't find the comment box. Go figure"}
{"text":"I wish there was actually a Hardee's in the Chicago city limits, but I survive because of the many other Chicago eateries.   Hardee's is one of the places I go to when I head down south from Chicago. The meals are big, but I always like having some leftover for another meal. This Hardee's always has nice staff well whenever I have been there."}
{"text":"The food is always good and the employees are friendly, courteous and helpful. Nice way to start the mornings."}
{"text":"Really great value! Best fast food burgers in town, better than culvers. Went on a Thursday and thick burger combo was $6 bucks with tax! Burger was big tasty and messy. Fries we're hot and seasoned nicely.  If your thinking red robin burger without the sit down price tag, come here and you'll be pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff but recommend going elsewhere. Hidden charges with buying combo meals. They are only place that charge you extra if you opt out of coffee to get a small soda.  Should of went to McDonald's"}
{"text":"Honestly the food is ok. Red burrito menu is nasty though. They are extremely slow and the general manager and team leaders aren't the kindest either. Although I think the team leaders just follow his attitude, I come all the time and he is never in a good mood."}
{"text":"Great food this is the only hardees near me about 30 min but its worth the drive there food is great havent got there burgers yet but had the chicken tenders and there really good"}
{"text":"Love Hardee's burgers, better than all fast-food burger joints around, so I decided to venture out & go for their chicken sandwich & I tell ya looks are deceiving looked great, smelled awesome, but the taste was lack luster, I thought it was just a plain grilled chicken breast,  but it was glazed with what don't know, did ask they said \"BBQ sauce\" to me tasted like a teriyaki sauce they asked if I liked it told them the honest truth no they did apologized since it was recommended by the cashier, so had ordered the hot ham/cheese sandwich, which I really like. I will ask next time of they have it without the glaze of so I'll order that & give it a try..."}
{"text":"I looooove Hardees burgers!! Today, the Frisco Burger, topped with Frisco sauce, bacon, cheese, on Sourdough bread. With a side of beer battered Onion Rings, a great lunch it was!!"}
{"text":"Recently I was on my way to the emergency room. I actually stopped at Hardees to grab my husband food because I knew I was going to be a long time. If any of you have been there you know their ordering system sucks.  You can never hear them. I waited until I got to the window to give my coupon. I handed my card with the coupon on top. She rings me up and gives me my receipt. As soon as I look at it she shows me to coupon and goes oops! I get making a mistake. The next part was inexcusable. She went tyo get her manager to fix it. The man outright attacked me. Told me how it says I have to present the coupon before ordering. Does not say that anywhere. Not to mention, fix your ordering screen so maybe people can hear it. He refused to give me the discount.  The woman who took my order then starts telling him that I handed her the coupon on the bottom of my card so it wasn't her fault. WTF. I did not. Even if I had. She would have had to swipe my card. She can't do that while the coupon is attached to the card.  After the lies and the snotty manager, I told them to just refund my purchase. He got ticked. Gives me back cash. I looked at him and asked for my card back. He honestly tossed it at me through the window."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever with this particular location! Very rude drive thru staff."}
{"text":"Like Brian, it is rare that I eat at Hardee's.  And I was really not in the mood for them this night either, but since this particular location has their Mexican offerings as well through the Red Burrito brand, I figured I could try that if I did not see anything I liked.  I probably should have kept driving.  I should note that I grew up on Carl's Jr.  The Western Bacon Cheeseburger was like manna from heaven.  Back in the day, it was difficult deciding between one of these and a double-double.  Seriously.  Who puts onion rings on a cheeseburger?  And then they pull out the unlimited soft drinks?  Nice.  Whether Hardee's purchase of Carl's Jr. really changed much about either franchise is difficult to say.  And Hardee's does have a decent burger - but as with most places, it depends on the staff at the location as well as when you hit them up.  And when you go into a burger place for Mexican, you are probably asking for trouble.  Stale chips.  Tasteless glop that is supposed to be a burrito (or an enchilada, or something).  Definitely want to go elsewhere if you are not sticking to the regular menu - and maybe even then."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Hardee's in the area. It's keep really clean, and maintained. Plus it's the only one I've been to with a Mexican menu. Staff was really friendly as well."}
{"text":"There's only one word you really need to know about this place: SLOW.   I was heading to set up for an event at the University and needed food. So, I stopped by here since it was so close. Big mistake. After what felt like an eternity of radio silence at the drive thru, I parked the car and went inside. It wasn't busy, yet there were super annoyed looking people scattered around the restaurant. Some were outside sitting in their cars waiting for their orders.  Someone finally walked to the register to take my order. She started by telling me that I couldn't order anything with meat from the Red Burrito side of the menu. The truck had just arrived and they haven't unloaded yet. Seeing how long it took for everyone else to get their burgers, I went with a bean burrito. It was just meh. The chips and salsa that came with it were meh. It also took awhile to get. Meh, meh, MEH.  If you're in a rush, don't stop by here. A woman outside (who waited for probably a good 20 minutes to get her food) told me it's always like this here. So the moral of the story is: if you're in a hurry, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Permanently Closed. Next closest locations are Paxton and Champaign. No explanation, just a paper sign on the door and registers and coca-cola machine removed.   A couple of days later, the outside signs removed."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service...interior wasn't particularly clean...soft drinks weren't calibrated properly. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Hardee's chicken biscuits more than anything, but damn this location to hell. We recently stopped here to eat breakfast while we were driving back home to Pennsylvania for the holidays. The food was great, but the patrons -- not so much. There were grown men turning around at their tables to watch us eat. Yes, we did not look like everyone else but pink corduroy jeans are in this season -- deal with it, assholes. I have never been somewhere where ALL of the clientele were completely rude by staring at us. It was completely uncomfortable and it did not seem like a situation where we could have said anything back to these fat hillbillies.  We will NEVER stop at this location again when we are driving back to Philadelphia. I urge any \"city slickers\" not to stop either. Take your money somewhere where people won't stare at you like you are a damn zoo animal."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  I'm a fan of the chain. Not so much a fan of this location. Slow Slow Slow and when they aren't slow. They're very slow. Its really not much to type for this location. Because my mom said if you nothing nice to say, say nothing at all.  TTFN"}
{"text":"Service was terrific. My breakfast bowl was a disappointment, Very small portion compared to other Hardee's."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Only 3 people working in the afternoon. No full time cashier. Had to wait at least 10 minutes just to place an order. Then at least another 20 minutes to get food."}
{"text":"The manager and all the employees here are always very nice to me actually always recognize me when I go through and get my biscuit and coffee I really appreciate their customer service and I will always use them as my primary breakfast fast food place."}
{"text":"I went to the Hardees location on Bradley Ave on December 1st approximately 10am. There were no other vehicles in line. I ordered my food, when we got to the pick up window, my oh so thirsty 4 year old changed ger mind and decided she wanted a cup of water. I asked the girl working if I could also get a cup of water. She i formed me that I would need to pull up and wait for someone to bring that out to me. This was ridiculous. What kind of service is this? Customer service has serioulsy gone to crap."}
{"text":"Just heads up if you ate here between June 13-23 go get a hepatitis shot. thank god I never ate there. I don't think I will be able to eat there ever. This is a crazy thing to think about in the food industry. Ok I'm going to start cooking more lol dueces"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of Hardee's at all! The advertisements are what dragged us in with the hopes of a huge, quality burger as advertised, but we got mediocre food at best. I got the curly fries, chili dog (~$5.99 combo) and the chicken tenders (~$9.99). The chicken tenders were chewy and did not taste or look as though they were \"hand breaded.\" I didn't like the honey mustard dipping sauce. It had a heavy taste of Dijon mustard and a hint of horseradish. The curly fries were not good and didn't compare to other fast food curly fries. The hot dog was salty, cheap tasting and the chili on it was over processed and looked like dog food. The staff was friendly and the wait wasn't long, so nothing but positives there, but I would not be visiting Hardee's again due to the lack of taste for the prices we paid."}
{"text":"I haven't had any issues at this location. I've always received what i ordered in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I stopped by the drive way on Sunday 01/09/2016  at 5.30 pm.... the restaurant was totally empty inside and no cars in front of me, I placed the order, but no one came by the window to take my money or let me know what is going on with my order,,,, I waited almost 6 min. and I decided to leave.... on the other side of the street McDonalds was loaded ...It was not wandering why it is empty inside like that."}
{"text":"these guys are super friendly. the food was made perfectly! mushroom and Swiss.yum they play nice music and its very clean"}
{"text":"So,recently my schedule at work switched from one hour lunches to half hour lunches. So, during my 30 minutes I went to Hardees , well actually, to Red Burrito, to get some nachos. I arrive and everything is fine, nothing stands out that would prompt me to write a review, either good or bad, about this place.  I get waited on almost immediately and I place my order at fair prices. I'm about five minutes from the office so I decide to eat in.  What escaped my mind was the restless mob of landscapers and construction workers congregated near the soda machine where you pick up your food. Odd... but didn't pay much attention. When I get to my table I notice another long table, about 8-10 of them, other workers sitting around stretching their necks towards the kitchen to see where their food was.  Five minutes go by and very few of our friends have received their food. Eventually they start trickling out with their delicacies in a paper bag. Oddly enough, the kitchen is swarming with activity. People running in and out of view, tasty, greasy, unhealthy morsels of food being wrapped and bagged by a few employees.  And that's when I notice it. 90% of the food is going to the drive through window. And hardly any of it coming to the dinding room.  And I think to myself that yet again, the laziest bastards on the face of this planet win! I felt kinda like when you go in person to some place and mid-sentence the person on the other side of the counter tells you to hold on so the crotchstain who was too lazy to come in and called gets preferential treatment over me!  At one point, some douche got mad enough to complaint very loudly and obnoxiously. Unfortunately, it only helped to prove the world is still plagued with douchebags.  I waited possibly 15 minutes for my food... took a few bites and had to rush back to work... eating nachos, and making a freakin' mess, in my poor little Sorento. Oh well, not that the food was bad or anything for fast food fare... just sucks how some companies prioritize who to serve."}
{"text":"Ok so I spent $7 on a combo the biscuit alone was four. How do you say \"Loaded Omelette Biscuit\" if there isn't anything in it????"}
{"text":"Just down the street from Belmont Abbey College. The bathroom waspretty clean. The service people were very nice. The drive through was extremely efficient and fast. Our order was complete and they went out of their way to provide good service."}
{"text":"Gross! I've been to other Hardee's and they were not that bad, but this one is horrible. It's like the reject Hardee's with all the misfits they can't fire. The food took forever and the burger didn't even look appetizing. The bun looked half cooked and the burger was cooked past dead. With all the toppings thrown on and a cup of mayonnaise. It's the first time in my life I couldn't eat more than a few bites of a burger because it was that bad. My wife got the taco salad. Hahaha more like the fat persons dream lol they forgot the main ingredient in a salad( that's lettuce). I would rather eat a tofu burger and listen to a vegetarian tell me why I shouldn't eat meat than go to this Hardee's again."}
{"text":"Wanted to stop for something quick with the kids.. ordered a large fry for the $5 box and got all smalls!! They made up after I noticed ?"}
{"text":"This review is for tea only: this location does not do $1 medium teas. I was very disappointed when my favorite road trip drink cost me double what I am used to. On top of that it was slightly old tasting. I can not recommend this Hardee's for sweet tea seeking travelers.  Will continue to patronize other Hardee's locations."}
{"text":"2 stars because our order was correct. If it wasn't for that, would have given 1 star. Customer service is non existent. I know it's fast food and a drive thru, but a hello or do you need ketchup isn't a lot to ask. Had to sit at the window an extra two minutes to wait for the worker to come back just so we could ask for ketchup. When she saw us still sitting at the window, she couldn't help but roll her eyes. She just opened the window and waited for us to tell her what we needed. Needless to say, the service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"9/2/2017 I hate to do this just as much as I hate to go to fast food, this has to be one of the worst visits I've made anywhere lately!!! The only reason we stopped was Stephanie had a headache and didn't want to go to a Mom & Pop. We ordered for her a small hot & ham cheese and small coke. I got the big hot ham & cheese, fries and drink, lets just say something with the ham & cheeses didn't taste right, so some lucky animal or bird got to eat those. Food took a very long time to come to us, I would understand if the place was busy but nope it was 2pm on a Saturday. The drinks were good !!! I don't know how these places don't have a commitment to quality control, I do have a commitment that I will not return to this location ever. I wasted my time and money and theirs too!!"}
{"text":"Recently redecorated. New photos look good."}
{"text":"Not long ago, the Hubs introduced me to the the chicken rice bowl.  I have been having at least one per week for the last two weeks.  Today, I went inside and read the nutritional information.  The calories are about 430 which I can handle.  However, with a sodium content of over 1,200, I will have to limit the frequency of my visits.  Three stars for a clean restaurant, a 94.5 rating, and great, albeit slow service.  I think the latter is because they don't have many people working at the same time, maybe two."}
{"text":"Best hotdogs of Harrisburg. I guess that all Hardee's hotdogs are good, but these somehow seem better. Cheap side salads as well. Other then sometimes slow in the drive-thru, this is a good store."}
{"text":"Dear Franchisee,  Just thought I would let you know that I almost choked to death driving home today when I took a bite of my Bacon Cheddar Melt. Two dry patties with dry bacon and dry cheese on dry buns ain't gonna go down anyone's throat prettily. Where the hell was the mayo or ketchup or water-laden lettuce and tomato? As is, that there burger is lethal, my friend. Stick with your fabulous (and moist) thickburgers. Please."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I came and tried to enjoy a meal here for the first time, but was I shocked to find out that all the other reviews were spot on. At dinner there was no one dining in which should have raised a red flag. It was effortless to order because there was no line. From my vantage point I question the cleanliness of this restaurant. There was a large mosquito flying around the lights in the kitchen, the sun room appeared to be flooded with a sign saying closed and a large puddle of water on the floor. This made me nervous with how dirty the restaurant was... Overall the booth's were simply sticky. The food itself wasn't bad, the mushroom and swiss burger was a bit on the salty side. The fries were fresh though. Overall this was my first and last experience with Hardee's. Thank you.  Pro: angus thick burger, a step above McD but still not restaurant quality  Cons: dirty store (bugs, a room that was flooded...)  Hidden gem: 1. Coupons in mail for BOGO 2.

{"text":"I visit Hardee's  for the chicken sandwiches and my wife loves their chicken strip wrappers.   I grew up on the west coast eating from Carle's Junior, which is the sister company to Hardee's and I have to say they're superior but I will settle for what I can get."}
{"text":"Went here once and will not return. Lazy teenagers were running the restaurant, and my burger was so undercooked that I took it home and microwaved it."}
