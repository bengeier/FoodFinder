{"text":"Just discovered this is a terrific daytime spot in the Village in Montreal. Gorgeous, freshly-prepared platters of salads, sandwiches, and pastries for eat-in or take-out. We ate in--the space is lovely, very serene and full of light. Good coffee in signature earthenware mugs. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Dave Plant is an awesome addition to the interesting things popping up in the NoVill (North Village) area. There is a revitalization happening north of Saint-Catherine that is reflective of the changes the Village is about to go though and it's exciting to see Dave Plant be a leader in this transition.

The shop features great coffee, amazing pastries, and delicious breakfast and lunch items such as whole-grain salads, sandwiches, soups. Everything is prepared with local and seasonal ingredients, which is refreshing compared to some of the other older establishments in the area.

I had a coffee and a chocolate chip cookie on my first visit. There is an attention to detail invested their pastries that make them desirable even at a quick glance. The chocolate chip cookie, while a classic, was unique on its own with chili peppers offering an extra kick that matched perfectly with my coffee.

The location is just a block up from Beaudry Metro and across from Le Red Tiger. The interior is adorable with picnic style tables, a sitting nook, and two outside benches. The details of the decor have been considered and they don't go unnoticed. I could see this being a great place for a quick lunch break, a casual business meeting, or even a place to hang out and work while you sip your coffee and have a bite.

The staff is very prompt and friendly. A must visit.

Recommendation: It's great to see a focus on third wave coffee, but I'd love to be able to pair the amazing pastries with espresso-based drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Such unique and interesting combinations, yet they deliver an absolute experience to your taste buds. 

By far the best bread I've ever had for for a sandwich paired with a great goat cheese spread, and very fresh veggies. Perfect portioning and taste."}
{"text":"Dave has created a wonderful cafe with beautiful pastries, delicious sandwiches and salads.  Bright open space with communal seating.   Perfect breakfast and lunch spot.

The fresh lemonade was amazing.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Dave's place on a very rainy day before heading to the airport. We were warmly welcomed and ordered coffee, tea, and some pastries. The tea was fresh and clean. Coffee was strong and robust. They were out of soy milk, but Dave ran across the street and got some for my coffee. Staff was delightfully friendly. Dave offered suggesting for things to do in the rain. Wonderful start to the morning!"}
{"text":"Vraiment mignon comme endroit; décontracté, sans prétention. Belle ambiance et musique qui vous detend. 

C'est plus un café qu'un restaurant.

Nous sommes allés pour le brunch samedi matin 10:00. Ce n'était pas plein, quoiqu'il y a peu de places disponibles pour s'asseoir.

Plusieurs choix d'assiettes et de viennoiseries fraîches. 

Bien aimé!"}
{"text":"Love the chemex cofee and their baked goods. Had banana muffin, cinnamon roll and chocolate chip cookie with chili.  Real good food and very nice staff."}
