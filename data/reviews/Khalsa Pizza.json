{"text":"Once a year I visit Toronto and eating at Khalsa Pizza is always at the top of my list. From the Vegi pizza to burgers is my all time favourite vegetarian food! I would recommend Khalsa Pizza to everyone."}
{"text":"NOW THEY SERVE VEGAN CHEESE TOO!!!!!!!
oh you ought to try out this place , another place which is good on your pocket.
An extra large Pizza for only $14....yummy too .... ask them to put on a hint of garlic, ginger and coriander ...oh yummy.
I visit there every weekend. very friendly elderly lady at the counter. quick service, as its not crowded all the time. After a lot of inquiries regarding vegan cheese they started from this week and I was lucky enough to get it...I am loving it....and for the prize you keep going back there."}
{"text":"I'm happy to have found this pizza place! They are great at customizing pizzas. Usually I don't get comments from my coworkers on my lunches, but whenever I have one of these pizzas they comment on how great it smells."}
{"text":"Well I'll be! I never thought I'd come across an all-vegetarian Punjab pizza joint. While I'm glad this place exists, it didn't really blow me out of the water in terms of taste and quality of the pizza, and I say that as an passport-carrying Italian and vegan.

The selection of vegetable toppings is pretty standard to other meat-serving pizza places, which was disappointing considering they are specializing in vegetarian pizza and have the words \"vegetarian\" and \"vegan\" strewn all over their website. Where's the kale?

They offer unique plant protein toppings such as soy ground round, soyperoni, and plain(?) tofu. No indication about whether this is GMO soy or organic. And for the Indian community and those into that whole curry pizza fad, paneer.

We opted for the ground round and soyperoni, as it didn't sound like the tofu was prepared with any type of marination. Eating plain tofu on pizza isn't an appetizing thought and I love tofu! I genuinely hope they marinate it and begin to advertise it with said flavour. A smoked tofu would be nice.

We forgot to say 'no cheese' when ordering and the subject was only broached by the staff behind the counter after the pizzas were already in the oven, so it was moot by then. 

I guess we got lulled into a false sense of security having found their business through the Toronto Vegetarian Association (a vegan organization, despite the name)'s Directory and seeing the word \"vegan\" all over their website. I would have given another star had she asked us if we wanted cheese BEFORE she put cheese on both pizzas and put them in the oven. Bad customer service, but also a whoops on our part for not catching her while she made it.

Dairy cheese is borne of the same animal suffering as meat and equally, if not more terrible for the human health, but I digress. Difficult to explain to people who are vegetarian on religious grounds, not ethical ones. 

We asked them why they don't offer vegan cheese such as Daiya brand cheese, which is tapioca-based and now readily available in every grocery store. It keeps very nicely in the freezer. She said it is because they only get a few people enquiring every month about vegan pizza and they like to buy cheese in bulk. Well, you can buy Daiya in bulk from the Ontario Food Co-op in Oakville if you're a business, but I think this was her way of saying, they don't cater to the western-veg crowd.

I think if they added vegan cheese to the menu and they'd get more people asking for it. A lot of people are lactose intolerant and frankly the cheese we had on our pizzas was as delicious as melted glue (true of most pizza cheese though). I ended up pulling it off and losing some soy ground round topping as a result.

I also found the pizza to be a bit on the over-cooked side. Browned crust and browned cheese is not how I like my pizza done. They use a conveyor belt style oven so it's preset to cook the pizzas to the point of browning. The vegetables toppings were good. I would definitely get the grilled zucchini and ground round again.

We were offered to have our pizzas be made spicy without much of an explanation to what that entailed. If we hadn't been bringing the pizza to share with family, I definitely would have sprung for the opportunity to try this variation.

All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Khalsa again, as I don't live in Brampton and I can get a vegan, Napoletana-style pizza from Famoso, Piola, Terroni, Pizza Rustica, and regular take-out pizza with vegan cheese from Pizzaiolo and Mamma's Pizza now. Sure, I'd love to support an all-vegetarian business, but they are definitely more lacto-vegetarian than vegan-friendly. 

If you are in the area and hungry, it's worth a try, but probably not more than the vegetarian Indian offerings up that way."}
