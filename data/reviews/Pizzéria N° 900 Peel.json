{"text":"Having just come back from a month long jaunt through Italy, I have been hesitant about eating pizza. Would anything ever come close to the magic I experienced in the motherland of pizza? Pizzeria No. 900 Napolitaine does a pretty good job! 

In good pizza, the crust should be thin, chewy (but not too chewy), burnt appropriately for the bitterness and smokiness to counter the rich acidity of the tomato and other ingredients. My pizza definitely had all the hallmarks of good dough. The ingredients were also super flavourful and I enjoyed the combination of the pizza I ordered. I ordered the mild Italian sausage one, which was tomato based with pesto, green onion, peppers, and cheese. 

Service was also super quick and very friendly. The whole process of ordering, waiting, and leaving took around twenty minutes. 

Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long morning trekking Mont Real. The place did not disappoint! Great artisinal pizzas, local beer, and an 80s playlist. A great way to end our last day in Montreal."}
{"text":"Menu assez court, mais pizzas délicieuses. Assez la Prosciutto, elle est délicieuse! Seul bémol: le vin au verre est cher, mais au moins on y présente plusieurs choix. Service rapide, parfait pour l'heure du midi. Pas idéal pour un repas d'amoureux car les tables sont très proches."}
{"text":"Great location, hip urban interior with a clear retro touch, the concept is great and the pizza prices are reasonable ( the wine by the glass is on the pricy side though ). The only down side is that the ingredients of the pizza are so little, like 25% of the pizza the rest is dough"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazimg.  The place was a bit hot with the wood ovens going the whole lunch on a hot day."}
{"text":"So I went there for dinner a few nights ago and so far it has been the best experience eating here in Montreal. The food was also fabulous. The waitress was super friendly, and the food was good. Definitely a place I would recommend anyone check out."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant located in one of my favorite parts of Montreal because of all the close shopping, good food and was next to the 1st hotel I ever stayed in Montreal. Ordered the sausage pizza, was great! Liked the crust- not too crunchy or too soft. The green sauce that came with it gave it good flavor. The server that helped me was a bit pushy and rigid..but good food was worth it."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzarias in town. Real quality pizza. Dough is delicious.  Def a must eat."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée avec une collègue sur l'heure du diner car on en entend beaucoup parlé.
Quelle déception ! J'ai pris une margherita Bianca. Je n'avais jamais vu une pizza aussi peu garnie. J'ai compté 4 petites tomates cerises, 4 rondelles de mozzarella et 5 feuilles de basilic. That's it.
Je mets deux étoiles car le service était correct. Je trouve cela cher pour ce que c'est. 
Je n'y retournerai pas et ma collègue non plus. Elle avait aussi été déçue d'une expérience précédente dans la même chaine de restaurants.
Il y a d'autres endroits en ville ou l'on peut manger de meilleures pizzas et a un bien meilleur rapport qualité prix."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Authentic dough and first rate ingredients. Despite it being incredibly busy for a Monday, the staff was very friendly and accommodating of my special needs daughter. I had the prosciutto, which was excellent. My wife had the spicy pancetta and figs. Very good."}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza with arugula (forget what it was called) and added red sauce. What really made this amazing was the chili oil on the side! It added such a punch and made this pizza place really stand out!"}
{"text":"pizza is fresh and hot
fresh crust
no ipa on tap
the mozzarella side dish is $9 and has 2 balls
not that sweaty 
but we get get it
best part is the view
we got to watch the pizza cook"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a casual dinner/lunch. Nice decor, can get a little bit noisy tho."}
{"text":"Il y avait des bouts de ma pizza qui n'était pas cuit correctement.. Peu de garniture aussi...

Je suis déjà aller dans plusieurs autre No.900 et celle là est décevant. 

2 étoiles au service!"}
{"text":"Service sucks. Staff is arrogant, unwelcoming and racist."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant, really nice in the summer but food was just average. Also didn't know what most of the ingredients describing the dish on the menu were"}
{"text":"Love this place. Perfect and cosy with wonderful staff. Probably best for groups for under four people and dates. We had a pizza with wines and an arugula salad, which I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not the most knowledgeable staff but our waiter clearly did his best to make us feel comfortable. for a downtown joint it's rather \"healthy\" and fairly priced. I liked their margherita quite a lot!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way out from the hotel. Ordered a margarita but added Italian sausage.  Dough was light and fluffy pretty good. The sauce tastes homemade perfectly balanced with the basil and sausage. They so have a lunch special so ask for that.
I got carryout and it was pretty quick considering the fact that it was around lunch time and very busy.
The wait can be ling I heard the waiter tell a group of 4 it would be about an hour! 
Tip: place your order over the phone if your getting take out."}
{"text":"This is hands down my new favorite Italian style pizza place. I thought Brigade was \"it\" downtown but this is even better! I'm amazed it's a chain, but whoever is behind it is onto something good. If that means people all over Montreal get to experience some most excellent pizza, that can only be a good thing.

So the pizza. Oh the pizza! This pizza rivals some of my fondest memories of eating pizza in Italy (and no, not all of it was amazing there either). The perfect thin crust, but still a bit doughy at the edges. Enough toppings, but too much. Just right. I had a four cheese pizza (that day's pizza of the day) and it was delicious and the didn't skimp on the cheese, but there also wasn't so much that I felt ill afterwards (it has happened elsewhere). 

I found the price reasonable, especially the lunch special at $12. By no means a cheap lunch, but if you want to go out and eat a delicious sit down meal, it's perfectly acceptable. 

The space itself is gorgeous. Lots of wood and light, and people crammed everywhere. There's a window counter for people watching while dining. The kitchen is right there and open, so you can watch the pizzas being skillfully prepared while you wait. It looked like they were working on an adjacent space that will add more seating, a welcome addition as most lunch hours there is a steady lineup of people waiting for takeout or to be seated."}
{"text":"It's okay. I mean, honestly, the pizza dough itself is good -- wood fired oven, soft dough-y perfection, but the toppings are where they fell flat.

They were pretty stingy with the basil leaves, the cheese.. I honestly think that it should have had at least double the toppings on there because even for $11, I am not expecting 4 little leaves of basil on a pizza.

I would come back. Don't get me wrong, I would eat here again as a quick snack, but it is mostly really good, delicious, pizza dough bread with a slight smear of toppings. I would have needed two to be full."}
{"text":"We went for lunch in a group of 6. Even though there aren't big tables that easily seat larger groups, the staff easily accommodated us by pushing a few of the small tables together. Service was fast and attentive - I never ran out of water. It was a Friday, so I thought the restaurant would have more people, but it also felt like -30° outside, so I wasn't too surprised. Still, there were a few other groups there, so I imagine it gets pretty busy on regular days. 

I ordered the lunch special with arugula salad and Margherita pizza. My friends got the antipasti board, which looked good, but I didn't try any. Great value for the amount of food. The coffee was great (and well priced) too. I'm only surprised that I haven't come here before!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had.   Ate here twice during a 5 day visit to Montreal.   Everything we had here (marguerita pizzas, the porcini, mild sausage, charcuterie and deserts) were fantastic.   Small and cozy, service was friendly.    Was well worth the dinner prices.   The special prices at lunch or the pre-habs game special they mentioned would be a steal.  Highly recommended with no reservations."}
{"text":"So good. I came here alone because my mothers flight was delayed and I hadn't eaten all day. I had never eaten by myself in a restaurant before but it was great, because the service was extremely fast. I had the spicy pancetta and fig pizza... which I (by myself) completely finished in about 5 minutes. I inhaled it. They have a spicy oil you can dip the crust in which I would highly recommend. Crust is perfectly cooked and toppings are really nicely balanced. Would definitely recommend this place, I wish I could've gone back to eaten more pizzas."}
{"text":"Great place if you want a fancier pizza joint but due to the price I could never make it the normal place I'd go to for pizza. The Margherita pizza with mild Italian sausage was great! Again great food and atmosphere but very pricey"}
{"text":"Très bonne pâte de pizza. Il manque peut-être un peu de sauce pour mes goûts, mais la meilleure pizza au centre-ville. On goûte bien les ingrédients. Nous avons essayé la Margherita bianca et la Saucisse italienne douce, ainsi que l'entrée Pesto di parma (un peu trop salé).

Au fond du restaurant, il y a une longue banquette avec de petites tables, ambiance romantique. J'aime bien le design intérieur qui me fait penser aux beaux restaurants de Barcelone. 

Service courtois, rapide et sympathiq"}
{"text":"Some great stuff coming your way. I'm going to keep my review short because the beauty of no. 900 pizza is its simplicity. Marvellous combination of fresh ingredients , wood oven baked. Yum, delicious! Flexibility with order choice, you can remove meat, or substitute pork with beef. Staff is friendly, they let me hang my coat in the back. Really cute decor, urban hipster vibe with a nostalgic yearning for all things retro. Recommendation: Porcini pizza!"}
{"text":"We wanted a \"late\" night snack but decided to go for pizza instead. 

The staff greeted us right away and we were seated by the opened window which was nice on a warm september evening. The waiter made some nice recommandations on drinks and pizza according to our taste. We ordered 2 cocktails and 1 italian sausage pizza to share. The food came very quickly. 

The pizza is amazing. Perfect amount of tomato sauce with enough ingredients as topping. They also gave us spicy oil to spice things up. The cocktails were pretty good too. 

Overall, excellent service with amazing pizza combined with a nice view of the street."}
{"text":"Simple menu with great choices of pizza. I forgot the names of the pizzas, i loved the one with hazelnut. 5/5 for ambience. I'll come here for pizzas again."}
{"text":"For great pizza in Downtown Montreal this is a must go! Go for the spicy pancetta, fig, and goat cheese pizza! To die for, and the staff is the best!"}
{"text":"I can't understand how this pizzeria is on the list with so little ingredients on the dough and such a terrible service and attitude"}
{"text":"We wanted a nice night in with some great food and we're so glad we found this spot! The pizza was perfect! We also had burrata which was also  I highly recommend this spot for dining out or sitting in!"}
{"text":"Un super pizza avec des ingrédients de top qualité sa donne une pizza au goût top. 
Les ingrédients étaient frais et excellents. La croûte était parfaitement cuite et juste assez croustillante.
Le prix plus que raisonnable."}
{"text":"Great prices, beautiful decor, but the pizzas are really average. Not enough cheese!!"}
{"text":"Une grosse surprise, grosse dans tous les sens du terme. Pour 8$, je m'attendais à une mini pizza...non, au contraire, j'en aurais eu pour 2 semaines, la pizza est énorme...VRAIMENT énorme.

Seul bémol, la sauce goûtait un peu trop l'origan. Mais vraiment, ca vaut le détour. Belle surprise...pour les gros appétits..."}
{"text":"My real rating is a solid 4.5 but Yelp doesn't do have stars. This place was near our hotel and we found the service and pizza to be great! Our pizzas were delicious, the toppings and dough all very fresh and high quality. The pizza was also cooked quickly so if you're really hungry (or getting hangry) I recommend this place. It's really nice though small so I imagine it could get busy, though it wasn't like that when we went for a midweek dinner around 18. Considering it's location it draws a mostly tourist and suits crowd but it was nice and the staff was all very attentive and helpful. Both the pizzas we had were really good, I had a mushroom and prosciutto calzone style pizza topped with arugula that I would happily have again. We had the tiramisu after dinner and that was also very good! Would really recommend this place if you're in the area and craving some good pizza. The prices were very fair as well :)"}
{"text":"My second visit to this location proved to not live up to my first visit, sadly, and mostly a product of service. It was my partner's birthday, and as I headed out to see if there was a good bakery in the area (there wasn't) the server informed me that there was a \"cake fee\". Really? I'm about to drop over $100 with a group of six? Someone please let me know if other establishments do this, because this is the first time I've ever encountered it.

This really soured the beginning of the evening for me, and sadly, the rest of the meal didn't improve much. It was in general was pretty cold and barely present, definitely missing the personal touch which drew me in with my first visit. At least the food was still good."}
{"text":"One of my best meals in Montreal! Great service, pizza and wine. I love a cozy neighborhood restaurant that has quality food. Easy to find and quick service. When you enter you are kindly greeted by friendly staff - and promptly seated. The pizza is made to order, very personal! I had a margherita pizza with Italian sausage and mushrooms. It was great! I also ordered a glass of red wine. A perfect meal to end a day of sightseeing and shopping! Hope I can stop by again before my trip is over."}
{"text":"I love Neapolitan style pizza, so I was really excited to discover this place on Yelp.  My husband and I went there for dinner recently during our trip to Montreal.  It was fantastic!

I had the I started with the arugula salad ($5) and then had the Margherita Pizza ($9), while my husband started with the Caesar salad ($5) and then had the Porchetta Pizza ($16).  My husband also had some local beer ($5 a bottle).    

My salad was a really good size for a starter.  It had fresh baby arugula, some chunks of fior di latte, cherry tomatoes and grated Parmesan cheese.  The dressing was citrusy.  It was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  My pizza was delicious.  The crust was thin and blistery as Neapolitan style pizza should be.  It wasn't too burnt (which sometimes happens with this type of pizza).  The sauce was not excessive and had a nice tang to it.  There was the right amount of cheese (fior di latte) and a few basil leaves.  I loved it.  

My husband enjoyed his Caesar salad (I'm not a fan, so I didn't try any).  He said \"it tasted like it was made with quality ingredients.\"  I had a slice of the Porchetta Pizza and it was ok, but I liked mine more.  It was an olive oil based pizza (no tomato sauce).  It had porchetta and fior di latte, but also some Romano cheese.  It also had some marinated vegetables (definitely artichoke and I think also eggplant), hot peppers and basil leaves.  It was definitely oilier/greasier than my pizza.  I like tomato sauce based pizzas, so I might be biased in my opinion.    

The place is not very large, so it filled up quickly.  There are about 30 seats in the whole restaurant.  There is an open kitchen behind glass windows.  You can see the staff making your pizzas.  I noticed that the person who handled the pizzas after they came out of the oven wore gloves.  I am a huge fan of this practice!  

Service was very nice and attentive. As soon as my husband finished his beer, they asked if he wanted another one.  And as soon as our waters were running low, they refilled them.  

The place gets really warm due to the pizza oven, so dress appropriately.  I would not want to be in a wool sweater or a turtleneck or anything like that in the restaurant!  The washrooms are cool.  They have 3 universal/unisex water closets with just a toilet, then there is a communal area with a sink.   

If you like pizza and especially Neapolitan style pizza, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Oh my, this is good pizza! I have been spoiled and it's hard for me to find a good slice of pizza. I was visiting and went in for lunch. They have a great lunch special that includes a pizza and salad. It is about four slices, so plenty enough. Actually, too much. However, I couldn't stop eating it and finished the whole thing! I had a espresso Machiatto afterwards too and even that was good there. Excellent service, I hung out a bit working on my laptop and they kept making sure that I had everything I needed."}
{"text":"Location: Peel above de Maisonneuve. Street parking is available but metered and the closest subway is Peel (green line). If you go on a weekend, it will be tough to find street parking.

The place: It's pretty small and the kitchen, including the giant wood burning oven, is in the main dining space so it can get a little warm.

The goods: Frankly, I don't get the high ratings for this place. I went on a Tuesday with 6 friends and we each ordered pizza. I got the Italian sausage pizza with Fior di latte, green onions, romano cheese and pesto. First of all, there was the equivalent of about half a sausage on my pizza - in fact, I counted 6 pieces. There wasn't much mozza and I couldn't taste any of the Romano that was allegedly on this pizza. Green onions? Where? To say that they're cheap on toppings is an understatement - they seem to count exactly what they put on their pizzas. My friends all experienced the same thing but hey - the one topping 900 is generous with is arugula! Because that's why we eat pizza - the greens! In terms of taste, my pizza was OK but the crust tasted a little burnt. My friends thought their pizzas were OK too, but this place didn't blow them away. The reality is that 900 doesn't serve the best pizza in town. If you want great pizza then check out Anton & James or Santa Lucia, which are both about a block away.  

Service: The fellow who greeted us was very friendly and he seated us almost immediately. That said, the waitress was all about the attitude and left us with the distinct feeling that we were bothering her. We had the same impression from the bearded guy in the Hawaiian shirt who we presumed was the manager. Tip: If you don't like customer service then maybe you should change jobs - you're not doing us any favors by gracing the culinary world with your surly presence. 

Price point: The average price for pizza is between $11-$15 - which would be fair if the pizzas actually had toppings and the staff didn't dole out attitude. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really great pizza and a good atmosphere. Stopped in with five friends while on vacation for lunch, I ordered the lunch special where you get a salad and pizza for 12$. We waited a bit of time for the pizzas but none of us were upset about that. The server was friendly and apologized for the wait. 

After we finished eating he asked if he could give us free coffee and dessert since we had a long wait. We gladly accepted and were brought two delicious dessert pizzas, one with Nutella and the other with ricotta and honey. 

Great place to hang out and have pizza/drinks, and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Actually very authentic Italian pizza at very good prices. The location is small and quite crowded, so you eat, pay and go."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service was good but that is all I can say good. The drink I ordered was gross and the pizza was bland."}
{"text":"The second restaurant that had GF options for me! Waitress was knowledgeable in saying what toppings were safe as well. Super cool atmosphere and generous serving. So glad I was able to fit this place into our trip on the last night"}
{"text":"Went to this place on my last night in Montreal. I kept passing by it on my daily ventures to the city from my hotel and there was always something that intrigued me about it. It reminded of those trendy places that line Queen West in Toronto. After the previous place I'd been wanting to go to was full for the night I decided this would be a good opportunity to stop by. 

The place is small, so I wouldn't recommend it for groups of 4 or more. 

We were greeted by a friendly host who brought us to our table and were immediately met with our waiter. The establishment seems to be run by young 20-something's so it's definitely a \"cool\" vibe. He ran us through the drinks menu and then gave us a chance to look it over. 

We ordered the arugula salad and the charcuterie board to start. The arugula salad was garnished with some ricotta cheese which was a nice touch. The charcuterie board was neatly presented and included: prosciutto, salami, fior di latte, olives and artichokes. We were also given bread for the table. Both starters were amazing and a nice way to start off the meal. I love charcuterie boards so this was a definite hit in my books! 

The pizza's are cut into quarters and about the size of a regular dinner plate, if you're hungry I would suggest ordering your own rather than sharing (and if you happen to have leftovers... who doesn't love leftover pizza?). We ordered the Margherita and the Mild Italian Sausage pizza's. Both were absolutely amazing! The crust was perfectly crispy on the edges, the middle of the slices not drooping, being unable to sustain the toppings. They also gave chilli oil do drizzle on the pizza's elevating the heat levels. This is great if you're sharing pizza's and some people aren't too fond of spice. 

One of the things that i really enjoyed about this place was that the dining room and kitchen were within close proximity of each other. No matter where you were seated you had a great view of the pizza's being made, the wood oven heat radiating throughout. This added a sense of warmth to the place.    

For dessert we ordered the Nutella pizza, the tiramisu and cappuccino's. ALL WERE AMAZING!!! 

I'd definitely recommend this place! Amazing atmosphere. Amazing pizza's. Amazing service."}
{"text":"FAV PLACE IN MONTREAL! The bread they give you before the meal alone is to die for. Ordered the meat platter as an appetizer and the spicy fig pizza. Waiter was so helpful & recommended nearby bars. Also great playlist playing throughout the meal."}
{"text":"I spotted this place while walking downtown two days ago. It looked beautiful from the outside, so we decided to try it for dinner. Although it rained sporadically all afternoon today, we managed to avoid the downpours and secure our seats less than 10 minutes after arrival. Pizzéria No. 900 doesn't take reservations - which I guess goes into the idea of a \"neighoughood pizzeria\" - so it can be a bit annoying if you're not ready to stand in line.

The restaurant has perhaps ~30-35 seats. Its not big, but perfectly arranged and decorated. The white subway tile walls and patterned floors are simple and clean, giving an aerated look to the otherwise small restaurant. Inside, a mirrored wall further expands the space. Combined with the beautiful wooden tables and glass shelves, the whole place looks luminous and welcoming.

We took advantage of the waiting time to decide on our orders. I strongly recommend the burrata, especially if you're a cheese monster like me. Every item on that wooden board was praise-worthy. The taste of the sun-soaked cherry tomatoes was enhanced by fresh parsley and olive oil. The olives (castelvetrano?) were mild and meaty. The pesto fragrant and beautiful in color. The cheese itself was of course wonderful: creamy, rich and fresh all at the same time. Upon his first bite, my boyfriend decided on the spot that he would come back just for burrata - everyday single day - for a whole week! 
His mild Italian sausage pizza came soon after. To me, they apologized and said they were re-making my spicy pancetta and figs pizza, as it was apparently overcooked. It came merely 2 minutes later, which shows how important customer service is to Pizzéria No. 900. I have to admit that the pizzas were less impressive than the burrata, but still delicious. The outer crust had all those delightful imperfections and blisters, and the center was just thin enough to hold its own. I was actually surprised to see my boyfriend finish all of his crusts - he normally refuses to eat them. He explained that it was \"different\" this time (lol).
In the meantime, rain was coming down again, so we decided to stay for dessert. Since cannolis were not available, we opted for coffee. And so, we spent the last 20 minutes of this hour and a half-long dinner happily sipping (great) coffee while watching the rain fall outside the large open windows. Such a relaxing time!

I think the greatest strength of Pizzéria No. 900 comes from the quality of their products, and the attention they give to details, whether it concerns the food, setting, or service. Seriously, it's worth a visit. 
 
Tip: If the restaurant is packed and you don't feel like waiting, consider ordering for take-out. You will be out of there pizza in hand in much less time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my girlfriends after walking around downtown Montreal. Pizzéria No 900 is a cozy and cheerful little spot on Rue Peel. I ordered the Porchetta pizza and it was fantastic! I enjoyed the combination of ingredients - artichokes, porchetta, hot peppers and fior di latte and the fresh basil were delicious! Make sure to ask for the hot chilli oil if you like a little bit of spice! The pizza was enough for one person or for sharing when ordered with another appetizer. 

The service was okay - the pizzas were brought out in a timely manner but the waitress never came back to see how we were doing until we asked for the bill. I would have liked a refill of the water bottle for the table while we were eating. 

Other than that, definitely check it out if you're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Food was great and servers were amazing. Only issue was the table was to small. Could barely fit one pizza one large salad as well as the plates and drinks for three people.
again food was delicious. Had a pizza with mushrooms, greens and sausage. Salad was fresh and simple. Go check it out, but be prepared to get cozy."}
{"text":"Looks like a business lunch place. Cool atmosphere with reasonable prices. The pizza was delicious. Also, ordered a tiramisu and that was just I wanted that way. Cappuccino was great. Generally good but keep your expectations moderate."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the technique put into the pizza. I ordered a lunch special, which was a Margherita pizza and a Ceasar salad. The Margherita, being the absolute benchmark of a pizza-maker, was delicious. A crispy, yet slightly elastic crust, the perfect amount of flavour and acidity in the sauce, a good balance between the texture of the fior di latte and the parmesan, and an amazing spicy olive oil. The only weak point is I actually enjoy my pizza with a bit more basil, but this could be easily fixed with an add-on. 

The crowd is mostly office workers, service was efficient, yet courteous, and prices are more than reasonable.

Oh and the salad was great too, but who cares about the salad right ;)."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool in here. 
The service was really awesome!

The bummer part is the food...the pizzas lack a lot of flavor and are pretty boring.

Enjoyed a beer and a pizza."}
{"text":"Going through the shows of Grand Prix Montreal 2017, I came across this pizza place. When I got in, I saw that there is also a take away option for ordering your pizza and you can see all the guys making it for you fresh which is amazing however I decided to have a seat and enjoy my food. The lady came up to me and gave me a choice of where I wanted to be seated and during summer time. I placed my order and it arrived in 10-12 minutes from the wood fire oven.

My pizza was delicious and having their chilli oil on the side just added the right kick! The pizza was thin crust and the outside well cooked and full of fresh flavours. I would definitely return and try their other pizzas on the menu. My server was friendly and nice! I also noticed as to how they managed their decor which was neat and clean. It's a top notch experience that I had with them."}
{"text":"Small cute and cozy italian style pizzeria. Offering  2 pizza categories: white and red.
If you are a prosciutto fan as I am I recommend the prosciutto pizza which has the cold cut topped after the pizza has baked. They have a good selection so you can't really go wrong. Service wise in general (from the way we were hosted and served by other staff other than our waiter) was acceptable.  Our waiter, however, was very nice and friendly!
Bottom line, good pizza place in town."}
{"text":"Pizza un peu légères et peu garnies"}
{"text":"THIS PIZZERIA ROCKS ! 
All pizzas are available on GLUTEN FREE DOUGH! 
Delicious place! I meant, the pizzas they make! 
We're coming tonight for more! got hungry writing it! Love Love Love! 
Very nice staff and atmosphere, also the music! 
I saw some good beers there too!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  The arugula pizza is pretty much the best I have ever had in any country - Super fresh ingredients, exceptional flavor combination.  Nailed it.   Great wine list, and the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Good pizzas at a good price. I had some of the mild Italian sausage and a proscuitto & arugula white pizza. The toppings & sauce were great but the dough might not be your favorite if you're more used to NYC pizza. Was a little chewy and almost had the texture of naan bread. Pizzas were also served with a spicy olive oil on the side which was a nice touch on the white pizza.

Still, a nice spot for pizzas in a cool area of downtown at a very affordable price. Our service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Great spot! Awesome pizza!Great service!

Absolutely nothing negative to post about this place.

Make sure to get there early if you are going for lunch as it's quite small.

They do have a take out counter if you want something on the go. Make sure to get there early for lunch as well... The line up piles up quickly!!

I would recommend this spot to anyone who loves traditional Pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza place felt classier than I was expecting. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the pizza was incredible. I had the margherita bianca with sauce which turned out perfect. Wasn't too busy during lunch on a weekday. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking to avoid a chain pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"Thought I already tagged this one before..  not a lot to say here that I haven't already seen said in the first several reviews

This place is right beside the Hotel Omni Mont-Royal which makes it extremely convenient for those of us who stay there.  The Lunch Special is a great deal, $12 for a proper wood-fired margherita with a caesar salad & homemade dressing and bottle of water.  

I've had the pizza a bunch of times and it's consistently good, except for the one time they made the crust way too thick and the bottom got blackened from them having to cook it so long.

Not the end of the world as this only happened once, so I think 4 stars is the right call here

PS:  ask for the homemade chili oil"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, considering I visit this restaurant atleast once every two weeks. 

I absolutely love this cute little pizzeria, they have the kindest staff and I love watching my pizza being made. They use fresh, and quality ingredients (ooh the cheese ) 

My personal favorite is the mild Italian sausage pizza and the margarita pizza. I could have them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
I highly recommend this place to everyone and don't think twice- just order the cannoli, it's worth the calories."}
{"text":"not bad. tiramisu is not really the classic way though. Pizzas are good, size is enough for one person"}
{"text":"The pizza is great - oven baked and quick.  Chewy crust, fresh toppings, lots of variety.  Each pizza is the right size for an adult - we had no problem downing each of our pies.  The only problem is that this place is *always* crowded.  Whenever I pass by, both lunch and dinner, the restaurant is not only full but there's a line out the door.  This is a good sign for the quality of the food, but when we ate there, it was crowded and loud, and I was hoping for a more relaxing lunch.  I recommend the pizza here, the service was good and quick, but this place may be \"hot\" for awhile, which likely means it'll be crowded and rowdy for awhile.  If you're not into crowds, maybe get the pizza for takeout - it'll still be worth it."}
{"text":"Came with two colleagues to try out the newly opened locale on Peel. Arrived at 12:05 and was told that there were no spaces available for three persons. Waited for about 20 minutes to finally sit down at a crammed space probably originally designed for two. Had the daily lunch special which is a small salad and a choice of either the salami pizza or the pizza du jour. Ingredients were fresh, taste was good and price was right. Next time I'll just make sure to arrive a few minutes before noon."}
{"text":"Not your typical greasy, high calorie pizza joint. If you want fresh, healthy ingredients on your pizza, this is it! The crust is crisp on the outside and chewy in the center, different from New York style but stands up on its own. Definitely, a must-try if you're in the downtown/McGill and wants a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've had in my life. The one with arugula. 
Was a pizza Bianca (no tomato sauce) but didn't say so on the menu, it didn't nearly have enough toppings for the size and the dough was burnt. So most bites were plain burnt dough with a bit of arugula leaves. 
Also the waiter wouldn't bring us our bill, probably hoping we would order drinks, and took another 30min to make us pay. 
Will never go back."}
{"text":"Very good wood oven pillow-soft edge and thin crust Margherita pizza, good tangy sauce served still moist with fresh basil added at the end."}
{"text":"Ideal place to go to if you want to enjoy a wood oven pizza downtown. The restaurant is cozzy and casual and servers mainly pizzas. They have a nice selection of tasty pizzas. The pizzas are not very big, however the dough is really soft and the ingredients and toppings are top quality."}
{"text":"The real Naples pizza in Montreal!!! Going back for sure! Only a little thing is: in Italy is not ground pepper on the pizza please take it off. ;-)"}
{"text":"Nothing to say! Amazingly good pizza, especially the ricotta !!! And the Nutella pizza in dessert is to die for !"}
{"text":"The pizza here is phenomenal. Stopped by three times in the week I was staying at the Residence Inn next door and that alone says how much I liked it, because I don't like to repeat restaurants while traveling. I got a pizza to go all three times and literally waited no more than five minutes each time. The reasons for the four stars instead of five is if you do order to go and wait, the only place to really wait is right in front of the door or on a lone bar stool next to the door (so if there is more than one person waiting, you are basically standing next to someone's table). This is such a small complaint though. The slight inconvenience of waiting is far outweighed by the awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Another solid Montreal find!  This was right next to our hotel, and we walked past it probably 6 times before we said, why not get a couple pizzas and salad after a long day of running around and take it easy.  

We got an arugula (roquette) and a margarita with sausage and a nice big dinner salad.  90 seconds in their oven blistered the crust and melted the cheese just perfectly.  

The girl behind the counter was really nice and, while we took ours to go, the small dining room was decorated very nicely and looked comfortable.  The whole place was a little warm.  Wasn't an issue in April, but that oven might make it extra toasty come summer."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. I called to make a reservation for four and was told I didn't need one.  Showed up and was asked if I had a reservation. Obviously, I did not since I was just told I didn't need one. The man with the \"pornstache\" and the keys to the kingdom declared he couldn't do anything. So I took my hungry family and left. If you can't get your story straight or have the guts to say you don't want kids in your restaurant you aren't worth my time or money. The pizza is probably good but the people aren't."}
{"text":"Excellent oven with he perfect temp to provide and produce some awesome pizza! Highly recommend this place for some vegan or meat selections!"}
{"text":"Such a cool pizza spot!! It's trendy, right in downtown and very authentic. 

I came on a weekday for dinner and got seated right away. It's small, but they do have enough seating. I imagine this place gets busy on the weekends. 

Ordered a classic margherita pizza and it was delicious. They have plenty of other pizza choices well, everyone will be pleased here!  

It was prepared in an authentic oven and has brilliant charcoal-ing. The cheese to sauce ratio was also perfect - not too heavy and not too stingy on the ingredients. 

The sauce was also nice. My friend who got just the marinara version appreciated the freshness of the ingredients as did I. 

The ambience was great too...full of charm and quirks. A bit on the smaller side in terms of seating but it was still comfortable. The music choice was a bit odd though (playing the billboard hits for a quaint Italian restaurant seemed odd to me). Nonetheless a nice pizza spot for a fine meal."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night with a group of 7 friends. We made a reservation which was a good idea considering the restaurant is pretty tiny. Though it was small, the restaurant is cozy with high tables and chairs, mirrored walls and a candle on every table. 

I initially wasn't really in the mood for pizza (ironic choice of restaurant eh) but my friend convinced me that it would be a crime to order a salad. I ended up ordering the plain cheese pizza (I forget the name in the menu). The pizzas we ordered all came out at the same time and all looked delicious. Mine looked so good, I couldn't wait to take a picture of it so the picture attached to this review is actually my friend's pizza.

The ingredients used were high quality and my pizza was cooked perfectly. A few of my friends found their crust to be over cooked but mine was perfect. The spicy oil they serve is excellent!

Our waiter was friendly and attentive and was quick. Overall yummy, affordable and somewhat healthy place for a pizza (not fast food)

{"text":"I've been to Naples and I was trying to find something that would be close to the real thing. I was excited when I read the menu and I actually enjoyed the pizza, however the only downer is that there wasn't enough Mozzarella Buffala in my pizza, I know it's expensive, but still, it needs more. The rest was excellent, can't complain, I'm sure I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I love love love pizza and this pizza place does not disappoint! It was empty when I first got there but it filled up very quickly. I had the prosciutto pizza (olive oil, parmesan, oregano, mozzarella di Bufala, tomatoes, arugula). What stood out for me was how good the crust was!! I don't usually like crust but this one was doughy but not thick... it was almost stringy and it tasted great! It was like eating naan bread. For those of you who like it spicy I warn you that their chili oil is not spicy at all."}
{"text":"I had the classic margarita and parmesan fondue. My friend had the same. It was good but i felt something was missing. It was little over burnt at the ends. I even told the person who served us about that. Otherwise it was good. Parmesan roti fondue was more like a dip and not fondue. the bread was really good."}
{"text":"Bonne pizza pour emporter ou sinon à manger sur place. Même concept, même compagnie que sur Bernard à Outremont. Petit local sur la rue Peel, environ 15 places assises max. Déco moderne classique. Prix corrects. J'ai pris une pizza margherita (9$) pour emporter, super bonne, croute mince, délicieuse. Elle fût prête en 5 minutes. Ils ont plusieurs sortes de pizzas; saucisse italienne douce (13$), prosciutto (15$), pancetta épicée & figues (17$). Spécial du midi 11h30@16h lundi au vendredi, 12$ salade césar ou roquette + pizza margherita ou salami bio ou pizza du jour. Bien sûr, ils ont du vin, rouge, blanc ou rosé pour accompagner avec les pizzas. Ils ont aussi de la bière en bouteilles et des vins mousseux (bulles). Ils ont quelques desserts, cannoli (5$), tiramisu (6$) ou pizza Nutella (5$). Ils font aussi livraison (514-303-0334) qui sera opérationnelle d'ici un mois. Le resto était remplit à capacité en début de soirée, étant donné que c'était la journée d'ouverture (23 juin 2016). Je reviendrais pour sûr, essayer une autres de leurs pizzas. 

5/5 visité en juin 2016."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a friend today, as I've been meaning to try their pizza since they opened. Unfortunately, my experience was quite negative.

Before I explain, I'd like to say that the pizza was amazing! Additionally, that was one of the best, if not the best, gluten-free crusts I've ever had. The ingredients were also super fresh. I have nothing bad to say about the food whatsoever.

Much to my dismay, the service was lacking. I ordered a gluten-free pizza with no cheese (I am vegan, but this is mostly due to allergies and dairy happens to be one of them). When my pizza came it looked like there was a bit of cheese on it, so I double checked with the waiter. He assured me that it wasn't cheese, and wouldn't ask the kitchen to confirm. I then proceeded to pick a bit of it off, and ate about 1/4 of the pizza. Even though I haven't eaten cheese in ages, I knew there was cheese on it. Moreover, I began to feel ill. I called on the server again and told him. Once again, he argued with me and said there was no cheese. I'd like to emphasize the fact that I, on several occasions, stressed the fact that I had an allergy, which is why I was being so cautious. The server didn't seem bothered by that whatsoever. I finally convinced him to take the pizza and ask the kitchen. As you can probably guess, I was right. The pizza did have cheese. They made me a new one, and I barely even got an apology, or a discount or anything to makeup for such a huge mistake on the restaurant's part. In addition, I dropped by a few days ago to get a pizza for takeout, and they were out of the gluten-free crust, so if you have a gluten allergy, I would double check before ordering.

Honestly, I was extremely disappointed. I would have given this establishment 5 stars if it wasn't for the service. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Service is good and ambiance is good too. I like that you can see your pizza get prepared in front of you since its an open kitchen. I went to italy many times and i love pizza...the quality of the ingredients is excellent, the preparation of the pizza also. The only thing lacking is the generosity of the toppings and the sauce. Some bites felt like toasted bread."}
{"text":"Very tasty and they have excellent wine. A little pricey, but it is worth it. Especially if your parents are paying."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong going there at anytime. Went with a friend who recommended the place. Loved the decor and atmosphere, hip and clean with bright tile work and warm wood everywhere. Arrived at around 9pm and light were perfectly dim and music at a very respectable level (do all hip new places have to be loud?). We were rapidly seated at a counter for drinks and moved to a table minutes afterwards. 

Ordered the Margarita (9$) and Salami (11$) pizzas, both were delicious. Crispy crust, fresh toppings. Also had their Aperol spritz, which was decently priced also and well balanced. Finished off with their Nutella pizza. Man that thing is decadent. Eat half and bring the rest home for a treat later before bed ;-)

Service is equally as good. Props to each and every person of the staff.

A must try downtown or elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet Sunday evening. The ambience and lighting were pleasant enough. The combinations of ingredients on the pizza were interesting, to say the least. I can't say I'm ever really pleased to have just roughly chopped raw romaine lettuce sprinkled on top of my speck pizza, which, as I was reminded by my gracious server, was smoked prosciutto. My partner and I were also perplexed by the giant chunks of jalapeno and green onion (?) on the mild Italian sausage pizza: if it's meant to be mild, then why spice it up anyway? I suppose I should commend them on cooking their pizza all the way through (here's looking at you, neighbouring competitor who shan't be named), but I would've liked a denser, more burnt crust. Both pizzas could have definitely used more of their actual namesake toppings on top of them, but that's just me. Also, it is kind of a turn-off when the waiter reminds you that the tip isn't included in your bill at the end of your meal... Overall, I've had better for the price range, gratuity or no (once again, looking at you unnamed neighbouring competitor)."}
{"text":"Awful. Our pizzas were cold, they didn't wash the salad prior serving, the beer was flat. This place is not clean at all, the floor is full of garbage and the table was not clean. We tell the waitress but she was on her cellphone. Just don't go."}
{"text":"Had the buratta and the pizza that has a whole lotta lettuce on it (forgot what it's called). The buratta was decent, but the serving is small. The pizza was ok, too much lettuce. It's like having a plain salad on your pizza. I actually didn't realize it had lettuce when I ordered, I thought it was a classic prosciutto and arugula pizza, but it's lettuce. So it's odd having the bland crunchy salad on a perfectly fine pizza. The place is kind of cute. I was on a work trip in my downtime, so i sat alone facing the street. Convenient."}
{"text":"They don't take reservations, so you might have to wait a bit to get a table. 

The restaurant is small but really cute! 

In terms of food, this is one of the best pizzerias I have been to. I started off with the Mozzarella di Bufala maison à la fleur de sel, which was amazing. The taste was very different than most and so flavorful. I also had a margherita. I'm all about the sauce they used... I just couldn't get enough. 

Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Montréal!"}
