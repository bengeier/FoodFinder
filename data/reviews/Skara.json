{"text":"Not your regular cheap Greek restaurant. They tried to upscale Greek and they succeeded to an extent but not worth the price. Had the chicken, the octopus both were good. The sides were expensive and you need to order sides if not you'll just have whatever proteins you order. Sangria was good as well. 

Worth to check out, too expensive IMO but you be the judge."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and very tasty. The cocktails were crafted with love and equally delicious! We had Fresh Oysters, and fried Calamari which were fantastic. I had Lamb Shank which was fall off the bone tender with a pasta aside that was very good. The Red Wine Sangria was very tasty and the Strawberry Mojito was made with love. :) I was very satisfied with the portion sizes and it was one of the best Mediterranean meals I have had in a long time! The waiter Esteban was very nice and attended to our every wish, and the hostess Katarina was great! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Great service. Friendly staff. Skara chicken was delicious. Chicken combo dish was also excellent. Side dish of potatoes was plentiful. Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"The first time I came to this restaurant I loved it. They were attentive with our table, maybe because not of people were here. Came today, to celebrate my parents 50th wedding anniversary! My brother advised them of the occasion. No mention when we arrived. 

Waiter was busy attending other tables and forgot about what we asked a few times. Never refilled our water once yet refilling everyone else's on the terrace.

The seafood platter for 4 we ordered was sub par and the lobster tail and jumbo shrimp was dry. He came back to our table half an hour later to check how we were, when we finished! Not happy. Will not be coming back! I am sad that I recommended my parents to come here!

When we asked for the bill it took them another half an hour to bring it"}

{"text":"Dans le 10/30.a midi.beau decor,service impeccable.restaurant d'inspiration grecque,méditerranéenne.bel effort au niveau des vins,mais on n'est pas la pour les découvertes,donc le vin résine et l'ouzo sont absents.les entrées sont classiques,les plats et les desserts aussi.un certain manque de fraicheur(bcp de produits congelés,m'a t il semble).en somme:des bémols quant à la nourriture,mais une visite agreable.la table d'hôte est plus chère que chez milos?"}
{"text":"Splendide resto. Serveur attentionné et très professionnel. Le menu est simple, belle carte des vins. Spécialités de la mer. Prix un peu élevé mais ça vaut la peine pour une bonne bouffe."}
