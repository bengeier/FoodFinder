{"text":"Went on a weekday evening for dinner. The place was almost empty except for a few people at the bar area.  The interior of the restaurant was designed with a lodge cabin theme and was cute and comfortable. The food was typical pub food and fairly priced. I ordered a burger with fries which turned out ok, but the bun was way over buttered and greasy. I would recommend asking for any kind of sandwich bread to be lightly buttered. I'm giving this review an extra star than what I think it deserves due to our server Misty - she did a great job!"}
{"text":"Worst bar ever!  Place was practically empty, and the bartender still took forever to come take our order.   He flat out ignored us for awhile, even.    We ordered white wine.  Cheapest, most disgusting garbage ever.  I haven't had wine that bad since I was 18 on a military base in England getting drunk with a bunch of broke airmen...myself being equally broke and boozing on a budget.   Awful all around.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed today. Been coming here for months and now the same older woman bartender kept trying to tell me that I owed money on our tab when we had played $100 for 4 drinks. $20 per drink.. I think I'm doing that math right. Sorry to have to take one of my favorite off my list, but after her attitude, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best bar/food I've had in Las Vegas.  Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Second time we have eaten lunch here and once again we were impressed. Great service by the bartender/waitress.  The food came out quick,  hot and cooked exactly how we asked. The onion rings are great! Super crispy and huge! Don't go here if you are not very hungry,  the portion sizes are enormous!!    Sorry folks you can't take your kids here either, but that is a good excuse to have an adults only meal.   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Cedric is the best bartender. Always great service and entertaining. They have an internet jukebox and a full menu. They also offer breakfast anytime. Gamblers bonus bar so you get the fun bonuses. Saturday nights they have a band."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved into the area and were looking for a new neighborhood bar for our weekly date night. We went in on a weekday late afternoon during happy hour.  My first thought was wow it's hidden, but I really like the atmosphere inside. We got a bbq chicken pizza and it  was great. Our only complaint is that the bartender all but ignored us. He seemed like a nice enough guy by his interactions with the 4 other patrons who were obviously regulars. But, I was only able to get 2 refills and my husband only got 1 while we were there. We would have stayed longer if we had gotten better service, we might have even become regulars. We might give it another try on a different day or shift."}
{"text":"Try the BBQ Burger. Also, try the Redwood and/or Big Sky martinis. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was terrible. Our server Jennifer was friendly and outgoing. For example, fajita tacos, with canned pinto beans....everything seemed to come from a can. The best thing was our server Jennifer.  Thank you Jennifer :)"}
{"text":"Great show on Saturday night but the worst service you can imagine.  The only bright spot is that you are guaranteed to not leave drunk because they will not serve you.  I do find it interesting that they will pay somebody to pick up your empty glass yet they won't send somebody to ask if you want a refill..."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Bartender Jim was rude and evasive. Ordered a cheeseburger-standard bar food. It was cold in the middle and the bun was soggy. I asked for ketchup twice and finally had to just get it myself. We ordered another shot and he never made it. By this time I was so irritated we asked for the check. That took another 10 minutes. Jim just walking around the bar in circles pretending to be busy. I tried Joey's once and will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is great. The tables were clean and staff was attentive.  We just stopped in for some burgers and fries.  No complaints at all! Burger was cooked medium as I had requested and my Gfs was well done.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer. Tasty burgers, a quiet, laid back atmosphere, and comfy big lounge chairs. Great place to relax or unwind, grab a social bite or drink.  On the downside, it's a little hard to give someone directions because it's tucked behind a few other places, and the liquor selection is a little slim."}
{"text":"Went to the \"jam\" last night. Pretty bad. Not so much the musicians but the general overall presentation of the show. Really, really bad sound quality. Really bad acoustics in the room. Really bad mix. Really bad lighting. It is a shame because the idea has merit. It is just that the execution was terrible. It didn't seem that most of the players were performing for the audience. They were there to feed their egos. Why is it that these decent players don't understand stage presence or actually listen to their end product with a critical ear? When you throw a bunch of good players together in a lousy setting, it equals lousy. There was one good act that sounded great (not the house band - their set was boring and sounded horrible). Unfortunately after they played a couple songs they got quickly ushered from the stage in favor of a really bad amateur act that looked and sounded like they just rolled out of bed. We went there expecting a showcase and found a garage band rehearsal. Had to leave because it went downhill quickly.  I heard that it used to be better when there was a different host. I don't know about that but I know I won't be back under current conditions. Seems like yet another case of management that doesn't care about quality entertainment as long as they are selling drinks. Very sad."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed with the bartender tonight. This is my neighborhood bar and I come about once a month.  I usually gamble $20-$100 when I'm there. Tonight I came in to meet some friends. I sit at the bar and put $20 in. I lost $10 within 2 minutes, but won it back a few minutes later. I was up and down all night. Getting as low as $1.25 and as high as $25. I was up and down for more than an hour. I got 2 beers comped. When he asked if I wanted a 3rd beer and I said yes assuming it was going to be comped. He said that I was going to be charged because I was not playing enough and not at max bet. The thing is, I was playing max bet and continuously playing with stopping for a minute occasionally to talk to my friends. I guessed that I bet close to $80 when all was said and done. What upset me was that I told him that I was playing continuously and betting the max yet he tried saying I wasn't. I'm not mad that he wanted to charge me for the beer, I mad that he was basically calling me a liar.  He also did not mention to my buddy that it was buy one get one during happy hour when he ordered a beer from the bar. The waitress told him that it was happy hour. So when he tried to get his free beer the bartender said he couldn't because it was past happy hour. My buddy said that he ordered his first beer before happy hour, but the bartender said why didn't you tell me you knew about the happy hour, not knowing that he didn't know about when he ordered. The bartender should have told him about and and not blamed him."}
{"text":"Victor is the coolest bartender. A place when you just want to be alone w your girl.....away from the hoopla. Buy the way great fish and chips. Awsome"}
{"text":"Good food, relaxed vibes, but the place is kind of unsanitary. They don't seem to clean their tables very often. But the food really makes up for everything. I got the Grilled Sourdough Melt and was thoroughly surprised with the quality of the food. The beverages are fresh and they serve you mixed drinks if you ask for it. Very friendly place. Will be back."}
{"text":"Highly surprised and impressed. Thought we'd grab breakfast here instead of the very packed Dennys in the same parking lot.  The food was really good!  Had a Club Omelet.  All the veggies were fresh including the large sliced avacado on top.   The omelet was enormous and couldn't possibly have held anymore bacon.    The staff was polite, the restaurant clean and the prices really fair for the amount and quality of food we were given. Skip Dennys folks....try this place. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"It's a simple place with gaming and bar food.  My boyfriend said the chicken wings were good and I liked the onion rings.  The waitress was very nice and personable.  They had great beer specials as well."}
{"text":"My bf and I love this place! We always get great service, strong drinks, and great food :) we come here almost every Saturday and have never been disappointed. Recommend trying their martinis and bloody marys! :)"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch/early dinner with the work wife after taking in a movie.  Nestled in the corner of Craig & Tenaya.  Located in what was once a former Timbers, Joey's has something for everyone.  The service was friendly and seeing how this was last day I gave a S&*$ about calories, I was prepared to stuff myself.  I ordered a burger and split a pizza and chugged down a few beers.  The server was a very nice lady.  All in all a solid three star experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the cozy chairs. I go there often with friends for snacks and pool, the bar food is great from what my friends say, I've only eaten the cheese sticks; and zero complaints on those. Pool tables and a decent selection of booze. Staff is friendly and makes sure you're comfortable. Great business! Seriously, eat at those chairs!"}
{"text":"Never coming here again!! First of all the service was just awful, had to keep going up to the bar to ask for napkins, water, condiments, etc. Ordered a rum & coke to start off and my drink was WARM and the coke tasted flat. When I told the server, she acted so offended. I then asked for a margarita and it was WARM too and not good at all. For food, I ordered the chicken fingers, which were SO greasy, barely any meat & burnt. We also ordered the combo platter which included nachos, chicken wings & mozzarella sticks. The sticks were hard and salty, the wings had barely any meat and it all tasted terrible. Left feeling so sick."}
{"text":"Joey's, back when it used to be Timbers, used to be my favorite bar in town.  I could walk over the 95 to the restaurant, enjoy a bowl of super delicious chili along with a couple of delicious drinks, and have a great conversation with one of my favorite bartenders, Meredith.    Times change, however.  Joey bought it and eventually stopped serving food late night since the poor choice of allowing bartenders to blast rap and hip/hop music to a crowd that wasn't really fond of it drove a lot of their regulars away, resulting in a loss of funds late night.  So individuals like myself who usually only hang out and drink after eating a meal or during were left disappointed.   Meredith went to day shift, where it's near impossible for me to get with my schedule, but it was frustrating to have someone with such a tremendous personality and a regular customer following to just vanish on her regular crowd.    Their food has some great dishes.  The breakfasts have touches such as onion/pepper/potato mixes in lieu of hash browns and they are seasoned well and a lot of their food is excellent bar food.  As I mentioned before, the chili is really up there.  The portions for soup and salad are on the larger side.  The decor looks like Gaston from Beauty and the Beast had go at the place with antlers all over.  I LOVE the comfy wing chairs.  Super comfortable, although service can be a pinch slow there vs. in the booths.    If you want fast service, sit at the bar or at the side booths, as my general recommendation for this place.   They also offer free wi-fi and have karaoke on Friday nights, which is supposedly hilarious to witness.  Pool tables available as well.  I would give four stars if they offered food late night and if the offered breakfast all day buuuut no go."}
{"text":"Joey's is a bar/grill tucked away in the back of a shopping plaza on Craig and 95. It's not visible from the street but it's behind Tommy's and next to Dennys. We had a restaurants.com coupon for $25 off $50 which is why we chose to eat here. The menu is quite small. It appears at one time there were more items to choose from, but they were blacked out on the menu. The menu consists of soup/salad, burgers/sandwiches, breakfast, and appetizers.   I started with a blue moon. It was on special because it was during a football game. On game days they have food and drink specials so be sure to ask if you go during those times. We decided to order a couple appetizers; chili cheese fries with grilled onions and tomatoes added, and hot wings. I thought the chili cheese fries were just okay. The chili wasn't particularly flavorful and the onions weren't as grilled as I would have preferred. The portion was hearty and more than enough for 2 people. The wings were hot wings nothing special about them. I did like their ranch it was definitely house made.   For our mains we both got burgers. I got the parmesan burger and he got the bbq bacon burger. The BBQ bacon burger was SMOTHERED in bbq sauce and not in a good way. There was so much sauce my bf had to scrape the majority of it off. It was probably a good burger but the sauce really overpowered the other flavors. My burger was good, it was similar to a patty melt except it had mushrooms as well as grilled onions and thousand island sauce. I liked the parmesan bread it came on. After that we still weren't quite at $50 so we checked out the desserts. They only have 3 - brownie, an apple pie and ice cream. Nothing sounded good so we ended up getting a cheesesteak to go and my bf ate it for lunch the next day.   Finally our total was over $50. Even though we had the coupon we paid close to $40 with tax and tip. I don't think I would come back here to eat because of the limited menu selections and the food was just A-OK, but I would stop by again for a drink during games."}
{"text":"Visited Reno's L.V. ROC N SOL All-Stars-Jam last Satuday night. Best Jam in Vegas bar none! Totally off the hook and totally entertaining! Blues, Rock, Funk, Soul, R&B and some of the most talented musicians Vegas has to offer. Check out these names that you'll see at the Jam! Christofield, Bruce Ricerd"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with their tap selection and display. The lounge area is cozy. There are T.V. almost everywhere so you can watch with a nice picture. They have up to 50 drafts available! I would stop by frequently to have a beer tasting festival!      There are nice pool tables, dart boards etc. But wait there's more! They have the internet jukebox where there's rarely a song that can't be played if your feeling like music with your booze.     Unfortunately the kitchen has less than average bar food. my friend and I shared the fish platter and country fried steak. I'm gonna be brutally honest, the country fried dinner was disappointing. I've had frozen dinner entrees with just as good of quality. The gravy was plain, the potato was bland, the steak was not battered well."}
{"text":"The food was tasty. Decent selection of beer on tap. Food came out right on time. Very laid back environment, nice local bar to grab a bite and a drink, after work or to just hang out."}
{"text":"I love this place! The people are friendly, the food is good, and the music is AWESOME! Some of the best live music in Vegas in my opinion. Saturday nights there are SO MUCH FUN. I'm not in the club scene here, and I was looking for an older crowd and a friendly atmosphere. This place is exactly that. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved it! Went there Monday night to check out the North Vegas 49ers Faithfuls and I had a great time. I ordered a pizza and wings, which were football special ax so the price was right for sure. The tap beer was cold and well priced and the staff was friendly and attentive even though the place was packed and they were super busy. Overall, I had a great experience and I'll be back for football on Sunday."}
{"text":"Saturday nights are very chill! Live house band at 9 and then a cover jam band comes on about 10:30. Affordable drinks with live entertainment - always a good time. The bartenders are quick and take care of everyone!"}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another chance.....Bad idea. It smelt like the sewer system was backed up in there. AGAIN we were the ONLY ones in there. It took well over 40 minutes to get our food and that is including the time it took for them to remake our food because it was undercooked. The Health Department was in there and we should have left as soon as their A rating dropped to a B but since I work in the food business I understand that a B isn't necessarily a bad thing. All in all I really don't think they deserve my money a third time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, plays blues and jazz bands on the weekends. I haven't got to try they're food yet but I've heard nothing but good things about it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years and we feel like family. The food is good and the service is always friendly. And now they feature a great craft beer selection."}
{"text":"I love this place. Joe, Tomorah, Dylann, Nick, Josh, plus all those I haven't mentioned, are SO delightful every time I visit. Love you guys!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to this exit and I must say that this is now my favorite spot. I have been a handful of times, and will continue to return. The staff is always very friendly and quick to refill, the machines are pretty good, and the food and beer choices are great after a long night of work. My brother is on town, and we will certainly stop by. ----also, the food is on point, Excellent bar food (the wings are the best)."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Both times for beer and food.  The first time was on a Thursday night and the special was $2 for a fajita taco.  Oh, what a taco it was.  The meat had enormous flavor.  There was onion, bell pepper, and cheese.  There was sour cream and salsa on the side.  Delicious.   And the beer kept coming.  Actually, I didn't really want the beer at the time.  But hey, who am I to refuse what was poured for me.  Besides, it was still happy hour.  The next time I went back I had a coupon for a free pitcher of beer.  So my roommate and I went.  We got a pitcher of Bud Light (a $12 value come to find out) and some food.  He got the fish and chips.  I got the Western Style Philly.  The meat on that sandwich was so good.   I wish there had been more of it.  It taste like the steak I would make at home.  That is a good thing, by the way.  I got my sandwich with coleslaw.  Looking at the fries sitting across from me with a plate of fish I started wishing I had ordered the fries.  The coleslaw was fine.  It seemed to be very fresh.  The fries would have been more filling though.  Eh, live and learn.  Anyhow, the service has been good each time I've been in.  The waitress this last time was joking wih us about how the Shock Top is so damned good the owner wont even serve it. LOL.  I'm starting to like Joey's.  The food, the beer, the service and especially the music.  I love classic rock."}
{"text":"3rd shift crew is always on point Bryan and Matt always good conversation and always ready to pour another! plus they pay out nicely!"}
{"text":"Nick is by far the best bartender in Vegas behind Chance \"Boom Son\" Weber. You should come see Nick if you're having a good night or even a bad night. Either way it ends well."}
{"text":"Although I have yet to win anything playing their machines I can say that the food here is great! 2 breakfasts here to date and tonight was a doozie!! Get the garlic chicken pizza. Just do it. It is amazing!! Best pizza ever!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with some friends.  My friends were an hour delayed in meeting me, and some super nice bartenders kept me company. They offered to change the channels on the TV - a simple thing to ask, but something bartenders never offer. They made stiff drinks and refilled quickly.  I thought the food was great. I ordered a chicken southwest salad (can't remember the name on the menu), and it was gigantic. Super fresh. Only thing I would've liked was if the iceberg lettuce was mixed with something a bit more hearty and green (spinach, mixed greens, etc.).  They have a jam band that plays every Saturday that took the stage around 9ish. I loved the vibe. They take requests, they play hits, and anyone can take the stage with an instrument or a voice as long as you sign in first. They were super fun and audience engaged.  For two gigantic liquor drinks and a HUGE salad, my total was only $20. I consider that a deal!  Tip for the antisocial: The singer/MC does come out into the audience and converse with you on the microphone, so if you hate audience interaction, don't sit up in the stage area.  Frankly, I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews. I got great and friendly service from the bar staff, the food came out super quick, and it had a nice and relaxed vibe about it.  And yes, this place used to be a Timbers, but I got better service and better quality than I ever got at any of the local Timbers. Delete review"}
{"text":"We've driven by the shopping center housing Joey's Tavern at least 100 times and never knew it existed.  Restaurant.com made us an offer we couldn't refuse, especially since we had several certificates to trade in from other defunct places.  This is a big joint, and on this night it was almost empty at the large gaming bar,  and totally empty in the dining room at 9:00 p.m.  Getting a table was a piece of cake, but we were here for dinner, not dessert.  The dining room was dreary:  brown benches against starkly empty lighter brown walls without a hint of decoration, surrounding brown tables and chairs in the center.  It was depressing, made more so by the absence of other customers.  I wanted to pick up a paintbrush and go Jackson Pollack on those walls.  But then I took a walk to survey the rest of the place.    The far opposite end had a few pool tables and some pub tables, and some decoration that made it a 180 from its cohort on the other side.  But the central bar area had some comfy booths with color, the flashing lights from the TVs, and the view of booze bottles.  We switched, and it made an instant difference.  The menu was disappointing, since a third of the items were inked out, which made it hard to find something to order.  And if we wanted to use that certificate we had to spend $50 bucks!  Ah, the life of a couponing diner is tough.  Finally, we settled on a chicken quesadilla appetizer, a bowl of tortilla soup and a side salad for Herb, fish and chips for his entree, and grilled tilapia for me.  The quesadilla was terrific, full of tender and meaty chicken, bacon, cheese and avocado.  The tortilla soup was a huge bowlful.  It had a lot of chicken and canned chopped tomatoes, but was lacking spice, avocado, and substance.  It was very watery, and had no relation to the beloved tortilla soup of my Mexico past life. The tortilla strips were served on the side. Salad was ordinary iceberg with two kinds of cheese and some chopped tomatoes.  Nothing special, and it was missing the croutons I think the menu had specified, but the tortilla strips did double duty.  For the entrees, the fish of the \"Fish and Chips\" was good, though the chips weren't well done, as asked for.  My tilapia dish had two pieces of the fish, a lot of rice, and a veggie mix.  When I see those crinkle-cut carrots, I know they came out of a freezer bag.  Unfortunately, half of that portion apparently didn't make it into the pot, because it was still frozen.  I was already full from my quarter of the quesadilla and the pint of Angry Orchard I was chugging down, so I didn't make a big deal out it, knowing those veggies would live to be reheated - or heated - another day.  The fish was perfectly cooked, though, and well-seasoned, even if that, too, came out of a freezer.  Our waiter/bartender, Joey, gave us excellent service.  There's a good chance we'll return.  Though they'll probably have to let me decorate the main dining room in order to do that.  I work for food. :)"}

{"text":"1-19-18~Playing catch up on my reviews.  When the Golden Knights are away we go places to watch the games. Someone recently recommended Joey' s Tavern. We got lucky and came during happy hour. Great prices! Huge screen to watch the game on. There was lots going on. Darts, pool, jukebox just to name a few. Definitely will put this on my list of places to come back to. Friendly staff. Great food! Recommend for games or just hanging out. Try the sliders!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this particular spot since it was Timbers. The one major difference in the change of name and ownership? A shit-ton less pretension. In a city where even the smallest of neighborhood bars can afford to be dickheads and serve the like, Joey's stands out as a comfortable place to sit down and relax after a long day and just talk or play pool or drink. The food is your typical American Continental Bar flair, but not horrible. If you like a bar where everyone knows your name or at least asks it upon entry with a hearty handshake, go here. Because it isn't right next to a major street (about a football field from the 95) outdoor seating would be a great addition!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food. I am appalled at the poor customer service I received for my first time (and last) at this restaurant. I came in with a restaurant.com certificate to try this restaurant. From the moment I told the staff that I had a coupon, their continual comments instantly made me feel degraded. I highly discourage anyone from wasting their time, money, or appetite at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband for the first time a few months ago. When we walked in, it's like everyone knew we've never been there but we decided to try it since we had a Restaurant.com coupon.  The place wasn't busy with 3 other people dining at the bar.  It took over 30 minutes for the waitress to even come around to get our drink orders and when we wanted a few more minutes, that took even longer! The food took long as heck to be delivered and it was okay. It wasn't good but it wasn't the worst food.  I believe the waitress was being fake towards us because it was like she was trying to be nice but you could tell she wasn't happy we were there with our coupon...and she over charged us but my husband just wanted to leave.  We will never, ever come here again."}
{"text":"First time here and I am happy I was invited to Rock and Sol-All-Stars-Jam! The music was amazing. From Blues to Jazz to Soul a little disco and some Rock and Roll. The band was incredible as well as all the singers who performed.  Got there around 930pm and it was not too busy until around 11pm, and than the house started filling up. Lots of drinking and dancing going on, everyone was very nice and easy to be around. Definitely will stop in again!"}
{"text":"So the Hubby and I went there to watch the superbowl. It is normally a niner bar and the husband is a niner fan. and they were supposed to be doing give aways and a special food menu.  When we arrived it was busy but not crazy it was about 2:40 and the game was to start at 3PM. we sat with some friends and when the server came over she completely ignored us. she took orders from everyone else.. now being in the business I understand when your swamped and I give leeway but then when she came back a few times and still acted like we were invisible I was getting pissed. how about an acknowledgement? finally my husband asked her if we could order something to which she replied \"yeah, I'll be right back\" well she came back two more times and never took our order. we went to the bar where we stood and waited I even had money in my hand to give the sign I was in need of a drink yet the bartender took orders from everyone around us again like we were not there. so we went back to the table and still no drink. it was almost the end of the first quarter when our friend waved her down and she finally asked what we wanted I decided to not order as I felt that there was no point in trying to order one round if we may never see her again to get anything else, but my husband did order a Kahlua and cream. I got up left and went to Denny's next door to order a soda and brought it back. when I arrived it was the second quarter and my husband still didn't have his drink. when he asked about it for the second time her answer was \"I am waiting on the bar\", not sorry, or I will go check, nope she just brushed him off.  finally he got his drink she walked over and just put it in front of him and walked of without a single word, and I had to laugh because the drink wasn't even full.  Now one of our table mates placed an order for a Capt. and coke when it finally arrived she literally leaned over knocking in to my leg reached her arm across my face and flipped her hair in to my face, put the drink down and walked off. I WAS PISSED!  By this time it was half time so I got up and went to Albertsons to get a snack cause I was not ordering shit from this place. Now before I left I made a post about the bad service on their Facebook page and apparently the server had so much time on her hands since she was not waiting on tables to read this post and came to the table looking for me, when I got back she came up and said \" listen if you want beers and shots I am here\" to which I told her \"you ignore us this whole time but now all of a sudden you have time\"? don't think so.  so the whole game I spent running back and forth to Denny's for refills so we could have drinks, and I got to watch the server and the owner basically trip over themselves to wait on the 10 Seahawk fans that were at a table right behind us I guess my money wasn't green enough.  what a joke this place is I have never been in a bar where you could not get a drink. trust me there are plenty of bars in Vegas so I will never have to set foot in this rat hole again."}

{"text":"The food is good I got a bbq chicken pizza and side of fries.   The pizza was ok -- It came with raw onions and I am not a big fan of those on pizza's if they where caramelized onions it would have tasted better, because of the sauce and onion just left a raw taste in mouth. I like the idea of a breaded chicken part for the bbq chicken that was a good idea.   ok on fries they where steak fries -- I am not a fan of these at all, they tend to get cold fast and then become soggy witch happened. Maybe change up to shoe string fries or seasoned fries   Thankfully with my name is joey lol I would like to at least give this place a second try and see what they can do. They are cheap on prices witch is nice but sometimes there is a off set in price vs food."}
