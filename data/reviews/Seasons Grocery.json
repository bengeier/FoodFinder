{"text":"Most of the staff here is very rude, ESPECIALLY the older woman with the long blonde hair. They never say hello, and forget about receiving a thank you or have a nice day. I ordered a iced chai tea from the bakery area and it was the worst! I also got a very small muffin that was more than $4.00 and tasted like cardboard. Aside from all of that, the store is very charming and in a beautiful location. Other than the the produce and bakery, the prices are decent.  Please work on your staff learning basic customer service skills.... and get rid of the nasty, blonde haired older woman"}
{"text":"Why are all these reviews bitter this place is awesome I go here everyday and I get great service from both young ladies that work at night. All these negative people need to jump in the lake with ankle weights."}
{"text":"A wide variety of upper scale pastries and food. Their meats are great friendly service.   Smaller location but pack full of everything you"}
{"text":"Seasons Market is a great place, especially if you need last minute items or want a treat.  It's a great addition to Lake Las Vegas and they have specialty cheeses and other items you cannot find in a regular market.  They have the best ice cream that markets don't carry and it's a big tub for $4.99, with specialty flavors.  The staff are all very friendly and are always willing to help.  Sometimes they have free wine tastings which are always a treat.  Walk outside and there's plenty of seating with a lakeside view.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"A grocery store that ORGANIC + non-gmo items as well as your regular conventional brands. In terms of Organics/natural/non-gmo they have That's it bars, organic peanut butter, oats, cereal, coconut milk, almond milk, lentils, chicken breast, frozen peas, mango and pineapple and more! Stoked to see such a great natural food range. I hope they get some organic chocolate, candy and chips in soon"}
{"text":"Love this market!  My husband and I live at the lake and this saves us so many trips \"into town\" :-). The selection is great, prices are decent and staff is so friendly.  If there's something they don't carry that you're looking for they will order it- so nice!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Lake Las Vegas, a convenient option for residents and Lake hotel guests. Dedicated parking reserved for Market customers only. Newly renovated, very clean, and exceptionally courteous and engaging staff. Great prepared foods, meat and cheese section, coffee bar, as well as fresh juicing machine. Good wine and organic food selection. Has all the necessities you would want from a grocery store...and dropping off dry cleaning here at the Mint Lockers takes 60 seconds. Will continue to visit regularly."}
{"text":"For a tiny store, Seasons grocery is impressive! They offer fresh desserts, pastries, coffee -cold or hot with non dairy options and great tea's too! Season's is a small scale grocery with most everything you need!  Including: beer, wine, liquor, nuts, candy, frozen and fresh foods, produce, sunscreen, clothing and so much more! Always Friendly staff, also offering drop off/ delivery dry cleaning!"}
{"text":"Good selection, pricing comparable to a vons or Albertsons (if not cheaper), and good coffee made to order. Nice to have this little grocery store here in Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Sep 19, 2016  Customer service: One star  Great little store for the area since there isn't much around.  First time visiting the store & as soon as I walked in, the two employees were too busy talking amongst themselves to even greet me with at least a hello. After walking around the store for a couple of minutes they didn't even bother asking if I needed anything. When I went to check out not even a \"did you a find everything alright?\". Once I payed for my stuff not even a \"have a good day\". They were to eager to keep having a conve  They did have Vegan ice cream  & plant based milks"}
{"text":"This isn't a market where you can do your weekly grocery shopping but none the less it was badly needed at LLV.  It's obvious it should survive based on how busy it has become on the weekends and during special events.  I stopped here on 3/18/2017 about 6:00pm (day after St. Patrick's) and the check-out line was non-stop with most customers purchasing just a few items.   So the wait to pay could get long on busy weekends especially with just one clerk.  Dedicated parking is available but I doubt all parking here are in the store.  Security was parked across from the parking spots but his location actually made it more difficult to utilize the spaces since it's narrow already.  I guess he wanted to intimidate folks not to go over the allotted time of 30 minutes.  Anyway, I was browsing near one of the double doors along the lake side of the building and 2 men entered and walked past me into the stock room.  I received unwanted attention from the 2nd man walking past me.  Then I noticed the back of his shirt said \"marina employee\".  So I don't know if he worked at the marina or he's just a fan.   Having the Mint self-serve cleaners at this location is really great and is an added plus to this new store.  I wish them much luck!"}
{"text":"This place is very nice.  They have a great selection of cheeses and wines, and also most of the main groceries you would need to make a nice diner.  Also their produce is nice and fresh.  I live in the area and come here a lot.  I strongly recommend this place if you want to grab some great to go stuff or enjoy a cup of coffee in their sit down area."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time this evening.  Definitely recommend it. Has a wide selection of items, decent prices. Great staff. You can park in their nearby lot for 30 minutes while you shop. There's indoor & outdoor seating. I'm planning on grabbing coffee and a pastry there for breakfast one of these days..."}
{"text":"Returned THREE rotten salads. They were 50% off, but that's not an excuse for selling rotten food. When my husband returned to the store for exchange, they made sure he was charged the other 50% of the price. WTH. They sold ROTTEN , STICKY food. And when the customer returned for an exchange they should've said SORRY, and give us the good ones for FREE OF CHARGE.  Don't go to this store. We'll never return."}
{"text":"Visiting friends here who walk their dog about a mile to the market every morning for coffee. The almond croissant is definitely worth the walk. It is a friendly environment with a great view and outdoor tables as well as comfortable indoor chairs.  Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of groceries, meats and fruits. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. They have fresh pastries and cakes. Surprisingly, the prices are competitive with national chains. And to boot they have some rare pokemons in the store :)"}
{"text":"Great new market. Just opening do working out all the plans. Prices are reasonable, selection limited but high in quality. Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"The nasty lady who manages/runs this place is probably a big reason why the whole area is so depressed and lonely.  More than 50% of the stores in this town are shuttered and it could be because of nasty women like her.  There are gates where there shouldn't be and when I tried to walk over one of them she bum rushes me.  But the worst thing about it is, rather than complaining to the dweebs who erect gates that stall business from coming into this area, the lady from this grocery store runs out and yells at people who are trying to shop at her store.    Probably pent up frustration for lack of business, but not a way to treat customers and a poor misdirection of her negative energy.  Talk to your city planner about taking down the gate you nasty toad.  I wish I hadn't spent a dime here, but since there aren't any choices in this ghost town, with 102 degree heat, I bought a diet coke."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not only is it a market (think a bit smaller than Trader Joe's but well stocked) but it also has a coffee/pastry shop encompassed in it. Furthermore, you can grab some coffee, wine, and picnic food and eat it out on the floating (and covered!) dining area on the lake (which we did!). Quite a unique experience. Customer service and the food were also excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood market. Makes vacationing here even better! This was what was really missing as it gives you the chance to grab a quick breakfast or bottles of wine for sitting on balconies admiring the views around here. Hoping Lake Las Vegas continues to make a come back as it's such a good escape from the strip and feels like a real getaway from LA!"}
{"text":"Awesome market away from the big strip. Plenty of whole foods and friendly staff. Of course there's the gorgeous lake view"}
{"text":"I want to love this place because there is not much else around, but the kids that work there  are immature and talk to each other more than they talk to you. Spend some money and get older more mature people to work at the front."}
{"text":"Great staff especially Allyson Plumlee she's very welcoming and friendly and had a great conversation with her and she helped me to the fullest and cant wait to go back in and meet her again and the rest of the crew!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice, clean, and convenient store! I love coming here. They serve pastries and coffees which I really love. I always get the Ã©clair with hot mocha on the side. Super yummy! In addition to that, they have great customer service!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a new store at the Lake! I went here on a scorching afternoon after hearing about the recent grand opening. Lots of groceries including frozen, produce, dairy, etc. Saw lots of gourmet cheeses and forgot to look for caviar, but I have a feeling they have it! Also a liquor section, baked goods case and coffee/espresso drinks. Small seating area is a nice touch as well as a table with a couple stools looking out to the marina! Probably best utilized during their wine tastings. You can grab a cold beer from the display at the center of the store and head out to stroll the Village and ponder the future of Lake Las Vegas. It looks a little brighter now with this new addition to the offerings at the Village!"}
