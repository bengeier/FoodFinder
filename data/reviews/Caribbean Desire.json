{"text":"A personal favorite of mine...  The West Indian soup is my favorite menu item...The pepper sauce that is served is one of my favorites and really compliments everything on the menu.  Very relaxed, casual, clean, friendly atmosphere...nice tv's, good selection at the bar and the service is all you can ask for.  The lunch buffet is a mix of Chinese rice/noodle items and curry...definitely worth visiting if in the Brampton area..."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I was with a friend from Trinibago.  He told me that the interior reminded him of home, and that the food was similar to home as well.  So I'd have to say it's pretty authentic. I ordered the pineapple chicken, and he got the chicken roti.  We were both extremely satisfied with the price, serving sizes, and service.  When we were in the area, we decided to go a second time, and it was hardly as good as the first time. The server had no idea what pineapple chicken I was referring to, despite it being on the menu, and the roti wasn't cooked as well as the first time.  Service was incredibly slow, and after taking the meal home (we ordered take-away) I realized I received some strange concoction of chicken and pineapple.  Not at all similar to what I had received the first time.  I barely had three bites before I was throwing out the rest.  The roti received a similar end as well.  Since that disastrous outing we haven't been back... but I also wouldn't avoid this place.  Great ambiance, and huge portions.  Just a warning though that this place is hit or miss."}
{"text":"This place was quite interesting I must say. The name is Caribbean Desire, however the menu says Caribbean Desire - Chinese Restaurant. Their food was exactly that a mixture of Caribbean and Chinese food.   I ordered the Curry Potato with Rice, Peas and some spring rolls.  The Spring Rolls were the worse spring rolls I have ever encountered. There was seriously no filling and just a roll of crust.   Desire redeemed themselves with the Curry Potato Rice and Peas though. A Huge amount of this curried potato mixed with spices and onions spread across peas and rice. It was definitely great.  So yea... if you're in the burbs of T-dot and want an Asian-Caribbean meal check them out."}
{"text":"My friend and I passed this place on the way to a Caribana party and noticed the Trini and Guyanese flags out front. At about 330 am on our way back we decided to stop. This place was LIVE! SO many West Indians partying and dancing like crazy. The DJ was blasting some really good soca. Everyone was having a good time. The menu had Caribbean and Chinese food. I wanted to try their version of Chinese food but I opted for the Curry Chicken and rice instead. It was DELICIOUS. They gave a generous amount for the price, too. The service was ok. Small place but seemed popular. Loved it, would like to go back if I am ever in Toronto area again!"}
{"text":"We were a group of eight and never got down to ordering our main course. We did order some starters: pepper duck, pepper shrimp, fried fish and jerk chicken. While the food was okay, we found a bunch of hair (not one or two strands! a bunch!). When we pointed it out to the server, she told us that the chef has short hair so that must have been hers that flew in when she passed the big fan on the way!  So that was the end for us. We left and will never return."}
