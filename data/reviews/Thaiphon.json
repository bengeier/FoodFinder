{"text":"Great place.  Had a birthday dinner there a couple of years ago and the owner took really good care of our party of 10.  Probably the best sesame beef in Montreal (hope your palate is ready, though) and everything is cooked to order.  Nice place for a laid-back weeknight date.  Only thing is that I'd rather see some menu items offered in bigger portions, but otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"Friendly Thai restaurant with average prices and a big menu. They've got a lot of seating as well as a take-out option.   The food isn't that special. Some dishes are good, but nothing really mind-blowing - more like regular pan-Asian dishes than rich, flavorful Thai. The soups are pretty good - nothing special about the won tons, but I like both the regular won ton soup and the meal-size won ton with noodles. (Good choice for a cold or rainy day!) The imperial rolls are served hot out of the fryer, nice and crunchy on the outside. The only main dishes I've had that are consistent are the vegetable pad Thai and the beef in black bean sauce. Everything else I've tried is hit or miss, and some of the dishes could have a little more meat in them - I like rice, but I don't plan on ordering it as a main.   The staff are friendly, though: I've been a few times in mid-afternoon and they were happy to take my order even though they were probably tired from the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Such a treasure! The restaurant is fewly populated which makes for a quiet environment. The food is extraordinary and you only have to wait a maximum of 10 minutes for it to arrive. Also great to take-away!! I don't know why so few people come to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Very ordinary place. Food is not bad but not the best out there. Price point is good but portions are a little small but staff is really nice"}
{"text":"service ici??? HORRIBLE! impoli sans raison! je ne retournerai jamais!"}
{"text":"awful. came here on the cold day because we wanted to grab something that was  close to campus. Since I'm a fan of sushi inbox next door, thought i would give Thaiphon a chance (since im a huge fan of thai food).  Upon entering, the price seemed to be pretty full with alot of business people and students, so i figured that it couldnt be very bad. EXCEPT, i was WRONG.    My friends ordered the general tao, chicken pad thai and i had the flat rice noodles with beef. What kind of thai place has general tao on their menu ? The place was clearly owned by chinese people ( no offense cuz i love my chinese people) but the food was just AWFUL. Even the general tao, it was soaked in sauce but the chicken was not crispy at all. The general tao came with rice, a sad little salad on the side (completely bland) and crap tons of sauce with very little chicken pieces. I've had better general tao chicken at thai express. The chicken pad thai was not any better, the noodles were soggy and drenched in sauce with less than 5 pieces of chicken. My rice noodles with beef was the best of the bunch, but not by much. It was very blend and mediocre. again, the pad see ew at Thai Express was way better.  Thaiphon, if you're going to serve chinese food, you might as well do the good job at serving chinese food.  & oh and the price, ranges between $10-15/dish. not horrible but the quality of the food definitely doesn't measure up."}
{"text":"I get takeouts and since knowing this place I've become a regular.  Noodles are generally very good. I'm going through them one by one and so far so good!  The imperial rolls are awesome and spring rolls are OK.  Glad to have this Thai place close by!"}
{"text":"The place is very cozy and well decorated. The service is a little slow, because the owner is both the chef and the waiter of the place. Food tastes great and the portions are fair. The restaurant is a mixed style of Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai cooking. Been there twice, he owner is very friendly and the dining experience was very pleasant.  UPDATE! I recently saw something that disgusted me... I was waiting in line to pay, and saw the chef scoop frying oil directly from the fryer to cook the food.  As a future biochemist, I am absolutely disgusted as I know how much toxic compounds are generated when frying food under high temperature. The oil must be changed after several days as its contents such as polyacrylamide from frying potatoes can cause breast cancers, let alone having the customers to eat it.  TL;DR: The food tastes fantastic, I still hold my opinion on that, but using deep-frying oil to cook my food is just disgusting, and the review remains 1 star (dropped from 4) until something is changed about that."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai food. Take out is great as well. Even though it may be a bit more expensive than Thai-Express the quality is so much better. Owner-operated and you can tell they take pride in preparing their food."}
{"text":"Not very good food, General Tao is hard, no actual chicken; just batter, but is the only option in the area if looking for Asian (Canadian) inspired food."}
{"text":"Was pouring rain and I had to eat something. Was delicious and quick and the lady explained options thoroughly. They take cards which is nice.  3 hours later I have a slight fever and some nausea. It hurts to swallow but I had that from before and the food def didn't help.  Probably wouldn't eat again. Sorry probably thriving business because you're so close to McGill but I feel like crap and it's not fun."}
{"text":"I think this is a good simple straight to the point that place.  Nothing fancy or grand,  but it's one place I love being at with friends and clients alike.  The pad is good and possibly spicy just right."}
{"text":"Based on four star ratings, I went there. The food was sub-standard. Service was fine. Cocoanut milk was not tasty. It is more a Chinese rather than a Thai restaurant. Normal Tom Kha soup was not there. They had a very poor substitution. The chicken and cashew was horrible. The only nice part of the experience was water and cashews. I would never recommend any one. I do not know how any one give a four star rating."}
{"text":"Your average Asian style food with okay service. Bubble tea is too sweet for my Chinese standards but North Americans may appreciate that. Prices are decent for a downtown resto"}
{"text":"Finally came here for lunch with a friend yesterday after walking by this place countless times since I go to school right by it. It's a nice little place and the prices are very very friendly to students. I often see my fellow students in here and hear them talking about it. The food was great. I had a rice platter with chicken and cashews and it was a good-sized portion for the very reasonable price. Service could have been a hair better but was decent. The place doesn't have it's own bathroom so you have to exit out the back into the office building complex where the bathroom is shared by other small businesses. The television in the restaurant is a little distracting but entertaining I suppose. All over, a good place to get decent Thai food for a budget-friendly price. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Thaiphon is this great little shop on Union - really close to McGill University.  The service is very fast and the owners are very friendly. The menu variety is wide. I've had a few things on the menu and they have all been absolutely delicious. It may not be the best Thai food in Montreal but it's pretty great when you're craving something spicy!"}
{"text":"Chinese tuned Thai food. They have tom yum soup and basil fried rice. However, there are bunch of Chinese and Japanese dishes too.  The green color of its decoration is so agree to me.  Just for the connivence and fair price."}
{"text":"I wanted to mix up my usual lunch places and decided to try this one, Lets call it an experiment so I wont feel too bad for paying 12 $ (after tax) for a really bad Pad-Thai.  So I got my Pad-Thai and was extremely hungry, opened the box and said to myself way is the sauce so red ? took the first bite and felt like I am back at age 10 when my mom gave me pasta with ketchup because that was basically what I got. I dont know if they have a very cheap sweat and sour sauce or they added ketchup to the sauce but it sure tasted like that. THIS IS THE WORST PAD-THAI I HAD EVER HAD and I paid 12$ for it...."}
