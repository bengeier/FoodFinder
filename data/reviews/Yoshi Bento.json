{"text":"Really nice staff who do seem to do everything, but unfortunately the sushi was just not good. Oddly almost all of their rolls have crab in them. We asked for custom rolls with no crab (just salmon and avocado), and we should have stuck to the menu because they were rather sub par, fish quality was not great, avocados were hard, and the brown rice was chewy. The rolls that we ordered that were standard off the menu were better, but still not great. Why so much crab? One person at a our table ordered a bento box, and he seemed happy.  So perhaps stick to the hot dishes here!"}
{"text":"I hate writing this review, but I have too. This is my first review for Yelp I have ever done and its a shame it has to be a bad, but factually correct one. I will write more, but I seldom have bad experiences, so have never felt compelled to write another great one  about the many really good restaurants we go too all the time.  My family has eaten at Yoshi's many, many times since he opened the business. He is a really nice guy and the food has always been really good and in large portions. My wife couldn't go, so I took 2 of our kids and a friend of mine. We hadn't been there in months.  The food was terrible and the portions about 30% smaller than anytime in the past. The fish was old and on the verge of being not safe. Salmon for sushi shouldn't be black. none of the entree's, rolls, or even the soup was good. A family of 4 nearby got their dinners, took them up to complain, he didn't seem to care, and they left without eating. I told Yoshi, but he didn't respond. We will never go back again.  My guess is that the restaurant will be closed in the near future. Its a shame because at one time it was good. Not anymore. No bueno."}
{"text":"The staff is very amiable and attentive here, which is always highly appreciated. However, the sushi wasn't the freshest we have had... which is saying something when it comes to sashimi, especially. The udon was a bit gummy, but had a lovely spice to the broth. As well as the chicken katsu, which is one of our personal favorites of meals, had pretty good flavor despite being on the burnt side. Thank you for the meal, but most likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  It is Korean Ramen.  Very different from other Ramen.  I got the spicy pork Ramen and my girlfriend got the tempura udon. The spicy pork was delicious. AND IT WAS SPICY!  Not for the faint of heart.  The udon was just as tasty.  Great noodles, great flavors.  We talked with the owner/chef - Jai.  A sweet and caring host. After he finished making our meal he he served for the rest of the evening.   His \"broth creations\" were unique and sensational. This was our second visit and it had only verified its awesomeness. We will be back, anxious for MORE!!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy pork ramen and it was exceptional. Certainly one of the best ramen spots I've ever been to."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week and we're seriously back 2 nights later.  It's no frills, but it's all about the food here.  Isn't that all that matters anyway?  Love the choose your own roll for only $10, and the Udon is bomb!  Makes me feel like I'm back in HI GO AND EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"We came tonight for some ramen and udon soup and were so happy we did. The care and thought that goes into this food is apparent with such rich flavorful dishes. The Scottsdale roll was incredible and so was the beef udon soup. Fresh ingredients with a chef/owner that really cares. Our new spot for sushi and ramen!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and bowls!!! Very reasonable prices. Give it a shot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Yoshi's Bento is our favorite restaurant of all time. We come here every week and love all dishes we tried: consistently delicious, very healthy, and generous portions. The chef is proud of his cooking and you can tell he puts a lot of effort to make every dish good for each individual customer."}
{"text":"Great, authentic, and fresh food! My boyfriend and I are there pretty much weekly. Everything is made fresh and the Ramen is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Love the crunchy mango roll! He made it vegetarian for me too!! Salad and fried rice was awesome! Great service!! Large portions"}
{"text":"Three of us had dinner tonight.  All dishes were great!  We had the chicken teriyaki bento, pork katsu plate, miso soup and the sushi bowl.  Everything was fresh and delicious!!  We also found out that no MSG is used.  The owner is very pleasant and nice.  We are sorry that we didn't discover this place sooner as we leave AZ in a couple of days.  Prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"Sushi, fast food style.  Service was great. Everyone was very kind. The sushi was just as good as the nicer places around town, but at half the price! I will be there on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Went to Yoshi Bento for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Great customer service from the beginning to the end. Ordered several rolls and a few appetizers for the party and all came with fresh ingredients, and large in size- especially compared to other places I have been. The couple that owns the place are so nice and keep the place clean and tidy, even the bathrooms at the end of the day were spotless. I definitely plan to become a regular customer and would recommend it to anyone. And for those of you that think it's too far, I'd say that its worth the drive."}
{"text":"we both ordered the bento boxes. really a great mix of well made items. nice that they had orion beer too"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner is extremely nice and always greets us. The fish is so fresh and the service always professional. They are also great with takeout and never forget to include chopsticks (you'd be surprised how many places forget to do that). Recommend it if you're looking for a quiet place to grab sushi any night."}
{"text":"Awesome new place! And great to stop by before a movie. Service wasn't super fast but great sushi and big pieces in every roll. Cheap too!"}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch and getting the bento boxes. Teriyaki chicken bento is my favorite but the sushi bento is also great. You get a lot of food for a good price.   Staff is always friendly and welcoming every time.   Don't make the mistake of passing this place up!"}
{"text":"Amazing wonton soup!  Service is a bit slow as they are usually short staffed.  Food a little more expensive than you would expect for this type of place.  Otherwise good food."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a late lunch.  What a surprise!  It's a fast food Japanese restaurant with fine food sushi.  My husband and I had the squid salad which was our least favorite dish but still good.  The tempura appetizer was wonderful with the best tempura batter we have ever had.  The tuna and salmon roll was fabulous.  Great size and very flavorful.  The staff including  Mr. Yoshi (didn't get his real name), his wife and Daniel were so very friendly and helpful.  We will go back and will tell our friends to try it.  Thanks for a great lunch."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not go here for lunch. There is literally 1 guy working the front and the back. The food was ok, but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We used groupon in our visit.  The eel nigiri was good and the udon soup was excellent!  We were disappointed with the veggie tempura - very oily and breading was hard.  The owner and staff were friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to some yummy Japanese food but this place totally disappointed me.  The place was empty today for lunch.  I ordered the tonkatsu and some gyoza.  It came out not too long and it was only warm.  The pork cutlet seemed reheated.  The gyoza were frozen, then deep fried which is not the traditional way to make gyozas.  No traditional sauces to go with any of it.  Service was non existent.   I will NOT be going back here ever again.  If you want true Japanese food, this is not the place."}
{"text":"My family has sushi and other appetizers every year on Christmas Eve.  This year, I ordered sushi from Sushi Bento. I had never been there before so it was a little risky, but it's close to my house and I saw the positive reviews online.  I am so glad I did!  Everyone loved the sushi!  We especially loved the Eel Dragon Roll and Shrimp Killer Roll.  Of all the years I have ordered sushi takeout for Christmas Eve, no restaurant has every packed my nigiri container on ice but S.B. did! My husband and I will definitely be back for more sushi and to order a Bento Box! (PS: LOVE the mochi ice cream!)"}
{"text":"I LOVE the sushi here !! It is ALWAYS so fresh and delicious !!  The sushi chef is so wonderful too and creative in all of his dishes as well! Today, he surprised me with some specialty rolls that were the BEST ever !   I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking for GREAT, FRESH SUSHI at terrific prices as well : )  Enjoy : )"}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch and getting the bento boxes. Teriyaki chicken bento is my favorite but the sushi bento is also great. You get a lot of food for a good price.   Staff is always friendly and welcoming every time.   Don't make the mistake of passing this place up!"}
{"text":"Visited: 7:30pm 12/07/2012  Japanese Fusion.   The restaurant is quaint seemingly similar to the small sushi houses in Japan; however, they transformed part of the sidewalk into a gated dining area adding to the restaurant's occupancy.  Food was good.  We had the BBQ Beef Bento and a side order of Tempura.  The side order of Tempura is quite generous (2 Shrimp, 2 Sweet Potato, 2 Zucchini...) and the BBQ Beef Bento was also. The Beef Bento had rice, side cabbage salad with wasabi dressing, and tempura (Shrimp, Sweet Potato, Zucchini).  I love tempura and didn't realize that the bento provides a generous amount.  I suggest not to order the side tempura because the bento is more than enough.  20/20 Hindsight: * Ask to have any sauce(i.e BBQ, Teriyaki and so on) be on the side.  This allows you to add to your taste. * Business should be more welcoming * By the way, owner of the restaurant is very passionate of his menu, so i believe there might be more to come.  Is it worth visiting again: Yes - when i'm in the mood"}
{"text":"This establishment has changed its name to Sakura, which I believe is a chain, because we have one in Kingman. The atmosphere is nice, the food is good and well presented. Our waitress was a bit ditzy, but that can happen anywhere at any time. I had the shrimp and scallops entree which was very good. My wife had prime rib which was good but nothing to write home about. Would I go back? Sure. If I was already nearby. I've been to other Japanese cuisine restaurants that aren't Nearly as nice and the food was bleah. Prices were a bit high in my opinion, hence the three stars."}
{"text":"Love this place, very quiet. The spicy pork ramen is a must get! Will definitely come back to try other things."}
{"text":"The owner here does such a great job!  Budget Japanese is not easy to pull off, but this franchise does fresh, thoughtfully prepared food perfectly, and is super friendly.  A terrific deal when you want simple rolls or basics for a reduced price and in a hurry.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Sushi was yummy! Ramen soups were spicy but good and filling! Fast service! Not good for large parties tho. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"So far i cannot comment on the food.  My family and i are having dinner here. But 5 of 7 got their food,  and are finished.  2 of us are still waiting.  And it is uncooked sushi everyone else had a cooked dishes.   Ah everyone else  is done eating .  And our food arrived.    The waiter leaves,  and we realize we still cant eat.... no chopsticks or utensils.  Well, i won't give the place 1 star, since i observed for 20 mins the rest of my family enjoying the food.  Oh and it's not like they were too crowded.  We were the only ones in the place!"}
{"text":"This place feels a bit out-of-the way, with a small interior and not a whole lot to the ambiance.  The sushi, however, is superb.  The chef clearly takes pride in his work and creations, which show.  We had a Philadelphia roll, a salmon dragon roll, and a stuffed avocado which was new to us and utterly amazing.  Staff there was polite and because it was a smaller place inside, we felt we got a lot of personal attention and were well taken care of.  Would recommend if you're looking for some pretty good tastes, or need to pick a place for good food before a movie."}
{"text":"Very first yelp review for me. Have been wanting to write a review on Yoshi Bento for a while, as I enjoy going to this restaurant quite often. Besides the wonderful food and service I have experienced in the last four years, a recent negative review compelled me to tell yelp users how good this place is. Have tried a variety of menu items, and they are always on point. Personal favorite is the Yakisoba, bento boxes, as well as the Udon noodles with seafood. Can't go wrong with the sushi as well. I personally rely on yelp to choose what places to frequent for a good bite, and it is very disappointing to see how certain yelp reviewers take it to the extreme when describing food at certain places. Please don't be influenced by a yelp user whose main dietary source is toilet water."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. Thought it'd be a fun family dinner... not. Sat with my family of 3 for 20 minutes before getting our beverage cups. Another 20 minutes was spent waiting for food. 40 minute wait for food MAY be acceptable when busy. We were the first party to order,  4 other parties came in after. 3 parties were served before we decided to leave and actually get service elsewhere. Maybe we ordered a lot? Not at all, we ordered 2 rolls and rice. Sad day."}
{"text":"Just stopped for lunch for the first time. Excellent service and the food was delicious. Ordered the spicy Korean bowl and hubby had spicy soba bowl with seafood. Perfect level of spicy. Also had a spicy tuna roll, delish! Owners were attentive and very friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this little spot. The restaurant was clean and had a very chill vibe. The chicken yakisoba was very flavorful and had a nice little spice to it. The chicken udon was pretty good as well. It wasn't anything spectacular, but wasn't bad. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Inside was very warm we had to wait quite a while for a table. They offered for us to sit outside but it was 110 degrees and they have no mister system. The service was VERY slow, I ended up having to get my own napkins and chop sticks as the waiter never brought them or asked if we needed them. My 10 year old son was never acknowledged and that drives my nuts, he is a person and deserves to be spoken to.   The food was good, but everything is fried so I hope you don't want a healthy meal.   Do NOT go there with a groupon, the owner gave me a lecture about how he doesn't make any money off groupons and if I come back with another one he will not honor it. He won't have to worry because there are plenty of other places for me to go where I'm treated much better!"}
{"text":"I barely ever write reviews but I was just server rotten chicken. My son and I went in their after a movie. I usually don't trust places like this but we were in a rush to get home so he needed something to eat in the car. We grabbed our food to go. The whole car ride I could smell something bad but thought nothing of it. My son ate all his meat and when I opened mine up to eat the smell came out like a punch in the face. I've smelt bad chicken before and it has to be real bad to smell that horrid even after cooking. How could they serve something like that, there's no way they couldn't smell it too. Our whole house stinks of it. I'm just praying my son isn't up all night with food poisoning."}
{"text":"The Groupon sampler gave us just a small taste. After speaking with the owner - we know we'll be back!  All natural ingredients, sauces are homemade & there's no MSG. This one's worth a stop people."}
{"text":"-Waiter really didn't seem to know what he was doing, kept walking back and forth without refilling drinks or moving food out of the way, or for that matter even talking to us.  -Food was cold after waiting 40 minutes for it.  -Mosquitoes all over the place inside and out.   My boyfriend and I have been here many times before with great service and food, so we don't understand why this time is so vastly different.. Not sure when or if we are going to be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sushi is delicious, and the owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Very serviceable Japanese fast food.  Quick to serve.  There is a variety of dishes.  We ordered a couple of the sushi rolls and the dumpling soup.  Everyone was happy."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! The owner is so hospitable and makes sure that my vegan diet is accommodated. When I walk in, he knows what I like and even suggests other options and/or makes changes to dishes on the menu and makes it vegan for me. His teas are so yummy, and the crunchy tofu is da bomb. Not sure how someone could give Yoshi Bento a bad review, because we have never once had a bad experience. I guess what you put out, is what you receive."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim the other day and I have to say I really enjoyed this place.  My husband got some sort of teriyaki chicken with rice (really wishing I would have paid attention to what he ordered) and I got the spicy tempura shrimp roll. Most cheaper sushi places taste like grocery store sushi. Not here. I have been to nicer and more upscale places and had a similar roll and for the price this one measured up nicely. Being pregnant, I couldn't try any of the delicious raw options but what I did get I was happy with. The portions were great and the staff was very attentive and friendly. The bathroom and restaurant were both clean. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we stopped in for some Ramen while waiting for a car revive. Broth was passable. Chicken was off (hoping I don't get sick) and the noodles undercooked meaning the broth was not hot enough when prepared. The chef/ owner seems like a nice guy but the food standard was like something I'd expect in a rally poor Malaysian village, not in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I like it more then hot noodles cold sake. Though not wholly devoted to ramen you can get a nice spicy bowl of pork ramen. Yummy katsu, beef udon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried Yoshi Bento tonight for the first time.  Many of the reviews indicated the gentleman owner was \"rude\" and I would have to agree.  When you walk in it looks like you go up to the counter and order and then sit down.  We were told to \"sit down\" and someone would come to us.  How would we know that our first time there because the decor and the way the restaurant is set up does not lend itself to this type of atmosphere.  Also, instead of saying \"welcome\", or \"we will be with you shortly\" we got the rude curt remark.   We each ordered the chicken udon and it was not served like anything I have had before.  There are numerous recipes on the Internet for chicken udon and what was severed to me was nothing close to these recipes.  The broth at Yoshi Bento tasted like fish although it was a chicken dish, maybe they use a miso soup base.  There were noodles, a few onions, a few pieces of chicken that I could tell (in other words if there was ginger, garlic or scallions in the broth I did not see nor taste them).  The bowl was a good size portion. The menu is hard to read (copied over and over on pink paper) and the descriptions of the food items do not indicate totally what they are or are not.   We asked the owner (man) for clarification but we could not understand what he was saying to us so we were still unclear what to expect.    We overheard a couple sitting next to us saying how the food has gone \"downhill\" here (they had been there before).   The restaurant was very cold (temperature).  When it is 35 degrees outside you need to turn on the heat! The younger man who was cleaning the tables dropped the white cloth he had been using to wipe off the tables people eat at on the floor.  He picked it up off the floor and wiped the tables down.  Really - you are using a wet cloth you dropped on the floor to wipe down the table I am now going to eat off of? Neither the woman making food behind the counter nor the owner were ever seen wearing any type of gloves when preparing the food while we were there, and because of where we sat we had a good view of what was going on behind the counter.  Obviously, no one at the restaurant has taken a Safe Serve food class!     Sorry, based on the rude customer service, the uncleanliness of the restaurant, the poor menu, and the food preparation observations, we would not return."}
{"text":"Ordered to go Sunday afternoon specifically noted not to add extra sauce but end up very saucy.  My kids won't touch them. Oh well..."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently incredible. Everything is freshly made and it shows. I highly recommend anything on the menu, especially the sushi and the teriyaki bowl, which are both arguably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bento box, with Teriyaki tofu today and my friend had the Korean beef.  The Teriyaki had a way too sweet sauce with veggies and tofu over rice. It tasted like a frozen dinner. The tempura coating was very greasy, inside contained something tasteless and part was dark and hard like a bad potato. The egg rolls were mushy and tasted like frozen also. The coleslaw was cabbage with dressing, very unspecial. I don't know what the greasy eggy pocket filled with rice is called, didn't even try it. My friend liked the sauce on the beef and the rice was okay as well as the piece of shrimp tempura although very greasy. With two sodas our bill was $24.00. Even if it was free, I wouldn't want it. I can't imagine this place will last long."}
{"text":"June 28th,  104 degrees outside.  Feels close to the same inside. I made a comment to my wife as the owner passed by so he would overhear me and thankfully,  he did and after 10 minutes,  it felt much better.   Definitely pass on the appetizer sampler as everything is completely fried fried and fried. Even the dumplings were fried as well and had some type of sweetener on them. The fried avocado was smothered in sauce and after a few minutes was completely soggy. The Tempera was mostly that ;tempura with a sliver of vegetable. We ended up taking most the sampler home because our nephew, 17 will eat anything and I didn't want to throw away $13.  I order the half half eel dragon and spicy crunchy roll($10) It tasted fresh and was decent, but again had way too much sauce all over it . I've been here about 7 or 8 times and think this experience will be my last."}
{"text":"What a scam the owner HATES groupon so he has the nerve to mark mine redeemed ALTHOUGH I never used it. I wonder how many other unsuspecting people don't even realize this... I WILL NEVER go there again. And will be reporting this to GROUPON?"}
{"text":"Where to start... Well first there was very slow service. We had to order our drinks twice before they arrived. Now I am all for trying new things and this wasn't as exciting as I hoped. I ordered the dumpling soup. The broth itself is find on it's own. The dumplings were not very good. The meat inside had a strange chemical taste to them. So I just took them out and put them aside (in a little bowl with another liquid I just added to my soup). All in all I would not order this again an be hesitant about visiting again for a different meal. I am sure it is different for everyone but today wasn't my day apparently."}
{"text":"Ordered the teriyaki chicken bento which tasted fine. Haven't had any sushi here yet. I've had the chicken fried rice once too which was kinda skimpy considering the price."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered spicy pork ramen to go over the phone and we're pleased with the results. We both got a heaping serving of broth and fair amount of noodles although we both agreed we were still somewhat hungry after. There was just the right amount of spice to add meaningful flavor to a sometimes dull broth. The price was fair for the dish and I will be returning to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"The food was below average at a very high price. The chicken fried rice only means chicken flavored rice. There was no chicken in it. When I asked them, they didn't speak english all of a sudden. The extensive wait was not at all worth the wait. I could have flewn to Japan for Japanese cuisine quicker than my wait time at the Yoshi Bento. It was definitely not worth the $80...I left with the wah wah wah of disappointment in both my ballet and on my pallet. I wouldn't have left a star rating it was so terrible but Yelp doesn't allow you continue without it."}
{"text":"So it's legitimate, I'm definitely coming back to this place. Coming before a movie on Saturday night we decided to sit at the bar. Our server/bartender was great and the sushi was delicious and fresh.  My reasons for 4 out of 5 stars- there seemed to be a serious lack of not only a hostess, but bartender, busers, food runners and not to mention a manager. There only seemed to be servers which were literally, doing everything. So I am in no way blaming the staff for any lack of service but some serious attention needs to be giving to whoever is supposedly managing this place. People were waiting to be seating, tables to be bused, checks to be given etc. so I'm willing to believe it may have been an unfortunate set of circumstances and they where short handed.  But the food was super good and at an amazing price, better then I've seen in a long time. Next time I am coming back with friends for some serious Korean BBQ time."}
{"text":"Had the spicy pork ramen and chicken gyoza! Ramen is the best I've had in North Scottsdale and on par with another favorite restaurant of mine \"Clever Koi\". Nice blend of spices and all the ingredients tasted fresh. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We bought the groupon and when we went in to use it they acted like they had never seen one. When I asked what it included he told me one roll and an avocado appetizer, which it does not say that on the groupon. The value on the menu was $15 and I paid $15. I explained to him it says it is a $30 value. They didn't care and were fine with me leaving. We will not be back and I will get my money back from groupon. We never tried the sushi but customer service alone was awful enough to never go back. Plus it's not a restaurant like I thought. You order form a counter and they bring it to you. Very misleading and unfortunate that they hired such a young kid that could care less about customer service and helping their business."}
{"text":"I wish I could give his place a better review. We enjoyed the service - very friendly and kind.   I wasn't sure what to eat so I asked for a suggestion. I said specifically that I didn't like spicy. I was suggested a dish. When I got the dish it was spicy and included jalapeño. It was so spicy my lips were stinging. :(   I did have it boxed up and brought it home to my husband. He liked it, but also said it was spicy.   Our other dishes were good - not spicy."}
{"text":"You couldn't ask for nicer people to run a restaurant.  That being said, also the food was wonderful!  the owner was SO kind to us...we had just worked out and knew that they opened at 10:30...it was 10:00 so we wandered around Sports Authority...but showed up at 10:15 and the door was open so we went in.  Owner/sushi chef were just so so nice to us.  Yes, the place itself is no frills, but they have a nice little patio and it's very very clean.  Sushi was delightful and they offer brown rice option!  We are already planning to come back when we go to  movie or after working out on Saturday again.  Food was great but sometimes it is the PEOPLE/service who bring you back!"}
{"text":"I must be white trash.   When I think ramen, I think dried powder packet of beef.   I wasn't feeling 100% so I telexed ramen and here I am. I got the spicy pork. The broth is better than my childhood favorite. A zing of spice and flavorful.   So here is white trash me..I like the cheap 12 cent noodles. I don't need expensive thick ramen. I want hurry up and eat me before I swell noodles.   All being said - this place rocks. The Scottsdale roll.   Come eat 1000 x more expensive ramen..your childhood is calling."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon. Food was good, but menu items all seemed to have the same ingredients. Would suggest owners clean the restaurant a bit more, like the inside if the women's bathroom door had dirty hand print grime. Nice for a quick bite after a movie or while shopping."}
{"text":"Eh. I'm on a sushi bust apparently... Was hoping for much better given the reviews. Small place, which I thought meant it would be outstanding but I was wrong. Ramen is ... Okay. I ordered a chicken ramen but didn't know it came cold - can't remember if the menu indicated that or not so might be my bad, but regardless, was very disappointed and tried to send it back. I tried to swap out for a hot ramen but they insisted that I also pay for the one I didn't want. No establishment should make a patron buy food he or she doesn't want or like. Sushi was decent, nothing great. Best was the beef bowl - I kept stealing bites from my kid."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever. Horribly rude service from the owner himself.  Food wasn't much better. Never again."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat. The food is so good, you will love it. The owner will make just about anything vegan if that's for you, which is what I eat. My daughter wants to go there all the time for dinner. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg! this guy in the picture was so rude, we came to order 10 sides of Rice and 10 sides  of vegetables that goes for $2.00 each, why he charged us $43.00 with no vegetables? Just wow! Poor customer service - would not recommend anyone!"}
{"text":"Horrible, avoid!!!  I waited 25min for a bowl of ramen.  We were only one of two tables so there was no excuse of being too busy or overwhelmed with customers.  I ordered the spicy pork ramen, there was 1/2 a hard boiled egg (that was still cold) and 4 bite sized pieces of pork.    Please take ramen off your menu if you don't know what a bowl of ramen consists of.  I feel embarrassed for you to be serving such garbage and calling it ramen.  Poor and slow service didn't help either."}
{"text":"I really want to give a better review because the Staff seemed nice enough.  However, there were too many elements that turned me off.  This is a seemingly middle of the road restaurant, however, they act like a fast food restaurant: no glasses, napkins, or silverware...and my Bento Box was served in Styrofoam (even though I was asked, \"For here or to go?\").  The salad that was served with the Bento Box was less than sub par; all I saw was old iceberg lettuce.  To their credit, the piece of salmon that was served was of very good size.  The taste was nothing special, but it was not bad either.  They made the mistake of giving us a \"free sample\" of the California Roll.    It scared us.  If this was what we would experience when the sushi arrived, it was AWFUL because it was so obviously OLD!  The sushi was much better than our \"sample\" when it arrived, thank goodness.  All in all, this is a poor value for the quality of the food.  Sorry Yoshi."}
{"text":"My Husband and I were really eager to try this place and I noticed it was on groupon. It read Ramen and Sake meal for two. We walked into Yoshi Bento and the gentleman was really happy to see us and greeted us right away. He asked if it was for two and then asked what we wanted to order and pointed at the menu taped on the counter. We informed him we had a groupon on his entire demeanor changed. His attitude changed from happy to perturbed within seconds. Then he said you can pick on Ramen and one Udon and that we would get a sake to share. My husband chose a Ramen dish and so did I. The gentleman said, \"no only of of you can have the ramen and the other gets udon\". Not sure why we HAVE to get on Udon when the groupon said RAMEN AND SAKE FOR TWO but OK. So I asked him which Udon dish is the best- he chuckled and said they are all the same...... At that moment it was clear he didn't want our service and it was also very apparent why they have Groupons. There was no one in the restaurant and the guy was SO RUDE!! Don't offer a coupon and then get pissed off when someon tries to redeem it. We won't be returning. Customer service is what keeps people coming back this place is lacking."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst ramen I've ever had. The broth tasted like toilet water (assuming that's what toilet water tastes like).I ordered the chicken shoyu and I could not finish my meal without dry heaving. I did not finish my meal and I highly regret eating at  this place. My friends had the chicken katsu and it was over cooked and dry with no flavor. Please do not go here unless you have a fetish with eating food that tastes like toilet."}
{"text":"This was my third time at Yoshi Bento, I had the Shrimp Teriyaki  and house salad it was very good and very generous portions. Can't Waite to come back a fourth time to try out her items on the menu. This place is defiantly worth coming back to."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't sure about the place just because of the mixed reviews but I have to say that I had the spicy Korean BBQ pork bento box and for the amount of food that you get and the taste was on point.  The dressing on the salad was delicious and to the cone sushi was a surprise.  No complaints here.  I would definitely go back.  The place was very clean, which is a must for me.  Definitely check it out and if you don't like any of your meats or poultry covered with sauce make sure to have them put the sauce on the side and you can drizzle the amount you want."}
{"text":"Came here to give it s whirl.   My son liked the beef teriyaki bento I on the other hand had the frozen pork pot stickers.   I thought I would top of my greasy, store bought pot stickers with the red bean ice cream.   The presentation was nice but it was freezer burnt.  Gross.   WONT BE BACK."}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service! Extremely rude! Drove all the way to Scottsdale to eat there and was told that they were already closing at 8:25pm and refused to serve us even though they close at 9pm. Will never go there again!"}
{"text":"I bought the groupon, went at 345pm and was turned away from the owner, no customers were even in the restaurant! Owner said groupon says 4pm. OK it does but really? 15 min he was going to make us wait to order. So we left. Came back in the evening 1 month later. Wanted 2 udon bowls to go, owner again rudly says u have to eat here and you can't order 2 of the same thing. No where on the groupon does it have any stipulations !! We sat and ate but that was uncomfortable since the place was so discussing, it s so filthy. My daughter was filling her drink and could see straight into the kitchen and said it to was filthy ! The food was ok but small portions for the menu price. Won't be going back ever!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for something to eat after watching Logan. Desperately needed something phenomenal to follow up a great film. Randomly saw Yoshi Bento and checked it out. Great food. Had a ramen bowl. Would recommend anything."}

{"text":"Nothing cures the common cold/flu and fights off flu season better than a Chicken Udon noodle soup!! Thanks Jay!!"}
{"text":"The manager/owner (old Asian guy) is so rude and makes you feel so dumb. Tried to order shrimp udon and was told it's not good so I need to get chicken udon. Also I was told that I \"shouldn't use Groupon and buy straight off the menu because Groupon is a lie even if it says two ramen, I can't get two ramen\" he laughs at you and says he doesn't care if customers come back. Don't waste your time going there just to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon to try this gem out, the wife and I were very satified and left happy.  Try the fried avacado with crab meat."}
{"text":"I'm here with my family. I love the sushi specially Las Vegas roll. It's awesome. I will definitely come again with my friends."}
{"text":"The service is unbelievably SLOW! It started when the waiter actually admitted that he never has eaten at the restaurant which in itself is alarming. Our food took awhile and when it came out my ramen wasn't even hot. As well, I had to go up to the counter twice, once for a to go box and the other to ask for the bill. The only reason they're getting two stars is because my husband likes the food here. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was good- although I would expect more food for the dough that you spend.  I wouldn't mind going back here again- but only if the Tea Light Cafe is too busy to accommodate us."}
{"text":"I was out here as I do quite a bit of business in the area.  I received an email from the family that opened this restaurant as I used to frequest their store when they were located in the Fry's Signature location on Hayden and the 101 (I thought the owners changed, as the last time I was there, it was an entirely different staff).     Their objective was to open a no-frills sushi restaurant offering great sushi at more than reasonable prices.  I guess it makes sense why they have Bento (to-go lunch box) in their name.  Well, I was out in the area and gave it a shot.  They were indeed the kind family that had the sushi island in the Fry's Signature.  GREAT sushi as always and definitely on par with price.  I know they just opened and the kinks will be worked out.  I've got faith in them.    If you are looking for a high-end experience with a million dollar interior, then this is not the place for you.  But if you want more than decent food at a price that isn't hurting the checkbook, then this is more than fulfilling the Japanese craving during a more than real and current, economic climate.  Thanks Yoshi Bento for offering high-quality sushi at a moderate price!  I am very tight with my distribution of stars (as you can see). You just cant make a gold medal winner over night.  Either you have it or you don't.   But with the kindness and humility the owners show (which you especially don't see a lot of now-a-days), I am sure this is going to do well!   I wish you luck guys and we'll see you again for sure!"}
{"text":"We recently moved from Seattle -- where there are just as many yummy teriyaki places as their are Starbucks -- and have had a hard time finding a great place for quick take-out teriyaki or sushi.  Fortunately, we stumbled upon Yoshi Bento. The food is great and they have a few gluten-free options (GF beef teriyaki!) for our daughter -- which is awesome!  I highly recommend this place. Check it out if you're ever in need of a teriyaki fix."}
{"text":"Yoshi Bento is a great place. The owner Jay is a wonderful chef and has really unique and delicious items to choose from. The sushi rolls are always fresh and amazing. The Udon with seafood is one of our favorites as it has shrimp, muscles, calamari.The portion is huge!  Also you can't to wrong with the ramen here. The tofu ramen is my go to soup, the broth is really clean and comforting. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not annoyed so much with the food, which has been lukewarm, or too spicy, or in need of spices. I keep coming back because I believe in the food, and hope soon I hit gold... But I am annoyed because all this time the gold was in front of me... I just wished someone had had the courtesy of telling me. I always begin with asking the attendant what's good or what's special? Or what's delicious? But I can barely get any relevant information, but the table right in front of me got the service and information I had longed for. It was by evesdrop that I found out they have a dish called  (if I remember well) Spicy Avocado and according to what I heard from the distance is delicious!is It's fried and, its exquisite... It's the item to order!! I'd be darned. I wished someone had told me that... I sure would have ordered the Spicy Avocado :/"}
{"text":"Really good food! My fav is katsu and ramen. Sushi is not as expensive as other places."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi and very flexible staff - the Sushi was better tasting than quite a bit of upscale restaurants. The staff was able to make modifications due to my dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"We really like this little local business.  We used to come here all the time, but haven't been here for quite a while. It was always good, but it is even better now. It's a tiny place, but they have added more sushi to their menu and I'm so glad they did. Their noodle bowls are as delicious as they always were, but the addition of all the new sushi rolls made the menu even better. We had the Shrimp Killer, the Las Vegas, and the avocado rolls. They were all very good. My husband had the Spicy Pork Ramen and said it was still as good as it always was, but was even hotter than the last time we were here, which he loved."}
{"text":"Lunch was great. The chef was super nice and welcoming. The iced green tea was real and refreshing. The food was good and a reasonable price. We will come back here again. It was a tad bit warm inside but (being that I work in a salon and have a window space my spot is always warmer then the rest of the salon)due to the whole side of the building being a window I would think it would be hard to keep cool. My son had the steak teriyaki bowl and LOVED it. The chicken bento box was good and as well as the shrimp and veggie tempura."}
{"text":"I had a break between my classes and was craving ramen. I decided to try something new and chose to get the Curry Ramen and asked if they could make it spicy. Let me tell you, soooo good!!! I'm for sure coming back. And why would I say no to Mochi ice cream for dessert?  The people were nice and came around to make sure I was happy. See you soon!!"}
{"text":"What can I say I eat here at least once every ten days.  It's not about the decor, it's really about the great food.  Chicken bentos, spicy pork bowl, salmon bento, and all three soups on the menu are awesome.  The owners name is Jay and he has a really good palate and also really cares that you have a great meal.  Udon is also really good for days that you're feeling the effects of a long night out.  If you like kimchee, he may just have some for you to try as we'll if you're lucky!"}
{"text":"Definitely order a sushi bento when you visit. It is absolutely amazing! The sushi is spot-on fresh and delicious. The tempura is a good crispy texture. It gives you a really nice variety. The staff are very friendly and welcoming as well.  The Lyft we took had some trouble finding the place and it led behind where we needed to go. If standing in front looking at the movie theater, go left and keep going until you reach the restaurant at the end."}
{"text":"Yoshi Bento deserves 5 stars! It's a hole in the wall joint. Their menu is pretty simple, consist of sushi rolls , bento combos, and good ramen! I LOVE the spicy pork ramen and the pork / chicken Katsu rice plate. The owner Jay is very friendly, when he is not busy he always drops by and says hi. This is a nice place if you want a quick meal, or call ahead for to go orders!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and I love bento boxes but the problem with bento boxes is usually I can only get them at lunch. . . BUT NOT AT YOSHI BENTO!  I got a bento box after 8PM last night and it was nothing short of amazing!  I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki bento box which comes with a salad and some delicious tempura.  The tempura consists of a piece of Shrimp and a few vegetables in this case sweet potato (amazing) and cucumber (good but sweet potato is my favorite after pumpkin which is extra amazing - side note).  I'm excited to go back and try the sushi which seems reasonably priced and according to the pictures delicious!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat. The people who own it are so friendly and everything they make is delicious. All the people I have brought here are just as in love with it as I am. There is never a time I don't crave the Monterey Jack cheese ramen and crunch tofu."}
{"text":"Yoshi Bento has many mixed reviews on Yelp, but their overall rating was good, and we didn't want to drive too far from highway 101, so we stopped in to give it a try and LOVED it!  We were welcomed by Daniel who took our order at the front counter and served us.  He gave us great recommendations. We opted for the Champon Ramen (extra spicy) and Spring Buckwheat Soba.  The Champon Ramen has plenty of seafood to chopstick up, and the broth was so rich and full of flavor.  As much as I enjoyed the Champon Ramen, the surprise came in a bowl of Spring Buckwheat Soba.  Green Soba, cooked to perfection, topped with seafood, vegetables, and rolled fried egg, all dressed with fish sauce.  Every bite has light, refreshing components.  Chef Jay later mentioned that this is a seasonal item and he is about to change to a warm soup version of this delightful Soba dish.  Yoshi Bento is located in the back corner of the shopping center with plenty of seating outside. If you sit inside though, you could well enjoy watching Chef Jay cook your dish.  Spending a little over $20 for two satisfying dishes was a very good thing.  -2017 review #58-"}
{"text":"I used to live in Japan back in 2001. Then while serving in the Army, lived in Korea 2004-05. Yoshi bento restaurant has both of the quality food that comes from both of those countries. Excellent ramen and bulgogi. Trust my review and just try it. Spicy Korean bbq is great and the chicken udon is great."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing. The staff is super friendly and helped point us in the right directions of what we each would enjoy. I got the chicken teriyaki bento and the teriyaki by far is the best I've ever had. My husband got the spicy pork ramen and loved it. He said it was a tad on the spicy side but it was delicious. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Visiting our son in Cave Creek and ended up here on a Groupon.  We love Korean and any kind of Asian.  This place has everything we can't get and everything we tried, was awesome.  One thing for sure, these folks aim to please.  Was very happy to find the foods we ate in Okinawa, Korea, and the Kimchee was just like Korea.  Mr J, from Korea seemed very proud of his restuarant.  I ate here 4 times, beacause I wanted some of my friends to try it.  Yakisoba, Pork Bulbogi, Yakimondo (Gyoza) was a great memory of my tours overseas.  This is a must stop when North Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Thanks for the great food Mr J!  We shall return!"}
{"text":"Buckwheat soba with chicken, spring mix, crisp apple, orange, fried egg, and spicy citrus dressing. Cool, very fresh and refreshing - perfect for summer! This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Good food. Very slow service. By biggest issue is their large ordering menu posted in the restaurant. I have been here twice in the last month. Each time I order it gets more expensive. I did the math and questioned the cashier. He pointed out to me that they have an updated paper menu and haven't had time to change the board to reflect higher prices. Wouldn't honor posted prices. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"To start-the owner is such a sweet man. We went in there for the first time with our son and he was very nice and accommodating. Went in there about a week later, the man says hi and asked where our son was. They're quick to clean tables and they keep their eyes on you to get what you need while you're enjoying your food. The prices are fantastic and the food is super fresh!"}
{"text":"Worst place to get sushi. The rice used for the sushi was hard. In addition, I ordered the eel dragon roll, and the eel was really cold. Every sushi place I have been to heats up the dragon roll so that it comes out hot and at worst room temperature.   Also, the prices are really high for the quality of sushi. This place is a fast food sushi place with inflated prices.   Also, the price has increased, but the main board (menu) has not included these changes. The owner tells you this conveniently after he expects you to pay.  The new prices are reflected in the to-go paper menus that are stacked in front of the cash register.  I am never going to yoshi bento again! I would advise you to save your money because you will be surely disappointed!"}
{"text":"For $9, the Spicy Pork Ramen is a great lunch consideration. Food was prepared fast-- taking less than 10 minutes from scratch (we stopped by during non-lunch hours). Soup was just spicy enough by Asian standards, and though the noodle was a bit doughy it was plentiful. Half of boiled egg on top too!  They also have a wide selection of Asian beers, and even soju! Ramune for the kids or for reminiscing adults.  3.5 stars. Recommended for quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Owners and employees are super friendly! Owner will come talk to you and ask how your food is. Teriyaki sauce is good on the beef Bento box. Ramen here is good too!"}
{"text":"To me this is a hidden treasure not enough people know about.  I *LOVE* Yoshi Bento!  Every time I stay at my resort in Scottsdale, I like to make sure I get to this small, quaint dining delight.  The owner is very nice. He's great because he seems to really care to provide good service. For example he remembers how spicy I like the yakisoba with tofu dish that's my favorite (even if it's been four to six months between visits).  He's also the chef.  That's what I had tonight. I had forgotten how outstanding this dish in particular is.  I like a lot of black pepper, and that to me is the dominant flavor in the sauce. (I could be mistaken; whatever it is, it sure tastes divine!)  The prices are quite reasonable. Besides the yakisoba to go, I also bought a Lucky Buddha beer, just to take home for the novelty. That was $5. The total bill came to $14.02.  People I know in the area don't seem to know about this place.  To me it merits \"Best of Phoenix\" honors, for Japanese food.  It's a place I feel warmly welcomed... and deliciously well fed!"}
{"text":"Well I've never felt compelled to make a yelp account in order to review a restaurant, but Yoshi Bento has motivated me to do so for serving what I would say was the WORST sushi I've ever had in my life paired with a sub par dining experience. It all started when I decided to venture out of the office on my lunch break to dine out at one of the many different restaurants at this particular plaza. Any of which I'm sure would have yielded a more pleasant experience than what I went through at Yoshi Bento. Sushi sounded good so I walked into this place and it smelled great so I thought I had made a good choice. I was wrong, very wrong.   The young woman behind the counter arrived at the counter to take my order promptly and was very polite. She explained that they had an \"updated\" menu that had a special which included a dragon roll and a spicy salmon roll for $15. I was hungry so I took the bait and decided on a tuna dragon roll to accompany the spicy salmon. I paid and went to the restroom to wash my hands.   Upon entering the restroom I found a dying COCKROACH on the ground. Seeing as how it was dying they must have some kind of pesticides working, but since there was one I got to thinking that there must be more where that came from...GROSS   I sat down and contemplated telling the young woman asking for a refund and leaving. In hindsight that would have probably been one of the better decisions in my life, however I decided to take a chance and give Yoshi Bento a shot. I waited for 15 minutes from the time I placed my order. I wouldn't consider this an extremely long time to wait, but customers who ordered AFTER me were served before me and they had COOKED food. I know that making sushi is not easy, but I know that it should be quicker than cooked food. I've worked in a restaurant so I understand that certain things take more time, so that wasn't that big of a deal. The following is what WAS a big deal:    1) They brought out 1 roll and then the second a few minutes later. I know this happens at restaurants all the time when it's busy, but when there are only 3 other groups of customers in the restaurant it shouldn't be that hard to have items come out simultaneously.  2) The dragon tuna roll used yellow tail instead of sushi grade tuna (has a different color than regular tuna, is lower quality, and cheaper). Since I'm paying for sushi with tuna I would at least expect sushi grade tuna. Would probably fool just about anyone else though.  3) Oxidized avocados on the inside of the roll (aka they were not freshly cut). I get that avocados oxidize easily, but put some kind of citrus juice on it to prevent this or cut a new one! Come on, it's just common sense who in their right mind would want to eat a brown avocado? I'm not talking about a little oxidation some of them were literally completely brown.  4) The sushi was poorly rolled. Every single one of my dragon rolls fell apart at the avocado section. Granted sometimes sushi just falls apart, but I've been using chopsticks for more than a DECADE and have never had a sushi roll where literally every single one falls apart when I touch it.  5) The \"spicy garlic\" salmon roll was one of the nastiest roll I've ever had in my life. For starters the roll was DRENCHED in sriracha. I'm not being sarcastic it literally looked like a wet burrito you might get from a Mexican restaurant, which is very delicious, but not what I want on my sushi. I don't think that the fish on top was salmon either. It didn't taste like salmon, but I couldn't tell for sure since it was drenched in sauce.    I should have asked for a refund once I saw the roach and gone somewhere else instead. However, I decided to roll the dice and by the time my food had arrived I was pressed for time and very hungry so I ate it. Maybe their cooked food is better, but I will never be back to find out. The cockroach was enough to make me never go back...   I've eaten at a lot of restaurants and also had my fair share of sushi so I know what I'm talking about when I say this is some pretty terrible sushi as well as service. I hope Yoshi Bento sees this so they can improve for future customers, because this was the sorriest excuse for a sushi/ Japanese restaurant I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Great food and received great service! We were taken care by this Korean lady with glasses, she makes the best food! Seems like she only works during the weekend.. Gladly to return when she is cooking lol"}
{"text":"Hubby & I came a year ago.  I gave this place a good review.  We came and sat at table to order.  We've ordered at table both times but I think you can order at counter.  I ordered the crunchy tofu and hubby ordered bento box with a dragon roll.  I loved my tofu dish.  Apparently I ordered it the last time I was here.  Had to say it did not disappoint.  Hubby said his was very good.  We also had edamame & miso soup.  Food arrived in a timely manor and they checked to see if everything was ok.  It's a very small place.  Nice to support a non chain place."}
{"text":"This is the best teriyaki chicken bowl I have ever eaten, the chicken was so flavorful.  The only problem I have is they wok fry the chicken and I am pretty sure in oil.  While the meal was very tasty, I typically eat this type of food for its low fat count.  Well, this didn't taste low in fat at all, but I could be wrong!  Next time I am in the area, and in the mood for a very tasty teriyaki chicken bowl, you will find me at Yoshi Bento, oh yeah!  FYI, it's right my the Mayo Clinic if you happen to be there and want a good quick meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food . Crispy tofu , maggi ramen and noodle Miso soup are out of the world . Loved it . And the server and owner both were very sweet . Owner cooks everything himself . :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to start with the negative (and there was only one)... the wine.  Just simply not good.  The atmosphere is whatever, it's in a strip mall, but it does have a nice outside patio which actually has a surprisingly nice view.  Now that that's out of the way... wow.  Everything else was excellent.  Found this place by accident (aren't they always the nicest finds?), after seeing a film at Cine Capri.  If I was rating it for value received, it would be like a 7 out of 5 stars.  I had the teriyaki beef bento box.  The beef was done to perfection, the tempura side dish was superb (me eat zucchini?  Yes I did and loved it)... with incredibly light batter.  The salad was also excellent.  My son had the spicy pork ramen, which was to die for.  My wife had two sushi rolls, which were HUGE, and excellent, now in the top 3 of our list of sushi places (although need to have more and a wider selection before we cement that list).  She had the crunchy California roll and the spicy California roll.  The owner was warm and personable, coming over to our table and chatting with us on a couple of occasions (although it was not busy when we went).  After dinner, he treated us to a \"plum saki\" drink.  Now, I don't like saki, but this was great.  Definitely on our list of favorites."}
{"text":"This is really more like a take out place. So if you intend on going to a sit down place this is not it. But the staff was very nice and service was fairly quick.  The sushi was good, but poorly executed. It was loose and came apart as you picked it up.    My friends were split on whether the Ramon was good. One loved it and the other was not impressed."}
{"text":"Found this cute Korean/Japanese restaurant when I started working in the area . It's much more intense in flavor than the traditional Japanese cuisine.   Today I tried the sushi bowl,  which is a Korean style chirashi bowl. For $10 it comes with a large mountain  of rice topped with cabbage,  spring mix,  sashimi,  and a tangy chili sauce. The sauce was just a bit overpowering,  so I'll probably ask for my next order to be light on sauce. . But it's a generous serving of food that always leaves me satisfied.   Ps,  their spicy ramen is pretty fantastic too if you're craving some hot food."}
{"text":"Meeting a great friend for lunch and we both ordered Champon Ramen (spicy seafood ramen noodle). It came in a very big bowl, lots of broth, nicely cooked veggies, some mussels, big shrimps and of course the ramen. Asked for extra spicy paste and powder. Overall, it tasted okay. Service was quick, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"What a terrific sushi chef!  The fish is of higher quality than one would expect for a strip mall sushi place. Truly enjoy the outdoor seating and the freshly brewed iced green tea. Super pleased with the value proposition."}
{"text":"Looks good...hasn't opened yet but the menu looks great. Met a gentleman from Yoshi Bento who came out to greet us. Have yet to find good sushi in AZ, have high hopes! THEY OPEN 3/25/10!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there to try out the cuisine with a groupon. What turned my daughter off at the very outset is the owner's attitude when he learnt that we had a groupon. He seemed irritated and immediately told us that he did not like groupons. I did not want to spoil our evening and so didn't say anything. The food was pretty good but the owner has no customer skills. We bought the groupon because he offered the deal through Groupon and he made us feel as if we were trying to cheat him off his dues. The couple at the next table were also discussing the same thing. The owner is extremely unprofessional and actually told us that he had started serving only half a portion of ramen and udon to people with Groupons which is unethical. I would recommend the place for the food but don't go with a groupon - it will ruin your evening."}
{"text":"Spiderman! Spiderman! ... It was our Friday movie night with a friend. Since it was only a little over an hour before our movie schedule, we decided to grab our dinner near the movie house. We decided to try a bento restaurant beside our favorite phoa spot.   We got a patio table (seemed like everyone wanted to dine at the patio tables). There were 5 tables. When we arrived there were already 2 occupied tables. It didn't look very busy at that time.   I guess we got the rookie server. He just stood beside our table and did not ask us if we wanted to start with something to drink. We ask for a glass of water and he again waited for our order (I guess it really wasn't that busy. If he could wait and watch us drink water while we decide what to order, then he must really have some time to burn).  We started with dumplings and their crunch tofu. The dumplings were... hmmm... dumplings. For me, it was nothing special. Had a good combination of crunch and chewy dumpling wrap but it was just ok. The crunch tofu, now that's a different story. It was different. Good different. Correction, very good different. The wasabi mayo sauce on top of the lightly fried tofu was a perfect match. The sauce had enough of the wasabi flavor but not too much of the wasabi nose wrenching effect. It was sweet, spicy, tangy, soft and crunchy. All in one bite. Yum!  For our entree, we ordered chicken yakisoba, tempura roll and salmon/tuna sashimi which took a little over 30 minutes to get to our table (take note: there were only 5 full tables at that time. With 2 guests per table). Back to the food... well... ok... It was worth the wait! The yakisoba was very tasty and just had the right kick. Sweet, salty, spicy and yummy! It's worth coming back for another visit. Sashimi was fresh. Slices were generous. Plating was really clean as well.  Would I come back. Yes, when there is less people. When I have enough time. When I am craving for a good... correct that... very good tofu and tasty yakisoba.  more reviews on  http://themealexperience.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"The best Japanese food in town! Jay, the chef, is an amazing cook. Everything on the menu is really good, my favorites are the teriyaki bento and the spring mix chicken bowl. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a great chicken teriyaki bento here - very fresh, simple and done well. The teriyaki sauce is critical - sweet, salty, good sesame flavor and not too thin - and that the meat was browned but not dry. Couldn't ask for more. My husband loves his spicy pork ramen. I ended up coming back just a few days later to eat it again! Unfortunately, they wanted to charge me $4 for extra noodles for the ramen which seemed steep so I turned it down. Then the gentleman laughingly said he thought we had enough food. um... I think we'll be the judge of that!"}
{"text":"Well, if it wasn't for the Groupon there is no way I would have eaten here.  It's unfortunate because there is certainly *something* here, but this is ramen for the uninformed, without a doubt.  If it's any indication, the sake is served with Bud Light.  The ramen itself didn't have any flavor and they had to get water and ice from the vending machine...not necessarily what I'm looking for in my food service.  The spicy udon bowl with shrimp was alright, but you'd be better off driving to Republic Ramen if you want to get your fix."}
{"text":"After hearing about all the good reviews on Yelp I figured i would give Yoshi Bento a try. The restaurant layout itself was a little disappointing with the kitchen being out front and really taking up a large portion of the space and there were only a few tables inside and some seating outside as well. But I didn't find that to be a problem because yoshi Bento isn't your traditional sushi place, i found it to be more of a \"fast food\" sushi place which i thought was a good unique idea especially with high quality food. However, when ordering out food upfront and then sitting down we didnt get out food as soon as i wouldn't have liked and had to wait. Though they did apologize for the wait it was still slightly disappointing. When it comes to the complaints about the \"quality\" of the silverware i do not think that is a point of contention as I wouldnt expect super high quality silverware in a quick sushi place.  On the food end i had ordered a scottsdale roll, and a dragon roll. They were both outstanding when it came down too it. Very fresh and had great flavors. I would especially recommend the scottsdale roll it was amazing with a great spice too it that was the perfect size. On another visit i tried the bento box and wasn't overly impressed but that doesn't mean i wouldn't order it again. I liked the variety of the items in the bento box and the chicken was good but not outstanding. Pricing for the bento was good especially for what you get and for on the go.   Overall, Yoshi Bento was a good quick sushi restaurant that I will visit again. I can also tell the owner is trying hard to better the place in every way he can and i respect that. If your looking for a casual place to get some good sushi i would say try Yoshi bento, if your looking to go out on a date Yoshi bento wouldnt be my first choice."}
{"text":"Visiting for ramen bowls again. We have a Groupon. It says: two ramen or udon bowls and one sake bomber. First, sake bomber came with Bud Light. Had to buy a Kirin, as we can't just pay the difference. Second, we are not allowed to order two ramen bowls. Only one of each. Groupon doesn't state that. They are losing money with one udon and one ramen. Our choice of ramen bowls was less expensive. First time here, bad experience. Second time here, great experience with the same groupon and we ordered two ramen bowls! Weird. This visit is disappointing again. We won't be back. Will have to ask for a refund from Groupon. Too bad because we really liked this place."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. This is a 'order at the counter' place. I got the chicken bento box. I was disappointed.  It came with rice covered in chicken. Chicken was over done. It had two egg rolls, which were pretty empty and very greasy. There was a cabbage salad which was good. There was an attempt at tempura that was pathetic - greasy and very thick batter.  All in all very disappointing. I've had much better in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I would give more stars if I didn't have to wait so long for food here. I love the udon and ramen here. I've had some potstickers and their lunch bento box. Not a big fan of their bento because it isn't really flexible, but the food all tastes good. Eating here seems like trouble. They don't bring people at your table their food all at once. Once my boyfriend was done eating his entree before my food and our appetizer came out. Their organization is a bit off. It's quirky, but the food is good, so I come here occasionally."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place because the chef is personable and the food is delicious. Last time I was back I had the Champon ramen. The broth was rich, flavorful, well seasoned with just the right amount of spice. There were two mussels and two shrimps and some rings of squids.  They have a patio area and it was pleasant sitting there enjoying the warmth of the sun and the wonderful bowl of seafood ramen with just a little kick.    The other dish that I enjoy at times is the sushi bowl. It has sashimi fish with spicy sauce and fresh greens on a bed of rice, a wonderful combination. It is kind of like eating Poke but unique to this restaurant.   The other noodle dishes in the broth are good too. I added some other pictures of these dishes.   Bathroom is s little dark and not updated but clean."}
{"text":"I had no idea there were more shops past mayo blvd. Its all hidden but always busy. Now i know.   Instantly greeted when walking in. You have the option to sit outside or inside.  It's a small menu but the portions are filling. Prices are comparable to others in the area. Nothing was wrong with the food. It tasted pretty darn good.    Will definitely keep this spot in mind when im up in Scottsdale and have a craving for sushi."}
{"text":"If you have the word \"bento\" in your restaurant name, you better have a pretty damn good bento when I come to visit. We decided to come on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was empty and it was warm and musty. We decided to dine anyway and I ordered the teriyaki chicken bento. This came with a salad, egg rolls,one tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables. The food was awful - the chicken tasted dry and old, the tempura had way too much batter and didn't really cook through so it was soggy in the inside and one of the egg rolls were beat up and busted. They couldn't just give me another eggroll that wasn't busted? Prices were inexpensive, service was mediocre and the food not so good."}
{"text":"I will say the sushi we had was very good. We had several half rolls and the fried avocado appetizer. We really enjoyed the meal.  The reason for the 3 stars was the customer service. We were told to have a seat and the server would be right out. There was only one other table besides us. The server came around and got our drink order. He was wearing an apron that looked like he was butchering animals. We waited at least 15 minutes and I went to the counter to get our drinks. He then came out to drop off glasses that were totally filthy. It was really disgusting. I really don't think they had been washed. While sitting waiting we could see into the prep area and the server was helping with the preparation. He was using his bare hands and I would assume wiping them on his apron. I don't think there was much hand washing going on. When our food arrived we had to ask for plates, which were also brought out dirty. I will say the server was very nice despite being incredibly slow.  In the future I think we will stick to our regular sushi hangouts."}
{"text":"It has been a while since we've had the opportunity to enjoy our favorite date night restaurant.  Tonight was no less wonderful than it always is.   I do not view Yoshi Bento as a restaurant in the traditional sense, but rather its like having dinner at a friends house.   The owner and staff are such warm and welcoming people.  Tonight I am excited to leak a little secret, my wife and I were treated to a sneak peek at a recipe that we are told will be on the new menu due to be released in October.   It is a dish that is similar to the Champon Soup.   The Chapon Soup is a delicious sea food and vegetable soup with a rich flavorful broth. The new soup is as of yet not named, but I can say it is a lighter version of Champon, but unique all on its own.  It has a wonderful broth with shrimp, fish cake (wonderful) and a bounty of vegetables, it also has a new addition of a chili (sort of like salsa) accoutrement that has the spicy edge with a wonderful pickled like flavor.   All I am willing to say is that based on a pickled seven chili mixture and some other spices.  I have come to really appreciate the Kimchi that the owner makes in his restaurant.   I had the opportunity to be stationed in South Korea during my time in the service.  Having come from a very mid-western family I had little to no exposure to Kimchi, but found a small family owned restaurant just outside of the military base, and fell in love with its flavor, and the surprisingly rich and at the same time mildly spicy flavor.   Recently as age has caught up to me I have also found the health benefits of Kimchi.    Beyond all of that my wife and I now have a dish of traditional kimchi as a part of our meal.  If you are looking for a friendly family oriented night out with dishes for every age and pallet, I highly recommend that this restaurant be put on the agenda.   The prices are very reasonable, and quite the bargain given the volume of food you receive with your order.   If you want a more grown up evening this is also the place to be, the Plum Sake Tea, or my favorite Soju, as well as a large verity of Pacific Rim and domestic beers are available libations."}
{"text":"This review is not for their food because I didn't get to taste it. Just walked away from the restaurant because the manager chose to answer his phone while we were still giving him our orders. And he then proceeded to take the phone order while we waited in front of him. No matter how good your food maybe, customer service should be equally important."}
{"text":"My go to for ramen. I love this place especially on a cold, rainy night. Also enjoy their sushi and bento boxes. Staff has always treated me well the three years I've been eating there."}
{"text":"Jay has done it again. Everything here is spectacular and reasonably priced. I saw new summer dish  Shrimp all sorts veggies Apple. Orange. egg on bed of spinach and green tea buckwheat noodles in ice!! New for the summer menu. Amazing and spicy"}
{"text":"Traaaaaash. I found melted  plastic wrap on my food. No apology, no compensation. Took my  groupon. Tried to charge me. Literally laughed the plasic wrap in my soup. Really?!?!?!  Smh. I could tell the waiter didnt want to explain the shadey groupon.  Saaaaad. I rarely leave negative reviews however the lack to empathy or care set me oooffffff. Find a better ramon spot if u love ramon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a date night and went to the movies. After the movie, we decided we wanted sushi and looked up great sushi places nearby. We ran into Yoshi Bento, and decided to give it a try.  When we walked in, we wanted to leave and find another place because we were looking for a nice, sit down restaurant. However, Yoshi seemed like a to-go, fast food place. But the owner was very friendly, so we decided to give it a try.  We found a Groupon deal, $15 for a crispy avocado, 2 half and half rolls, and sake bomb for two. We ordered the Scottsdale Roll, Eel Dragon Roll, Crispy Shrimp Tempura Roll, and Salmon Garlic Roll.   Everything was good! The crispy avocado is soooo good! LOVED it! The rolls were great as well, although the eel dragon roll was very cold. In my opinion it would be much better if the eel was warm! The owner recommended the Salmon Garlic Roll. I hesitated because I don't like jalapenos, but minus the jalapenos, it was very good!   We were able to get an appetizer, sake bomb, and try 4 different rolls for only $15! Definitely a great deal, and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"After searching through Yelp for ramen near the 101 curve, we decided to try this place. As we were walking up we noticed it looked kinda of small. When we walked inside the place was so warm and humid! We were handed paper menus and told to sit anywhere. I think they have inside seating for like 16 people. As we sat down looking thru the menu we notice that there were no GF symbols on the menu like advertised on the yelp pictures of the menu. Also, the prices and menu options seemed to be different too.   I fee very deceived with this place, they have great pictures on Yelp and reality is a lot different. I was embarrassed that I took friends here to try it out. We ended up leaving because it was unbearably hot inside and we weren't impressed with the menu options."}
{"text":"Came here again for lunch recently and I had the seafood soup, OMG it was so delicious! The best seafood soup ever, the broth is to die for.  My friend had the chicken teriyaki bowl and she said it was yummy as well. I love the people here, they are super nice!!"}
{"text":"Just ate there for the first time. WOW! Yakisoba was great, service was prompt, price was right and the place was clean. Don't let the location or seating size fool you, it's a diamond in the rough that shines for me."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this place, maybe we ordered the wrong items?   Three of us went here for lunch. I ordered the spicy pork ramen, guy ordered the sushi bento, and girl ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl.   The spicy pork was not too bad actually, I'm half Korean so I'm pretty picky in that regard, and if I ever come here again I'd order that. The ramen, however, was very oily and did not have much flavor besides an aftermath of spice. I also felt like there was a lot of MSG as I was not feeling too great afterwards.   Sushi wise - not put together well (I think that's only because he was very busy), filled with imitation crab and not that fresh. Guy did not like his sushi.   Girl's teriyaki bowl had a hair in it so she had it taken back. She got a new one with less sauce and all in all, wasn't a happy camper either.   Regardless though, I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the following:   - The spicy pork was decent.  - The owner was working VERY hard - seriously. - The green tea was delicious.   Lastly, I think they'd do a lot better if they were in a bigger place, they are doing a lot in such a tight spot. Food appears to be coming out at a slow pace because of the lack of space/equipment.   Oh and FYI, there isn't much room for eating in during the lunch rush if you're a party of 3 or more."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a mediocre review because I really like the people who work there, but the food is just ok. I got a chicken teriyaki bowl, which was $7 and was half empty. They don't give you enough meat. The chicken was tough and not tasty, I liked the sauce though."}
{"text":"SO good. Really great quality sushi at an amazingly cheap price. My friend and I sat on the patio. The weather was perfect, the sake was yummy, and the rolls were awesome. Try the combination salmon/tuna dragon roll. Family owned, super friendly service. I will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the spicy ramen, and it was FANTASTIC, and a lot like sex in an uncomfortable position: hard to finish, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I have been craving a bowl of Ramen for a couple of weeks now and the other night that craving needed to be satisfied... So a quick search on yelp showed that Yoshi Bento was in my hood.  Walking in its a small no frills place, so if your looking for a waiter driven experience this isn't your spot, but I will say service was very good. The owner was more than happy to take our order at the table and checked on us regularly. We started with the tempura appetizer, it was good... the breading was a little heavy for tempura. I had the Spicy Pork Ramen, it was really delicious and It was super spicy (which I LOVED!) and the pork was amazing! Not dry at all, and it had a lot of flavor. I saw some sushi come out and the fish looked fresh so I would be intrigued to give the sushi a shot here. For the price point, this place is a no brainer."}
{"text":"I was here last weekend due to a Groupon. Upon presenting the groupon was told I had to order 1 udon and 1 ramen. So two people can't order the same kind of noodle apparently. That was very disappointing as both my husband and I wanted to get the udon.   The server said there's an error on the groupon. I ordered the miso tofu ramen. It tasted like salty water. If I weren't hungry then, it would have been difficult to eat it. My husband got the chicken udon. It was better but not great. I would not recommend coming here for the noodles in soup. Very disappointed with this group on and meal."}
{"text":"The spicy pork ramen and the crunchy tofu, as recommended by yelpers, were quite delicious but my favorite was the spicy seafood udon dish.  This happened to be the chef's favorite dish too.  Reasonably priced, fast and friendly service! I highly recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Their Sushi was very good and the Noodle Soups & Sake Bombs where amazing along with the great service!"}
{"text":"Found while exploring Scottsdale and starving, so checked it out on Yelp!  So pleased with the experience.  Small place in a strip mall, with only about eight tables, but apparently they do a lot of take out business.  The owner met us at the cash register and took our order, and he recommended the Scottsdale roll for me (crab, avocado, and cucumber topped with crunchy tuna and spicy mayo) and my wife chose the Philadelphia roll with crab, cream cheese and avocado topped with fresh salmon.  My roll was outstanding, and the cream cheese on my wife's was well-balanced with the salmon and avocado.  Both were really tasty and fresh.  He also had recommended that we try the crispy avocado appetizer, deep fried avocado with crab and salad on banana dressing with eel sauce wasabi dressing.  Different and delicious.  Washed it all down with Kirin Light for my wife and Kirin Ichiban for me, and we were full!  Not an impressive place, but guaranteed fresh sushi with some very unique choices!  A caution:  when reading Yelp! reviews, be sure to read ALL of them and not just the most recent two!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a bento box place that is a GREAT place to go to just pick up some sushi for lunch that tastes yummy and reasonably priced. However, this place is NOT awesome for a sit down date.   They serve the sushi in the to-go packages, and there are no real silverware available. It's just disposable stuff and styrofoam cups. They also didn't have any sugar for their tea. It took quite a while for the rolls to be made as well. The service was very spacey - like the guy didn't know what he was doing.  HOWEVER, their roll (rainbow roll) was AWESOME and their green tea was TO DIE FOR. They don't serve any white fish (at least they didn't when I was there). I would definitely recommend this as a place to pick up a good lunch, but not as a date or a dinner meal."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Yoshi Bento today and I really liked the place.  The service was great as was the food.  I had the Tofu Teriyaki Bento and it was delicious.  Everything was freshly made and the price was very affordable.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great location, but food is very basic.  There were pictures on a digital frame with no names or description.  The Scottsdale roll was good, the chicken terryaki bowl was nice and spicy, the salad bowl with miso soup was tasty, the Killer Shrimp roll was good, but the chicken wrap was very basic (something my kids could make at home)  The whole family was disappointed to leave still hungry.  Not our favorite place."}
{"text":"Very good, FRESH, food! It took a little while to get our udon soup, but, well worth the wait. Our cook was alone and making and cutting and cooking everything from scratch, so I didn't mind the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times; yesterday with Mom.  She had a craving for sushi bento, so I thought she could try it here while I have some ramen.  I ended up ordering chicken udon, after having some wonderful udon at Waikiki's Marukame Ramen.  It cost almost twice here in Scottsdale, and it made me wish I was back in Hawaii having fresh hand-rolled udon there.  Yoshi's broth was tasty, with a good amount of chicken, both chunky and shredded, complete with sliced roasted chicken skin (not crispy).  I wished the skin had even a hint of crispiness.  There were tempura sprinkled on top, but even those were not crispy at all...  Marukame spoiled me, I think.  Yoshi also added an egg in the broth, so it looked like egg drop soup with chunks of chicken, sliced of chicken skin, zucchini, nori, onion, and green onion.  My main concern was that the udon had a slimy texture.  Not at all like the texture of the fresh hand-rolled udon noodles at Marukame.  This made me think that the noodles here at Yoshi were pre-packaged.  I would order the broth to be served with ramen in the future, if that option is available.  Be careful to allow the bowl to cool off for about ten minutes, or you're going to burn your tongue (and in my case, my eyelid, as the hot and slimy noodle whipped across my face as I tried to prevent the noodle from burning my lips- ouch!).  Mom was already eating, and I was hungry, so I couldn't wait.  Silly me- I ended up with a tender, burnt tongue, but thankfully my eye was only slightly puffy.  Mom enjoyed her sushi bento, priced at $12 ($11.95 to be exact).  She missed the miso soup and salad that usually accompany bento boxes elsewhere.     $23 for lunch that should've included miso soup, a salad, and non-slimy udon... We'll try elsewhere next time.  p.s.  The ramen here is just OK.  I enjoyed the spicy pork more than the tofu miso soup, although both tasted good.  The latter needed more pork in it, while I had issues with the miso.  I had ordered it without mushrooms (and was told that corn was not a standard ingredient in it), but allowed the carrots and whatever else it came with.  My order arrived with mushrooms, which I discovered after they floated to the top after having many spoonfuls of broth already, so I returned it and asked for a new one sans mushroom, but the second one arrived with corn in it!  The carrots were also omitted, even though I didn't ask for the omission-- I think due to the cook/owner spying the carrots I had fished out and left on the table next to the first bowl.  Needless to say, I was not happy with the second bowl, but after having some tofu and soup and then seeing the corn rise up from the bottom, I decided I'd had enough of soup for lunch.  I'll need to be more specific about the omissions and to inspect the bowl for ingredients before eating next time."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.  Stopped by with a Groupon.  The owner seemed disappointed about that --  I don't understand why some merchants act like this.  No one holds a gun to these peoples' heads and demands that they run a Groupon.  The primary reason merchants run deals like Groupon and Living Social, is not for retention of existing customers, it's for new customer acquisition. So acting bummed when a new customer presents a deal coupon, really defeats the purpose. I walked in and told you I had a Groupon and you give me a \"really?\" face.  Not off to an exciting start already.  A \"sake bomber\" was included in the Groupon offer but, unlike most other Japanese places that feature bombers in their deals, you cannot choose the beer.  All you get is Bud Light -- seriously.  Way to put your best foot forward.  The menu is rather limited.  Although I appreciate their generous use of avocado, much of the menu seems to be made up of the same ingredients, combined in different ways - imitation crab, an overly-mayonnaised aioli sauce, something fried with too much soggy breading, and cream cheese.  Speaking of crab, if you are going to use imitation crab, then spell it \"krab\" on the menu, like other places do. I think it is misleading/mislabeling to do otherwise. If you use the word \"krab\" it is crystal clear to the customer, and we don't have to ask and then be disappointed to learn that the crab is actually fish.    Overall, an uninspiring experience."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Teriyaki Bento and it was pretty good- I liked the tempura. The man at the store was incredibly chatty and sweet--couldn't understand him well but he was just a very happy man. I wish the bento came with some rolls, but it was still pretty nommy."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! The Philadelphia roll is so good!! The service was excellent!! They gave us our food in like 2-4 minutes!!!"}
{"text":"Gonna give 3 stars based on both food and service..  The Food: My girlfriend ordered a rainbow roll.  Alone, I give it 5 stars.  It was delicious.  I had ordered a side of edemame with it because i love the stuff.   I dont know what they were thinking , but the stuff was cold.. Luckily it had a ton of salt or I wouldn't have touched it.  Did I finish it? God, no.  The service.. We walked up and instantly knew what we wanted.  It seemed like the poor guy behind the register was using a computer for the first time.  I couldn't help feel  bad and being a nice guy, I didn't complain.  However what really annoyed me was this woman behind he yelling \"excuse me.. have you guys even ordered yet??\"  I looked back with this \"are you kidding me\" face    \" yes we have.. we're waiting on the register\"   \"oh.. \" she pipes up.  So he finally gets our order paid for.  He tells us to wait and our food wil be brought out to us.  Cool.  I get the drink, napkins, and utensils and go outside.  Ten minutes later, I'm wondering where our food is.  Oh guess.. it's sitting on the counter near a sign that says \"pick up food here.\"  Guess he forgot to tell us that.  I get the food and notice that there are two orders of edemame.  \"I just ordered one maam\"   She says \"Ohh, well it shows two\"   As much as a fan I am of the stuff, I only needed one.  They kindly gave me a dollar back and I took my food to sit down.  The End."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall, literally, with delicious ramen, sushi, fried rice and much more.   The food is very fresh. Including all of the meats. And fish.   Just be warned: if you order the spicy pork or spicy chicken Ramen, it's as hot as hell."}
{"text":"Its a shame that there food looks good and Smells good but OMG they take forever!!! Apparently they have one server and the cooking takes ages so come with time. Ramen  its not bad but not the best either, it is served on half the bowl they give you."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  While on business trip to Phoenix, my husband and I ate at Yoshi's Bento twice.  The first time was for lunch and the second time was a to-go order on our trip back to Los Angeles.  Mr. Yoshi (I didn't get his name) who apparently seemed to be the owner was super nice and friendly. When he learned that I was on my 6 hour drive back to LA, he packed my order of Rainbow Row, Eel Dragon Roll, California Roll and Spicy Roll in an ice pack. My husband at first thought it was an overkill, but we realized the wisdom of Mr. Yoshi as we consumed our delicious rolls in the car.   The rolls were huge, delicious, and just what we wanted. The next time we are back in Phoenix, we know where we will be dining!"}
{"text":"I eat here whenever I am in the area, and it's always a pleasure!  Fresh food, friendly service, and good prices.  It's not a traditional sushi bar, but a great place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi and horrible service.  I went at 11 AM and was welcomed by someone who immediately prompted me for my order - no hello, no have you been here before. Behind him, was the \"chef\" who was busy prepping chicken breasts that were stored in a gigantic plastic tub. Going against my survival instincts, I ordered the sushi bento box.   After only about 2 minutes the chef plopped my order at my table and didn't utter a word.   Needless to say, I was disappointed. The sushi roll was covered in enough spicy mayo for five orders and the veggie tempura was mushy.    You couldn't pay me to eat the food again or cope with the extremely poor service."}
{"text":"Sorta difficult to find when using google maps... If you get lost, just keep driving around the parking lot, you are bound to find it :)  The restaurant is quaint and homely.  I got the Champong (Korean style seafood noodles) and hubs got the spicy pork ramen. They were both equally good but I think his pork ramen had deeper richer flavorful broth. I sorta felt like my noodles were too hard and uncooked a bit. No biggie.  When the owner found out I was Korean, he brought out some kimchi he made himself. It was DELIGHTFUL.  I will definitely go back to try some other dishes too."}
{"text":"Owner was very friendly and told us about his sake choices while we waited for our sushi to be made.  Ordered the Dragon maki roll. Yummy.  Will check this place out again."}
{"text":"This has been pretty much a weekly lunch destination for me and my coworkers.  A couple of our favorites:  Crunchy tofu extra crunchy Spicy pork spring mix bowl  Spicy pork ramen  Sushi Salad Bowl  The owner does seasonal ramens and dishes,  I recommend trying them.. we have not been disappointed yet.  Great place to go for Japanese/Korean food. The flavors are very consistent."}
{"text":"Looking for a decent Sushi spot and came across YB from Yelp. Good reviews and my family had a sushi craving. So here we are and I was pretty excited to try YB.   Walked in and I was a little confused if this was fast food or a sit down place. Anyways, the owner greeted us and he he seated us. Very friendly owner.   I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento which had a small salad, rice with a very generous portion of white meat chicken teriyaki and five pieces of tempura including shrimp tempura. Chicken was moist and tasty, loved the little cabbage salad and the tempura was ok. Very different tempura. The batter used reminded me of the batter that's used for fish and chips. The tempura was a little greasy but I enjoyed it. My wife ordered the chicken Yakisoba. It was pretty spicy and my wife usually doesn't like spicy but was able to eat most of it. I tried it and it was really good. Nice kick to it.   Of course we had to try the sushi. So we had the caterpillar and rainbow. Very fresh and good. Only problem is that the sushi rolls weren't cut very good so it was crumbling while we were trying to eat it. Presentation was really good. Taste good. As long as it's good I don't mind it crumbling cause once it goes down the chute it's yum yum.   Interesting that YB looks like a fast food but yet it's not. We ordered at the table and were served. The owner even served us our water even through its self-serve.   Overall, the food was very fresh and prices reasonable. Enjoy and have fun."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good soup. Sushi was okay.   I stopped by this restaurant today and was greeted warmly by the chef/cook. I think their A/C may have been broken as it was hot, considering this is the middle of the Arizona summer you can imagine how uncomfortable it was. The friendly chef/owner helped me select a meal, sushi bento box, and some dumpling soup. He laughed and told me I'd over ordered but he'd bring me some to-go cartons.   It arrived shortly. I liked the tempura, loved the sushimi, but did not care for sushi roll as there was some orange mayo sauce that just didn't agree with me. The soup was delicious and I devoured it with gusto. I received excellent customer service as the owner smiling packed up the rest of my food.   Overall I can't complain other than the lack of A/C there was nothing lacking quality wise with my lunch. If you know what you like in and on your sushi you shouldn't have any problems."}
{"text":"We're were looking for a quick bite of dinner, before a movie. We decided to try Yoshi Bento.  We've passed it may time, and not sure why it took us so long to try.  We were please how fast we were greeted and the menu explained. Told them we had a movie to catch. They said it shouldn't be s problem. And it wasn't.  I got the Scottsdale roll and was very pleased. Spicy, and fresh. I added a little extra wasabi.  My boyfriend had a chicken teriyaki bowl. They made his extra spicy and he was very pleased.   A quick easy meal  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The rice bowls are pretty good - even though it's a Japanese restaurant, the sushi is not good - the rolls fall apart.  This place is adequate if you're in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Great place! My co-worker and I love trying out new spots and often use our lunch hour to do just that. She had asked me what I was in the mood for and I said, \"something good!\" haha. Luckily, this place hit the nail on the head!  I had the Shrimp Killer Roll and a California Roll and they were both great! My tell tale sign of good sushi is if a place can make a GOOD California Roll because it's so simple... that they did! My friend had Ramen and enjoyed her meal as well.  I had never heard of Mochi Ice Cream before, we asked what it was and the gentleman pleasantly explained it to us, I wasn't exactly sure what he was describing, but we bit the bullet and ordered a strawberry to share. It was delish! Perfectly light dessert to compliment a light sushi meal.  The staff are nice. The place was clean. Plenty of parking. Outdoor seating on the patio as well as indoor seating (not sure why someone said this isn't a place at which to dine??). It's no Mastro's, but it's quaint and has charm. Overall, we had a positive experience and will definitely be back! I've added them to my top three for sushi ;)"}
{"text":"Owner awesome and very accommodating- food is amazing, obsessed with their teriyaki veggie bowl!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love eating at Yoshi Bento. It's a small hidden hole in the wall restaurant with amazing food. The spicy pork ramen and all of the sushi is absolutely outstanding. The owner is always so friendly and goes around to personally check on each guest. When you eat here you can tell that his heart and soul goes into each and every meal he makes. This is one of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Ramen broth was tasty and perfectly spicy. The pork was a little fatty, but tender. The veggies I requested be added seemed like they were frozen- I did enjoy the broccoli but the carrots weren't as crisp as I would have liked them.   A small little place, quite busy on a Sunday afternoon.   May give their bento boxes a try if they are open for lunch."}
{"text":"CURRY!!! Jay put a new curry noodle dish on the menu...no question, best curry in town!!! Flavor like no other!!! This restaurant is a hidden gem-dont miss it!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out via recommendation, and who doesn't like a good Bento?  The menu selection was pretty underwhelming, for a place with Bento in the name, you'd expect more than five options. The prices seemed reasonable.  The reason for the bad rating is that the food wasn't worth the wait. Staff did not acknowledge me for almost ten minutes, only to tell us to order at the front. We ordered two bento and a roll of sushi to go. Thirty-five minutes later and we're still waiting for food. The place also wasn't busy, so I'm not sure what happened.  Update: Both bento items were not served with accompany items. The sushi bento was given to me as simply a roll; nothing else. The Spicy Pork bento came out as a Spicy Pork bowl. The sushi roll was OK, but tasted too fishy for my tastes; a bit more salmon than I'd of expected in a special roll.  We left ASAP because of the long wait and I'm just going to write this off as someplace not to return to unless I'm promised the five star experience others have expressed."}
{"text":"I used the groupon deal for the Ramen and Sake bomb. The owner blatantly refused to honor the deal and I ended up paying full price. The food was ok. The customer service and cleanliness was pretty bad. The owner is rude. The place is filthy and hot (Air conditioning was not turned on."}
{"text":"The owner was nice.  Simple place, but decent sushi at a great price.  Nigiri portions were big too.  Fried rice was tasty and not too salty like some places.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had picked up a bento box at Yoshi Bento and had been hinting that we should try it. We ordered the Brown Rice Spicy Cali Roll as an appetizer. I was hesitant because it was described as topped with a spicy mayo... not a big mayo fan to begin with and picturing mayo on sushi sounded weird, but I took a chance on it. I'm so glad I did, because it was pretty awesome! The mayo (more like a spicy, creamy drizzled sauce) was a great combo with the usual soy/wasabi mix. Definitely will order it again.   For our dinner, we each ordered a bento box. I had the BBQ beef and bf got the teriyaki chicken. The portions were very generous. The box included a variety of items to try. My beef (I ordered it spicy) had awesome flavor and was served over rice. You also get an asian slaw on the side and tempura vegetables (squash and sweet potato) and a large tempura shrimp with a tasty dipping sauce.    Good food and a friendly staff means I'll be back! Thanks Yoshi Bento!"}
{"text":"Wonderful variety of well paired foods at a very reasonable price.  The staff is very friendly and willing to explain the individually created menu items.  Always enjoyable."}
{"text":"Got the chicken bento box and it was excellent and very good deal! Will be back. They also have Asahi and Kirin light my favorites!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Its all made fresh when you order, service was excellent,  food was great.   We had the crispy sweet avocado appetizer,  edamame, salmon spicy garlic roll and the Las Vegas roll....everything was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi that you should not miss. I had a quick bite of their las Vegas roll, and it's my best roll ever tasted! The rice is crispy and the fish is just tender, with juice coming out of the roll is just heaven like. I also had the spicy pork ramen, really hot and spicy! The pork is treated very well together with the boiled egg, it reminds you why ramen is the most comfort food."}
{"text":"I'm one for finding hidden gems.  If a restaurant inspires me to come back again and again just for one dish, then I know I've struck gold.  Here, it is the Korean dumpling soup.  Okay, so you can actually get a better bowl of soup.  But to do this, you have to go to the East or West Coast --- basically you have to be in a region where a lot of discerning Koreans live.  And, let's face it, there are about 12 Korean people in Phoenix.  Soooo...everything is relative.   This is certainly not to say that the Dumpling soup is not tasty.  If it wasn't, then obviously I would not have visited this place a dozen times just to order it.  So, you darn tootin' that this bowl of soup is worth the visit.  The broth is just the right balance of salt and peppery.  Excellent!  The dumplings are a bit chunky inside -- these are not of the same ilk as that which you would find regularly in Koreatown in LA.  But, we are not in LA.  We are at the corner of Scottsdale and the 101.    So, 4 stars for a restaurant that keeps me coming back for that one menu item.  Well done--"}
{"text":"The thing I love about Yoshi Bento is that they keep adding new menu items all the time. They have very good bento boxes and noodle dishes. I recently came across the new Korean spicy cold noodles and had to try it. They served it with the same chicken they use for their teriyaki dish. It was little dry which would have been bad in any other dish but with this dish, it added nice chewiness which balanced well with the sweet spicy sauce. I would definitely get this again."}
{"text":"Really should be 4 1/2 Stars!  Great Sushi! Decent prices and good size rolls. I got the Rainbow, Spicy Crunch and California (should have ordered the California Salad, didn't see the difference when I ordered)...I was hungry and hadn't had sushi in sooo long so I went a little overboard.  I highly recommend the Spicy Crunch.  The format is fast-casual which is my favorite for lunch time...order when you walk in and have a seat.  Place is CLEAN and the people are super friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When my fiancée and I moved into our north Scottsdale neighborhood a couple of years ago, we thought we'd discovered the Shangri-La of Japanese cuisine in the most unlikely of places -- the local Fry's supermarket, where the owners of Yoshi Bento used to make us sushi several times a week.  They often encouraged us to try new items, offering samples and enthusiastic recommendations, and they were never wrong. In some ways, they really helped me discover the complexity of sushi.  But then, suddenly, one day, they told us they would be leaving soon and not returning.  Initially, we were crushed -- but we were relieved to hear that they'd be opening a restaurant of their own, and thrilled when we saw that Yoshi Bento was going up in our neighborhood.  Those who have criticized Yoshi Bento's ambiance and/or lack of frills are not wrong. Yoshi Bento is hidden away in the back corner of an expansive shopping center, virtually out of public view.  The first time I walked in, I got the sense that the they had simply changed the signs on a dumpy, by-the-slice pizzeria, handed over the keys, and dropped a few rice cookers in.  Truth be told, not much has changed since then.  The food is served in styrofoam, and the sushi is packed with industrial ice pouches.  Let's be clear: if you're looking to enjoy a romantic dinner with breathtaking views, you will be sorely disappointed with Yoshi Bento.   But, on the other hand, if you want beautiful, mouthwateringly-delicious nigiri, tempura, and teriyaki cooked and served by experts who truly love what they do, Yoshi Bento should be your go-to place."}
{"text":"This place is very good. The service is good, fast, and the people are incredibly nice. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"absolute favorite place for japanese food! the crispy avocado is amazing as well as the chicken bento, lately i've been trying to branch out and try something new every time and it's always delicious, so you really can't go wrong with anything you order!! the owner is super super nice and he always remembers my family and i, which we love! we come here all the time and i definitely recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Really poor quality.   The California roll I got (pictured) was so large it was inedible. I've never had such a loosely rolled roll. So I asked for something different and got the mango roll. The mango in the role was frozen solid like ice. Just had a really bad experience with the quality of food."}
