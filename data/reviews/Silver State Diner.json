{"text":"Best diner in town great food and customer service. I recommend anyone to try it out ! the cook makes the food with love . really good place"}
{"text":"What a great little spot! Service is outstanding and food and prices are great! They serve breakfast all day. Place was very clean and quaint. Had a cheeseburger and fries. Burger was huge! It was really tasty as well. Great experience. Cant wait to go back for breakfast. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place to get a great burger, I just found my new favorite spot AMAZING staff !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome!  Everything is made when you order it by the owner.  Her mom is the waitress and they are so nice.  We had a turkey club (the biggest one we have ever had) and a delicious crispy chicken club.   You definately need to try this out!"}
{"text":"I feel so bad for the sweet lady that was our server.  I believe she is the mom of the guy (I refuse to say gentlemen) working in the kitchen.  2 coworkers and myself were here for lunch.  Lady took our order.  Soon after then cook started yelling profanities at the server lady.  I am not sure if she maybe messed up taking the order or what happened but he was in her face full of rage yelling at her.  I turned around to face them.  The guy calmed down and looked at me calmly.  He looked at me and I asked\"is everything ok\"?  He said yeah everything's fine and smiled.  He kept staring at me angrily after that.  I seen him a couple more times talking in a lower tone to the server but still very angry with her.  She looked so terrified of him it was disgusting!!!  I have never experienced this in a customer service environment.  The cook eventually walked out of restaurant for about 15 minutes.  When the server gave us our checks she was apologetic for the guy.  I told her she didn't need to apologise and that we were sorry for her.  I hardly ate anything because I was uncomfortable and untrusting that maybe the guy had done something to my food before he walked out.  Will never come back to this establishment.  Wish there was more I could have done for the lady."}
{"text":"Bomb cheap Burgers! Small quaint and Clean.
Milkshakes are made to order, portions are more than fair for the price. Will definitely be a local go to place."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great bargain! Their choices are not limited by what's on the menu, ask the chef and she'll tell you what she can whip up. The philly cheesesteak fries are prime example! Very customer service focused. A family owned small business worthy of patronage. Best onion rings Ive ever had! Don't sleep on the Silver State Diner!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now.  I have tried several different items and everything has been good.  The prices are very inexpensive, cheaper them most fast food joints and with better food.  Very friendly owners, I wish them all the best and hope they make it.

The person giving them a 1 star because of their limited hours and never even eating there is a ?#@&. Give them a chance and rate them on their food and service."}
{"text":"Solid food. Great prices!
 Chef Donna is a delight. 

The pancakes are so good!
I'll definitely be back.

Be aware, this is a tiny place and only seats  16 or so."}
{"text":"Good priced food, couldn't finish the pancakes I ordered, kids ordered the silver state omlette plates and both didn't finish either.. Service was great very friendly! Next time I'm in Vegas we're coming here."}
{"text":"Silver State Diner has good food and friendly service.  It's a small cosy place with limited seating, but our party of 4 was able to sit upon arrival.  We ordered burgers, onion rings, fried mushrooms and milkshakes.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  
The only downside is I felt bad for the employee.  One lady was running the show.  She was the hostess, waitress, cook and busboy.  Because she was so busy we had to wait a bit for our food.  I'd recommend Silver State Diner as long as you're willing to sit back and relax for a while."}
{"text":"My Dad says 3 stars, but I say 4. We stopped in and the person working was doing both the cooking and the waitressing. She was super friendly, helpful, and the food was good! My Dad wasn't a huge fan of the Philly but I loved their cheeseburger and fries. The chicken fingers were also AMAZING (my boys got them and I had to try a bite, of course). The prices are good and the food is good especially for the price. Worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"We had eaten here a couple of times when it was Kailyn's. We stopped by today for lunch to see what the new owners menu looked like. They are redoing their menu so I'm not sure what it will look like in a bit but I am so glad we stopped in. I had a Patty Melt and my friend had the Reuben. Both were excellent. So flavorful, not greasy, fries were good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"As others have said, Silver State Diner is small and nothing fancy.  But if you are looking for good food at a good price then this is a place you should check out.  They throw in great, friendly service for free!  We had burgers and fries and both were very good.  Table next to us was having breakfast and everything looked great."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in this place. My sister and I went for lunch about a month ago, and literally saw a baby cockroach crawl up the wall near our table. When there's a baby, there's a mama. And probably a whole family. We got up and left.  Super sketched out."}
{"text":"Good greasy burgers, fries and onion rings and $15 for the two of us.  Very friendly service.  Will try to go back for breakfast before we head home to Texas.  Thank you, Roxy, Donna & Tom!  Recommend."}
{"text":"Where do I start ...soon as you walk through the door u feel at home sitting at the counter watching your aunt or mom cook up dinner. Both the ladies that work there are hilarious and too sweet. This place is a gem. I had the BBQ cheeseburger fire!! My husband had chicken/steak Philly cheesesteak I wanted his food too! So delicious! Every time we come to Vegas I'm coming here a must atleast one day I'm here! The place is in the cut as well so drive slow lol!!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of scads of places in rural Wisconsin.  Personalized service...friendly like.  Burger 1/3 lb full on dressed w seasoned fries, crisp NO grease.   Philly w mushrooms also good.  Like visiting family...enjoy!"}
{"text":"The burgers here were perfect! Well seasoned and great proportions. The fries were perfectly crisp and Donna even made a fresh pot of coffee for me. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place because of the reviews and it was better than I even expected. A legit diner, in Vegas. Complete with the smell and all. I expect to be eating here a ton because it reminds me of home"}
{"text":"I never review places, but this little diner is phenomenal. Best onion rings I've ever had, hands down! And the women who run the place are awesome and super friendly. It feels like you're just eating at home. The prices are also very reasonable, biscuits and gravy for $3, and a burger and fries for $6. Also their philly cheese steak fries are fantastic. This place is the definition of a hole in the wall, and they set the bar very high!"}
{"text":"Best in town! I come here all the time and I'll never get tired of it. The service is exceptional, they will treat you like family and make you feel at home. They have the BEST burgers in town. This place is amazing and if you want great service and great food come here."}
{"text":"Sure was disappointed with the previous diner at this location closed until one day driving by the marquee lit up with the diner's name. Turns out the place is entirely new -- new name, new owners, new chef, new server--and they were in the process of starting the business. Since we were hungry, my friend and I decided to give their burgers a try, figuring as usual that if they make a good burger, the rest of the food would be good. WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED. The burger was tasty, hot, served on a big bun and done to order.  The next week, just to be sure, we stopped in and ordered a pulled poker sandwich. The result is: We'll be regulars there, for sure. 
If the two friendly chicks running the joint can overcome the location, they'll have people standing in line for their food."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked French toast burger good and two very nice ladies serving/ cooking and great prices what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"Love this place! VERY friendly staff, good food, big portions at a low price. Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"It's true what they say about the Philly cheesesteak it was huge and it was very good"}
{"text":"This was a great dinner with the kids. Here on vacation and got out of there under $20."}
{"text":"Classic diner food. Love my burgers simple and love the crispness of the frys. Short stack was huge."}
{"text":"I went to this place two days ago and I looked up the reviews and it said it was good. But in reality the food was nasty. I order the chicken wing special the only thing that was good were the fries. The chick was soggy and not done to my liking. I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Still delicious... Was able to taste Philippine Friday special Lumpis and Pancit.... Mouth watering, call ahead to make sure it's a Philippine Friday!"}
{"text":"What a nice little gem!  Fresh food, made to order and presented by 2 lovely women. Large portions at fair prices.  Yelp didn't let me down!"}
{"text":"Talk about a HOLE IN THE WALL gem!!!!

Small place but homemade food. There was only one lady working and doing everything. Bless her heart. It's a nice little dive. Good food with a small town feel. Friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"Went back today and even though I said I wanted to try the wings, I had to get the pancakes!  

My pancakes were just as good as the 1st time!

We also had great customer service again."}
{"text":"Small quite great food had the chicken wings and fries both done perfectly. Only
One older lady working who was awesome she left to deliver to a man who owned a nearby business and told my father and I to keep an eye on her business  100% will be back!"}
{"text":"Cozy, clean and beautiful. Real homey feel and spotless rest room. Great service! I ordered a burger with swiss, everything on it and fries and let me say this: It's the best burger I've had in decades. Seriously, no lie. There was not one bit of gristle in that burger! From the very first bite to, sadly, the last, it was delicious. The bun was slightly toasted, just the way I like it and the homemade fries were so, so good. None of it was greasy and everything was fresh. I will definitely be going back for more of their delicious fare. Afterwards, I did not feel bloated as if I ate something heavy. What a meal. You can't go wrong at this diner. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"I'll admit it takes a lot for me to take the time out of my day and review a place I've eaten at, but my god this place deserves it. Walked pass it not expecting to eat here but the neon poster boards caught my attention. The food was amazing hot and fresh, very small so the owner and her family are everywhere always asking of you need anything. Prices are amazing got a great burger for $7 that's hard to find in Vegas. If you're in the area I highly recommend this little gem"}
{"text":"brand new diner in a strip mall. I wandered by heading for Taco Y Taco when I saw their sale of the day sign. A bacon burger and fries sounded good and the price $6.99 was great too. As I said a brand new place just opened so they are in the throes of building a new business. The food, friendly atmosphere and service was great. Great burger, fresh crisp romaine lettuce, tomato and bacon. Check it out and say hello."}
{"text":"This little gem of a place is hidden in a strip mall, as many of these places are.  Directed here by Yelp reviews, my family and I trudged in to get food before my graduation.  

One lady was running the place.  It's a small place. There are five tables or so, and they're chrome, shiny, and bright.  The owner / operator runs the place, cooks the food, chats with customers, and keeps the place running very well.  

I ordered the Gyro.  It came with fries.   I was so hungry and feeling rushed (not due to her, but due to having to get to my ceremony), that I ate my Gyro very quickly. It was warm, fresh, and tasty. The fries were delicious.  Because we had heard so much about them, we also ordered some onion rings.  She said that her son used to make them, but he's not working there any more, so she wasn't sure if they were as good as they had been.  To us, travelers who were hungry, in a bit of a hurry, and having had several other meals in the area, they were absolutely delicious.   

Definitely give this place a shot. If you like diner fare and a friendly proprietor, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Tasty Philly cheese Sammy. Very small mom and pop feel. Food is cooked in front of you waffle house style. Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Came here around noon. Really great food, good price. One lady is working the whole place by herself. She serves, makes the food. Very comfortable, shes very sweet. Will come back if whenever i am in Las Vegas again! The breakfast Sandwich was super delicious !!!"}
{"text":"First time having lunch here had the patty melt sandwich. Had to be one of the best melts I've had, cheese was nicely melted patty perfectly grilled rye bread was fresh and toasted. Overall the restaurant was clean menu prices are outstanding service was excellent. I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome little place, great food great people.
Great atmosphere.  Check it out. Limited hours, don't drive to fast you'll pass it."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food at great prices. Clean and inviting. Awesome atmosphere. Will be returning."}
