{"text":"I walked by here many times and based on how it looks outside, would not have thought to go in but ended up going in late one night with friends. Since then I've gone in many time, mostly for take out. 

The food is fast, cheap and freaking delicious!! And they even bring me tea while I wait for my take-out although the food comes so fast I hardly get to drink any!"}
{"text":"My lady and I went to Vietnam a while back, and upon returning to Calgary, soon found that we were both longing for the food that we had so enjoyed during our time there.  Surely, we thought, we wouldn't find a Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary serving up the same calibre of sumptuous dishes as we found overseas.  So my lady did a little investigating, and low and behold, it turned out that there was such a place, and lucky for us, it was located just around the corner.  That place is the Saigon Palace, and they do Vietnamese cuisine the way it ought to be.  This unassuming restaurant located in a strip mall on Richmond Road serves up delicious, authentic Vietnamese cuisine.  It's served up hot and fast, and is sure to delight even the most jaded palate.  The charbroiled pork and spring rolls on rice vermicelli is a massive feed for the paltry price of $9.25.  The meat is lean and flavourful, and the spring rolls are crispy and delicious - some of the best I've ever had.  Wash that down with a Tiger beer, and you'll swear you've been transported to Vietnam."}
{"text":"Tasty rice dishes

Haven't been there in a minute just hope they didn't change the quality of the food

Longevity of this restaurant speaks for itself"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourites in Chinatown - was saddened when I walked by a few weeks ago and found it was closed. Did they go out business? Or did they just move? I don't know!"}
{"text":"With a city filled with plenty of options in Vietnamese cuisine's ,Saigon Palace offers a authentic experience in dining pleasure.Vermicelli with shrimp,in a delightfull fish sauce broth,carried with a mixture of scallions,diced peanuts,and a variety of sprouts and veggie,and accompanied with crisp spring rolls,is so flavorfull that we dont think twice about crossing the border to satisfy are craving! The array of options on the menu offer some thing for even the most discriminating taste."}
{"text":"This is my seventh time and the pho is not bad. I give it a 3.5  The first time I ordered a rare beef pho the broth was warm -- alarming because the beef is suppose to cook in the broth. I guess blue is the new rare? 

After this episode, I came back to find my favourite: Large #25 (The House Special).  Yes indeed, all the fixings are represented: tripe, beef balls, flank, and other parts of a cow, and in mass quantities too! (including excessive amounts of rice noodle).  So, for the price, you get more (calories) in a bowl.  But, the only problem with too much stuffing is that it takes away from the broth--it's a soup right?  As a result, too many rice noodles absorb all the broth--like a superabsorbant polymer dinosaur toy---growing 3 times its size (okay, a bit of an exaggeration)

The engorged and swollen noodles feel dense, and breaks apart, losing  its texture and flavour.  So a tip when ordering a large #25, have some noodles placed on the side and ask for \"extra hot broth\".  

The broth is flavourful (maybe even more flavourful than Pho Pasteur's broth), but is sometimes served a bit warm (maybe due to the amount noodles)  If Saigon Palace can get a bowl of pho that is super-hot and balanced then this is a hands down 4.5 star.  

Side note: I love coming to a restaurant where I'm greeted with a welcoming and warm smile.  The \"grandma\" at Saigon always gives me a smile and wave when I come in. it reminds me when I was young and would go over to my grandma's to get spoiled with congee-love ;) priceless!"}
{"text":"Too bad this place closed - Can't argue with the Pho - good quality, solid cuts of meat, never shortchanged on the value, always fresh and well presented with the side garnishments. Had a certain vibe about the place - with the owner standing at the cash register, and the kitchen with the noisy ladies in the rear. Had to try those superhot vietnamese chilis presented on the side!   Will miss visiting here on cold or rainy winter days for some nourishing broth!"}
{"text":"I had pho and spring rolls. The broth was fine, nothing noteworthy. Noodles were a big disappointment. I came here because other reviews raved about fresh noodles but whether fresh or dried you can't serve them overcooked! Mine were limp and mushy. The rare beef was not noticeably rare when served, as it should be. The brisket beef was very good though. Finally, the spring rolls were terrible. The filling lacked meat, fell apart and was flavourless. It is easy to find good Vietnamese spring rolls so why do they mess these up? Toronto downtown doesn't compare to North York pho shops -- too bad."}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur has competition in Chinatown for title of \"Best Pho-cking Pho\"!

Saigon Palace is a complete dive.  It is dirty (don't even venture into the bathrooms...you've been warned), unapologetically Vietnamese, and dirt cheap.  It's everything I've ever wanted in a pho joint.

The goods on the pho:
- Fresh noodles (brap brap!)
- Broth is clear, yet flavorful.  Not as potent as a Vietnam Noodle Star, but not as bland as a Rua Vang.
- Portion size is perfect with an excellent broth:noodle:meat ratio
- Probably the best tendon in town!  Melty goodness.
- $6 will do you good

Overall, I have to give this place 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5).  I rounded up because it received my prestigious \"White People Don't Eat Here\" seal of approval!"}
{"text":"Reasonable Vietnamese option downtown. Cleanliness is okay here but most non-Asians would find it disturbing. But I come here because the noodles are among the freshest in town. Spring rolls are overgreasy. 

Worth a try if you have a craving. Ask for fresh noodles."}
{"text":"Loved this place, went there since the early 80s. 

Great food, cheap and fast service.  

What was really amazing was the back room, which wasn't open too often. It was a Chinese  restaurant from the 1930s and hadn't been renovated, or modernized. If that was destroyed when Saigon Palace closed, that would be criminal."}
{"text":"It's a little hole in the wall Vietnamese place, the decor is outdated but you'll hardly care because the food is good and the staff are delightful Can't recall how we found this little place but it's been a few years now and my entire family still love it. 

They really get to know their regulars too. If I go in without my sister, 9/10 the guy at the front asks where she is and how she's doing. It's the thoughtfulness that they put into the details like remembering my mom can't have the spicy fish sauce. Little things. It's a very home-y place to get some pretty good food. 

Parking in front of the restaurant can get full quickly as there's a limited number of stalls and it's right next to a pub, but there's always parking allocated to the general use of the strip mall."}
{"text":"Until my first visit to Saigon Palace Restaurant, I've always thought of Vietnamese food as Pho - but Saigon has showed me differently! 

When I went into the restaurant, it seemed like a pretty typical China Town  place (and the decor, tables, and service really are comparable to others). It is a typical \"write down your order\" kind of place, with decent (not fabulous) service. 

Immediately our table got a pot of tea, which was really quite good - I've never had tea from a Vietnamese place before, but the food... the food is amazing!

On my first visit, I had #22 - the Chicken Curry Soup, and it was delicious. The chicken falls right off the bone, and it is creamy and really flavorful (and not too spicy, which was perfect for me!) the soup is full of noodles and chicken (2 thighs) so it is a full meal. I've been back since, and have had #50, which is BBQ Pork, Sweet & Sour Pork and Spring Roll on Vermicelli. This was also really good - the meats are tasty (the variety is nice), and the spring roll is very crispy - one of the best I've had! I've also tried the #105 appetizer, Shrimp Rolls, which are worth trying, but not as great as the entrees. 

This is a great place to stop by for a quick/cheap lunch or dinner. The food comes out really quickly, and is very filling. The decor may leave a bit to be desired, but don't let the outer appearance fool you - it really is a gem!"}
{"text":"Kat and I would frequently come here when looking for a quick meal after some Westhills shopping action. Our most recent visit was marred by pretty sloppy service, but of course I can never fault the food - I have never had a bad meal here, and in our experience the service is usually on par. They offer a combo appetizer we usually get: two each of the spring and shrimp salad rolls, as well as a shrimp skewer. Good start to meal. The bun is always generous and flavorful. Altogether, I would still recommend this place for a quick bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I miss the Saigon Palace. It was both my introduction to Vietnamese food, and the best that I ever had. But alas, it has been gone for over a year now, so I thought someone should indicate that here..."}
