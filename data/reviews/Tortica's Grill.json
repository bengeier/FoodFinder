{"text":"Edit: I tried calling them again, and now it goes straight to voicemail. They've blocked a customer's number! LOL and for a simple question about a mix up in order. Wow. Never order here. Worst service ever.

I've eaten at Tortica's more often than I would like to admit, so, this isn't my first time ordering from them. And usually I never have any complaints on them. Last night, I ordered a Milaneza Torta, they didn't have it, which was totally fine! They called me and I ordered a steak quesadilla instead. around 1 hour later, I finally got my food. Again, I've ordered here many times so I was expecting around an hour for them to deliver. 

When I opened up the container, it was a cheese quesadilla. So they got the wrong order, I'm fine with it, again, 'cause I'm easy going. No problem, I will just call them and get my right order in. Multiple calls over the course of an hour. Nothing. No answer at all. I checked the time and I know they are still open. I thought maybe they were too busy to pick up calls, even though it was only 12:30am. So! I thought, hey I will just call tomorrow about the mix up and maybe get a refund or exchange. 

Next day I called and they finally picked up. A lady answered, as I was explaining my situation, suddenly she went \"I can't hear you, sorry, bye, sorry\" and then hung up on me. I was like what the fu... maybe bad connection. I am wayy more forgiving than I should be. I tried calling back after that and from then on, no more answers. They either keep ringing to voice mail, or cuts short and goes to voice mail. So I think it's obvious they are avoiding my calls. 

Learning from this I will just pretend I lost $10 to the wind. Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Great food for a dive type place. Ordered take out for my boyfriend and I. The tostadas and tacos were great. Our side order of rice was very large and delicious. They also gave us chips and salsa for our take out order. Very inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I would love to review the food, but THIRTY minutes after placing my delivery order online, I received a phone call from them saying they don't deliver to my neighborhood. I offered to pay a TEN dollar tip on my twenty dollar order, to no avail. Regardless of whether this was a website or restaurant error, it should have been handled better. Bad service."}
{"text":"The Good:
Great food at a great price. I went there today for the first time with 3 co-workers and we all were very satisfied with our meals. The chips were great and had there own special seasoning on them acompanied by their delisous salsa. I had the Chicken fajita Quasidila and i have to say it was great. Much better than El Toros, which is a local chain mexican resturant here in town. In addition, our waiter was very nice and the service was fast.

The Bad:
First - let me just say I have nothing bad to say about there food. However, the resturant itself needs improvement. The place looks a bit run down and needs some TLC. I can see how some people get discuraged from eating at a place like that but hey the food is yummy."}
{"text":"It is definitely a good place to go if you are hungover. The food is cheap but it still tastes really good. The people working are always very nice and love when you try and speak Spanish. 

It isn't the cleanest place but as a place I go to basically still drunk from the night before, it works for a quick meal"}
{"text":"This place has never let us down. Generous portions, reasonable prices and delicious food. They have never had any discrepancies with any of my orders. They deliver fast,( my taco salad shell was still crispy!) they are courteous and polite and I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is!Its not fancy but doesn't need to be."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why i haven't heard about this campustown gem earlier, but i am VERY happy i know about it now.  First off,i LOVE their salsa more than anywhere else in town, but it must be mixed with the hot (red, not green) and regular salsa in a bowl, their fresh, hot chips go perfectly.  SO GOOD.

i've had the Pollo Quesadilla twice and love the flavor, especially of the Cheese sauce.

Overall, this place is excellent, good service, has a big menu and best of all, its Cheap!

Go here soon!!"}
{"text":"More authentic than Chipotle for sure but thats not always a good thing. Pretty greasy overall and nothing seems to really stand out. Priced well. Service is hit or miss. Not bad drunk food."}
{"text":"Standard Mexican fare in a grimey Campustown shitbox.

Friendly staff. Good chips. Good salsa. Good prices."}
{"text":"If I die young, bury me in queso.

Queso from Burrito King (or Torticas, or the Burrito King truck...) will easily be the most delicious queso you have ever had in your entire life. The queso dreams are made of. The queso that makes the world go round. The queso that Burrito King smothers on everything...

I love this place. Fantastic staff, good chips and salsa, big portion sizes, veggie options. And did I mention the queso? Whether it's 2 pm or 2 am, this is the place to be. And if it happens to be sometime in between 2 and 2, they have a bunch of different flavors of margaritas, but they are a little pricey. 

Tip for the wise (or drunk, or reaaaaally hungry): if it's one of those nights that everybody has the same great idea as you and the restaurant is packed, order your food to-go! They'll even let you snack on chips while you wait - the best.

Another thing to note: The Burrito King truck only accepts cash. Don't get mad, don't cry about it, the restaurant is literally a block away. Seriously, don't cry about. Seriously.

Five stars 'cause I'm in love."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. As much as you can.
The chips were stale, and the salsa was bland. Although the portions were decent compared to the price, the quality of the food was poor. I ordered the mushroom quesadilla, and it was SWIMMING in oil. I was literally draining my plate every 2-3 bites to get all the excess oil off. There was also WAY too much cheese in the food. If you love mexican cheese, you might like this, but it was too greasy and too bland. My friend ordered the burrito with steak in it, and the steak was over-cooked.

Next time you want a mexican fix, go to El Toro or Maize. Those dishes will hook.you.up."}
{"text":"Did not care for this place. in their defense, only tried the guacapeno guacamole but it was kind of runny and half of the container was jalape√±o peppers- I thought they would be sliced up in it but still good nacho style. if I wanted guac again I would go to maize. comparable prices but much better taste"}
